Freud and the Healing Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society.

02:01.420 --> 02:10.180
This meeting which has to do with this content in the society at the moment was proposed

02:10.180 --> 02:19.220
to us by the Commutee Freud and Emil Mallet and Maria and we are very happy for being

02:19.220 --> 02:23.060
able to organize it under our auspices.

02:23.060 --> 02:28.100
I will ask the president of the New York Psychoanalytic to say a few words.

02:28.100 --> 02:35.580
Dr. Eunbachinga.

07:13.020 --> 07:26.020
and the American Psychoanalytic Association.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.020
Thank you, Ed.

07:27.020 --> 07:32.020
I'd like to thank the Helix Center in New York Psychoanalytic

07:32.020 --> 07:37.020
for hosting, obviously a very timely Congress.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.020
Maria asked me last spring,

07:40.020 --> 07:44.020
when we were in Stockholm, if I might join you,

07:44.020 --> 07:48.020
and I'll be able to be here for part of the day,

07:48.020 --> 07:53.020
but as I have thought about what this Congress,

07:53.020 --> 07:55.020
this committee will be addressing,

07:55.020 --> 07:58.020
two things came to my mind.

07:58.020 --> 08:02.020
And it began last Wednesday evening,

08:02.020 --> 08:05.020
Wednesday afternoon, in between patients.

08:05.020 --> 08:08.020
I kept getting alerts on my phone

08:08.020 --> 08:11.020
that there had been a shooting in San Bernardino,

08:11.020 --> 08:16.020
in California, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.

08:16.020 --> 08:22.020
I paid attention, but then went back to my patients,

08:22.020 --> 08:26.020
and then that evening was meeting my wife for dinner.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.020
We went through the whole dinner,

08:28.020 --> 08:33.020
and I completely forgot about the shootings.

08:33.020 --> 08:37.020
And I wanted to just say something about

08:37.020 --> 08:39.020
that kind of forgetting.

08:39.020 --> 08:43.020
Number one, I'm kind of numb,

08:43.020 --> 08:46.020
as I think many people are in this country,

08:46.020 --> 08:49.020
in terms of the frequency of these mass shootings,

08:49.020 --> 08:53.020
whether they be political or just the individual rampage

08:53.020 --> 08:59.020
of somebody compelled to kill him or herself and others.

08:59.020 --> 09:02.020
But that numbness has set in, for me,

09:02.020 --> 09:04.020
over the last couple years.

09:04.020 --> 09:08.020
The other hesitation, I think, that led to my forgetting,

09:08.020 --> 09:13.020
to speak about this, is that when my wife was six years old,

09:13.020 --> 09:16.020
and though the memories are a bit cloudy,

09:16.020 --> 09:21.020
she was in her first grade class in the north shore of Chicago

09:21.020 --> 09:24.020
and sitting at her desk,

09:24.020 --> 09:29.020
and there were, she heard popping noises from outside the classroom.

09:29.020 --> 09:33.020
The next thing she remembers is huddling under her teacher's desk

09:33.020 --> 09:39.020
and the teacher telling her and her fellow students to be very quiet.

09:39.020 --> 09:43.020
And there was more commotion, more popping in the hallway

09:43.020 --> 09:46.020
outside the classroom, and then silence.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.020
And what had happened was a 30-year-old,

09:49.020 --> 09:52.020
very troubled, very disturbed woman,

09:52.020 --> 09:55.020
had gone into this elementary school

09:55.020 --> 09:57.020
and began shooting children and teachers,

09:57.020 --> 10:01.020
left the school and went and shot down the street

10:01.020 --> 10:04.020
and saw some house in the neighborhood.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.020
This was somebody who had been under psychiatric care,

10:07.020 --> 10:10.020
obviously not successful.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.020
And so every time there is a shooting,

10:14.020 --> 10:17.020
my wife relives that trauma.

10:17.020 --> 10:21.020
And in that sense, it's close to me and to our family.

10:21.020 --> 10:29.020
Our job, it seems to me, whether these kinds of violence

10:29.020 --> 10:35.020
is individual, of an individual who's gone mad,

10:35.020 --> 10:41.020
or a group that on the basis of an ideology imagines

10:41.020 --> 10:46.020
that they have to kill in order to get that ideology across,

10:46.020 --> 10:49.020
that is something that's psychoanalysts,

10:49.020 --> 10:54.020
that this group and whether in Europe or in the US

10:54.020 --> 10:58.020
and throughout the world, now we have something to offer.

10:58.020 --> 11:02.020
I was telling someone last night at Ed's cocktail party

11:02.020 --> 11:05.020
that I spent a day and a half in Washington, D.C.,

11:05.020 --> 11:08.020
in September with our lobbyists,

11:08.020 --> 11:12.020
and visiting staff of congressional leaders

11:12.020 --> 11:15.020
to talk about are there ways that we can prevent

11:15.020 --> 11:17.020
these kinds of mass shootings.

11:17.020 --> 11:23.020
I live in a country that continues to be obsessed with guns

11:23.020 --> 11:25.020
and cannot let go of guns.

11:25.020 --> 11:30.020
If you read the statistics about the numbers of people killed

11:30.020 --> 11:34.020
in our country with guns compared to anywhere else in the world,

11:34.020 --> 11:36.020
it's shameful.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.020
So we can talk with congressional leaders about that.

11:39.020 --> 11:44.020
But what they're also very interested in is they're interested

11:44.020 --> 11:47.020
in what we offer in everyday language,

11:47.020 --> 11:51.020
a psychoanalytic perspective about what compels an individual

11:51.020 --> 11:52.020
to do this.

11:52.020 --> 11:57.020
And these kinds of meetings are critical and essential

11:57.020 --> 12:00.020
and call us to leave our offices,

12:00.020 --> 12:05.020
to stand up from behind the couch and go out into our communities,

12:05.020 --> 12:09.020
our larger communities, like you all have come here today

12:09.020 --> 12:13.020
and say something about it because the public is desperate for answers.

12:13.020 --> 12:20.020
Because if not, that hopelessness, that helplessness that sets in,

12:20.020 --> 12:25.020
that I experience every time I get that CNN alert on my phone

12:25.020 --> 12:29.020
that there's been yet another shooting, that numbness sets in,

12:29.020 --> 12:31.020
and we have to interfere with that.

12:31.020 --> 12:36.020
We know something about the impact of hopelessness

12:36.020 --> 12:39.020
and helplessness that creates that kind of numbness

12:39.020 --> 12:44.020
and through our educating the public and offering what we have,

12:44.020 --> 12:47.020
what we've known about the human experience,

12:47.020 --> 12:50.020
but also what we can learn from our communities,

12:50.020 --> 12:53.020
what we can learn from these acts of violence.

12:53.020 --> 12:56.020
We have something to learn as psychoanalysts as well.

12:56.020 --> 12:58.020
That's a very important piece of it.

12:58.020 --> 13:02.020
But I think if we do that, we can have an impact.

13:02.020 --> 13:06.020
And even if it just is to save some lives.

13:06.020 --> 13:09.020
On my signature, on my email, I say,

13:09.020 --> 13:15.020
psychoanalysis, now more than ever, psychoanalysis, now more than ever.

13:15.020 --> 13:18.020
Thank you, and thank you for inviting me.

13:18.020 --> 13:23.020
APPLAUSE

13:23.020 --> 13:27.020
Dr. Charles Melman, who is the founder of the

13:27.020 --> 13:30.020
Laconian Psychoanalytic Association,

13:30.020 --> 13:33.020
International Laconian Psychoanalytic Association.

13:33.020 --> 13:47.020
Dear friends of New York,

13:47.020 --> 13:52.020
Moriel and Paris.

13:52.020 --> 13:59.020
So there is one thing that surely we have in common with food

13:59.020 --> 14:04.020
and probably with Lacon as well.

14:04.020 --> 14:13.020
And that is that we haven't done any better than they have.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.020
What do I mean by that?

14:16.020 --> 14:26.020
I mean that we have failed to have academics as well as public opinion

14:26.020 --> 14:33.020
take into account the case to the understanding of the world

14:33.020 --> 14:39.020
that are provided by psychoanalysis.

14:39.020 --> 14:51.020
Let us consider the greed and the dream problems that we have to face today.

14:51.020 --> 14:58.020
We shall perceive that fruit and probably Lacon as well showed

14:58.020 --> 15:05.020
that we had no choice but interpret and elaborate them

15:05.020 --> 15:23.020
adequately if we were to solve them in an adequate way.

15:23.020 --> 15:27.020
What does that imply?

15:27.020 --> 15:34.020
It implies some form of complicity between former enemies.

15:34.020 --> 15:39.020
Who thus become partners also?

15:39.020 --> 15:46.020
They have to be given the information that will take them away from their blind hatred

15:46.020 --> 15:55.020
of the other, which is none other than self-hatred.

15:55.020 --> 16:02.020
But is there such a thing as justified hatred?

16:02.020 --> 16:09.020
This point, however, is not the subject of our discussion today.

16:09.020 --> 16:22.020
Fred and Lacon did see that Thanatos could be the overwhelming force.

16:22.020 --> 16:35.020
Thus today, the world may be seen as divided into two groups.

16:35.020 --> 16:43.020
On the one hand, we have the peoples whose only law is enjoyment,

16:43.020 --> 16:50.020
and for the sake of enjoyment they are ready to sacrifice their own life.

16:50.020 --> 17:12.020
The only thing that the two groups seem to have in common is an addictive

17:12.020 --> 17:22.020
behavior pattern. No addiction, unfortunately, is not something that can be subject to

17:22.020 --> 17:35.020
dialectics, which means that it is out of the reach of reason.

17:35.020 --> 17:43.020
We wish to have the works of Fred listed among the world heritage sites

17:43.020 --> 17:47.020
referenced by UNESCO.

17:47.020 --> 17:55.020
You are well aware that such a step will not change the course of a story.

17:55.020 --> 18:04.020
However, it will be a small stone paving the way for the possibility of a different future.

18:04.020 --> 18:11.020
Thank you.

18:11.020 --> 18:26.020
The first round table is on education, and the participants are Marilia Eisenstein,

18:26.020 --> 18:37.020
Victor Azale, Paul Fry, Gerard Pomey, and Jean-Jacques Moskowitz.

18:37.020 --> 18:56.020
The participants were delighted when my senior passport went on toisible in the

18:56.020 --> 19:18.020
Thank you, Ed. So I have a great pleasure and honor to chair this first panel on education.

19:18.020 --> 19:27.940
And it will be an open discussion if someone to read a paper or a short paper or part of

19:27.940 --> 19:35.660
the paper and then discuss I think the best is to fee free.

19:35.660 --> 19:42.740
But I will probably give to Professor Frye.

19:42.740 --> 19:45.500
We'll start.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.700
Well thank you and welcome all.

19:48.700 --> 19:56.900
My French is equal to reading and comprehension but unfortunately very little to speaking.

19:56.900 --> 20:07.780
So you will have to endure my English which I will at least attempt to enunciate slowly.

20:07.780 --> 20:16.900
I chose this panel because of course while I have opinions about civilization and about

20:16.900 --> 20:25.700
discontent I feel a little more qualified to speak about education.

20:25.700 --> 20:32.260
In recent years in addition to the various duties you can imagine as an English professor

20:32.260 --> 20:40.860
I have become the executive co-director of the Yale New Haven Teachers Institute and its

20:40.860 --> 20:47.300
national emanation which is called the National Initiative.

20:47.300 --> 20:56.900
And what we do is sponsor collegial content driven seminars for teachers preschool through

20:56.900 --> 20:57.900
high school.

20:57.900 --> 21:04.540
I have taught a great many of these in the summer time and during the course of teaching

21:04.540 --> 21:13.380
them I have heard perhaps to invoke the word more meaningfully for the first time the discontent

21:13.380 --> 21:16.020
of teachers.

21:16.020 --> 21:23.260
And I am very much concerned that and by this I mean primarily what we call public school

21:23.260 --> 21:32.420
teachers that is to say state and locally sponsored education as opposed to privately

21:32.420 --> 21:34.580
sponsored education.

21:34.580 --> 21:42.140
I am very much concerned about this and the paper that I have distributed takes up what

21:42.140 --> 21:51.100
I take to be the two dominant modern philosophies of education neither of which I think are

21:51.100 --> 21:58.340
in any way adequate to the needs of the student population in general and neither of which

21:58.340 --> 22:04.420
I think sufficient even for the students whom it is best calculated to serve.

22:04.420 --> 22:10.220
The first of these philosophies of education in a certain sense however consciously of

22:10.220 --> 22:11.740
course is unclear.

22:11.740 --> 22:20.980
Decends from Plato and the idea behind it is that you e-dos or draw out knowledge in

22:20.980 --> 22:32.380
students through a process of warmth in atmosphere participation and encouragement of creativity.

22:32.380 --> 22:39.900
This philosophy of education dominated educational thought in the 60s and the 70s what you might

22:39.900 --> 22:44.340
call the Aquarian Age of education.

22:44.340 --> 22:51.020
Another philosophy of education has largely supplanted it owing to the inadequacies of

22:51.020 --> 22:56.380
previous one and that is a philosophy that seems to me derives most respectively speaking

22:56.380 --> 23:05.020
from Locke because it seems to suppose that the mind is a blank wax tablet on which information

23:05.020 --> 23:08.540
needs to be imprinted.

23:08.540 --> 23:14.500
And it is obviously a very different attitude toward the mind and it puts teachers in the

23:14.500 --> 23:21.260
same subject position exactly as students because teachers too are supposed to be blank

23:21.260 --> 23:29.100
wax tablets on which both pedagogical skill and the content they teach need to be imprinted

23:29.100 --> 23:36.420
and in this atmosphere we have what in English we call teaching to the test an emphasis on

23:36.420 --> 23:45.500
core knowledge to be imparted largely by rote in classroom situations and in the teachers

23:45.500 --> 23:52.900
own behavior the supposition that everything they do needs to be scripted.

23:52.900 --> 23:58.620
In the French translation it says screeped and I'm afraid I think it should be screeped

23:58.620 --> 24:05.740
and maybe acry day would be a clearer term I don't think the correct term is screeped.

24:05.740 --> 24:11.980
In any case that's what we call what teachers are obliged to do both in preparing their daily

24:11.980 --> 24:15.860
lesson plans and also in meeting the class.

24:15.860 --> 24:24.980
You begin by saying good morning class as you're told to do and then your teaching duties

24:24.980 --> 24:33.740
proceed from there all of them script well it seems to me that one great advantage of

24:33.740 --> 24:38.940
invoking Freud on an occasion like this is that if we understand these two traditions

24:38.940 --> 24:42.220
differently he can be seen to reconcile them.

24:42.220 --> 24:48.660
On the one hand while he's no more interested in innate ideas than most people are since

24:48.660 --> 25:01.500
Kant he nevertheless does have strongly inculcate us to recognize the as one of the preliminary

25:01.500 --> 25:10.540
speakers said desire to learn the innate disposition to know or to learn which is in part driven

25:10.540 --> 25:14.020
by infantile sexual researches.

25:14.020 --> 25:19.180
The infant is as desperate to know the truth about the things that matter to him or her

25:19.180 --> 25:25.500
as a philosopher is to know about the things that matter to him or her during the course

25:25.500 --> 25:33.420
of growing up latency adolescence there's the great danger of course that this desire

25:33.420 --> 25:37.540
to learn will be suppressed altogether.

25:37.540 --> 25:43.980
On the other hand we can make something of the Lockean tradition if instead of the idea

25:43.980 --> 25:50.380
of the blank wax tablet we keep in mind the notion Freud's notion of the mystic writing

25:50.380 --> 25:58.740
pad in other words the palimpsest of imprinting that acknowledges the dynamic relationship

25:58.740 --> 26:05.300
between unconscious drives and the effort all of us make to form something like a coherent

26:05.300 --> 26:18.580
consciousness and it seems to me that the basis for pedagogy and for mediating the issues

26:18.580 --> 26:24.860
of transference that have to be involved in education but that surround these two philosophies

26:24.860 --> 26:33.220
of education crudely the platonic and the Lockean it seems to me that the issue for education

26:33.220 --> 26:43.940
is understanding that the vagaries of human love which so much drive the wish to know

26:43.940 --> 26:56.300
need to be through the transference transformed stabilized as a kind of object love that we

26:56.300 --> 27:04.980
can call the love of understood ideas and by this means we need to recognize that both

27:04.980 --> 27:14.260
the edible resistance to the mentor or teacher and the abject identification with the mentor

27:14.260 --> 27:23.620
or teacher need to be curved mediated and a common ground between these radical extremes

27:23.620 --> 27:29.860
both of which it seems to me can be recognized in the structure of discontent that concerns

27:29.860 --> 27:36.340
us so much abject identification with the mentor of course has a great deal to do with

27:36.340 --> 27:43.060
the formation of fundamental solidarity and edible resistance to the teacher sometimes

27:43.060 --> 27:50.620
in the same personality has a great deal to do with the generation of hatred so it's

27:50.620 --> 27:57.980
commonplace enough to say so but it seems to me that our task is finding through our

27:57.980 --> 28:05.140
understanding of the dynamics of the transference a common ground between these undesirable extremes

28:05.140 --> 28:10.300
thank you I'm sorry if I went on too long.

28:10.300 --> 28:20.420
No you were not long told and it was I'm personally I was very moved.

28:20.420 --> 28:29.380
Because you you really have a very psychoanalytical understanding of what teaching is I mean the

28:29.380 --> 28:36.140
part of the casexis you have to casexis a person you have to have a strong casexis

28:36.140 --> 28:44.780
on the teacher and then if things go well this casexis can go from the person of the

28:44.780 --> 28:54.500
teacher to what he teaches and that seems very important and I was also very interested

28:54.500 --> 29:08.100
in your paper to the place you give to philosophy saying that finally a child is in love with

29:08.100 --> 29:15.980
philosophy because he wants to understand how mind the mind works.

29:15.980 --> 29:19.860
Thank you.

29:19.860 --> 29:21.860
Who wants to react?

29:21.860 --> 29:22.860
Yes.

29:22.860 --> 29:23.860
I can.

29:23.860 --> 29:24.860
Yes.

29:24.860 --> 29:25.860
I can.

29:25.860 --> 29:26.860
I can.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.860
I can.

29:27.860 --> 29:28.860
I can.

29:28.860 --> 29:29.860
I can.

29:29.860 --> 29:30.860
I can.

29:30.860 --> 29:31.860
I can.

29:31.860 --> 29:32.860
I can.

29:32.860 --> 29:33.860
I can.

29:33.860 --> 29:34.860
I can.

29:34.860 --> 29:35.860
I can.

29:35.860 --> 29:36.860
I can.

29:36.860 --> 29:37.860
I can.

29:37.860 --> 29:38.860
I can.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.860
I can.

29:39.860 --> 29:40.860
I can.

29:40.860 --> 29:52.120
But listening to the president speaker first, I am speaking that there is no relationship

29:52.120 --> 29:57.760
evident between education and teaching.

29:57.760 --> 30:06.620
Because on the method, at this because in the method teaching does not let speak of anything

30:06.620 --> 30:11.620
especially not speak of about sexuality, about drives,

30:13.540 --> 30:18.540
about what any kind of obscenity

30:19.580 --> 30:24.580
that is repressed by the common education.

30:25.740 --> 30:30.140
And it's on the contrary of psychoanalysis

30:30.140 --> 30:35.140
who's first, I don't know to say, the rule is to let speak,

30:39.140 --> 30:44.140
to let speak the free association, which are not free,

30:44.220 --> 30:49.220
which are all going back to the drives,

30:50.140 --> 30:52.420
to the obscenity of drives,

30:52.420 --> 30:57.420
which is not permitted by good education.

30:57.420 --> 31:02.420
In principle, there is no way to join education

31:02.420 --> 31:06.020
and psychoanalysis on the method.

31:06.020 --> 31:11.020
But in fact, anybody can see that there is in the life,

31:13.580 --> 31:15.620
there is a strong relationship.

31:17.300 --> 31:22.300
I mean that education as well as psychoanalysis

31:22.300 --> 31:27.300
are the same boundary with the prohibition of incest.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.500
And this prohibition is,

31:40.940 --> 31:45.460
is what?

31:45.460 --> 31:47.100
Commanding, commande.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.100
Yes, commande.

31:48.100 --> 31:51.340
Insisted on, demanded?

31:51.340 --> 31:53.140
Demanded, yes.

31:53.140 --> 31:53.980
Yes.

31:53.980 --> 31:58.980
Demanding, demanding the repression.

31:59.260 --> 32:02.220
There is a strong relationship

32:03.780 --> 32:08.780
between what is so necessary

32:08.780 --> 32:11.620
in the, in the,

32:11.620 --> 32:16.620
in what is the way psychoanalysis is leading to,

32:21.100 --> 32:23.860
that means to two main things

32:27.660 --> 32:31.580
that has something to do with this contents,

32:31.580 --> 32:36.580
that is resolution of the symptoms by speaking,

32:36.740 --> 32:40.700
because only speaking as a subject and the symptom

32:40.700 --> 32:45.180
has no subject and speaking is making some,

32:49.180 --> 32:52.820
some help.

32:53.740 --> 32:58.140
First thing against this content,

32:58.140 --> 33:03.140
and second thing is the dissolution of the edifice complex

33:04.180 --> 33:08.460
as the end of analysis on the front end

33:08.460 --> 33:11.260
is a way to understand it.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.820
And so on this way it's very clear

33:13.820 --> 33:17.500
that analysis has something very strong

33:17.500 --> 33:20.940
to see with education,

33:20.940 --> 33:24.100
but the method are not the same.

33:24.100 --> 33:29.100
So we are, I mean, we have a good orientation

33:29.700 --> 33:34.700
by speaking first of the question of education.

33:34.700 --> 33:39.700
A way to educate that has nothing to see with science.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.900
Science has not been able to civilly-see

33:45.740 --> 33:47.940
the mind of the people.

33:47.940 --> 33:51.700
Always this discontent is going on,

33:51.700 --> 33:55.340
on his basis of sexual discontent,

33:55.340 --> 34:00.340
and science itself is changing,

34:00.340 --> 34:05.340
and is now like a new religion,

34:08.340 --> 34:13.340
trying to give explanation of what are the sources

34:16.340 --> 34:21.340
of this contents, but outside of the sexual reasons,

34:22.340 --> 34:26.340
and outside of the prohibition of incest,

34:26.340 --> 34:31.340
which is the law on which the edifice complex tech

34:32.500 --> 34:37.500
is universality, and which are the way

34:39.420 --> 34:44.340
in which we are trying to civilize,

34:44.340 --> 34:49.180
civilize the desire, always savage,

34:49.180 --> 34:54.060
because taking within this discontent.

34:54.060 --> 34:57.260
But maybe I will not say no more from now,

34:57.260 --> 35:01.180
and after in the discussion, to say no.

35:01.180 --> 35:03.100
If I understood well,

35:03.100 --> 35:06.580
Girard Pamele you are saying that psychoanalysis

35:06.580 --> 35:10.220
and education have the same aim,

35:10.220 --> 35:15.220
but it totally, totally controversial or different method.

35:17.020 --> 35:20.780
One is contracting, and the other is deconstructing.

35:20.780 --> 35:24.900
Yes, that's it.

35:24.900 --> 35:27.180
There's a wonderful paradox in your paper

35:27.180 --> 35:32.180
that I admire very much, and the idea is that education

35:32.260 --> 35:35.820
or pedagogy advocates free speech,

35:35.820 --> 35:38.900
yet speaks under inhibition,

35:38.900 --> 35:42.620
and psychoanalysis fully acknowledges

35:42.620 --> 35:46.620
that language is a prison house within which we struggle,

35:46.620 --> 35:49.420
and is much more skeptical about free speech,

35:49.420 --> 35:53.780
while at the same time articulating issues

35:53.780 --> 35:57.060
that pedagogy tends to wince away from.

35:57.060 --> 35:59.660
It's a wonderful paradox.

35:59.660 --> 36:04.660
I wonder how it's affected by the loss of verbal inhibition,

36:09.060 --> 36:12.140
let's say in post-war times.

36:12.140 --> 36:14.900
It's true that the schools, and here again,

36:14.900 --> 36:17.820
I speak only from American experience,

36:17.820 --> 36:22.100
are remarkably alert senses,

36:22.100 --> 36:25.740
very frequently on the subject of sexuality,

36:25.740 --> 36:29.300
but at the same time there is among students,

36:29.300 --> 36:32.100
and of course among teachers too,

36:32.100 --> 36:37.100
the common currency of freedom to speak about these things

36:37.980 --> 36:40.020
in less formal situations.

36:40.020 --> 36:43.660
So I would think that there would be a slight erosion

36:43.660 --> 36:45.180
of this paradox,

36:45.180 --> 36:50.180
perhaps not for the good or for any productive end,

36:50.460 --> 36:55.460
owing to the collapse of verbal inhibitions

36:55.460 --> 36:58.300
in the last few generations.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.940
I don't know what you would think about that.

37:05.820 --> 37:10.300
The sexual education I am speaking of

37:10.300 --> 37:14.180
is not the sexual education of free speech,

37:14.180 --> 37:17.940
or on how to make love or things like that.

37:19.300 --> 37:22.180
It's something like a more profound

37:22.180 --> 37:27.180
that includes the discontent of what is coming

37:27.820 --> 37:30.620
from the edipus complex.

37:30.620 --> 37:34.860
And of that, there is no speech, nowhere possible,

37:34.860 --> 37:37.340
because it's a very personal thing.

37:38.620 --> 37:41.580
I mean, the men, like the women,

37:41.580 --> 37:45.140
are afraid of their own desire,

37:45.140 --> 37:47.900
which is coming from the discontent itself,

37:47.900 --> 37:50.620
and it's only analysis we can do,

37:51.660 --> 37:56.660
we can make that more civilized.

37:57.260 --> 38:00.180
We can come to terms with it, rationally perhaps,

38:00.180 --> 38:01.780
but not emotionally.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.620
Yes.

38:02.620 --> 38:03.460
Yes.

38:06.260 --> 38:10.580
It makes sense because you have discourses,

38:10.580 --> 38:13.900
which are very, very welcome-stranded,

38:13.900 --> 38:18.900
and very intelligent and full of culture,

38:20.540 --> 38:25.540
but what Andre Green would call dead discourses,

38:27.300 --> 38:31.940
because when the discourse is no more rooted in the drives,

38:33.860 --> 38:37.340
it becomes totally different, concrete.

38:37.340 --> 38:42.340
Yes. For example, what is coming from our buzzies culture,

38:48.100 --> 38:53.100
is some kind of hate of the feminine.

38:53.340 --> 38:55.180
Of the feminine, I say.

38:55.180 --> 38:57.500
I mean, of the castration.

38:57.500 --> 39:02.500
And this can be educated by rational ways,

39:02.500 --> 39:07.500
but only with personal ways like analysis.

39:08.460 --> 39:10.380
That's why we have, I mean,

39:10.380 --> 39:15.380
something very unique to give to civilization,

39:17.020 --> 39:19.180
and with these contents.

39:25.460 --> 39:26.300
Yes.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.140
Yes, yes.

39:27.140 --> 39:27.980
Thank you.

39:27.980 --> 39:31.740
I speak in France, excuse me.

39:31.740 --> 39:36.220
It would be much easier to own our plans,

39:36.220 --> 39:37.900
and to do some stuff.

39:37.900 --> 39:38.580
Excellent.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.180
We're so thrilled.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.820
We are so grateful,

39:46.420 --> 39:52.040
and the architects of coming here

39:51.980 --> 39:56.580
are two separate groups.

41:26.580 --> 41:55.580
I really want to be very bummed that my studies were to be Osse

41:56.580 --> 42:16.500
beating his fucking hair...

42:18.420 --> 42:20.540
OK.

42:20.540 --> 42:21.580
Thank you.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.580
Thank you.

42:23.580 --> 42:24.580
Now, what's interesting?

42:24.580 --> 42:28.060
As such,Sizey wishes that necessary

42:28.060 --> 42:30.920
are all leading together by clearer approaches

42:30.920 --> 42:33.380
and which we are facing answered

42:33.380 --> 42:40.260
and thousands of Sturke

42:40.260 --> 42:25.460
different conflict

42:25.460 --> 42:45.300
choices

42:47.740 --> 42:50.900
And phrases and sounds

42:50.900 --> 42:53.960
And the country has been working hard.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.740
So we are looking at all the electric values

42:58.740 --> 42:52.980
and our

43:07.540 --> 43:09.900
jetson, and Marvel engineers

43:09.900 --> 43:11.940
who spoke at its own

43:11.940 --> 43:13.260
communities, that make a Beta for the

43:13.260 --> 43:15.260
planet.

43:15.260 --> 43:18.080
I have read they have the same

43:18.080 --> 43:19.220
sound of

43:19.220 --> 43:24.620
but apparently this is the kept up with the Excellent

43:25.420 --> 43:26.660
entrepreneurs now

43:27.740 --> 43:29.460
somehow so often

43:29.460 --> 43:30.620
there's an charred

43:31.120 --> 43:32.940
for Erma Fan Kills

43:33.260 --> 43:36.140
that's why absolutely

43:38.120 --> 43:39.640
is the case

43:40.280 --> 43:42.760
and this actually does not

43:44.920 --> 43:46.540
I'm not them

43:46.540 --> 43:51.600
directly at the stage

43:51.620 --> 43:53.680
point or third

43:53.700 --> 43:57.300
involved a set of

43:57.340 --> 44:01.380
collaboration

44:01.380 --> 43:54.720
the

I would like to thank you for the support of the church,

and to the people who are here,

49:59.120 --> 50:01.120

Thank you.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.120
Thank you.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.120
Thank you.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.120
Thank you, Martyn.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.120
One question.

50:17.120 --> 50:23.120
Did everybody understood French?

50:23.120 --> 50:27.120
And shall I make a very brief summary?

50:27.120 --> 50:29.120
Yes, ma'am.

50:29.120 --> 50:31.120
I'll try to.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.120
It's not so easy.

50:33.120 --> 50:39.120
But Jean-Jacques Muscovic started saying how moved he was

50:39.120 --> 50:42.120
to speak in New York in this symposium,

50:42.120 --> 50:46.120
especially after the tragic Paris events,

50:46.120 --> 50:51.120
and what happened yesterday in San Bernardino.

50:51.120 --> 50:59.120
He evoked the hate of humanity,

50:59.120 --> 51:08.120
and went back to Freud's papers on human destructivity.

51:08.120 --> 51:12.120
He picked up one expression,

51:12.120 --> 51:18.120
which is an expression that one can find in Freud's 1916

51:18.120 --> 51:26.120
Y War, no considerations on war,

51:26.120 --> 51:30.120
where he speaks of the individual people,

51:30.120 --> 51:34.120
the individual mass.

51:34.120 --> 51:40.120
And then he said that he thinks that the word discontent

51:40.120 --> 51:42.120
is a very feeble word,

51:42.120 --> 51:46.120
that one should say more, something like

51:46.120 --> 51:58.120
destructivity, something more

51:58.120 --> 52:02.120
than discontent.

52:02.120 --> 52:11.120
Then he went to the relation between infantile sexuality

52:11.120 --> 52:18.120
and saying that nowadays religion and moral

52:18.120 --> 52:25.120
is no more able to contain the violence,

52:25.120 --> 52:33.120
which starts with infantile sexuality.

52:33.120 --> 52:40.120
He quoted Andre Mallejo, who in 1953,

52:40.120 --> 52:48.120
already said about he had a premonition saying that

52:48.120 --> 52:54.120
if the 21st century is not a religious century,

52:54.120 --> 52:59.120
it won't exist.

52:59.120 --> 53:06.120
So he had the idea of the danger of the religion now.

53:06.120 --> 53:12.120
Now, he, Jean-Pierre Mascavitch,

53:12.120 --> 53:16.120
if I understood well,

53:16.120 --> 53:24.120
closed his remarks by seeing how much education,

53:24.120 --> 53:30.120
social education, education, teaching,

53:30.120 --> 53:33.120
is important, of course, as we already said,

53:33.120 --> 53:39.120
in the round table, but how much it can also be something

53:39.120 --> 53:43.120
which is totally insufficient,

53:43.120 --> 53:52.120
because it can totally erase the unconscious fantasy.

53:52.120 --> 53:57.120
And he said something which for me is very important.

53:57.120 --> 54:02.120
He said we should be very much aware

54:02.120 --> 54:08.120
of the seduction of the terrorist attacks,

54:08.120 --> 54:13.120
the seduction of violence of destitute activity,

54:13.120 --> 54:16.120
because of course we are all,

54:16.120 --> 54:23.120
we have a fundamental violence in all of us.

54:23.120 --> 54:29.120
Yes, yes.

54:29.120 --> 54:34.120
Yes, yes, yes.

54:34.120 --> 54:39.120
No, of course.

54:39.120 --> 54:42.120
No, no.

54:42.120 --> 54:31.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be

54:31.120 --> 54:52.120
the truth is not to be the truth.

54:52.120 --> 55:02.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

55:02.120 --> 55:07.120
It is not to be the truth.

55:07.120 --> 55:12.120
It is to be the truth.

55:12.120 --> 55:25.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

55:25.120 --> 55:31.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

55:31.120 --> 55:46.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

55:46.120 --> 55:53.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

55:53.120 --> 56:03.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:03.120 --> 56:12.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:12.120 --> 56:26.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:26.120 --> 56:34.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:34.120 --> 56:44.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:44.120 --> 56:51.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

56:51.120 --> 57:06.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

57:06.120 --> 57:14.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

57:14.120 --> 57:24.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

57:24.120 --> 57:34.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

57:34.120 --> 57:47.120
The truth is that the truth is not to be the truth.

57:47.120 --> 57:54.880
One thing that will probablyique the subject from your family is development today,

57:54.900 --> 58:01.800
the

58:02.540 --> 58:03.400
textile

58:03.400 --> 58:10.900
That's for you or the intrigued

58:11.740 --> 58:15.660
You get issue as so whole as we

58:15.660 --> 58:22.660
I think that's a very important thing.

58:22.660 --> 58:27.660
I think that the people who are in the U.S.

58:27.660 --> 58:29.660
are in the U.S.

58:29.660 --> 58:32.660
and in the U.S.

58:32.660 --> 58:36.660
are in the U.S.

58:36.660 --> 58:39.660
and in the U.S.

58:39.660 --> 58:43.660
and in the U.S.

58:43.660 --> 58:46.660
and in the U.S.

58:46.660 --> 58:52.660
so there are many people who are in the U.S.

58:52.660 --> 58:57.660
and in the U.S.

58:57.660 --> 59:02.660
and in the U.S.

59:02.660 --> 59:05.660
and in the U.S.

59:05.660 --> 59:12.660
and in the U.S.

59:42.660 --> 01:00:03.340
And are pigs for his Drag

59:45.060 --> 01:00:03.580
America?

59:56.040 --> 01:00:05.480
The

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:18.080
Okay, I'll try very, very briefly.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:30.400
Big Dawahdulay was saying that the previous speaker was as pessimist as Freud was.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:40.460
We all know Freud's pessimism and he rose then two questions saying that first of all

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:50.720
reading the paper and listening to Muscovitch wrote to his mind that the word discontent

01:00:50.720 --> 01:01:00.900
is becoming a crucial psychoanalytical concept which is at the core of our daily work.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:13.600
And then that he heard in the speech of Muscovitch something which was of an urgency, urgency

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:22.520
to find answers, urgency to react, urgency to understand. And he says, Victor Azulay said,

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:29.520
that between the discontent and the urgency, there was something which was lacking which

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:43.480
is the work of education. And the, that education is what is constituting finally the identity.

01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:52.320
And I think that you were finally making a link to the next round table between education

01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:04.400
and identity of course, because to be educated one must have, one must be constructing his

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:14.400
own identity with education.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:40.360
I would like to mention that Raj said the  Owl had to Professor

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.260
something that the people middle from.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:48.020
Live from the old mes Hangs.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:49.140
in combination with the local

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.860
which the people and the local area

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.840
these are actual

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.720
is one where there is going to be a

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:14.120
to help raise money and you will see that our problem is not

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:21.220
possible to forgive those people and Trustees not to seem to

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:07.800
more than they report so that we are willing to

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:13.220
look at the approval of audit of the

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:11.220
potner in these

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:34.640
but I could ask you, whether I have your integrated

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.840
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO more often

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.840
if you devoted yourself

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.480
Okay. Please.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:56.840
I feel that probably one duty we have before us is to discuss quayons.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:05.520
Mr. Poemier makes a very interesting distinction in his paper between to believe that and to

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:19.520
believe in qua qua, which I think bears careful examination because there's certainly a difference.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.720
We have a kind of a philosophical feeling about believing that.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:28.760
I believe that such and such is the case, for example.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:37.920
Whereas we have a religious, perhaps a squeamish religious feeling about believing in.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:46.520
And yet the whole concept of belief, it seems to me, still has very much to do with identity

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.040
formation.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:54.720
Perhaps we all of necessity and spontaneously believe something.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:01.320
I feel very much as though I were on the couch and so I will confess that I believe painfully

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.920
little myself, which in a certain sense perhaps exempts me.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:14.120
I don't think you need to worry too much about my turning violent tomorrow as a result.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:21.560
But on the other hand, I'm often the sort of person who's often accused of creating

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:27.200
an intellectual void into which fanaticism can rush.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.400
I resist the charge, but at the same time it's this question.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:43.480
Whether or not there is a structure of belief that actually resists fanaticism, for example,

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:52.480
somehow or another based on coming to terms with the understanding of the violence within

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:59.400
or whether on the other hand the resistance to fanaticism is in a certain sense necessarily

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.440
a resistance to belief as such.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:10.440
I would like, I would be very interested in hearing that question pursued.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:24.480
You know, you reminded me, Ron Britton, British psychoanalyst, wrote a lot about belief in

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.240
relation to what we call internal reality.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:30.760
Yes.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760
Yes.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760
Yes.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:42.000
And I think it's very important what you said and belief can of course be part of internal

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.360
reality and then be worked through.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:54.760
Or if it's not worked through, it can exactly go to fanaticism or delusion.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:09:06.320
I should tell you something about education.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:20.720
Freud in 1916 wrote, We Believe That Civilization has been created under the pressure of the

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:33.320
large extent being constantly created anew since each individual who makes a fresh entry

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:43.160
into human society repeats this sacrifice of institutional satisfaction for the benefit

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:51.840
of the whole community by refusing of this sacrifice, the new individual necessarily

01:09:51.840 --> 01:10:10.720
comes up against the discontent present in civilization and today is the same problem.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.160
Any comment?

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.160
Yes, maybe.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:24.440
The comment that as Mr. Mark Smalert said, we have to learn.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:40.240
We have to learn not only thinking that violence is founding itself on some personal problems

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:48.680
of people who are a problem to finish with with their parents and so on.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.400
But there is something specifically cultural.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:02.080
And this is what is specifically cultural is not only the fault of the author.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:09.840
There is not in one way the religious people, we are fighting against religion for atheism

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:22.360
which permits to finish with this kind of violence on one side and ourselves, our societies

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:28.520
who are at least and who have finished with this violence.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:29.840
This is not true.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.840
We have our own violence and we have to confess it as well.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:51.880
I mean, it's not only the other culture which is in theological, political violence, our

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.600
self as well are in this violence.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:08.680
I mean, capitalism is not something on the side of a taste in a very evident way.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:18.120
It is as well a theological, political commandment, a criterion one to be on the wealthy side,

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:29.040
to be the strongest there is competition violence in scripted with our belief and our belief

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:34.800
in God as well is written on each dollar in God we trust.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:43.560
So I think we have to learn to and to think about that as well.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:50.560
Perhaps I can open the discussion to the audience if someone wants to, yes, please.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:13:00.560
Yes, I would like to try to remember and give those other words.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.560
But I have a good round of words.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.560
Does it matter?

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.560
Does it matter?

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.560
Does it matter to be the truth?

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:17.200
And the comments you just made and bring them together in order to also make a connection

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.620
between the question of education and the larger social, cultural, and political questions

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.520
we are considering.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:34.420
You know, Adorno in his famous article on after Auschwitz said the role of education

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:43.360
should be to create autonomous citizens who can critically enter into the public sphere

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:48.920
and challenge, question, evaluate the ideology, belief, solutions, whatever you want to call

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.960
them with a group.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:59.720
And I appreciate your stress on the role of transference in education and character formation

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.720
in the classroom is my calling.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.720
As someone who has taught in university, I have had occasion to observe that there is

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.720
as much transference in a seminar room as there is in the consulting room.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:28.720
So the point I want to make is that if we think of education in terms of the idea which

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:36.160
utilizes the transference of the teacher, I think the goal should be as you suggested

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:47.600
is to take the transference, take the identifications, and transform them into a situation where

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:54.600
the student identifies with the teacher in terms of his or her critical capacities, dedication

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.680
to truth, willingness to call things into question.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:05.600
And he or herself becomes an autonomous critical thinker.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.360
And to connect that to your last remark about the distinction between believing in and believing

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:21.000
that, you might say a secular identity is one that is committed only to believing in when

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.920
believing in is justified, what the analytic philosophers used to call that justified a

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.520
surgeon or justified belief.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:37.960
So that if one is cathected that stance, that identity, then all believing in should be

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.960
subject to inquiry, criticism, and to see if they can be translated into a justified believing

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:45.960
that.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960
Thank you.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.960
Emi Malle.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:02.960
Good morning, friends.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:15.280
As co-founder with Charles Melmont, I want to say something about what I heard this morning.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:26.920
The Freud Committee was founded to explain why today Freud could be not an explication,

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:35.400
but could be very accurate to understand what is coming in extremism, in nationalities,

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.120
in a dead drive.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:45.280
And I think it's very important not to take Freud as a commentator, as a journalist like

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:54.160
I am of the actuality, but to understand what is happening today, and I try to speak in

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.760
French and Maria will translate.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:16.880
And I hope you answer the answer from my other hand.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:23.880
and the other was that the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:42.880
The other was that the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:18:11.880
The real approach that Americans make against Freud is a constitutive identity.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.960
There are many heading to

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:20.960
the world they're queuing gap that theletists might be doing in stereotyping."

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.540
There was an excuse to quote Bob Cohen's

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:29.540
hope that he has a bias of our marvelous identity.

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.560
murder.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.080
INE

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:53.160
in Paris, in San Bernardino, and in Arabia show that Freud was right first.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.200
or has acquired the needlu

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:57.960
and Umua

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:08.260
and the

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.300
in reclaiming the —

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.800
the

01:19:48.800 --> 01:20:04.800
So now Europe and United States, Arabia, we all have a chance to get together to realize this point that in fact the death drive and the life drive, eros and Thanatos can be...

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.800
Can go side by side.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:23.800
One point in common between Freud and the Americans is that Freud and Americans read the Bible.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:31.800
What does the Bible say about the drive?

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:51.800
The Bible says that the death drive and the life drive go side by side, hand in hand, but we have to choose the life drive.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:21:06.800
The Bible says that Freud and Americans are not able to do this, but they are not able to do this.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:14.800
And we can see from Freud's work and his life how he put the arrows before Thanatos.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:29.800
In conclusion, it's worth talking to the plural of Freud, itself with someone who believes in Christ, his future falconment is theement of Writing & Economics of his english.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:52.800
And I think that the economists who won the Nobel Prize,

01:21:52.800 --> 01:22:01.800
Edwin Felds said that in taking a risk, an economic risk,

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:07.800
for progress and for life, Freud taught us more than an economist.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.800
Thank you.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:16.800
Yes, please.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:23.800
I'm not current with Freud.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.800
I haven't read Freud probably in 30 or 40 years.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.800
And I don't condone violence.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:42.800
Schopenhauer, to describe the concept of resenting a deep abiding resentment, anger.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:50.800
I understand what motivated those people in California and those people in Paris.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.800
We are told that anti- that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic,

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:01.800
that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic, and we're not allowed to discuss these issues at all of it,

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:08.800
as led to our committing unbelievable atrocities in the Middle East.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:15.800
I understand the rage that people can feel when they feel that their own people are being assaulted,

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:22.800
and they have no way to even cry about that.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.800
I don't condone violence.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:32.800
I don't condone the slaughter of innocent people, but I do not feel that I am innocent.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.800
I don't think anybody sitting in this room is innocent.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.800
French foreign policy is as much an atrocity as American foreign policy.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:48.800
French history with colonialism is as much an atrocity as what the United States has done

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.800
over my entire lifetime.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:24:00.800
And I think that more than Thanos and Eros being part of the human personality,

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:08.800
I think we have to speak about our own personal responsibility for where we have led this world.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:14.800
And I think you're being far too gentle on ourselves here.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:21.800
We bear responsibility for what we're facing today, every one of us.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.800
Thank you.

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:34.600
Well, first I think you can hear in the responses both of Monsieur Moskowitz and Monsieur B'omé

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:43.800
the acknowledgment of a violence within and especially of a violence from the standpoint of superiority,

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:51.800
which is, let's say, the structure of a self-condonation, although it doesn't emphasize it,

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:57.800
our task today to think about Freud in relation to these matters.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.800
And in that regard, I'd like to go back to the death drive.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:09.800
In beyond the pleasure principle, Freud toys controversially with biological metaphors,

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:19.800
as we know, and speculates that the death drive is the wish of the organism to return to a simpler state.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:28.800
In other words, in a certain sense, to uncomplicate itself to the point of a zero degree.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:37.800
That's, it seems to me, an extremely challenging and, can I say, seductive speculation,

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:45.800
because I think one of the things we need to acknowledge feeling in ourselves is precisely that wish for

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.800
a return to a simpler, organismic state.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:56.800
The question to me is the relation between the death drive and quéons.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.800
And quéons, and belief.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:09.800
To believe that one, to wish, to be with God in saying, for example, Allah is great,

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:17.800
is, it seems to me, a more or less open and direct expression of the death wish.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:30.800
But on the other hand, not to backtrack and rehabilitate quéons, because what I said before is really my stance on these things.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:38.800
But on the other hand, it's clear that there's a sense in which one might believe in something that affirms life.

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:52.800
And that if, you know, given the premise of the necessity of belief, which in a certain sense, for example, marks acknowledged,

01:26:52.800 --> 01:27:02.800
one might at least think of education as a matter of cultivating those beliefs in something that affirms life.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:11.800
Rather than, rather than in something that makes us wish immediately to leave life so as to be with something higher.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.800
I totally agree with you and with your comments.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:30.800
I just wanted to add that I really think that the definition that was given by Freud in the outline of what his death drive

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:42.800
is extremely important because it shows that death drive is important in every, even in the thinking process.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.800
It is to separate.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:57.800
And to think we have to put things together when little children, you teach them that Annapal and Epea, they are fruits.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:06.800
But he also has to learn that Annapal is different than Epea and they have to be separated.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.800
So death drive is in the thinking process of everyday's life.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:23.800
But what you mentioned, it can also go to this belief of total tranquility.

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:30.800
And that, and beyond, and that, yes, of course.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.800
I have to...

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.800
You wanted to speak and then jump, and then jump.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:54.800
So...

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.880
and steps in the image.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.980
That is what brings us to the folks

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.400
in our system for Blanca.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:52.060
We are constantly able to

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.060
No.

01:30:53.060 --> 01:30:55.060
See for Traduina.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.060
Yes.

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.060
Yeah.

01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:10.340
Jaujia Mascovic was underlining that Freud spoke already in 1916 of the enigma of this

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:26.260
activity and hate and that is an answer to the edla fibles, la completude.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:36.820
We, the unerability of human, it's an answer to human vulnerability.

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:47.020
So there are two choices or education and the work of civilization and he didn't say

01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:56.740
that, but I think I was thinking of Kultur-Aghabite and or Babarisma.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.940
Yes.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:12.460
I think with the question of Paul Free, maybe we are reaching to a point that Freud has

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:26.500
lived as a question, a point where Freud has only give something for us to look for because

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:32.020
he says it, I think, in a special way.

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:43.100
Why to prefer to be dead, to answer to the death drive, to prefer to be near the father,

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:48.180
which is in the sky, I mean the father of the religion.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:50.380
Why to prefer death?

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:59.140
Because it's like that the mass murderers, they know they will die as well.

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:05.940
And I think that Freud has not answered to the question, what is a father?

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:16.060
He has not answered because there is no possibility of answer in the sense that father is always

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:26.700
a son and there is a choice between the dead father or the son who wants to be a father.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.460
And he can't answer to this question.

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:37.660
I mean, on this point to be like the father is to be like the dead father.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:46.340
I mean, when a son wants to be a father, he identifies himself to the dead father.

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:49.420
He wants to kill his father, his own father.

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:57.260
And so there is a circle and there we are maybe a question to answer to.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:02.220
Something that Freud has not solved, I think.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:07.500
Manja?

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:12.500
A couple things to respond to the panel.

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:19.980
And I teach community college for many years and I also teach students who have difficulties

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.940
with English, immigrant students.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:25.660
I run a program for them and I'm also a psychoanalyst in private practice.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.620
So I have a little bit of both of these fields.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:34.020
I wanted to say one thing about the idea of Dr. Fry said about love of understood ideas

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:42.420
and to touch on the point of Jean-Jacques's point of the seductions of violence and to

01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:50.580
maybe hypothesize that it's making understood ideas less understood or putting castration

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:59.100
as an opening to combat the seductions of violence on the part of teachers and the part

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.740
of opening discussion that makes something possible.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:09.700
And nobody said today, I mean, the important point that education is one of the impossible

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.660
professions for Freud, right?

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:17.900
So we're dealing with a point of impossibility and to kind of make that point of impossibility

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:19.840
exciting.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.660
And I have the point that we all share that we can't finally, finally have an answer

01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.660
to.

01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:28.820
The death drive would be on the side of the finally, right?

01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:33.820
So that was one point, one first point.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:39.820
So the idea that understood ideas lack, that understood ideas are never finally understood

01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:42.260
or could always be understood another way, right?

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:45.100
So that's the opening towards education.

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:50.540
That was one, and then the other is that I think that some I think that still on France

01:35:50.540 --> 01:36:01.140
and this thanks you are doing valuable education, colleague and manager, then, simply on this

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:09.520
add-up or an example of their own intellectual educationMAs who we have a tiny of work you

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.520
It's very difficult to understand the truth.

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:17.520
It's very difficult to understand the truth.

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.520
So for some of them it's fantastic and revolutionary to come to school.

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:25.520
They can talk about sex, they can talk, they feel they can talk about anything.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:30.520
So these, they're not as separate as they used to be long time ago.

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.520
Thank you.

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.520
Thank you.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:39.520
I wanted to apologize for the phrase.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.520
I didn't mean by understood ideas, received ideas.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:53.520
I meant ideas thought through autonomously with the understanding of course that they always need to be thought through again.

01:36:53.520 --> 01:37:04.520
At the risk of responding as the superficial American psychoanas, just a couple of thoughts.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:12.520
I'm so glad to be here and I would like to be able to stay longer but I can't in these issues.

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:16.520
But especially regarding education.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:31.520
Like you, I, for 14 years, ran a program in an alternative public high school in Chicago working with mostly kids, adolescents and gangs.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:43.520
Having most of whom it experienced unspeakable trauma by the time they're 10, 12 years old.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:54.520
And their involvement in the gangs begins to make absolute sense that having had the experiences that they've had, had any of us had similar experiences.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:04.520
We too would have wanted to be a part of something beyond ourselves as a way to repair the damage of that original trauma.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.520
On the surface, and again, remember I said I was trained in Chicago.

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:20.520
I used to sneak into lectures of Heinz Cojat who had obviously a great influence on my psychoanalytic career.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:33.520
One of the fascinating things when you observe what looks on the surface like the most self-destructive behavior and a wish to die.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:41.520
That by the time the kids are sent to the alternative high school, that's what they're up against.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:51.520
It is amazing and remarkable and something that's humbling as a psychoanalyst to see that we provided treatment right in the school.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.520
Psychoanalytic treatment, individual and group treatment right in the school.

01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:07.520
So they would have math class and then they might come to a group. They would have English class and then see an individual therapist who was either an analyst or psychoanalytically oriented.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:18.520
The transformation in a relatively short period of time of that aggressive violent behavior is remarkable.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:28.520
The experience of being listened to, being heard, having an opportunity to have someone witness one's internal state.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:43.520
And the transformation of that's what seems like inevitable violent behavior like a gang experience provides begins to fall away.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:55.520
The death instinct, if you will, begins some kind of a transformation into a wish to live, into a wish to learn.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:06.520
Now we've all experienced this in our offices, but to see it dramatically in terms of adolescents who are so violent by the time they come to school, high school,

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:20.520
and to see the little bit of a compassionate and pathic experience become transformative, like I said, is very humbling to the psychoanalyst.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:32.520
And I think the question is, is there something we can learn from that at the risk of sounding superficial? Thank you.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:39.520
Thank you, Mark.

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.520
Yes.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.520
I just want to add something, what you said.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:56.520
That is to say, we cannot divorce education from the social cultural environment.

01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:11.520
And of course, the creation of institution at the time, or the problem of institution at the time of fraud was completely different than what we have to cope with.

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:17.520
That is to say, sexuality is no more an issue in repression.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:28.520
The market has invaded our way of life, and the market is extremely permissive in relation to our driver instincts.

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.520
It's very permissive.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:44.520
And of course, in this social cultural environment, the identity formation is much more complex and has become, in a way, a sociological issue.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:58.520
One should not forget that the terrorists in Paris were all coming from prison, delinquency, criminality and so on.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:05.520
It means that they have totally failed the process of the identification.

01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:30.520
In other words, we cannot discuss education in the old way, in the way it is perhaps still authorized to the elite, which has a way to promote the elitist education with certain tutors, professors and so on,

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.520
going to Harvard and Yale later on, if the parents can afford it.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:58.520
We are living in a very, very divided society where a lot of people, especially in outside the cities in France, are totally devoid of the normal educational process.

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:10.520
Yes, thank you. I would like to add something which is linked to all what was said.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:27.520
Now, in the construction of the ego of a little child, let's say about four years old, when there is difficulty, the child may have a little child.

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:37.520
He may become phobic, which is a system of a defense system.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:51.520
If this phobic defense cannot be constructed because there is a failure, there are more serious difficulties.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:44:02.520
Shall I take an example? All the child can become phobic and have a phobia of cats, like little hans with horses.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:19.520
But if he cannot construct this phobia, because the environment is not good enough, instead of that, he will not have a psychic defense, but he will start saying, I do not like cats.

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:38.520
And from I do not like cats, he can go to I hate cats. And then to, all cats are hateable. And finally, we should kill all cats.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:59.520
Have a good one, only? Yes. I should forward concern after me today as always numerous factors of social, cultural or political unrest,

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:14.520
which underlie contemporary discontent produced in individuals at the loss-fricant, identically disturbances,

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:29.520
more destabilizing that the mere feeling of this quiet, individual identity problems are complicated by a new ennishiness,

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:43.520
they are no due to an insidious instability produced by external disturbance, social, economic, cultural and political,

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:59.520
certainly tangled together, exercising their competitive, destructive effect on a disoriented subject who feels lost these disturbance and divine,

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:16.520
with the internal crossroads of fidelity uncertainties, creating fricy in the destabilized sense of self.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:29.520
Thank you. I think we will end this panel. I want to thank the speakers and to thank everybody.

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:48.520
So there is a lunch break and then everybody back here will be there. The noon meeting which will start precisely at 2 o'clock.
