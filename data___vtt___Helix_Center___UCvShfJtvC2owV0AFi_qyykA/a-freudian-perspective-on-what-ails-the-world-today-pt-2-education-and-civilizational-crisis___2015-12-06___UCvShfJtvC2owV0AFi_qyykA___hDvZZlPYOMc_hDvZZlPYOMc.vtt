WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.960
Good afternoon.

00:21.960 --> 00:32.420
We are beginning the second session, a very important session about education, civilization,

00:32.420 --> 00:35.960
and its discontent.

00:35.960 --> 00:47.400
Our speakers, our President Edouard Narcissio, Dr. Sharon Merman, who is President of Lacanien

01:42.800 --> 02:01.840
Thank you, Edouard, it's no time for you.

02:01.840 --> 02:08.080
You can't hear me at all?

02:08.080 --> 02:31.480
Thank you, Edouard.

02:31.480 --> 02:38.380
Because China in Korea has made exponential changes,

02:38.660 --> 02:56.940
we have theLin Rice family AtlasÃ®tre de Brom

02:56.940 --> 03:01.720
let's begin with another scenario,

03:02.160 --> 03:04.600
clinic regmusic,

03:04.580 --> 03:08.180
a busy and decided to crime

03:08.420 --> 02:57.300
Vatican

03:11.180 --> 03:13.880
people

03:13.880 --> 03:16.740
no

03:16.580 --> 03:19.300
Convention

03:19.300 --> 03:21.300
As analysis is a MUSTY S usabeenses

03:23.300 --> 03:38.300
Dear Them Sch Thema Wellich,

04:08.300 --> 04:13.660
If the law can't assimilate the internal law

04:13.780 --> 04:15.900
And dams, we can't

04:15.900 --> 04:24.820
By the law we will never get to any inquiry

04:24.820 --> 04:31.060
It supposed to be a conducive situation

04:31.060 --> 04:34.400
presentations

04:34.400 --> 04:44.640
as well as heavypour dissolved in virtual space in laboratories and laboratories in the

04:45.920 --> 04:46.640
comster to work in universities, and in clinical medicine at utensils,opsy

04:47.600 --> 04:53.040
work inlers and paper labs in sanitation, huns etc.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.380
We're successful at the

04:55.540 --> 04:57.340
senate administrationie.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.920
The work of Construction

04:59.040 --> 05:00.180
has given us a couple topic

05:00.720 --> 05:01.740
we wish

06:01.740 --> 06:03.380
This is an order problem.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.220
This is an order problem.

06:05.220 --> 06:06.820
This is an order problem.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.780
This is an order problem.

06:08.780 --> 06:11.780
This is an order problem.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.300
Thank you.

06:23.540 --> 06:30.220
As you can see, we have a common language

06:30.220 --> 06:33.460
to speak between us.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.980
The choice is English or French,

06:37.980 --> 06:44.700
and we don't hear the same things in each language.

06:44.700 --> 06:53.620
So I will create now a new language.

06:53.620 --> 07:02.980
It's a pigeon made with bad French and bad English.

07:02.980 --> 07:09.420
I think that pigeon is a very important language.

07:09.420 --> 07:17.820
Because in this language, everybody is equal.

07:17.820 --> 07:24.500
So, equally knowledge.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.980
And in this language, there is no ideal.

07:31.540 --> 07:39.020
And everybody is very glad to meet you, sir.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.660
And to know that is like him.

07:41.660 --> 07:48.660
There is a big writer in pigeon.

07:48.660 --> 07:54.660
His name is James Joyce.

07:54.660 --> 08:08.660
And as we like his works, maybe you will agree with my pigeon.

08:08.660 --> 08:12.660
I agree with my pigeon.

08:16.260 --> 08:23.940
I think that the Jewish language is a form of pigeon.

08:23.940 --> 08:32.940
Because it's made of words which came from,

08:32.940 --> 08:40.700
which come from all European nations, and from Hebrew.

08:40.700 --> 08:45.100
Just grammar is German.

08:47.620 --> 08:51.620
Maybe it's a dream.

08:51.620 --> 08:57.980
If the Jewish was the language of the state of Israel,

08:57.980 --> 09:02.980
maybe the things were different.

09:06.980 --> 09:12.980
As we know, Fred said he didn't know why he was a Jew.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.980
He was not religious.

09:19.980 --> 09:22.980
It was not his nationality.

09:22.980 --> 09:27.980
It was not his ethnic law.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.980
So what?

09:30.980 --> 09:34.980
But he said I feel I am a Jew.

09:34.980 --> 09:37.980
What? What does it mean?

09:40.980 --> 09:51.980
What we can say in my pigeon is that a Jew is a Jew.

09:51.980 --> 09:56.980
Life, Fred.

09:56.980 --> 10:01.980
It's all the way between two poles.

10:01.980 --> 10:14.980
One is a text which he likes, which he wishes to understand.

10:14.980 --> 10:24.980
He loves the true word of the text.

10:24.980 --> 10:31.980
It's a word with its impressions.

10:31.980 --> 10:46.980
And I think that on his couch with his adolescence,

10:46.980 --> 11:00.980
he found that everybody who is speaking has the same status

11:00.980 --> 11:10.980
between a text may be his unconscious.

11:10.980 --> 11:19.980
And the word, the word where he is.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.980
Come on, we're there.

11:22.980 --> 11:29.980
Thank you.

11:29.980 --> 11:34.980
In pigeon, it's the same language.

11:34.980 --> 11:50.980
So the trade, the same trade of identification

11:50.980 --> 11:57.980
is the trade of incifisms.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.980
Incifisms.

12:00.980 --> 12:08.980
But it's normal that we don't suffer it.

12:08.980 --> 12:26.980
And each one wants or to have the true text, the less word,

12:26.980 --> 12:43.980
the true religion and in the same way have the land,

12:43.980 --> 12:48.980
which is a good one.

12:48.980 --> 12:56.980
It's a real one.

12:56.980 --> 13:08.980
I think that if Fred failed, it's because he wanted that for his

13:08.980 --> 13:18.980
discipline, his followers.

13:18.980 --> 13:23.980
That is full lovers.

13:23.980 --> 13:33.980
That is full lovers had the last word of the East text

13:33.980 --> 13:44.980
and he wrote the outline of psychoanalysis, his last word.

13:44.980 --> 13:57.980
And he wanted that his school would be the true one,

13:57.980 --> 14:04.980
the true land of his discipline.

14:04.980 --> 14:16.980
So maybe that if we speak together a bit pigeon and remember

14:16.980 --> 14:37.980
the truth, maybe we will obtain a better one.

14:37.980 --> 14:47.980
Maybe we will be able to recognize that the other has the same

14:47.980 --> 15:01.980
difficulty, some ourselves, the same.

15:01.980 --> 15:11.980
And maybe this would be better for a future.

15:11.980 --> 15:34.980
How do we find the architect's interest?

16:04.980 --> 16:14.480
May 20th we ask that, theated year of low cost,

16:15.020 --> 16:07.480
the

16:27.440 --> 16:33.200
interest in government and

16:33.200 --> 16:40.200
Okay, let's go.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.200
It's in the Jews' ceremony.

16:44.200 --> 16:58.200
She wants to continue, respond to what Charles said, loads and raise.

16:58.200 --> 17:06.200
I'll continue where you started, in what sense was Freud in Jew?

17:06.200 --> 17:12.200
The answer is, in the sense of the prophets of Israel,

17:12.200 --> 17:21.200
he had a Savior or Redeemer complex of wanting to be the teacher of mankind.

17:21.200 --> 17:28.200
And he got that idea from a fellow like Isaiah who said,

17:28.200 --> 17:35.200
Chimiceon et cetera, udvar elo y mi ruschalain, which means,

17:35.200 --> 17:41.200
from Zion will come light and God's word from Jerusalem.

17:41.200 --> 17:47.200
So, talking psychologically and not geographically,

17:47.200 --> 17:54.200
Freud is a domain of culture, which goes back to Jewish roots in that sense,

17:54.200 --> 17:57.200
and he continues to teach mankind.

17:57.200 --> 18:02.200
Now, what was he teaching about?

18:02.200 --> 18:08.200
In my readings of Freud, I've come to the conclusion that the most important subject

18:08.200 --> 18:15.200
is the word that you use in connection with La Ka, the fool there.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.200
So, it's about love.

18:18.200 --> 18:24.200
The basic message of Freud is about love, but he was shy about it,

18:24.200 --> 18:32.200
and his shyness comes through in the essay called Civilization and its Discontense.

18:32.200 --> 18:40.200
He cannot quite understand altruism of St. Francis or what love is about.

18:40.200 --> 18:47.200
But if you read early Freud, if you go to an essay about which I wrote a number of papers now,

18:47.200 --> 18:55.200
from 1905, which was written in 1892, which is before he was an analyst.

18:55.200 --> 19:01.200
He talks there about love and hate and envy.

19:01.200 --> 19:07.200
By the way, apropos Yiddish, his mother spoke Yiddish all her life to Freud.

19:07.200 --> 19:12.200
So, he understood it very well and maybe spoke back too.

19:12.200 --> 19:17.200
She died in 1930, and there is a famous photograph of him with his mother,

19:17.200 --> 19:21.200
and you can see that Freud is a mama's boy.

19:21.200 --> 19:28.200
So, he knew about love from the first teacher of love, which is the mother.

19:28.200 --> 19:36.200
Now, the place where he talks about love explicitly is in his letter to Einstein.

19:36.200 --> 19:43.200
Einstein asked him, Dr. Freud, the great psychologist of our time,

19:43.200 --> 19:47.200
what can you give us as an advice to end war?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.200
And that is the essay Why War?

19:50.200 --> 19:58.200
And Freud says, increase errors in the platonic sense as well of non-sexual love,

19:58.200 --> 20:01.200
but love writ large.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.200
So, there is explicit.

20:04.200 --> 20:13.200
Now, since we are talking about education, he said there are two impossible professionals,

20:13.200 --> 20:16.200
teaching and psychoanalysis.

20:16.200 --> 20:24.200
So, the educational aspect of psychoanalysis has not been stressed enough in our writings.

20:24.200 --> 20:31.200
It's not just the hard-wiring of the brain for learning, but the learning experience

20:31.200 --> 20:38.200
that the analyst is really a teacher to his patient as well as to society.

20:38.200 --> 20:42.200
So, again, what does the analyst teach?

20:42.200 --> 20:47.200
What the mother teaches the child when he still doesn't know how to talk?

20:47.200 --> 20:52.200
The mother is a teacher of love and language.

20:52.200 --> 20:58.200
We have the broker center in the brain, but if it's not stimulated by a relationship

20:58.200 --> 21:02.200
of the mother who teaches, the child will not speak.

21:02.200 --> 21:07.200
And the wild children of a home are the proof of that,

21:07.200 --> 21:15.200
that children in the wild who are not taught language cannot learn at any time again.

21:15.200 --> 21:24.200
So, if the Freud is a teacher who is wanting to teach mankind love,

21:24.200 --> 21:31.200
the analyst in his profession is also teaching the patient how to love.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.200
And here I would say, I would say, Erich Fromme made an important contribution

21:36.200 --> 21:38.200
in the art of loving.

21:38.200 --> 21:44.200
And you teach sites from Deuteronomy, from the Book of Moses,

21:44.200 --> 21:48.200
love your neighbor like yourself.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.200
Why like yourself?

21:51.200 --> 21:57.200
Because if you do not love yourself, you cannot love another person.

21:57.200 --> 22:04.200
You will not understand a gesture of love if you don't have the love in you.

22:04.200 --> 22:08.200
There are many disappointments in love, of course.

22:08.200 --> 22:17.200
But the connection between healthy self-love and love of the other is very important.

22:17.200 --> 22:22.200
What do you need to have that love your neighbor like you love yourself?

22:22.200 --> 22:30.200
Basically, it's also hardwired and God-given if somebody doesn't destroy it.

22:30.200 --> 22:35.200
So the child has an instinct to love and the mother has an instinct to give love.

22:35.200 --> 22:40.200
And I'm always surprised that people like Margaret Mahler,

22:40.200 --> 22:44.200
who is very eloquent about the mother-child relationship,

22:44.200 --> 22:47.200
never mentioned the word love in it.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.200
I heard the other day, a lecture by Beatrice Beebe,

22:50.200 --> 22:55.200
who was a wonderful researcher of the maternal child infant tie,

22:55.200 --> 22:58.200
but she also didn't use the word love.

22:58.200 --> 23:03.200
It's all about rapprochement, about closeness or things like that,

23:03.200 --> 23:08.200
but love is the essential ingredient in that relationship.

23:08.200 --> 23:13.200
So I want to make my final point by juxtaposing it to what's the malays.

23:13.200 --> 23:21.200
We are, as people today, under the influence of monotechnology,

23:21.200 --> 23:27.200
we are now texting and texting instead of talking to each other.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.200
This is a deficiency of love.

23:29.200 --> 23:40.200
And in Boston, the IPA in July, there was a very good talk by Chris Bolas

23:40.200 --> 23:46.200
about the decline of love in society, which is al-Malays,

23:46.200 --> 23:51.200
that the religious have become so artificial through technology

23:51.200 --> 23:55.200
that people don't face each other, they don't see each other,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.200
they don't touch each other.

23:58.200 --> 24:05.200
The opposite of love is hate-print, and the opposite of good is evil.

24:05.200 --> 24:12.200
And Freud was concerned with evil after, during and after World War I,

24:12.200 --> 24:16.200
and he wrote about it and used the word evil.

24:16.200 --> 24:20.200
So what is the evil in our time?

24:20.200 --> 24:23.200
In one sense, it's lovelessness, and in another sense,

24:23.200 --> 24:27.200
it's a rise of violence as a mode of being.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.200
And this is what we now see worldwide.

24:30.200 --> 24:35.200
After two wars, which should have taught us, the end-to-end-all wars,

24:35.200 --> 24:41.200
we are here involved in a global chronic warfare.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
We've lived now through the crisis in France,

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
we've just had here a shooting the other day in California,

24:47.200 --> 24:52.200
we are really involved in the evil of violence.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.200
And here is something that we can transmit as a message,

24:55.200 --> 24:58.200
but to achieve it takes a lot of work.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.200
Thank you.

25:00.200 --> 25:06.200
APPLAUSE

25:12.200 --> 25:19.200
Well, after what my colleagues have already said,

25:19.200 --> 25:26.200
I want to emphasize, especially one point,

25:26.200 --> 25:40.200
that is that Freud reintroduced in our modern culture,

25:40.200 --> 25:43.200
in the cultural modernity.

25:48.200 --> 25:52.200
What ancient Greeks?

25:52.200 --> 26:00.200
What was for ancient Greeks obvious,

26:00.200 --> 26:11.200
that the relation to knowledge was linked by love?

26:11.200 --> 26:21.200
We had to wait 2,500 years if we refer to

26:21.200 --> 26:23.200
Plato's symposium.

26:23.200 --> 26:40.200
We had to wait 200, 500 years to allow Freud to say that

26:40.200 --> 26:48.200
transference love was the basis of any kind of relationship.

26:48.200 --> 26:56.200
And it was the basis of education.

26:58.200 --> 27:02.200
The ancient Greeks knew that,

27:02.200 --> 27:08.200
and we have all testimonies of this fact.

27:08.200 --> 27:14.200
Love, transference love,

27:14.200 --> 27:22.200
which Freud sized with his encounter of hysteria,

27:22.200 --> 27:25.200
of hysterical patience,

27:25.200 --> 27:32.200
these recognitions of transference love,

27:32.200 --> 27:45.200
and he extended it to all the mankind relationship.

27:45.200 --> 27:51.200
So we are in depth to lackum,

27:51.200 --> 28:01.200
to identify the structure of what is the stick

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
of transference love.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
A marvelous object,

28:06.200 --> 28:15.200
the marvelous object that El Cebiades has seen in Socratic,

28:15.200 --> 28:23.200
and lackum in his seminar transference,

28:23.200 --> 28:30.200
tried to demonstrate that this marvelous object

28:30.200 --> 28:34.200
is the object of the fantasy.

28:34.200 --> 28:42.200
And when you are not able,

28:42.200 --> 28:46.200
after psychoanalyzes,

28:46.200 --> 28:50.200
to understand, to realize that,

28:50.200 --> 28:55.200
you can, I just want to make here,

28:55.200 --> 29:00.200
I just want to quote what El Cebiades said

29:00.200 --> 29:03.200
to, in the symposiums.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
Excuse me.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.200
El Cebiades said

29:18.200 --> 29:31.200
that when he saw what Socratic receives,

29:31.200 --> 29:35.200
the Agarma, the marvelous object he receives,

29:35.200 --> 29:39.200
he said,

29:39.200 --> 29:45.200
there is, there remained only one thing to do,

29:45.200 --> 29:50.200
as soon as possible, by quickest means,

29:50.200 --> 29:55.200
do whatever Socratic commands.

29:59.200 --> 30:06.200
This type of submission to the one

30:06.200 --> 30:12.200
who is supposed to receive the precious object

30:12.200 --> 30:17.200
which is supposed to know,

30:26.200 --> 30:38.200
to know what is the knowledge

30:38.200 --> 30:46.200
that can be a total submission with no division,

30:46.200 --> 30:56.200
and the psychoanalyzes is able to avoid for a subject,

30:56.200 --> 31:00.200
to be in that kind of position.

31:00.200 --> 31:05.200
That means that kind of submission we can find,

31:05.200 --> 31:13.200
in the relationship to a leader, to a fume,

31:13.200 --> 31:20.200
or also to a text with a T capital,

31:20.200 --> 31:23.200
revealed or not revealed.

31:23.200 --> 31:28.200
I would like to emphasize also that,

31:28.200 --> 31:31.200
after the exchange of this morning,

31:31.200 --> 31:37.200
that the new type of terrorism,

31:37.200 --> 31:45.200
which surge from the last decades,

31:45.200 --> 31:50.200
is part of our civilization.

31:50.200 --> 31:57.200
I think our mass civilization is a civilization

31:57.200 --> 32:07.200
of enjoyment, and there is an enjoyment

32:07.200 --> 32:12.200
for those people, what,

32:12.200 --> 32:21.200
terrorists who are ready to kill and to be killed,

32:21.200 --> 32:25.200
an enjoyment of the nothing,

32:25.200 --> 32:30.200
of the nephew, and I want to emphasize this point,

32:30.200 --> 32:35.200
because there is a market of enjoyment,

32:35.200 --> 32:40.200
but how can we understand that young people

32:40.200 --> 32:44.200
who are not Muslim, in France,

32:44.200 --> 32:50.200
young people can be seduced

32:50.200 --> 32:57.200
by the way we know the social networks,

32:57.200 --> 33:04.200
internet, can be seduced by this kind of enjoyment,

33:04.200 --> 33:12.200
which is a kind of enjoyment of the knee,

33:12.200 --> 33:19.200
and that we can refer to the death drive,

33:19.200 --> 33:34.200
that Freud discovered and emphasized in civilization

33:34.200 --> 33:38.200
in this content.

33:38.200 --> 33:48.200
I think, from a point out that this kind of death drive,

33:48.200 --> 33:56.200
is what later on, like we call,

33:56.200 --> 34:06.200
Jewishness, enjoyment, and the enjoyment of the nothing,

34:06.200 --> 34:12.200
of the knee hill, is the expression,

34:12.200 --> 34:20.200
in our world today of the death drive.

34:20.200 --> 34:24.200
Okay, I will stop there.

34:24.200 --> 34:28.200
I have a couple of questions, but let's hear from Ernie.

34:28.200 --> 34:34.200
Well, I'm a late arrival and a semi-volunteer in this chair,

34:34.200 --> 34:40.200
and I anticipate having a certain amount of negative response

34:40.200 --> 34:44.200
to whatever I have to say, because I'm generally regarded

34:44.200 --> 34:50.200
as first of all too provocative,

34:50.200 --> 34:53.200
and secondly too incomprehensible,

34:53.200 --> 34:57.200
and then there are a few other problems about me,

34:57.200 --> 35:01.200
but I'll do my best to try to put my thoughts into a form

35:01.200 --> 35:04.200
which at least you'll be able to follow me,

35:04.200 --> 35:07.200
and whether you agree or not.

35:07.200 --> 35:15.200
The first thought is that participating in a group like this,

35:15.200 --> 35:22.200
whether you call it pigeon or whether you call it the tower of babble,

35:22.200 --> 35:27.200
there is always a very individual quality

35:27.200 --> 35:30.200
to the way that the speakers look at things,

35:30.200 --> 35:36.200
and the connection and so forth.

35:36.200 --> 35:46.200
As with art criticism or analysis of confidential spy data, et cetera,

35:46.200 --> 35:49.200
it requires a lot of translation,

35:49.200 --> 35:54.200
and as we all know, a translation is never really truly faithful

35:54.200 --> 36:00.200
to the original meaning or the original intent of the persons who are speaking,

36:00.200 --> 36:04.200
and of course we also realize that the original intent

36:04.200 --> 36:10.200
and the original meaning is not really something that can be closely defined,

36:10.200 --> 36:15.200
because meanings are very multiple, and the words have different meanings.

36:15.200 --> 36:20.200
Sometimes identical words in different contexts have opposite meanings.

36:20.200 --> 36:26.200
Freud, one of the things of course that Freud imposed upon us

36:26.200 --> 36:30.200
the following directions was, generations was,

36:30.200 --> 36:37.200
the understanding, and to some extent, the even more than intellectual understanding,

36:37.200 --> 36:44.200
of the fact that in our minds, things are going on constantly,

36:44.200 --> 36:50.200
which are mutually contradictory, which are not even sequentially satisfiable,

36:50.200 --> 36:53.200
and which are not necessarily definable.

36:53.200 --> 36:58.200
And this situation of course also exists in other elements,

36:58.200 --> 37:02.200
in other branches of knowledge. For instance, current physics,

37:02.200 --> 37:07.200
which is supposed to be an experimental field,

37:07.200 --> 37:12.200
has one theory, which is not very popular anymore,

37:12.200 --> 37:16.200
string theory, for which there's no possible experiment.

37:16.200 --> 37:22.200
Nobody can figure out how you can do an experiment to support it or not support it.

37:22.200 --> 37:26.200
There's a nice interesting book by a very charming

37:26.200 --> 37:30.200
and delightful author named George Muster,

37:30.200 --> 37:36.200
who takes up again the problem of mechanics

37:36.200 --> 37:44.200
in terms of the Newtonian physics, the pinball,

37:44.200 --> 37:52.200
or the, what is it that you play with it?

37:52.200 --> 37:56.200
With the eight billiards.

37:56.200 --> 38:00.200
Everything happens by contact. One particle gets,

38:00.200 --> 38:04.200
hits another particle and it beards up, etc., etc.,

38:04.200 --> 38:10.200
versus what is the, how do you then account for the attraction of gravity

38:10.200 --> 38:15.200
or the appearance of ripples on the water

38:15.200 --> 38:21.200
or static electricity, etc.

38:21.200 --> 38:27.200
Which seems to operate at a distance. So we have no solution to this.

38:27.200 --> 38:31.200
There are many other things that we are interested in knowing

38:31.200 --> 38:34.200
about, about which we have no solution.

38:34.200 --> 38:39.200
As a matter of fact, if you draw a list of opposites, like reality

38:39.200 --> 38:45.200
and fantasy, how does reality, how do they connect,

38:45.200 --> 38:50.200
how do they integrate if they integrate? If you take Charlie Brenner's idea

38:50.200 --> 38:55.200
about everything as a compromise formation, well, how does that take place?

38:55.200 --> 39:01.200
All it is, is another way of saying something that we really have known for a long time,

39:01.200 --> 39:05.200
that a lot of different factors, inclinations, forces, etc.,

39:05.200 --> 39:12.200
mechanics go into every act that we commit, and we don't know all of what's going on.

39:12.200 --> 39:17.200
So you cover it with a piece of language

39:17.200 --> 39:24.200
which may satisfy some people that now we know something more than we knew before,

39:24.200 --> 39:27.200
but generally I wouldn't say that's the truth.

39:27.200 --> 39:31.200
I mean, a whole list while I was talking here of these things.

39:31.200 --> 39:35.200
We have Naturvissenschaft and we have Geistus Visenschaft.

39:35.200 --> 39:42.200
Naturvissenschaft is supposed to be the experimental learning about the real world.

39:42.200 --> 39:48.200
The Geistus Visenschaft is supposed to be the study of human relationships

39:48.200 --> 39:52.200
and psychology and anthropology and so forth.

39:52.200 --> 39:55.200
This is like what's the brain and what's the mind?

39:55.200 --> 40:00.200
Well, we have a mind, and what the mind is is something which we look at,

40:00.200 --> 40:04.200
the brain from a certain point of view, and the brain is something which we look at

40:04.200 --> 40:09.200
with our minds from a point of view, but how do they connect?

40:09.200 --> 40:13.200
Well, we're in the dark ages.

40:13.200 --> 40:19.200
Similarly, secondary process and primary process.

40:19.200 --> 40:27.200
The original problem that Freud solved with the topographic theory is still a problem.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.200
We still have a problem with the topographic theory.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.200
How does the unconscious become unconscious?

40:31.200 --> 40:33.200
How does the unconscious become conscious?

40:33.200 --> 40:38.200
What about the unconscious, which was never conscious, et cetera, et cetera?

40:38.200 --> 40:43.200
We haven't any really satisfactory answers to that question.

40:43.200 --> 40:51.200
OK, I just want to tell you the name of the book by George Muster is

40:51.200 --> 40:54.200
Spooky Activity at a Distance.

40:54.200 --> 41:00.200
It's a charming book, and I recommended it to you.

41:00.200 --> 41:06.200
Then we have the question of language, which this gentleman brought up.

41:06.200 --> 41:14.200
What is the connection between Chomsky's deep language, which is supposedly a

41:14.200 --> 41:20.200
neurological development, which takes place at approximately the same age in every human being

41:20.200 --> 41:27.200
all over the world, and the language which we learn, like English or Yiddish or whatever it is,

41:27.200 --> 41:32.200
and how is one communicate with the other and go together with the other?

41:32.200 --> 41:41.200
It has a law of cause and effect, which we regard as a sort of sacrosanct,

41:41.200 --> 41:46.200
at least insofar as the fact that the cause has to proceed the effect.

41:46.200 --> 41:51.200
This is also part of what apparently appears as part of the deep language,

41:51.200 --> 41:57.200
the difference between a verb and a noun and what's acted on and what's acting,

41:57.200 --> 42:02.200
which seems to just appear in a certain way, everywhere.

42:02.200 --> 42:07.200
Anyway, so I think we have a lot of problems.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.200
There's a lot we don't know.

42:09.200 --> 42:15.200
When it comes to social problems, let's say, in the Gastis Visinschaft,

42:15.200 --> 42:19.200
if you look at the history of the world in the last hundred years,

42:19.200 --> 42:22.200
you wouldn't say that it's been very tranquil.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.200
We've had a world of one, a world of two,

42:25.200 --> 42:31.200
we've had multiplication of populations which have been enormous

42:31.200 --> 42:36.200
and beyond the capacity of countries to deal with and to manage.

42:36.200 --> 42:41.200
We've had migrations of peoples which were very interesting to Tolstoy

42:41.200 --> 42:47.200
when he wrote about the Napoleonic War in Russia.

42:47.200 --> 42:52.200
How does it happen that these masses of people get up and they go and they invade it,

42:52.200 --> 42:54.200
they move and what does this?

42:54.200 --> 42:57.200
What is the aura of a leader?

42:57.200 --> 43:02.200
How does Hitler get to be loved by hundreds of millions of people?

43:02.200 --> 43:05.200
And he was loved by hundreds of millions of people.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.200
They followed him and they did everything.

43:07.200 --> 43:13.200
What kind of communication is involved from him to somebody else?

43:13.200 --> 43:21.200
And what language is it that he is speaking when he communicates his enthusiasm and his aura?

43:21.200 --> 43:23.200
There's so many things we don't know.

43:23.200 --> 43:27.200
So we're in a great situation, let's say, of ignorance.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.200
And nobody likes to be ignorant and everybody likes to think.

43:31.200 --> 43:35.200
They know and they want to know what's going to happen next,

43:35.200 --> 43:39.200
whether it's in the stock market or whether it's their children and grandchildren,

43:39.200 --> 43:44.200
and they want to make sure that things go sort of the way that it wants to do.

43:44.200 --> 43:48.200
But they have no way of knowing what the next cataclysm is going to be.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.200
And they're somewhere in their minds they're aware of.

43:51.200 --> 43:56.200
Now, two years ago, I didn't wake up one morning,

43:56.200 --> 44:00.200
but I woke up six weeks later in a hospital.

44:00.200 --> 44:07.200
And the thing was that my dog found me lying on the floor in the bathroom in Florida

44:07.200 --> 44:09.200
where we were living.

44:09.200 --> 44:13.200
And I was whisked off to a nearby emergency room

44:13.200 --> 44:18.200
and where my stopped heart was revived and so forth.

44:18.200 --> 44:23.200
And people operated on me and did this and that and so forth.

44:23.200 --> 44:28.200
But I missed six weeks of life.

44:28.200 --> 44:33.200
And by the time I came back, there was such a delirium that I didn't know where I was,

44:33.200 --> 44:35.200
or what was happening on it.

44:35.200 --> 44:40.200
And I had the most mysterious hallucinations and complicated stories

44:40.200 --> 44:45.200
which actually would be very interesting to make into some fiction.

44:45.200 --> 44:53.200
But I had no pre-monition about this and the doctors didn't tell me that there was something wrong.

44:53.200 --> 45:00.200
But it made a significant difference in my life to the extent that post-traumatic stress disorder

45:00.200 --> 45:03.200
is not something that I can just say.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.200
I know about and so on.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.200
I'll tell you something else.

45:09.200 --> 45:12.200
About the effect of the war.

45:12.200 --> 45:17.200
I was born in Vienna and at a certain point my family moved to New York.

45:17.200 --> 45:22.200
There were many anxious days between 1932 when I was born

45:22.200 --> 45:26.200
and the end of 1938 when we arrived in New York.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.200
And many people were lost to me.

45:29.200 --> 45:32.200
My original language was lost to me.

45:32.200 --> 45:39.200
Many foods, ayes, aromas, all kinds of things disappeared.

45:39.200 --> 45:43.200
And I came to a country in which I was hardly welcome,

45:43.200 --> 45:48.200
which was in the throes of a depression, which had a population,

45:48.200 --> 45:55.200
which was hardly at all eager to get involved with the miserable affairs of Europe

45:55.200 --> 46:00.200
for which the Europeans were blamed or the Jews were blamed to some extent.

46:00.200 --> 46:03.200
So it was a difficult time.

46:03.200 --> 46:09.200
The result of this was significantly, if I look back on it,

46:09.200 --> 46:16.200
that it had a profound effect on my character, my personality, my choice of profession, whatever it is.

46:16.200 --> 46:21.200
First, because of the relic of the central European background I had.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.200
And Freud was a friend of my family.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.200
So I heard, oh, Freud, oh, Freud, Freud, oh, my life.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.200
So I thought he was a kind of interesting guy.

46:29.200 --> 46:36.200
And he belonged to the Knai Brif, of which my great grandfather was the general secretary.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.200
And so I called on it.

46:38.200 --> 46:45.200
And then somebody told me, with psychoanalysis, you can make people better than they were before they got sick.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.200
And I thought that was great.

46:47.200 --> 46:49.200
So that was the relics of the past.

46:49.200 --> 46:53.200
But there are also relics of the traumatic aspects of it,

46:53.200 --> 47:00.200
which, like, certainly aggravated by this health problem that I had a couple of years ago.

47:00.200 --> 47:06.200
But if you want to understand psychology and really approach group psychology,

47:06.200 --> 47:13.200
and first of all, the group is made up of people who feel that they have some similarity.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.200
That there's some kind of chemistry, that there's some kind of unity,

47:17.200 --> 47:22.200
that there's some kind of safety in something which is like an extension of a family.

47:22.200 --> 47:23.200
Or a tribe.

47:23.200 --> 47:24.200
Or a nation.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.200
Or a religion.

47:25.200 --> 47:30.200
So there are these attracting qualities.

47:30.200 --> 47:36.200
And then there is the definition of what one is is by what one is not.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
Hi, Ericsson.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.200
There was a son of a senator.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
Shasta?

47:40.200 --> 47:44.200
You don't have to stop, and you were understandable.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
It wasn't.

47:45.200 --> 47:49.200
You started by introducing your comments and you're not usually understandable.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
I think you were...

47:50.200 --> 47:51.200
The relevance.

47:51.200 --> 47:53.200
You were only understandable whether...

47:53.200 --> 47:54.200
But the relevance.

47:54.200 --> 47:59.200
I agreed with everything you said, I don't know.

47:59.200 --> 48:01.200
Do you want to respond to something you said?

48:01.200 --> 48:04.200
Yeah, I want to pick up at one point that Ernie, that you made.

48:04.200 --> 48:07.200
First of all, your background is fascinating.

48:07.200 --> 48:12.200
Coming from Vienna and all these connections and the immigration and everything.

48:12.200 --> 48:15.200
I mean, you should write a memoir about yourself.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.200
He's brilliant.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.200
Okay.

48:17.200 --> 48:24.200
But I want to pick up on what you mentioned is Freud's essay of 1921.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.200
Group psychology and also the ego.

48:26.200 --> 48:32.200
It's crucial to understand the dynamics of what's going with the jihadists today.

48:32.200 --> 48:38.200
To understand this even better, you should also know what Stalin and Hitler did with their

48:38.200 --> 48:43.200
youth in Russia, in the Soviet Union, in Germany.

48:43.200 --> 48:52.200
They both made an appeal to the young to leave their families and give their allegiance to the leader.

48:52.200 --> 48:57.200
Stalin did that and Hitler did that too with the Hitler you went.

48:57.200 --> 49:03.200
He said, and he made them swear allegiance to him with the Hitler-eyed.

49:03.200 --> 49:10.200
So the point that Freud made in this essay is what is the role of the leader and the masters?

49:10.200 --> 49:12.200
Why is the leader attractive?

49:12.200 --> 49:15.200
Number one, he gives them love.

49:15.200 --> 49:21.200
And number two, he gives them absolution from doing evil because he takes on their conscience

49:21.200 --> 49:27.200
and says, I am the leader of your conscience and I permit you to kill in the name of whatever

49:27.200 --> 49:29.200
you choose to kill.

49:29.200 --> 49:35.200
And the same thing happened with Mao Zedong and the revolution of the Red Revolution in

49:35.200 --> 49:36.200
China.

49:36.200 --> 49:42.200
And there was always a transition from the traditional family, from the traditional society

49:42.200 --> 49:47.200
to the new leader who promises them paradise.

49:47.200 --> 49:54.200
Well, if I may answer this, you omit the context in which these things take place.

49:54.200 --> 50:03.200
The context in which Hitler promoted this idea was betrayal in the First World War and so on

50:03.200 --> 50:06.200
and so forth.

50:06.200 --> 50:11.200
And the first of the Germans and the terrible Versailles Treaty and revenge and of course

50:11.200 --> 50:16.200
this happened after the end of the First World War in the Treaty of Versailles.

50:16.200 --> 50:22.200
The French and the British couldn't stop the war because they were so busy negotiating

50:22.200 --> 50:27.200
about which parts of the Ottoman Empire they would take over at the end of the war.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.200
So and the French wanted revenge.

50:30.200 --> 50:33.200
And well, let me go on just a second.

50:33.200 --> 50:40.200
And I've been watching the television series that somebody made about the Second World

50:40.200 --> 50:48.200
War and the same methods are used to make killers out of our Marine Corps or out of our army

50:48.200 --> 50:52.200
as were used by Hitler.

50:52.200 --> 50:58.200
And one of the men says, well, when I enlisted I really didn't understand how you could kill.

50:58.200 --> 51:02.200
But they trained us to kill, they trained us to kill, but it wasn't until I got to

51:02.200 --> 51:09.200
Taurawa, the Japanese island which was captured with great difficulty, when I saw that my

51:09.200 --> 51:15.200
buddies who were captured by the Japanese were tortured and their genitals were stuffed in their mouth.

51:15.200 --> 51:20.200
Then I said, I'm going to kill and I'm going to kill every day.

51:20.200 --> 51:23.200
I won't stop until it's done.

51:23.200 --> 51:28.200
I think you make a good point, which is what I was trying to get on when I made my introductory comments.

51:28.200 --> 51:33.200
You can train people to do evil things.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.200
But then evil in their minds.

51:35.200 --> 51:39.200
Well, in the context of I'm defending my country and not everything.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.200
Well, that's part of the training. In other words, you can use various...

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
Well, it's also part of the reality.

51:44.200 --> 51:49.200
It was real that Hitler was going to take over and that you would be under a dictatorship

51:49.200 --> 51:53.200
which was cruel, sadistic and so forth.

51:53.200 --> 51:57.200
I understand that, but what I'm trying to say is that there is something about the way

51:57.200 --> 52:03.200
the mind is or the brain is that you can actually train it to do things that you would imagine

52:03.200 --> 52:06.200
normally that person would do one of them.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.200
But not without killing.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.200
And the normal reality.

52:10.200 --> 52:15.200
But the reality is not normal. You need an abnormal reality in order to carry that out.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.200
Like the Germans needed an abnormal reality in Germany.

52:18.200 --> 52:24.200
I know this chaotic structure of depression, hunger, out of work, etc.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.200
They needed that.

52:25.200 --> 52:31.200
I don't dispute the context, which is why I said there are other factors involved in what's going on now

52:31.200 --> 52:36.200
and there have always been other factors involved, whether they were economic, social, whatever.

52:36.200 --> 52:39.200
You always have other factors involved.

52:39.200 --> 52:45.200
But I'm a little bit concerned about two things that the two of you talked about, which is this business

52:45.200 --> 52:55.200
that in a way Freud created this duality between libido and aggression or love and aggression.

52:55.200 --> 53:03.200
But things are not that simple because Freud also introduced the concept of ambivalence.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.200
So when you talk about...

53:05.200 --> 53:07.200
It comes from Bloyler.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.200
Fine. It comes from Bloyler.

53:09.200 --> 53:14.200
But that pertains more to a psychotic state than what the way Freud used it.

53:14.200 --> 53:20.200
But the concept... So it's not so simple that all you have to do is just to give love

53:20.200 --> 53:28.200
and it would stop the work of aggression because sometimes very aggressive acts are committed

53:28.200 --> 53:30.200
out of the person's sense of love.

53:30.200 --> 53:36.200
One of those is when at the end there are situations where a husband or a wife kills the other

53:36.200 --> 53:43.200
because she's the other in such distress or suffering or whatever that just commits

53:43.200 --> 53:45.200
to what we would consider an aggressive act.

53:45.200 --> 53:52.200
So it's not... I think to make it black and white today is a bit too simple.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.200
And I think that applies to this business of the death instinct.

53:56.200 --> 54:03.200
We can't just say, well, it's the death instinct that causes it.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.200
Because it explains nothing.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.200
It says nothing.

54:07.200 --> 54:10.200
First of all, we don't even know if it exists.

54:10.200 --> 54:16.200
But even if it exists, what causes it to do something at one point and not at another point

54:16.200 --> 54:18.200
is mysterious.

54:18.200 --> 54:23.200
So I think things are not as clear.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.200
I don't dispute the value of love.

54:26.200 --> 54:28.200
But...

54:28.200 --> 54:30.200
So what do you dispute?

54:30.200 --> 54:33.200
Well, I didn't...

54:33.200 --> 54:36.200
I was right when I said, I hope you hear...

54:36.200 --> 54:38.200
No, no, I agreed with what...

54:38.200 --> 54:44.200
I didn't say... I said... My idea about that, about the disparity between the two extremes,

54:44.200 --> 54:51.200
is that Freud pointed these out and he forced us in a certain way to look at them.

54:51.200 --> 54:56.200
And of course, he also pointed out that they were extremes in the unconscious...

54:56.200 --> 55:00.200
You know, what I said, opposites of Saint Laurent and so forth.

55:00.200 --> 55:02.200
But these are difficult.

55:02.200 --> 55:09.200
We float around in a land of a miasma of incomprehension.

55:09.200 --> 55:12.200
We don't understand where the universe came from.

55:12.200 --> 55:15.200
We can't really figure out about the black holes.

55:15.200 --> 55:26.200
We can't see why... reconcile what you call it, the relativity and the particle physics and so forth.

55:26.200 --> 55:31.200
Because this... the information we have...

55:31.200 --> 55:33.200
This is a piece of this piece of this.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.200
How does it fit together? We don't know.

55:35.200 --> 55:37.200
Now, does that make us happy?

55:37.200 --> 55:38.200
No.

55:38.200 --> 55:47.200
And the second thing is that we have all lived through times in which we have been traumatized.

55:47.200 --> 55:50.200
And it's not only being separated from the mother.

55:50.200 --> 55:56.200
It's not only from having no parents because half the population has been killed.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.200
It's not only that... that growth.

55:59.200 --> 56:04.200
Now we learn that... all right, also in smaller ways.

56:04.200 --> 56:10.200
You have an operation and you have a psychotic episode afterwards, right?

56:10.200 --> 56:14.200
After you recover. Once you've had that, you'll never forget it.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.200
I'm telling you...

56:16.200 --> 56:20.200
Once you've had a serious depression, you'll never forget that this happened to you.

56:20.200 --> 56:25.200
And it will make you continually somewhat apprehensive.

56:25.200 --> 56:29.200
Give him a chance, yeah.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.200
Love.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.200
Love.

56:32.200 --> 56:39.200
For... for... for Fred was first heroes.

56:39.200 --> 56:45.200
It's not love in general. It's... heroes.

56:45.200 --> 56:50.200
That means the problem... the problem is...

56:50.200 --> 56:58.200
Are we able to consider that... love...

56:58.200 --> 57:07.200
heroes... is linked with the knowledge?

57:07.200 --> 57:09.200
That is important.

57:09.200 --> 57:13.200
Point I would like to emphasize today.

57:13.200 --> 57:24.200
Because it is... what we can... we can... feel in our practice of psychoanalysis.

57:24.200 --> 57:35.200
But the patient, the love transference, is related to what the patient supposed.

57:35.200 --> 57:41.200
We know about his desire, about his unconscious.

57:41.200 --> 57:50.200
So this is not love in general and not... not only...

57:50.200 --> 57:57.200
mother's love, but love... that's called... heroes.

57:57.200 --> 58:02.200
In reference to... to God's heroes.

58:02.200 --> 58:10.200
Which was the little God who... who... who made difficulties to...

58:10.200 --> 58:12.200
everybody.

58:12.200 --> 58:20.200
So I think this is... I want to... to... to... to... to... to make a precision here.

58:20.200 --> 58:24.200
It's not love in general. We have to deal in psychoanalysis.

58:24.200 --> 58:28.200
We have to deal with love, hate and knowledge.

58:28.200 --> 58:36.200
And the difficulty is to link this... this... three... and on references.

58:36.200 --> 58:42.200
I think it would need a whole...

58:42.200 --> 58:57.960
...

58:57.960 --> 59:05.960
is now... we prefer to speak of sexuality or... everything, but love has become an obscene concept.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.960
It's very odd.

59:07.960 --> 59:08.960
A full-on of word.

59:08.960 --> 59:16.960
Exactly. But... what I wanted to say is that of course... it's very... very... things are very complicated.

59:16.960 --> 59:21.960
Because the young people, those young French or Belgian... who...

59:21.960 --> 59:27.960
... leave to go and be trained by Al-Qaeda and work with...

59:27.960 --> 59:32.960
... is this. They are also looking for love. They are looking for a family...

59:32.960 --> 59:36.960
... which will love them and invest them.

59:36.960 --> 59:41.960
The problem is that there is a kind of love... which is a total love...

59:41.960 --> 59:45.960
... which includes total submission to the object.

59:45.960 --> 59:50.960
And another kind of love... which is... a love with the capacity...

59:50.960 --> 59:56.960
... of keeping... a... his or her thinking process.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960
So the capacity to love, but to say no.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.960
That I will not do. I will not accept.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:10.960
And those two kinds of love are very different.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:17.960
I think if I didn't try to say that hatred is older than love...

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.960
He did. Yeah, this was an opinion.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.960
This was an opinion?

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.960
An opinion.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960
He said it's worse.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.960
It's an opinion. It's not a proved fact.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.960
Well, that's true of a lot of stuff.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.960
I want to respond to you, Marini.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:43.960
First of all, women understand love somewhat better than men.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
I don't know about this.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.960
It's an opinion.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.960
That was a proof.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.960
But the proof of it is in the symposium on love.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:59.960
In the symposium, Socrates finally goes to Dioteema...

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.960
... and says, teach us about it.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960
So that's a fact.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.960
Now, I wasn't offering a simple solution.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.960
Far from me, I was...

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.960
... an exciting Freud.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.960
I was trying to say this is the enormity of the problem.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.960
We are supposed to say something to UNESCO and the United Nations.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.960
So our job here is practical, not theoretical.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.960
I don't care much about Freud's theories.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960
I care about Freud's method, which is where it is.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.960
Now, from that point of view, we are now...

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.960
We have to solve many problems of mankind.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.960
We have to solve the problem of the Third World War...

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.960
... to do everything to avoid confrontations between the Soviets now, the Russians...

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:51.960
... and the Americans in a global confrontation, which is a very serious matter.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
And we have to take care of the environment.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.960
And we have to teach something, the world, about the lovelessness that there is...

01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.960
... and how to increase it.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:06.960
So these are all important educational tasks for somebody like ourselves, a psychoanalyst.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.960
I agree.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.960
I heard that a lot of young people in New York...

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:18.960
... I don't know if it's true from the States, because nowadays, because of the ease of communication...

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.960
... people from all over the country, all over the world, communicate with each other.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:29.960
But I heard a lot of young people, when there was the reaction to the events in Paris...

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.960
... a lot of people were very upset in this city.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.960
But a lot of young people said, how come nobody was upset...

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.960
... when just a few days or weeks before there was the event in Beirut...

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:50.960
... and nobody was upset when there was the plane crash in Egypt.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.960
And so, in a way, it continues to be a certain difference of reaction...

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.960
... over terrorist attacks that we are subjectively feel...

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.960
... in this current situation, which I think also needs explaining.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.960
No, no, I agree.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:15.960
And so, is it that you love the French more than you love the Egyptians...

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.960
... or the Russians or the people from Beirut?

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.960
No, there is a simpler explanation.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.960
It's what the journalists prepare for us to read.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:29.960
As far as I'm concerned, I feel compassion...

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.960
... and I feel moved by any violence anywhere in the world...

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.960
... where innocent people are killed.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:42.960
Whether it's Beirut, whether it's the West Bank, whether it's Israel, whether it's California...

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.960
... any such event is like John Don said, in for whom the bell tolls...

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.960
... the bell tolls for us, because we are now living in a global world.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960
Yeah, but you don't solve the problem, because what you are saying is...

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.960
... this is well, me, I'm the compassionate man.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.960
But the reality of it is that a majority of people in this city...

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.960
... that I know better than the rest of the country...

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.960
... reacted a lot more to the events in Paris...

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.960
... than they did to the other events.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.960
And same innocent people were killed.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.960
Yes.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.960
Well...

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960
Yes.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.960
You don't need my permission, not the teacher.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.960
I don't have to worry.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.960
You don't need my permission.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.960
Okay.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.960
I don't need it.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960
Yeah.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960
There we go.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.960
I had somebody mentioned the transference...

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960
... which would be hard not to hear, not to have mention.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.960
The interesting thing about the transference...

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.960
... about one of my analyses was...

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960
... I was a youthful and naive person at the time...

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.960
... and I said to my training analyst at that time...

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960
... Martin was Martin's dad.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.960
I said, Martin, you know...

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.960
... I know what you're like, because I can tell what you're like.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.960
You're quite moral and you're somewhat moralistic...

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.960
... and you're also diffident and shy.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960
And he said, that's transference.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960
I said, no, that's reality.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960
I really know that that's true.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.960
He says, that doesn't mean anything.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.960
Transference can be reality.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.960
Transference is the same as the reality.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.960
And after a long time, I came to the realization...

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.960
... that one of the things that we learned at the beginning...

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.960
... which was to adopt this very objective attitude...

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.960
... that the patient is looking out the window...

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.960
... and telling you what he sees...

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.960
... and the doctor is like a surgeon...

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960
... and he has a field in front of it...

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.960
... and he's not really involved with it...

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.960
... is wrong.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.960
That if you don't have a so-called, let's say...

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.960
... what do they call it?

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.960
Therapeutic relationship, which...

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.960
... people like Phyllis Greenacre said...

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.960
... goes back to infancy and the relationship will co-op.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960
And the relationship to the mother.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.960
If you don't have that, in reality in some way...

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.960
... there has to be some communication between you and the patient.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:23.960
And oftentimes, that is enhanced by your having had somewhat similar experiences.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.960
And when I was interviewed, it was at a time...

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.960
... when people thought the criteria for an analytic training...

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.960
... would be that the person was a literate, cultivated person.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.960
So people ask me, what are you reading now?

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.960
And they didn't want to know what I was reading...

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.960
... or chemistry, or Freud's Freud.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.960
They wanted to know what literature I was reading.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:55.960
And so the question of what do you know from life as you get older...

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.960
... and how does it add to your wisdom and your capacity to have a relationship with the patient...

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.960
... and understanding what the patient has to say is extremely important.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:12.960
So without a similarity of some kind, a shared experience...

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.960
... there's no transference that develops.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.960
And the person has to have a certain confidence.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960
So are you saying that's the...

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.960
... to understand it?

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.960
Are you saying that's the reason for the response different to the events in Paris...

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.960
... in Chiang La ChÃ©?

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:35.960
Yes, the people who you live with, who are on your block, who you see at the cafe...

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.960
... are more important to you. You have a connection with them.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.960
You already know each other in a certain way.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:47.960
And not only on a verbal basis, but you dance the same way French women can walk...

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.960
... in a way which is so wonderful that no other women can do it.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.960
I'm going to stop there reading the French women.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:01.960
Do you all want to say one last thing before I go to the audience?

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.960
But at the point that you raised earlier, we should have...

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:10.960
... psychoanalysts and volunteers to go to churches, to town meetings...

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.960
... to all kinds of groups and address these young people...

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.960
... and give them a different message and teach them something about it.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.960
This is what we should be doing.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.960
There are two points.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.960
I think you are two. Third, what a prophet.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:40.960
You are the prophet of the fact that there is no prophetess.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:52.960
Because at the end of the queue, he teaches to each of his analyzant...

01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:01.960
... the answer is no voice to answer his sufferings.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:05.960
And he has to do by himself.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.960
So you are true, it was a prophet.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
That's right.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.960
The second point, love.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:21.960
Love begins when I miss something...

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.960
... I don't know what.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.960
But it is sure that something very important...

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:40.960
... because with this loss, I begin to be a lover.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.960
I begin to know what is love.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:57.960
But if I meet the real object I lost...

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.960
... so begin hatred.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:14.960
So, too long, the best love is able to begin hatred.

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.960
And hatred, sorry.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.960
And it is true that truth...

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.960
... with this follow-up of us...

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.960
... that we are all human beings.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.960
He knew that.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.960
His best love is...

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.960
... where is the murders?

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.960
Like Moses.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.960
Like Moses. It is true.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.960
So I think we have a certain mind...

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.960
... when we speak about true love.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.960
Thank you.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.960
Love, ladies, give me a few of us.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.960
For you?

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.960
Maria?

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.960
Okay, questions.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.960
Same place.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960
Thank you.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:12.960
Reporting in the microphone.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.960
I'm wearing my belt.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.960
I'm wearing my belt.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.960
I'm wearing my belt.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.960
I'm wearing my belt.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.960
I'm wearing my belt.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.960
Well, we all know that it's possible to quote Freud on both sides...

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.960
... of probably every major question, including love.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.960
And while that's true, I would like to...

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:47.960
... disagree with my good friend, Svi, and say that the sort of angle he's taking...

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.960
... interpreting Freud is somewhat historic.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:56.960
First of all, factually Freud's relationship with his mother, we now know...

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.960
... his consensus was very problematic, if not traumatic.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.960
The whole idea of my golden siggie turns out to be a big myth.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:12.960
And as a result, he felt unlovable.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.960
He wrote that to Martha, and he wrote that to Yolm.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.960
And loving was very problematic for him.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.960
And to suggest...

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:30.960
... Freud said, yes, psychoanalysis is through love.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.960
By which I think he meant it was a cure through transference.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.960
But I think his letters to Roman Rolon, for example...

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.960
... go against what Svi was suggesting, namely that he thought love was the answer.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:53.960
I mean, he wrote to Rolon and said, well, this vision of universal love that you're promoting...

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.960
... he said, it's very beautiful.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:03.960
But he said, but as a Jew, with the history of my people, I simply can't agree with it or describe to it.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.960
I think the real text to look to, to try and decipher his position on love or an important text...

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.960
... is inhibition symptoms and anxiety.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.960
And there love comes up in the context of his discussion of helplessness.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:27.960
And he says, because we're born so helpless, we're dependent for an extraordinary long time...

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.960
... and love plays a bigger role for the human species than any other.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.960
So the need for love grows out of infantile helplessness.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:43.960
As does the need for religion, they both have the same source of infantile helplessness.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.960
So I think his position is, or the...

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:58.960
... and position is, that if the child with this need for love meets a good enough environment, the facilitating environment...

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.960
... they can overcome their omnipotence in a good enough way.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.960
And love in, what we call, healthy life, a lack of a better work.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:24.960
But if the child doesn't encounter a good enough facilitating environment, they don't resolve their need for omnipotence efficiently.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:32.960
And I think that's what really is totalitarianism, the fundamentalism, and the fascism.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.960
And their love is really based on...

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.960
... the model for love is the hypnotist.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.960
That the one is mesmerized by the love object and wants to become totally subservient to it.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:51.960
And then one last point to tie in the remarks about for its Judaism.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:15:01.960
I think if you can make a case that when Freud says, well, you know, I don't read the whole text, I'm not practicing jublah blah blah blah, what's left?

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.960
I think what's left for him is his identification with Moses.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.960
And identification with Moses in a particular sense.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.960
Moses was the iconic class, was the destroyer of idols, with the...

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.960
... Moses was involved in a particular illusion, like Freud later became involved there.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.960
And I think for him, that's what was fundamental.

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.960
And that's what allowed him to claim he was maybe the best Jew that ever existed.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.960
But then you have to...

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.960
... I have to point out something about the homo zed tradition.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.960
And Jan Osman has discussed this in length.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:51.960
That with the whole notion of the mosaic divide between the true gods and the false gods, critique became possible.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.960
Later science became possible.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.960
But also religious hatred and fundamentalism became possible.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.960
So there is a tremendous ambiguity in this identification with Moses.

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:16.960
It seems like it's absolutely necessary if one wants to be involved in the critique of idols, the destruction of illusion.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:28.960
But on the other hand, because there seems to be this divide between true and false gods, religious violence and hatred is also latent in it.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:41.960
Thank you.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.960
I'm Ed Robbins from New York.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:55.960
And just to add a little bit to what Joel was speaking about, that God in the Judeo-Christian tradition is seen as the totally other.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:06.960
And from that point of view, God can be hated as well as loved.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:15.960
And that often the equation is made between the mother as being the first Gansandere.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.960
They're totally different.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.960
And that in that sense that there is a total difference, there is a hatred that is appropriate.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.960
And I think it's why, and I would disagree with Z on this very much, that in several places Freud says,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.960
hatred is primary to love in humans.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:44.960
It's fundamental first, and love comes after that.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.960
Any other comments, questions?

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.960
Can I just... Yes.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.960
It's an answer to you.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:17.960
I think that when Freud says that hatred is primal, he really means that, of course, hatred must be primal because you have to recognize the other to be able to love him.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.960
Exactly.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:43.960
If you want to, I think Charles wanted to say, there is a proof of it when a boy, big boy, leaves with this mother.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.960
He doesn't know what is love.

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960
Maybe he's happy, maybe.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:53.960
But he doesn't know what is love about.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:02.960
He will begin always to hate her.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:14.960
And sometimes, at the end of this complicity is a treasure.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:29.960
So you know, effectively, that hatred, modile, la pÃ©zons mÃ©m de rabche, the presence of the object.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.960
Generates hatred.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:44.960
Ed Warbenz, I agree with you about that, Ed Warbenz.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.960
But there is...

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:59.960
You have to come to the...

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.960
Close London man.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:10.960
About this enjoyment of me here that you spoke about earlier in our civilization.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:20.960
I think you can elaborate.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:25.960
It's difficult. It needs time to elaborate that.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.960
I think this is the question.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:37.960
The problem is that, like I said, many young French people were not Muslims,

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:49.960
as being seduced by a kind of enjoyment shown on the social network, on the internet.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:54.960
And...

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:02.960
Adirate to Islam, but not really in a religious way.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:12.960
They want to participate through this kind of enjoyment, enjoyment, which is...

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:25.960
Which I try to explain by the enjoyment of the nihil, of the nothing, just the destruction.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:33.960
But not only a destruction. The people who killed the young French Muslims,

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:40.960
who killed the young French people, who were in the Bataclan.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:53.960
Some weeks before, they went to dance, to drink alcohol.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:03.960
They were not really... It's not really a kind of religious fanaticism.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.960
It's something more, or even something less. I don't know.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:14.960
But I speak on a French point of view.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:25.960
And what I'd say is that... Why are we most concerned about what happened in Paris,

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:31.960
and in Beirut, or in Chamecheque?

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:42.960
I think we are most concerned because French young people were not all ignorant,

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:53.960
who share until some weeks before they commit their crimes.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:23:07.960
We share with other young French people share the same way of enjoying.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:26.960
In a few weeks or few days, they became killers, and enjoy that.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:33.960
I think there is a market of enjoyment in our mass civilization.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:42.960
And this market of enjoyment is very polymorph.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.960
It's a protest.

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:53.960
And one of its form is this kind of nihilism.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:59.960
But it is always in our civilization.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:08.960
We don't have to think that there is a war between a civilization against another civilization.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.960
Like you said, we are a global world.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:18.960
I repeat it. I will repeat the accusation.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:24.960
At least among the militant Muslims who kill others and then kill themselves,

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:32.960
I would say there is a jouisance of the cruelty and the sadism.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.960
So this is the problem here.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:40.960
But I think when it comes to the French jihadi and the French killers,

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:43.960
they were also anti-Semitic.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.960
They were anti-Semitic.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.960
Well, not all.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.960
I'm not saying all.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:55.960
I'm not saying all but enough. So on the one hand, anti-Semitism plays a role.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.960
And I would say that from the vantage point of history,

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.960
the militant Muslims today are doing from the Catholic Church,

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.960
did in the Middle Ages with the Inquisition.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:15.960
And in that sense, there is a conflict between this conception and the civilized world.

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:23.960
I mean, it's complicated by the fact that the big powers are still warmongering

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:27.960
and arranging all kinds of proxy wars.

01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.960
But at least there is a certain consensus,

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.960
and I would like to mention one more element about Freud,

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.960
that he believed in the power of reason and the power of dialogue and negotiation.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.960
Which goes to the Lumiere, the enlightenment.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.960
And that aspect is also endangered today.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:57.960
That was your point where I am not speaking about what is happening in the Middle East.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:06.960
I'm speaking of the French situation, of the French young Muslims.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.960
And also the French young terrorists were not Muslim.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:16.960
And were educated.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:33.960
I think it's too easy to oppose Islam to a kind of radicalism of Islam to the rest of the civilized world.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.960
I'm talking about the militant Islam, I'm not talking about all of Islam.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.960
We were talking about what happened in Paris and Ed's asked why we were most concerned,

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:48.960
but what happened in Paris in Egypt.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:55.960
So I tried to give an answer, I don't pretend it's a good one.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.960
We have to discuss about that.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:08.960
But I would like to emphasize after the questions, the young lady has asked me,

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:13.960
that there is really a market of enjoyment.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:27.960
Charles Pigeon used to say that when you take drugs,

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:35.960
it's a kind of enjoyment who leads to death.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.960
Which leads to death?

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:55.960
Is it a real important difference between a young French American guy or girl

01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:03.960
who is a terrorist or who is a drug addict?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.960
There is also another thing I wanted to say.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:23.960
The problem, the hyper-nysis, the narcissism, the people in France and the former killing in November.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:33.960
The guy registered himself and with a record.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.960
You remember that?

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.960
It is the selfie, the narcissism.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:55.960
It's all part of the way the young terrorist, almost in France,

01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.960
try to exist.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.960
I don't know.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.960
It concerns psychoanalysts.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:17.960
I want to put in a word for something that in France is not always appreciated.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960
That is ego psychology.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:22.960
There is also maturation.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.960
I give you an example from my life.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.960
I have been with my wife for 62 years.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:34.960
Until she became demented, I did not realize how much I loved her.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.960
I didn't realize how much.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.960
Very significant.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.960
Second example.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:48.960
That has to do with, you have to be a little bit old.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:57.960
So something which at a certain point in life does not have a great significance.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:05.960
Like the death of somebody for a child, you can attribute the non-response to whatever you

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960
want.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.960
You can say it's denial or you can say whatever it is.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:17.960
But at a certain point, the guilt, the mourning, and also if you talk about survivor guilt,

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:23.960
you have to survive sometimes for quite a long time before you experience the guilt that you have for

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.960
surviving.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.960
It's not all narcissism or Jewish songs.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:36.960
It's also judgment and experience.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:42.960
It's also how human you are and how not human you are when you're an adolescent or a child.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:55.960
Last comment from Emil Malle, a static earlier.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:12.960
Before love in sequinaries, I think it's very interesting to have a comparison between sequinaries and the Bible and the Talmud.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:25.960
You will love your brother as yourself, but this is written after the biological signification of life.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:33.960
If you take the signification of life with Ka'an and Abel, there is a crime.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:42.960
If you take Abraham to see two brothers, it's like the ismail.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:50.960
If you take Joseph and the brothers, the brothers are against Joseph.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:51.960
What happens?

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.960
Why it is written after Chichaka Mohai?

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:58.960
You will love your brother.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.960
This is the symbolic law.

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:07.960
The symbolic law is coming after the Bologic Act.

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.960
This I think is very interesting.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:18.960
I think, and constantly, there is a Jewish heritage in the sequinaries of poet.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:30.960
I guess you won't need to keep saying you have to love your brother unless there was reason for it.

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.960
Thank you very much.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.960
Thank you.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:42.960
The next meeting is at the...

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.960
What is it now?

01:32:45.960 --> 01:33:01.960
How fast are you?
