00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay. The last session of today is on identity. And

00:15.920 --> 00:28.600
the participants for that are counterclockwise. No, clockwise. Clockwise, Charles Melman.

00:28.600 --> 00:47.400
It's your Whitbrook. I'm sorry, White Book. Then it is Anvido. Then...

00:47.400 --> 00:57.480
I will... I will... You are not on the list. And then it is Jean-Michel Gabbat, and then

00:57.480 --> 01:06.080
Marie Lyasens. Charles Melman is cheering the group, so he will be going.

01:06.080 --> 01:19.000
Putting on a metal room. It's how it moves. It's all the pain. It's so much weight.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.940
This is everything.dden up space. Or 16,000 meters, all the way around.

01:56.940 --> 02:24.540
I think I would rather speak in English.

02:24.540 --> 02:37.860
So, when I started to tackle the question of identity, of course identity is very linked

02:37.860 --> 02:46.460
to the question of education, because to be educated and to get a training in any sense

02:46.460 --> 02:53.940
to be trained, to be educated means that you need to have your own identity.

02:53.940 --> 03:02.500
But if not, then you are not educated, you become a clone.

03:02.500 --> 03:15.860
So how to tackle the question of identity, I chose three points, mainly subjectivity,

03:15.860 --> 03:31.340
secondly, what is the ability to say no, the ability to rebel and the ability to think.

03:31.340 --> 03:44.100
And the title of my paper is the very well-known sentence by Descartes, the past anniversary,

03:44.100 --> 03:52.660
I think that's identity.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.300
We were speaking of the terrorist attacks.

03:57.300 --> 04:05.460
When I started to think about this paper, what came to my mind was a book by a friend

04:05.460 --> 04:09.740
journalist whose name is Jean-Apsfeld.

04:09.740 --> 04:17.300
The book is translated in English and it's called A Season of Machate.

04:17.300 --> 04:29.700
And the book relates Jean-Apsfeld was very moved by the massacre of the two Tsis in Rwanda.

04:29.700 --> 04:37.020
So he wrote a first book and his second book, A Season of Machate.

04:37.020 --> 04:45.980
His book where he went for nearly six months and interviewed the killers.

04:45.980 --> 04:55.140
He interviewed those people who were good people, they were peasants, they had absolutely no

04:55.140 --> 04:56.640
hostility.

04:56.640 --> 05:07.700
But one day they were given orders that they had to kill their neighbors and friends from

05:07.700 --> 05:15.740
the morning, half past nine to four o'clock they had to take Machate and to kill.

05:15.740 --> 05:23.100
Fifty thousand Tsis were killed like that out of a population of 60,000, which is quite

05:23.100 --> 05:27.820
amazing, that took place in five weeks.

05:27.820 --> 05:37.180
So Jean-Apsfeld went to interview those killers and he is not a psycho analyst, he's a very

05:37.180 --> 05:39.660
good journalist.

05:39.660 --> 05:48.460
And he was struck himself by the fact that the discourse was absolutely concrete.

05:48.460 --> 05:53.020
There were no emotions, no affects.

05:53.020 --> 06:02.980
And he said a language without images, which for a analyst is very interesting because

06:02.980 --> 06:12.740
it's what we would call a language which is no more rooted in the drives and there's

06:12.740 --> 06:17.780
no formal regression possible, no images.

06:17.780 --> 06:22.020
No representations.

06:22.020 --> 06:32.180
And about from this book I went to, what came to my mind are two other books.

06:32.180 --> 06:44.380
One is Anna Arent, the banality of the evil, where she relates the trial of Aitman in Jerusalem.

06:44.380 --> 06:51.180
And he's also, it's not an emotive discourse.

06:51.180 --> 06:58.220
If you see the minutes of the trial, it's quite amazing.

06:58.220 --> 07:11.660
He relates and he said that he never imagined and he simply, he didn't seem guilty because

07:11.660 --> 07:21.660
he didn't want the shore to take place but he was just obeying orders.

07:21.660 --> 07:32.340
From that point, one can think what is exactly, there are people who don't want to think.

07:32.340 --> 07:42.860
So in the previous panel, somebody was, we were speaking of the love or the obedience

07:42.860 --> 07:48.220
to the leader, which is for me, it's not really love.

07:48.220 --> 07:59.380
It is, I love him, yes, but I stopped to think because he thinks for me and not thinking

07:59.380 --> 08:02.300
can be comfortable.

08:02.300 --> 08:10.380
Sometimes thinking is painful and not to have to think can be felt as comfortable.

08:10.380 --> 08:17.980
And that was one very crucial question when we think of terrorism, of attacks, of any

08:17.980 --> 08:27.460
kind, of those terrible social problems.

08:27.460 --> 08:38.340
The third thing is you all know, I imagine, the book of Stanley Milgram.

08:38.340 --> 08:48.700
Stanley Milgram is this professor of psychology who did this experiment.

08:48.700 --> 08:58.700
Maybe, if you don't know it, I can stop, I think everybody knows the experiment of

08:58.700 --> 08:59.700
Milgram.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.700
So I won't go.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.700
Just made a movie.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.100
Yes, yes, yes.

09:07.100 --> 09:17.620
So this shows that it's absolutely incredible how people who are intelligent, who are good

09:17.620 --> 09:33.660
people, who even can be smart, facing authority and even a totally vague authority can obey,

09:33.660 --> 09:39.780
that means stop thinking by your absence.

09:39.780 --> 09:43.140
They act, they simply act.

09:43.140 --> 09:54.340
So that put me to the conclusion and I will stop at that point that identity is based

09:54.340 --> 10:04.300
on the capacity of continue to think and to want to think, and specially, that means

10:04.300 --> 10:09.780
also the capacity to say no.

10:09.780 --> 10:18.660
Because if you think at one point you cannot always obey authority.

10:18.660 --> 10:27.220
So I think that Freud has two main papers on that question.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.780
One is the negation, of course.

10:29.780 --> 10:37.700
And the other one is the splitting of the ego in the defense process, where he shows very

10:37.700 --> 10:56.420
well that there are some, I forget the word, secretrés, scarves, there are some scars in

10:56.420 --> 11:01.460
the ego which will never, never heal.

11:01.460 --> 11:12.900
And this scarves in the ego is the part of the unconscious ego which will always be open

11:12.900 --> 11:15.740
at this scarves which will never heal.

11:15.740 --> 11:25.580
And that means that only working through constantly and trying to keep our thinking process alive

11:25.580 --> 11:43.540
is the only way to continue and not to be blind to what we are doing or not to do things

11:43.540 --> 11:49.020
that we wouldn't like to do but that we have the tendency.

11:49.020 --> 11:58.980
Because as it was said, evil is not outside, evil is in all of us and sadism is in all

11:58.980 --> 12:10.380
of us and we could all become killers.

12:10.380 --> 12:14.180
Thank you, thank you, Marina.

12:14.180 --> 12:20.020
Thanks a lot.

12:20.020 --> 12:44.180
Good evening.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.180
we afternoon

12:49.160 --> 12:49.680
The

12:52.320 --> 12:55.160
second morning I

12:57.380 --> 12:59.380

No

13:12.140 --> 12:46.920
It's

13:10.080 --> 13:12.140
Not

13:42.140 --> 14:09.580
commodity, sequ

14:39.580 --> 14:42.580
and support we set substitution.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.580
I am a philosopher who is a philosopher who is a remarkable.

14:50.580 --> 14:55.580
I am a former dezer of the law, a former dezer.

14:56.580 --> 15:04.580
I am a former dezer of the law, a former dezer of the law,

15:04.580 --> 15:09.580
a former dezer of the law, a former dezer of the law.

15:11.580 --> 15:15.580
Thank you very much for entering Dune.

15:16.580 --> 15:27.760
Let me say, in interaction, that it will trademarks his law as

15:28.580 --> 15:32.580
a progress IN this story,

15:32.580 --> 15:53.820
so that we don't even feel aiy

15:53.820 --> 16:03.820
exist, and flee from GET DOZ

16:03.820 --> 16:10.820
It is a very difficult proposition.

16:10.820 --> 16:15.820
It is a very crucial proposition.

16:15.820 --> 16:26.820
It can seem surprising that identity is regularly linked to a presentification sign of virility,

16:26.820 --> 16:32.820
whether it is manifested or it is the scar of this sacrifice.

16:32.820 --> 16:51.640
On the earlier day, the presence of virility,

16:51.820 --> 16:56.820
whether we are human, is calling out your spreads?

16:56.820 --> 17:00.600
One

17:00.600 --> 17:03.960
This is the

17:03.960 --> 17:07.400

18:20.460 --> 18:24.060
That's how she believed the person,

18:24.060 --> 18:27.060
who was the Bible,

18:27.060 --> 18:28.060
who said,

18:28.060 --> 18:33.060
a realistic road movie.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.260
A road movie.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.860
Road movie, road movie.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.260
Huh? Road movie, road movie.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.460
Road movie.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.460
Road movie.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.460
Road movie.

18:44.460 --> 18:48.460
A realistic road movie.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.460
She said,

18:49.460 --> 18:50.460
she said,

18:50.460 --> 18:51.460
for me now.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.460
Hmm?

18:52.460 --> 18:54.460
Lise von Rheelen.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.460
He said,

18:57.460 --> 19:00.460
two total shows.

19:00.460 --> 19:02.460
He said,

19:02.460 --> 19:04.460
the lesson,

19:04.460 --> 19:06.460
to the one who's

19:06.460 --> 19:07.460
a true

19:07.460 --> 19:08.460
and

19:08.460 --> 19:12.460
a message of energy.

19:12.460 --> 19:13.460
He said,

19:13.460 --> 19:14.460
the compliment of the film,

19:14.460 --> 19:15.460
he said,

19:15.460 --> 19:16.460
for the man,

19:16.460 --> 19:19.460
who knows the religion.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.460
Me okeun,

19:21.460 --> 19:23.460
the religion only brought

19:23.460 --> 19:25.460
in a catholic.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.460
And the pretense of text

19:26.460 --> 19:29.460
is the reference.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.460
I think it's a big thing,

19:30.460 --> 19:34.460
but it's a real thing.

19:34.460 --> 19:35.460
He said,

19:35.460 --> 19:36.460
the question is,

19:36.460 --> 19:38.460
how do you think

19:38.460 --> 19:41.460
of the consequences?

19:41.460 --> 19:45.460
Could some resale resort or

19:45.460 --> 19:48.460
to suburbia?

19:48.460 --> 19:55.460
Shall we try to translate?

19:55.460 --> 19:58.460
I didn't expect to translate.

19:58.460 --> 20:01.460
That would be difficult.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.460
Look,

20:03.460 --> 20:08.460
I will sum up because

20:08.460 --> 20:11.460
Schalman mostly a lot of very

20:11.460 --> 20:13.460
interesting things.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.460
Well, he started saying that

20:16.460 --> 20:22.460
we are all driven by an object,

20:22.460 --> 20:23.460
the object of our

20:23.460 --> 20:26.460
unconscious fantasy.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.460
And that, of course,

20:28.460 --> 20:31.460
that is unconscious

20:31.460 --> 20:34.460
and we are full of it without

20:34.460 --> 20:36.460
even knowing exactly where we

20:36.460 --> 20:39.460
are going and what we are

20:39.460 --> 20:41.460
thinking.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.460
I think this is very important.

20:44.460 --> 20:49.460
Now, he raises the question,

20:49.460 --> 20:53.460
when does that start?

20:53.460 --> 20:57.460
When do we start, finally,

20:57.460 --> 21:02.460
to really construct an identity,

21:02.460 --> 21:05.460
even if a huge part of our

21:05.460 --> 21:08.460
identity will always remain

21:08.460 --> 21:11.460
driven by something that we don't

21:11.460 --> 21:13.460
know?

21:13.460 --> 21:17.460
I couldn't answer to this question.

21:17.460 --> 21:19.460
I would rather say that I would

21:19.460 --> 21:22.460
put it around the adiabus complex

21:22.460 --> 21:27.460
or between three and four.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.460
I mean, around the construction

21:30.460 --> 21:34.460
of the superego.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.460
And a superego, which, of course,

21:37.460 --> 21:40.460
is rooted deeply into the

21:40.460 --> 21:42.460
id.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.460
I would put it like that.

21:45.460 --> 21:49.460
And finally,

21:49.460 --> 21:54.460
Schal, talk about the

21:54.460 --> 22:01.460
three monotheistic religions

22:01.460 --> 22:04.460
saying that what is very different

22:04.460 --> 22:08.460
is that choral is considered to be

22:08.460 --> 22:14.460
directly written or dictated by God.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.460
And what I understand is the

22:17.460 --> 22:19.460
difference because if it's dictated

22:19.460 --> 22:21.460
by God, it has not to be

22:21.460 --> 22:23.460
interpreted.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.460
And the two others monotheistic

22:25.460 --> 22:29.460
are interpretations and lead to

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
more and more and more

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
interpretations.

22:33.460 --> 22:34.460
Yes?

22:34.460 --> 22:35.460
You agree with that?

22:35.460 --> 22:36.460
Sure.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.460
Thank you.

22:38.460 --> 22:39.460
Merci beaucoup sommes.

22:39.460 --> 22:40.460
Meruis.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.460
Meruis.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.460
Les l'édour les jons.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.460

22:46.460 --> 22:47.460
Nous s'spadeurs.

22:47.460 --> 22:50.460
L'iréin a travais de exegez.

22:50.460 --> 22:51.460
Eres sur desinés and gémété

22:51.460 --> 22:54.460
amine.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.460
Yes, interpretation, which will

22:56.460 --> 22:57.460
never end.

22:57.460 --> 23:04.460
Because one interpretation

23:04.460 --> 23:06.460
leads to another, one and so on

23:06.460 --> 23:07.460
and so on.

23:07.460 --> 23:11.460
So it's an ongoing work.

23:11.460 --> 23:15.460
I would suggest that we should

23:15.460 --> 23:18.460
make a distinction between

23:18.460 --> 23:21.460
interpretation and critique.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.460
And what I'm going to say,

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
before I have to preface what I'm

23:25.460 --> 23:29.460
going to say with a statement.

23:29.460 --> 23:32.460
I in no way want to endorse the

23:32.460 --> 23:34.460
whole idea about class of

23:34.460 --> 23:37.460
civilizations or celebrate the

23:37.460 --> 23:39.460
west or deny the history of

23:39.460 --> 23:42.460
western imperialism and colonialism.

23:42.460 --> 23:47.460
Nevertheless, and I will probably

23:47.460 --> 23:50.460
be accused of Islamophobia and

23:50.460 --> 23:52.460
Eurocentrism, but nevertheless

23:52.460 --> 23:54.460
what I want to say is this.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.460
Well, I don't know what it's like

23:56.460 --> 23:58.460
in France at this point.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.460
But here, especially Columbia

24:00.460 --> 24:04.460
where I teach, thinkers who have

24:04.460 --> 24:06.460
been influenced by deconstruction

24:06.460 --> 24:10.460
and post-colonial theorists are

24:10.460 --> 24:12.460
constantly making the point that

24:12.460 --> 24:15.460
identity isn't unitary.

24:15.460 --> 24:18.460
Identity is always heterogeneous,

24:18.460 --> 24:22.460
not unified, not solidified,

24:22.460 --> 24:24.460
not final.

24:24.460 --> 24:27.460
But they fail to apply their

24:27.460 --> 24:30.460
point to the west.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
The identity of the west isn't

24:32.460 --> 24:34.460
unified either.

24:34.460 --> 24:40.460
And as Kesteriadis argued, the

24:40.460 --> 24:43.460
social formation of the west is

24:43.460 --> 24:46.460
made up by two competing projects.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.460
What he called the project of

24:48.460 --> 24:50.460
autonomy and the project of

24:50.460 --> 24:52.460
domination.

24:52.460 --> 24:55.460
The latter is the history of

24:55.460 --> 24:58.460
imperialism, colonialism,

24:58.460 --> 25:00.460
domination of the globe,

25:00.460 --> 25:02.460
domination of the nation, and so

25:02.460 --> 25:04.460
on and so forth.

25:04.460 --> 25:06.460
But there is something else that

25:06.460 --> 25:09.460
happened in the west which makes

25:09.460 --> 25:12.460
critique possible in a way that

25:12.460 --> 25:14.460
it isn't another culture.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.460
I mean, if you look to the

25:16.460 --> 25:18.460
Greeks, for example, and I don't

25:18.460 --> 25:21.460
think that's a way to celebrate

25:21.460 --> 25:23.460
the Greek miracle.

25:23.460 --> 25:26.460
But the unoxford classicist and

25:26.460 --> 25:29.460
philosopher, Loy, G.E.R. and Loy,

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
has done extensive research,

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
comparative research between

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
Greek science, Chinese science,

25:35.460 --> 25:37.460
and Indian science.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.460
And he is intimately familiar with

25:40.460 --> 25:42.460
all the text and sometimes it

25:42.460 --> 25:44.460
makes it impossible to read.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.460
But I mean, he's no

25:46.460 --> 25:48.460
one, that's what I'm trying to say.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.460
And his question is, why did

25:50.460 --> 25:52.460
inquiry go further in Greece than

25:52.460 --> 25:54.460
it did in either of these other

25:54.460 --> 25:55.460
places?

25:55.460 --> 25:57.460
And his answer is that the

25:57.460 --> 25:59.460
structure, there was a certain

25:59.460 --> 26:02.460
anti-authoritarianism in Greece.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.460
As opposed to certain

26:04.460 --> 26:06.460
structures of authority in China

26:06.460 --> 26:09.460
and India which allowed inquiry

26:09.460 --> 26:11.460
to go beyond a certain point in

26:11.460 --> 26:12.460
Greece, whereas the

26:12.460 --> 26:14.460
authoritarianism, the

26:14.460 --> 26:16.460
perseverance of inquiry to power

26:16.460 --> 26:18.460
prevented it from going that far

26:18.460 --> 26:20.460
in China and India.

26:20.460 --> 26:23.460
And then, I mean, I'll probably

26:23.460 --> 26:25.460
be accused of being a

26:25.460 --> 26:28.460
defender of the Enlightenment.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.460
And I don't want to defend it in

26:30.460 --> 26:31.460
its 18th century mode, but I do

26:31.460 --> 26:32.460
want to defend it.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.460
But then, contact,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.460
they're all, so ours is the age

26:36.460 --> 26:37.460
of critique.

26:37.460 --> 26:39.460
And he enunciated the principle

26:39.460 --> 26:41.460
that we shouldn't accept any

26:41.460 --> 26:45.460
idea, any norm, any value, in the

26:45.460 --> 26:47.460
name of traditional authority.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.460
Simply because it's been passed

26:49.460 --> 26:51.460
on and simply because the

26:51.460 --> 26:53.460
authorities say it so.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.460
And that, in principle, I mean,

26:56.460 --> 26:57.460
it doesn't happen, it's violated

26:57.460 --> 26:59.460
all the time, but in principle,

26:59.460 --> 27:01.460
every important idea has to

27:01.460 --> 27:02.460
stand before the test of

27:02.460 --> 27:04.460
critical reason.

27:04.460 --> 27:06.460
And I think these two

27:06.460 --> 27:08.460
sediment and historical

27:08.460 --> 27:10.460
experiences mean that they're

27:10.460 --> 27:12.460
something sedimented in our

27:12.460 --> 27:14.460
history, which needs to be

27:14.460 --> 27:17.460
defended and needs to be

27:17.460 --> 27:19.460
asserted against the other

27:19.460 --> 27:21.460
strand of our history, which is

27:21.460 --> 27:24.460
the project of domination.

27:24.460 --> 27:27.460
Would you agree that that's

27:27.460 --> 27:30.460
very near what you said is

27:30.460 --> 27:32.460
quite near?

27:32.460 --> 27:35.460
When I say the capacity to say

27:35.460 --> 27:37.460
no, it's very important.

27:37.460 --> 27:41.460
To say no to the idols of the

27:41.460 --> 27:42.460
tribe.

27:42.460 --> 27:43.460
Exactly.

27:43.460 --> 27:46.460
And to acknowledge, no, this

27:46.460 --> 27:48.460
is not mine.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.460
I don't feel this and I don't

27:51.460 --> 27:53.460
want to feel it.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.460
Lloyd even makes the point in the

27:56.460 --> 28:00.460
ilea that the other soldiers

28:00.460 --> 28:02.460
stand up and say no to a

28:02.460 --> 28:07.460
minna, which is almost unheard of.

28:07.460 --> 28:09.460
They had the right to speak up

28:09.460 --> 28:11.460
and to challenge their king

28:11.460 --> 28:13.460
general in a way that was

28:13.460 --> 28:14.460
uncharacteristic.

28:14.460 --> 28:22.460
Also, something you said, one of

28:22.460 --> 28:25.460
your earlier panels, that we see

28:25.460 --> 28:27.460
the death drive in thinking

28:27.460 --> 28:29.460
because the capacity to say no

28:29.460 --> 28:31.460
and separate is the same.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.460
That's true.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.460
But at the same time thinking

28:33.460 --> 28:35.460
goes against the death drive

28:35.460 --> 28:37.460
because insofar as the death

28:37.460 --> 28:41.460
drive wants to seek the

28:41.460 --> 28:43.460
release attention, this version

28:43.460 --> 28:45.460
of tension, thinking requires

28:45.460 --> 28:47.460
the increase in tension, the

28:47.460 --> 28:48.460
buildup in tension.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.460
That's true.

28:49.460 --> 28:50.460
Both are true.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.460
Both are totally true and that's

28:52.460 --> 28:55.460
why what is destructive.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.460
It's not the death drive only

28:57.460 --> 29:02.460
because it's the individual.

29:02.460 --> 29:05.460
It's the unabiding.

29:05.460 --> 29:08.460
I might slightly disagree in

29:08.460 --> 29:10.460
terms of what has already been

29:10.460 --> 29:11.460
discussed earlier today.

29:11.460 --> 29:14.460
The question of the death drive

29:14.460 --> 29:17.460
and teaching and identification

29:17.460 --> 29:21.460
and the recent problems and

29:21.460 --> 29:24.460
attacks in California and

29:24.460 --> 29:27.460
connected and I think what we see

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
here is that education and

29:29.460 --> 29:32.460
identity or identification are

29:32.460 --> 29:33.460
somehow linked.

29:33.460 --> 29:36.460
I would just begin by going back

29:36.460 --> 29:38.460
to the sentence that has often

29:38.460 --> 29:39.460
been quoted today.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.460
Freud said that education is

29:41.460 --> 29:42.460
impossible.

29:42.460 --> 29:45.460
Educate, govern, psychoanalyze,

29:45.460 --> 29:48.460
impossible professions.

29:48.460 --> 29:51.460
Just to say that this is where

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
we are now, but precisely I think

29:53.460 --> 29:56.460
our discussion is impossible.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.460
This evening.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.460
Nobody will come out of here with

29:59.460 --> 30:01.460
a good sense of what we're doing

30:01.460 --> 30:03.460
or saying to languages.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.460
We won't understand each other.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.460
That is clear.

30:07.460 --> 30:10.460
Yet this impossible is what can

30:10.460 --> 30:12.460
be used and I think we need to

30:12.460 --> 30:15.460
think through the impossible.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.460
And I think this is where La

30:16.460 --> 30:19.460
Conne or De Rida or Bataille can

30:19.460 --> 30:20.460
help us.

30:20.460 --> 30:21.460
Why?

30:21.460 --> 30:24.460
Because precisely the impossible

30:24.460 --> 30:28.460
is a certain paradoxical mode

30:28.460 --> 30:31.460
of thinking and you know like

30:31.460 --> 30:33.460
what De Rida often does in his

30:33.460 --> 30:36.460
text to bring us to an aporia.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.460
We don't know.

30:38.460 --> 30:40.460
We are stuck and so on.

30:40.460 --> 30:42.460
Which in a way interrupts a

30:42.460 --> 30:45.460
certain common discourse and I

30:45.460 --> 30:47.460
think we should go back to Freud's

30:47.460 --> 30:49.460
idea of what is this

30:49.460 --> 30:51.460
impossibility here.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.460
How is it connected with the

30:53.460 --> 30:55.460
task of educating?

30:55.460 --> 30:57.460
Is it possible to educate while

30:57.460 --> 30:59.460
it is impossible to do so

30:59.460 --> 31:00.460
normally?

31:00.460 --> 31:02.460
On the other hand we have the

31:02.460 --> 31:04.460
question and you started by

31:04.460 --> 31:06.460
quoting the card.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.460
I think therefore I am.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.460
La Conne as we know

31:10.460 --> 31:13.460
refrised it as I think Colin

31:13.460 --> 31:15.460
quote therefore I am.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.460
We can think it like I think

31:18.460 --> 31:20.460
it's a good question.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.460
Therefore I am.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.460
I think therefore I am like a

31:24.460 --> 31:26.460
whole phrase.

31:26.460 --> 31:28.460
What I mean is that in terms of

31:28.460 --> 31:30.460
the institutions that have to do

31:30.460 --> 31:32.460
with identification or

31:32.460 --> 31:34.460
education we can think of the

31:34.460 --> 31:35.460
two parallel institutions that

31:35.460 --> 31:37.460
have been so cooperative in

31:37.460 --> 31:39.460
France recently.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.460
On the one hand it's a high

31:40.460 --> 31:44.460
schools, universities and elite

31:44.460 --> 31:47.460
institutions and on the other

31:47.460 --> 31:51.460
hand the jails where most of the

31:51.460 --> 31:54.460
radical militants have learned

31:54.460 --> 31:57.460
to identify with an ideal.

31:57.460 --> 32:01.460
Which I think is also why we

32:01.460 --> 32:03.460
had that question earlier.

32:03.460 --> 32:07.460
Why are we maybe more moved by

32:07.460 --> 32:10.460
the Uldurahoke and Betacron attacks

32:10.460 --> 32:13.460
in Paris and they are playing

32:13.460 --> 32:17.460
in Beirut and so on.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.460
Why is it because it's just

32:19.460 --> 32:21.460
normal kids having fun.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
Any sense what we always aspire

32:23.460 --> 32:26.460
to that our children can go out

32:26.460 --> 32:28.460
on a cafe at night and enjoy

32:28.460 --> 32:29.460
life.

32:29.460 --> 32:32.460
And so that looks like very

32:32.460 --> 32:34.460
different from with the

32:34.460 --> 32:37.460
Ozzier 20 years ago when the

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
Goldenberg was attacked.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.460
Okay, use religion as the city

32:41.460 --> 32:43.460
and so on.

32:43.460 --> 32:45.460
Today is just sort of everyday

32:45.460 --> 32:47.460
style of life with which everybody

32:47.460 --> 32:49.460
here in this room can identify

32:49.460 --> 32:52.460
as something we think is good.

32:52.460 --> 32:54.460
It may not be that good.

32:54.460 --> 32:56.460
But if we think of the

32:56.460 --> 32:58.460
rapidity of the identification we

32:58.460 --> 33:00.460
have all those accounts of

33:00.460 --> 33:03.460
marginalized disenfranchised

33:03.460 --> 33:06.460
kids from the suburbs of

33:06.460 --> 33:08.460
Paris who go to jail because

33:08.460 --> 33:12.460
they first drug, they do deep

33:12.460 --> 33:14.460
drugs, they are dealing, they

33:14.460 --> 33:16.460
get called by the police, they

33:16.460 --> 33:18.460
go to jail and then they

33:18.460 --> 33:21.460
identify with an absolute faith.

33:21.460 --> 33:23.460
And so this is the function of

33:23.460 --> 33:24.460
identification.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.460
Against this a certain

33:26.460 --> 33:29.460
impossibility of the institution

33:29.460 --> 33:32.460
of learning and teaching is a

33:32.460 --> 33:34.460
good counter poison, I would

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
say.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.460
I would put it as a particular

33:37.460 --> 33:53.460
position I'd say in the

33:53.460 --> 33:41.760
race, that only

33:41.760 --> 33:44.960
make sense, not just upper

33:45.460 --> 33:39.460
offensive

33:45.460 --> 33:46.460
perspective but rooted in

33:46.460 --> 33:59.660
important actions,

33:54.460 --> 34:02.460
as people who make restrictions

34:02.460 --> 33:54.460
foraina's

33:54.420 --> 33:56.220
and other SI,

33:56.460 --> 34:01.760
colleague Paul

34:01.760 --> 34:03.760
And I think that the

34:03.760 --> 34:05.760
discussion is very important,

34:05.760 --> 34:07.760
and I think that the

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
discussion is very important.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.760
And is wondering if the humanities

34:12.760 --> 34:15.760
can address the question of identity

34:16.760 --> 34:18.760
and the civilization and its

34:18.760 --> 34:20.760
discontent.

34:21.760 --> 34:20.760
The question of the

34:20.760 --> 34:23.760
discussion is

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
that the

34:24.760 --> 34:26.760
discussion is

34:26.760 --> 34:27.760
very important.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.760
And when you are looking at

34:29.760 --> 34:31.760
the question of the

34:31.760 --> 34:33.760
discussion, the question of

34:33.760 --> 34:35.760
the discussion is

34:35.760 --> 34:37.760
very important.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.760
And I think that the

34:39.760 --> 34:41.760
discussion is very important,

34:41.760 --> 34:42.760
and if the question is

34:42.760 --> 34:44.760
very important,

34:44.760 --> 34:46.760
is very important.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.760
After Freud and Lacon,

34:48.760 --> 34:49.760
which was in her text,

34:49.760 --> 34:51.760
she's wondering if

34:51.760 --> 34:55.760
we can understand

34:55.760 --> 34:57.760
that the

34:57.760 --> 34:59.760
discussion is very important.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.760
So the question is

35:01.760 --> 35:03.760
why is the question

35:03.760 --> 35:05.760
very important.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.760
The question of the

35:07.760 --> 35:09.760
contemporary subject.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
I think that the

35:11.760 --> 35:13.760
discussion is

35:13.760 --> 35:15.760
very important.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.760
The question is

35:17.760 --> 35:19.760
how do you

35:19.760 --> 35:20.760
look at the

35:20.760 --> 35:22.760
discussion of the

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
discussion and

35:24.760 --> 35:28.640
all of its

35:28.640 --> 35:30.240
things and

35:30.240 --> 35:34.240
those who Jamie

35:34.240 --> 35:31.240
nodding and

35:31.240 --> 35:34.760
thinking that

35:34.760 --> 35:44.200
be Veilow

35:50.680 --> 35:53.200
The

35:53.200 --> 35:56.820
How they do the

36:06.240 --> 36:09.240
introduce

36:17.080 --> 36:18.920
teachers and students.

36:18.920 --> 36:23.920
And also, you, as an example, a particular character,

36:25.920 --> 36:27.920
a philosopher, a philosopher,

36:27.920 --> 36:30.920
and a philosopher, a person,

36:30.920 --> 36:35.920
a person who has a mission to make a difference.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.920
And the actuality.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.920
On a second term,

36:40.920 --> 36:45.920
she will interrogate the humanistic study,

36:45.920 --> 36:50.920
which are philology, rhetoric, interpretation,

36:51.920 --> 36:58.920
which open to the plurality of the unconscious meaning.

36:58.920 --> 37:03.580
And then the whole characters who take the

36:58.920 --> 37:05.240
the

37:05.240 --> 37:08.060
dimensions women,

37:08.060 --> 37:09.220
they take values that often

37:09.220 --> 37:08.600
be

37:12.120 --> 37:17.280
an

37:17.120 --> 37:23.960
guides

37:23.960 --> 37:29.100
...and then we got to the very beginning of the French.

37:30.460 --> 37:33.160
This is another question by Jan beauty teacher

37:34.300 --> 37:25.020
that we have found in the l

37:25.020 --> 37:40.940
tv political

37:41.680 --> 37:43.180
level as much as other people should

37:43.180 --> 37:41.640
in case the

37:42.780 --> 37:43.920
cast

37:43.920 --> 37:44.920
Something like that

37:46.020 --> 37:50.900
we are recording

37:50.900 --> 37:51.520
...

37:51.520 --> 37:51.180
nice

37:51.180 --> 37:52.680
Ko

37:52.680 --> 37:56.040
to protect the people of the country,

37:56.040 --> 37:59.480
and to defend the people of the country.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.480
And to protect the people of the country.

38:02.480 --> 38:07.080
She will use the writings of a French rapper

38:07.080 --> 38:12.440
to illustrate the system of reading

38:12.440 --> 38:14.560
that she wants to expose.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.520
Her name is Milani Diyana.

38:18.520 --> 38:24.120
Milani spew his memory from the end of March

38:24.120 --> 38:28.240
in 2004 Align gn skies

38:28.240 --> 38:23.640
activity calculated like unfinished

38:23.640 --> 38:37.560
forms of the

38:37.560 --> 38:41.880
definition and implement it carefully.

38:41.880 --> 38:21.400
Our

38:28.840 --> 38:21.800
court

38:41.880 --> 38:28.400
gh

38:42.920 --> 38:43.960
oration

38:47.920 --> 38:47.960
know

38:47.960 --> 38:52.960
And I want to thank you for your time.

38:52.960 --> 38:57.960
I want to thank you for your time.

38:57.960 --> 39:02.960
I want to thank you for your time.

39:02.960 --> 39:06.960
Thank you for your time.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.960
The signifier discontent runs in the contemporary zeitgeist.

39:11.960 --> 39:16.960
And what interests her is to the fact that she calls herself

39:16.960 --> 39:19.960
a suburbanite.

39:19.960 --> 39:25.960
I want to thank you for your time.

39:25.960 --> 39:30.960
I want to thank you for your time.

39:30.960 --> 40:00.920
In French, a happy with two Rs means to be abrasive.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.500
If you take the role of

40:03.500 --> 40:26.340
medical people back in depressing

40:26.340 --> 40:33.820
then he always cares on the poor and wont do anything because his blaster was with a

40:33.820 --> 40:35.060
dirty relic.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.740
A Frenchragpe also means fear.

40:37.740 --> 41:06.740
She wants to insist on her stage name, which is written

41:06.740 --> 41:13.740
in the AIM apostrophe S.

41:13.740 --> 41:31.740
The AIM is the abbreviation of diamond, which is from the Greek.

41:31.740 --> 41:37.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

41:37.740 --> 41:43.740
The Greek language is the name of the Greek.

41:43.740 --> 41:51.740
It's the name of the Greek language.

41:51.740 --> 42:02.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, and the name of the Greek language is the name of the Greek.

42:02.740 --> 42:09.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

42:09.740 --> 42:30.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language.

42:30.740 --> 42:46.740
She uses an anagramatic strategy coupled with a substantial and substitution to change her patronime by translating into Greek, which is...

42:46.740 --> 43:06.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek.

43:06.740 --> 43:19.740
This prefigurates the cleavage between D and AIM.

43:19.740 --> 43:41.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek.

43:41.740 --> 43:51.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

43:51.740 --> 44:19.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

44:19.740 --> 44:30.740
The AIM is the name of the Greek language.

44:30.740 --> 44:39.740
The AIM has a name of the Greek language, which is the name of the Greek language.

44:39.740 --> 45:06.940
In her analysis, the two signifiers black and white appear by analyzing the world lucosia,

45:06.940 --> 45:12.740
which is lab launch, and melancholia, which is lab noir.

45:12.740 --> 45:41.680
She also says,boy, let's follow Z

45:41.680 --> 45:44.680
and I'm happy to talk to you later.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.680
I'm going to go to the room.

45:49.680 --> 45:56.680
At this time, she announced a very naively done identification

45:57.680 --> 46:01.680
to women, to her mother and to her friends.

46:01.680 --> 46:08.680
At this time, she announced a very good identification

46:09.680 --> 46:12.680
to her mother, to her mother.

46:13.680 --> 46:20.680
At this time, she announced a very good identification

46:21.680 --> 46:26.680
to her mother, to her mother, to her family,

46:26.680 --> 46:31.680
to her mother, to her mother, to her mother.

46:32.680 --> 46:37.680
Through the failure of the identical operation,

46:38.680 --> 46:44.680
she chose to conform to the right, the ritual.

46:44.680 --> 46:49.680
She's great, yes.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.680
In the summer, the men were not able to deliver

46:54.680 --> 46:57.680
to the women of the exterior.

46:58.680 --> 47:05.680
The men of the apartment were not able to do it.

47:05.680 --> 47:14.680
They were not able to do it.

47:15.680 --> 47:24.680
Her father, which she describes as a convinced atheist.

47:24.680 --> 47:33.680
She was a very good atheist.

47:34.680 --> 47:39.680
She was a very good atheist.

47:40.680 --> 47:45.680
Her daughter, the Orthodox, Christian Orthodox,

47:46.680 --> 47:48.680
were long veils in churches.

47:48.680 --> 47:53.680
She was a very good atheist.

47:54.680 --> 47:59.680
She was a very good atheist.

48:00.680 --> 48:05.680
She was a very good musician.

48:06.680 --> 48:13.680
She was a very good atheist.

48:13.680 --> 48:22.680
What comes to mind is that Nicosy, the Capriella Cyprus,

48:23.680 --> 48:28.680
is cut into Greek versus Turkish.

48:29.680 --> 48:34.680
The duality has its origin in her father's origin,

48:35.680 --> 48:40.680
which are never mentioned in her book.

48:40.680 --> 48:43.680
It's about my family drinking"?

48:44.680 --> 48:48.680
After years since the fortteals were dated,

48:49.680 --> 49:06.260
our pianist was gathered in Europe des

49:06.260 --> 49:33.260
The second identification is made through the veil that she adopts from the Greek tradition.

49:33.260 --> 49:41.120
I think it is an corresponds to the

49:41.120 --> 49:46.080
international version of co- vascular manufacturing in the world at length five days when the

49:46.080 --> 49:57.260
legeating

49:57.260 --> 49:58.880
You have to clear up.

49:59.140 --> 50:01.640
In several independent differentoes

50:01.640 --> 50:03.480
we can translate to whether

50:03.480 --> 50:09.000
or not to play with any element

50:16.340 --> 50:19.080
that you might like it in your future.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.060
Sometimes Roberg

50:21.060 --> 50:39.700
The

50:39.700 --> 50:49.980
autobiography is emblematic of the history of a manic depressive woman which is out of

50:49.980 --> 51:05.500
bounds without limit. The trajectory of the group is reversed to

51:05.500 --> 51:12.420
virilization that she describes by saying that when she was younger she was

51:12.420 --> 51:19.220
masculine and very hard with herself and others.

51:19.220 --> 51:44.820
Thank you.

51:49.220 --> 51:53.940
which did shake loss in black.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.460

There are some necessary blinded sculptures,

Currently, all are

52:30.580 --> 52:36.580

52:37.340 --> 52:42.020
because, as we urge people to have a committed campaign

52:42.020 --> 52:44.440
around Speciallovors,

52:49.920 --> 52:52.020
they don't have any

01:05:51.640 --> 01:06:13.720
there are Agricultural

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.720
In the interview, I just prefer to call myself a Jew.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:22.720
It's a very good thing.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.720

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.720

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.720
I'm a Jew.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.720
I'm a Jew.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.720
I'm a Jew.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.720
I'm a Jew.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.720
I'm a Jew.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.720
Maybe I should say this in English.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:56.720
That Freud was interviewed by this protonatsy writer, very famous man, who had been born in Germany, wrote in English, Yarek.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.720
Interviewed everybody at that time.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:05.720
And he went, Freud said, look, I want to call myself a Jew, not a German.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Yarek, oh, I was hoping, here I said, that you were more a universalist.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.720
But I can understand the anger of Freud indeed, certain things happen and so on.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:31.720
But in that debate, what interested me in, so it's a debate that was published in a collection, very interesting, in 1957, on the future of psychoanalysis.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:44.720
It makes you want to laugh or to cry, I don't know exactly which, when you see what the imagined psychoanalysis would be like in, let's say, half a century earlier.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.720
But there are many, many issues about education, identification, science and so on.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:08:00.720
But fundamentally, what you can see is that Freud, first, we talked about the critique of American ideas and denounces,

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:08.720
as he always does, the superficiality of American cultural life and the medicalization of psychoanalysis.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:21.720
But then he says, you don't know your own classics, he says to an Whitman, because Whitman, if sex were lacking or were lacking.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:34.720
So Freud still believes that what is shocking in, let's say, American ideology of the common man is the sexual idea.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:44.720
What he then discovers talking with Virac is that the most shocking thing is the death drive, to return to what we were saying earlier.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:53.720
And he really goes on on on about the death drive, because Virac is ready to accept the idea, I think you were saying this, this morning very well.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:09:05.720
But, and I think Freud's anti-CP may have anticipated, you know, the culture of Hollywood and the certain soft form, diffuse eroticism and publicity,

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:15.720
and everywhere today on any screen we can open and so on. That has been completely absorbed by mainstream American culture and Western culture,

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:25.720
whereas the idea of the death drive, that is still something that, surprisingly, somebody like Virac who loved the Nazis couldn't take.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:36.720
But you know, the story is even more complicated, because everything most of us find obnoxious about American culture and consumerism and how I would,

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:48.720
was introduced by Freud's nephew, Bernays, I don't remember. And he took his uncles ideas and invented what they call it.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:10:02.720
And he was hired by the big corporation, blah, blah, blah, and he was the agent of all of this.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:20.720
But I think it took to conclude maybe on this and something that I owe to Charles Merman, because I can say that I started learning about LACON in a seminar you taught in Paris in 1969,

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:36.720
so that's a long time ago at the economic superior. In LACON you have this awareness that in the text I quote, there is a pedagogy of the death drive,

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:51.720
which is a little paradoxical to think today, because you were suggesting that what can we learn from the death drive, basically to avoid it, no. To understand what it means.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:11:12.720
And so for LACON it has to do with language and perhaps with literature. This is I think why when we teach literature we also have to work with the death drive, which is I think more difficult than to work with the fact that students may fall in love with us and so on.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.720
We know how to deal with that, but we don't know how to deal with their death drive.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.720
You've been part of their transverse is also the negative transverse of the death drive.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.720
The transverse isn't just euros.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.720
Can you go to the microphone please?

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:43.720
You did.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.720
Well, you also saw that it might be a cool thing, but some things are just barely as good as much, but obviously the better.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.720
When people experience, those are great

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.060
and midsettle, people have come

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.360
and LOT of music and then they himself

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.760
have posterity.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.680
Nah fullfloor is being used

01:13:06.680 --> 01:12:57.200
Basically, she does the fifth

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.520
Oh 3-4

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.600
At first she history support

01:12:59.600 --> 01:12:59.540
belly meditation

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:03.080
if al

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.180
free

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.640
Nah hezac

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.580
piring

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.120
aggravating

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.040
enthal

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:12.460
Yeah

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:13.820
Hehe

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.200
She converses

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.840
He comes to me

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:36.840
This is to Maria.

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:46.840
The identity is based on the capacity to say no.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.840
Philosophically, I do agree with you.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:59.840
But from a psychoanalytical point of view, I'm not sure that identity exists as such.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.840
It's like the baby for Winnicott.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.840
You see, it does not exist as such.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.840
Freud's thought of identity as a social relationship.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.840
Identity was social.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.840
And you refer to the London genocide.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:28.840
There is another book which I recommend, Scott Strauss, who analyzed different villages, different regions.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:38.840
And I remember the conclusion that the same type of people sometimes did resist other participating in the killing.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:48.840
In other words, the environment and the political environment was this system in the commitment of the crimes.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:54.840
So the question is, what does it mean, identity as such?

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.840
I agree, thank you.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:03.840
I don't think identity is one entity.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:13.840
Identity is a long and fluctuating process, which has to do with recognition by the other two.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:23.840
You have your identity, but you are also identified by the look of the other.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.840
Perhaps if I can add something to your remark.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:38.840
What Charles Melman was discussing with the example of the supporters is a little more than identity.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:48.840
It's this mixture of results and identity that Clampera, for instance, analyzed very well in the language of the Third Reich.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:55.840
And I know that book showed exactly what Mussolini did in Italy.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:09.840
Not just an identity to being Italian or Nazi or German or Aryan as non-drew, but the resource that was allowed to happen.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:21.840
And I think this is what a good club and my city of Philadelphia is very known for having really very rowdy supporters of the Phillies and so on.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:29.840
You know, if you join that you will be able to kick out people's heads and bash them and so on.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.840
That will be part of the little premium.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:39.840
And so this is the kind of excessive enjoyment I think, in Italy as kinetic.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:48.840
Try to describe this very well in what has been translated in English as my crowds and massed in German.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:55.840
It really about the unleashing of enjoyment in a crowd, in massed.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:03.840
It's I think different from just identity, we all need a certain identity, but that's special kind of identity.

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:11.840
A one line from Avid, I think that fits especially this country very well in our discussion is,

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:35.840
if you are afraid to fall in love, go into business.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:42.840
BlackSupp IntrInformation has had a powerful issue that StarCraft had since.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:39.840
It feels Exhibitionist type Curij, exposition, humour, propaganda, incarceration,

01:17:52.840 --> 01:18:03.040
but it doesn't ever actually go in

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:56.940
to a Reich with men in saber

01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.200
There were a lot of struggle foraged money.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:06.580
Maybe I'm perfect and the question

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:11.300
And, like right now, it wants to be context

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.000
It's a very well addressed

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
But the money's going a bituxed

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.260
If this funeral doesn't hold

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.460
And it'll be favorable for' Westminster

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.480
So we start

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:31.360
in this nature the RanchWerect of some information.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.840
Here are the text for native

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:45.000
which Garcia andcontrol still ask his authors

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:42.520
The

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.940
closest to grow, it's a Tessette

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.120
David

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.360
a lot of people who actually likes to do some

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:48.680
And if it will equal those Catherine'sbc

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.480
in 2019?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:21:00.720
of translation as a deal against

01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:03.700
Rashidq in summary

01:21:00.740 --> 01:20:58.340
SES

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.900
ipping

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.240
as a change

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.400
Al

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:13.620
mini

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:16.840
context

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:21.380
oligarchy.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:24.760
Goes in with hurts

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:28.080
may suffer so

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:34.620
William

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:39.700
I am very grateful to you for your

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.660
dedication.

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.660
I am very grateful to you.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.580
I am very grateful to you for your

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:48.580
commitment.

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:52.300
No, just to conclude, just something which is

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:57.420
quite rather an anecdote, but came to my mind,

01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:03.500
I don't know if you all know that the one who

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:09.500
always fight against the idea of nationalism was

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.700
Sasha Mazor.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:14.820
And in the same time, he was also the one who

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:19.860
fight to have the first ladies admitted in

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:26.420
university, which is quite interesting because we

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:35.220
evoked the problem of the women identification, women

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:41.820
representing the otherness, and of course, the danger of

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:48.580
nationalism and unique identity when identity becomes

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:53.380
something totally restrictive and not an ongoing process.

01:22:53.380 --> 01:23:04.860
Thank you all for coming tomorrow morning.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:07.020
The meeting will start at 10 o'clock.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.020
At 10.

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:10.500
Messier, Vichy, Vittian, Tu.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:38.380
Messi Allen to

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:15.380
Excuse me for not being in the sun, but you the right way to show it.
