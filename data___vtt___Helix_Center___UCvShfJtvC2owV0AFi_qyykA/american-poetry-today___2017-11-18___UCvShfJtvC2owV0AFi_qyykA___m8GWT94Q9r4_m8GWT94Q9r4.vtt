00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
Hi, good afternoon everybody.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.200
Welcome to the Helix Center.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
My name is Jerry Herwitz.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.280
I'm one of the organizers here at the Helix.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.360
And I want to make a full-to brief introduction to our moderator today.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.240
And Marie Louvine is herself an artist, painter and poet.

00:27.240 --> 00:34.240
And she will moderate this panel discussion and introduce you to our distinguished panelists.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.240
Okay, thank you.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.240
My mic is off.

00:41.240 --> 00:45.240
Oh, can you just...

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
Yeah.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.240
My issues.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.240
I think we also...

00:48.240 --> 00:49.240
Whoops.

00:49.240 --> 00:54.240
Good too much.

00:54.240 --> 01:02.240
I think we're also supposed to remind you that there's a conference on December 1st.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
The...

01:03.240 --> 01:04.240
Right?

01:04.240 --> 01:05.240
I don't have the information...

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
The SciArt conference.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.240
The SciArt conference, which you can see on the website.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.240
It's fully explained.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.240
So today we're going to attempt to tell you about American poetry today.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.240
It's only a beginning.

01:22.240 --> 01:31.240
So to introduce the program, the American poet Ezra Pound proclaimed that poetry is news

01:31.240 --> 01:33.440
that stays news.

01:33.440 --> 01:38.360
On a different note, his contemporary William Carlos Williams said that it is difficult

01:38.360 --> 01:45.680
to get the news from poems, yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.160
Do modernist maxim such as these also define the ever-expanding range and diversity of

01:50.160 --> 01:51.920
poetry today.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.160
Which poets or groups are doing interesting or important work?

01:55.160 --> 01:57.680
Who are the earlier poets that inspired them?

01:57.680 --> 02:02.960
And what is the nature, role, appeal, and significance of contemporary poetry?

02:02.960 --> 02:08.240
When it comes to grasping experiences and communicating their meaning, what does this art form provide?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.320
What kind of subjects to poetry journals and other publications focus on?

02:12.320 --> 02:16.960
How has the production and promotion and reception of poetry changed in the internet age?

02:16.960 --> 02:21.920
It's very much about the internet age and the 21st century.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.680
In response to questions such as these, around table of diverse and accomplished poets, we'll

02:26.680 --> 02:29.760
discuss what's going on in the poetry world today.

02:29.760 --> 02:34.200
They will explore the allure and value of contemporary poetry through different lenses

02:34.200 --> 02:39.600
ranging from the formal to the linguistic to the conceptual to the psychological.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.400
And in the second part of the program, we'll have our usual Q&A.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.360
I'm going to introduce the participants in alphabetical order and ask you each to raise

02:50.360 --> 02:56.280
your hands as I say your name so people will know who you are.

02:56.280 --> 03:02.840
Patricia Carlin received her PhD from Princeton focusing on Shakespeare studies and poetry

03:02.840 --> 03:04.200
and poetics.

03:04.200 --> 03:10.920
Her most recent poetry collection, Second Nature, appeared in May 2017.

03:10.920 --> 03:16.560
These books include Quantum Jitters and Original Green, Poetry Collections, and Shakespeare's

03:16.560 --> 03:21.280
Mortal Man, a study of Shakespeare's plays in their cultural context.

03:21.280 --> 03:26.640
She's published widely in journals and anthologies such as Playad, verse, Boulevard, Bomb, American

03:26.640 --> 03:28.360
Letters and Commentary.

03:28.360 --> 03:32.240
And is this right, McSweeney's internet tendency, right?

03:32.240 --> 03:35.840
And she co-edits the Poetry Journal Barrow Street.

03:35.840 --> 03:39.760
Honors include fellowships at the McDowell Colony and Virginia Center for the Creative

03:39.760 --> 03:40.920
Arts.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.040
She teaches literature and poetry writing at the New School where she has received the

03:45.040 --> 03:48.000
University Distinguished Teaching Award.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.960
Can everybody hear me?

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
Is this?

03:49.960 --> 03:50.960
No.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.960
Slow.

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
OK.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.960
Amy Holman.

03:53.960 --> 04:05.280
Amy Holman is a Pushcart Prize nominated poet and a literary consultant.

04:05.280 --> 04:11.640
Her collection, Rin's Fly Through This Opened Window, was described by one reviewer as part

04:11.640 --> 04:15.080
freak show, part searing insight.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.640
She's also the author of four poetry chapbooks, including the prize-winning Wait for Me, I'm

04:20.640 --> 04:24.040
Gone from Dream Horse Press.

04:24.040 --> 04:31.000
Her poems have appeared in numerous magazines and anthologies, two numerous to name, including

04:31.000 --> 04:37.880
Archaeology Magazine, American Letters and Commentary, Barrow Street, Fail Better, I'll

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
Stop.

04:38.880 --> 04:46.280
But I'll end with the first anthology of TV poems and the best American poetry in 1999.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.920
She teaches poetry workshops at the Hudson Valley Writers Center.

04:50.920 --> 04:56.760
Paolo Javier.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.640
This collaboration with Listening Center, David Mason, appeared as a limited edition

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
book cassette.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.200
Oh, his name I cannot pronounce.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.680
You have to help me.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
Earlier.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.680
OK.

05:08.680 --> 05:17.280
Published by Text and Town in early 2017, a featured artist in MoMA PS1's 2015 Greater New York

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
Show.

05:18.280 --> 05:24.400
He is the author of four full-length collections of poetry, including Court of the Dragon,

05:24.400 --> 05:28.000
which Publishers Weekly calls a linguistic time machine.

05:28.000 --> 05:36.520
A new chapbook, Maybe the Sweet Honey Poor is forthcoming from Nion Editions.

05:36.520 --> 05:43.360
And last but not least, Stephen Massamilla is a poet, scholar, professor and painter.

05:43.360 --> 05:48.720
He holds an MFA in writing and PhD in English and comparative literature with a focus on

05:48.720 --> 05:52.040
poetry from Columbia University.

05:52.040 --> 05:59.000
His new multi-genre volume, Cooking with the Muse, won the Eric Hopper Book Award, the

05:59.000 --> 06:01.800
National Indie Excellence Award and others.

06:01.800 --> 06:06.760
His previous books include the award-winning poetry collections, The Plague, Doctor in

06:06.760 --> 06:15.480
His Holeshape, TAT, Forty Floors from Yesterday, and later on Aia, as well as translations

06:15.480 --> 06:20.800
of book length works by Neruda and a critical study of myth in modern poetry.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.680
Massamilla has published recently in hundreds of journals and anthologies.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.600
Again, the list is too long.

06:26.600 --> 06:32.560
Agni-American literary review, Barrow Street, Colorado review, Denver, quarterly poet,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.640
lower poet daily.

06:34.640 --> 06:40.400
He teaches literature and writing at Columbia University and the new school.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.760
Okay, that's it.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.320
I guess I have to get my microphone back.

06:46.320 --> 06:53.320
And yeah.

06:53.320 --> 07:11.960
If it works, can you hear me?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.760
I'm not going to talk much.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.080
Yes, is this all right?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.400
Okay.

07:18.400 --> 07:27.520
So I'm going to ask Steven to say a few words to begin the program.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.160
Very good.

07:30.160 --> 07:35.600
I would like to thank Anne Marie for that gracious introduction and thank all the panelists for

07:35.600 --> 07:40.200
being here today and thank everyone in the audience for joining us to share an afternoon

07:40.200 --> 07:42.600
talking about poetry.

07:42.600 --> 07:48.640
I've been tasked with the impossible mission of conveying to you the various strands of

07:48.640 --> 07:54.400
modern contemporary poetry and to do so in just a few minutes when it would normally take

07:54.400 --> 07:56.400
me about 400 hours.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.720
So I better get started.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.160
I thought I'd start by just pointing to something unusual.

08:03.160 --> 08:07.040
This is counterintuitive, but this project that Anne Marie mentioned, cooking with the

08:07.040 --> 08:13.440
muse, is a cookbook that's also a poetry book that contains hundreds of recipes and

08:13.440 --> 08:20.000
hundreds of poems and some recipes that could be poems and that's the most avant-garde aspect

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
of it.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.280
But I just thought I would point out some poems in the book to show you that they look different.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.840
These are all contemporary and some of them modern poems, but here's one called spice

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
reflection.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.120
It's a sonnet, a love poem set in a restaurant.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.640
I wrote this one myself.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.800
Oh, by the way, this one's paired with a recipe for duck cohen feet, spice with coriander

08:39.800 --> 08:43.880
and star anise, which is wonderful to make this time of year if you're not committed

08:43.880 --> 08:47.120
to having turkey for Thanksgiving.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.720
There are turkey recipes here too.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.480
The poem it's like to write about swans.

08:51.480 --> 08:56.520
The only problem with swan for Thanksgiving is that everybody fights over the neck.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.680
Here's a recipe.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.760
Here's another poem by Claude McKay, Harlem Renaissance Poet.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.840
You see it's also a sonnet.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.880
So without explaining what a sonnet is, you can see they look very much alike.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.360
Here's another one by the contemporary poet, Vietnamese American poet, Manglan.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.040
It's called love poem to spinach.

09:14.040 --> 09:21.960
As you see, all the lines are scattered across the page and it looks very different.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.000
And others might look more like, I mean, there are more sonnets by people from all

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
different.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.560
A supermarketing California by Alan Ginsburg and the first line of the poem is what thoughts

09:32.560 --> 09:37.000
I have of you tonight, Walt Whitman, and it's written in long with manian lines.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.680
So if these are all, and I write lines like that too, I don't just write sonnets.

09:40.680 --> 09:45.960
So the point I wanted to make is there's not one form that writers are writing in today.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.520
Some people may think that there's a 19th century way of writing that's all formalist

09:50.520 --> 09:53.600
and then there's a modern way of writing that's all open.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.880
But the terrain is much more complicated than that.

09:56.880 --> 10:01.560
So I thought I'd just mention briefly that there is even a group of new formalist poets,

10:01.560 --> 10:04.040
Dana Joya, Marilyn Hacker.

10:04.040 --> 10:08.040
You could think of many Alfred Corn, right.

10:08.040 --> 10:12.000
I mean, a lot of us can think of an example to a right almost exclusively in form.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.920
They write sonnets, they write villainels, and longer forms.

10:14.920 --> 10:20.400
This is not so different from what, at the beginning of the 20th century and the mid

10:20.400 --> 10:23.680
to late 20th century, many other poets were doing.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.680
Robert Frost wrote this way.

10:25.680 --> 10:30.240
McKay, the founding Harlem Renaissance poet, wrote this way, Auden.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.840
So I'm just going to let you know that group exists.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.760
But that's not what I'm going to focus on.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.040
Because modernism is often seen as a break with the past.

10:39.040 --> 10:43.520
Both a formal break, though I don't think it applies as much to that particular team.

10:43.520 --> 10:50.880
But also a break in thematic, a break in subject matter, and a break in approach to theme,

10:50.880 --> 10:52.880
both modality and theme.

10:52.880 --> 11:00.000
So what we see in a lot of contemporary poems is radical subjectivity or radical objectivity

11:00.000 --> 11:04.800
or fragmentation or an emphasis on alienation, displacement.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.880
These are themes that define our era in poetry.

11:08.880 --> 11:14.920
And in contrary distinction to that formalist school, I passed out a sheet that you can all look at.

11:14.920 --> 11:24.760
And I have a poem by the founding American father of modern American poetry, William Carlos Williams.

11:24.760 --> 11:29.040
When it emphasizes middle name is Carlos, he's a Puerto Rican American poet,

11:29.040 --> 11:33.280
also partly a Basque background, a first-generation immigrant.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.720
That's important to know that, to understanding his work, it's important to know that.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.480
On the right I have a poem by Archie Ammons.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.160
This is a contemporary poem.

11:41.160 --> 11:47.440
And you can see right away that the contemporary poem owes something or a lot to the William Carlos Williams poem

11:47.440 --> 11:50.840
of much earlier close to a century ago.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.880
So this is the group.

11:54.880 --> 12:00.720
I would put not only William Carlos Williams in this group, but also Gertrude Stein.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.080
And I'm going to define this group as the local American modernist group,

12:05.080 --> 12:08.640
as opposed to the formalist traditional group.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.360
And I thought, just start us off, why don't I just start us off by having us look at these poems

12:13.360 --> 12:17.760
so that we can get a feeling of understanding.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.160
So a lot of you know this poem, the Red Wheelbarrow.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.400
How many people have seen this before?

12:22.400 --> 12:23.960
How many people have heard of it?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.040
Okay, a lot of us have.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.160
How many people are still baffled by it?

12:27.160 --> 12:29.360
Don't necessarily understand it, right?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.200
Let me read it to you.

12:31.200 --> 12:35.760
The Red Wheelbarrow, and this is from a much larger work that is multi-genre

12:35.760 --> 12:41.040
and contains a lot of prose and criticism as well, all mixed together.

12:41.040 --> 12:49.520
So much depends upon a Red Wheelbarrow, glazed with rain, water,

12:49.520 --> 12:54.160
beside the white chickens, end of poem.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.720
And some people are perplexed by it nevertheless because it's not an exclamation.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.600
So much depends upon ex exclamation point.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.880
It's not a complex sentence that has a dependent clause in it.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.040
So much depends upon ex that y.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.440
It just says so much depends.

13:13.440 --> 13:19.040
And that people find a little bit agrammatical or unusual or asymmetrical.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.160
But Williams wants that effect.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.600
You can't, he's not writing a grammatical sentence.

13:23.600 --> 13:27.600
And he wants to do other things like separate the word wheel from the word barrow

13:27.600 --> 13:31.800
so that every word gets equal democratic attention.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.000
Similarly, if you look at the contemporary poem by Ammons on the right,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.640
the spring in her step has turned to fall.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.120
We just are watching a woman take a step.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.960
And we are also watching the season turn from spring to fall.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.440
And we land on fall.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.160
That's where the foot comes down.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.440
The poem is the action.

13:52.440 --> 13:56.520
The poem steers us in the direction that it is going in.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.840
And we could talk about it all day.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.960
You have no idea how much is going on here.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.040
But the point I want to state is that it's not in traditional form.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.240
It's everyday data.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.720
It's not a regular.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.720
It's not a lusive or aerudite.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.480
It's attuned to the immediate.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.040
And the politics of the poet are liberal.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.280
I could say that these are things that apply.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.000
These are characteristics that often apply to members of this team.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.640
And if we look back over the past century, who are some poets and some schools of poetry

14:25.640 --> 14:27.880
that were inspired by the local American modernists,

14:27.880 --> 14:32.640
I would say that includes the beat poets, such as Alan Ginsburg.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.800
And Williams even included some of Ginsburg's letters in his epic Patterson.

14:37.800 --> 14:42.760
It would include the New York School, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbury, who was a big,

14:42.760 --> 14:46.880
just died recently a big influence on everyone on this panel, I believe.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.040
Or at least on their friends, Frank O'Hara.

14:51.040 --> 14:57.680
And for example, Kenneth Koch's one of his most favorite famous poems is entitled

14:57.680 --> 15:00.240
Variations on a Theme by William Carlos Williams.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.280
You can see the influence just by looking at the title.

15:03.280 --> 15:07.600
And then there's Ted Berrigan and Ansem Berrigan, if you want a contemporary poet that's still

15:07.600 --> 15:09.880
very much influenced by the New York School.

15:09.880 --> 15:10.880
Ergene Young.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.000
There's also an objectivist group, Olson and Creeley, or the Black Mountain poets, they're

15:16.000 --> 15:18.880
sometimes called, or the language poets.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.400
And maybe we'll look in an example of language poetry in a few moments.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.440
But that would include Charles Bernstein and Lynn Hagenian.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.360
All of these poets claim that they love Williams.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.560
They're not particularly fond, for instance, of T.S. Eliot, the next poet I want to talk

15:33.560 --> 15:35.720
about.

15:35.720 --> 15:40.960
But that Manglan poem I showed you with all the words scattered across the page, very

15:40.960 --> 15:42.960
much influenced by Williams.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.560
And so it doesn't really matter.

15:44.560 --> 15:49.600
You can pick so many contemporary poets, Ellen Bass, Jane Hirschville, Manglan, they've

15:49.600 --> 15:55.640
all been influenced by the local American modernists, William Carlos Williams and Gertrude Stein.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.800
And their grandfather is Whitman.

15:57.800 --> 16:02.000
So for a graphic for this talk, we're originally going to start with an image of Whitman as

16:02.000 --> 16:05.120
the grandfather of American poetry.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.320
But what he really is, is the grandfather of this strand of American poetry, which has

16:09.320 --> 16:13.720
ramified this trunk that has ramified out and created many branches.

16:13.720 --> 16:18.800
But Whitman wanted to break the back of the pentameter, and embrace people from all backgrounds

16:18.800 --> 16:25.160
and all walks of life, and celebrate the flesh as much as the spirit.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.760
But then there's another group, and maybe I'll mention just one or two more groups,

16:28.760 --> 16:32.520
because I don't want to go on too long in this introduction.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.880
And that would be the classical modernist group.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.920
So how many people have heard of T.S. Eliot?

16:38.920 --> 16:44.560
Okay, how many people can recite a T.S. Eliot poem by Hart?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.600
That's a hard one.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.120
It's hard to do.

16:48.120 --> 16:52.680
It's harder to do than, but easier than to do with a Bernstein poem, for instance.

16:52.680 --> 16:58.120
But if we were to look underneath what I have here at the Red Wheelbar, as a sample, Mr.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.960
Eliot's Sunday morning service.

16:59.960 --> 17:06.240
Without even reading the poem, you'll see the first word is polyphyloprogenitive.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.640
No word is too difficult for Eliot.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.800
In other words, it wants to make poetry difficult, and it's deliberate.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.560
My students sometimes look for that word in Greek and Latin dictionaries, and they don't

17:16.560 --> 17:18.680
find it, because it's not there.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.640
Eliot made the word up.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.720
It means something like loving to produce much offspring.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.280
It has to do with the fertilization of eggs.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.440
It has to do with chickens in this sense, and I think we could compare it to the chicken

17:31.440 --> 17:33.960
poem by William Carlos Williams.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.720
And without reading the entire poem, the sapient settlers of the Lord, those would be the learned

17:38.720 --> 17:40.760
it sells people of religion.

17:40.760 --> 17:46.560
In the beginning was the word, in the beginning was the word, superfitation of tohen.

17:46.560 --> 17:52.640
That's a word in Greek that suddenly appears in the middle of his poem, and what he's talking

17:52.640 --> 17:59.280
about is how the learned it sells people of religion, theologians like Origen mentioned

17:59.280 --> 18:06.800
in the last line there who castrated himself to bring himself closer to God.

18:06.800 --> 18:11.680
Their enterprise is completely futile, because their work, the proliferation of interpretations

18:11.680 --> 18:15.840
they offer us, do not bring everyday people closer to the divine.

18:15.840 --> 18:21.560
And in that sense, Eliot's frustrated that the erudition and subtlety of these great

18:21.560 --> 18:27.760
thinkers is futile, and perhaps Eliot's own poem might be futile if he's trying to reach

18:27.760 --> 18:29.400
a deeper truth.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.640
And he was.

18:30.640 --> 18:36.160
With Ezra Pound, he formed a group of classical modernists who did not like conservatism.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.800
They did not necessarily want to preserve 19th century traditions.

18:39.800 --> 18:47.520
They wanted to reach back to something more titanic than rationalism, or then market economies,

18:47.520 --> 18:53.040
or then perfunctory practices of Christian rituals.

18:53.040 --> 19:00.880
They wanted to reach back to a renaissance of the Renaissance, the rebirth of the great

19:00.880 --> 19:05.160
rebirth of classical antiquity, and everything it signified for them.

19:05.160 --> 19:14.200
So they set the bar at high in terms of their erudition, and what they were seeking spiritually.

19:14.200 --> 19:22.440
And in their Eurocentric attitude that they were seeking to embody what is best in the

19:22.440 --> 19:25.440
mind of Europe, they believed that Europe had a mind.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.160
And Williams rejected all of this.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.480
He felt the poetry is not sacred.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.880
Poetry does not have a philosophical mission like this.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.800
It's not a regular.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.160
All those things I said about Williams, Williams hated Elliot.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.320
Elliot did not think much of Williams.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.040
Williams loved Stein, pounded Elliot work together.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.640
And you would think that Elliot wouldn't have many incarnations today, but I gave an example

19:47.640 --> 19:51.640
on the right of the contemporary poem Shiloh Church.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.920
And you can see right in the second line we get, plan Vistas milky with Jehovah's Calm,

19:55.920 --> 19:58.800
so an invocation of the biblical Lord.

19:58.800 --> 20:04.080
And it ends with the line in deserts, drop the odd white turds of bone, which is not a

20:04.080 --> 20:05.280
good omen.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.560
And basically this poet is suggesting that even those who were sacrificing themselves

20:10.560 --> 20:16.520
for the noble cause of ending slavery committed great slaughter and therefore believed that

20:16.520 --> 20:18.320
they were unredeemable.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.680
And so there's a great, or might not be redeemed or that they were sinful.

20:21.680 --> 20:27.760
And there's the same sense of futility and historicism and high language in this poem

20:27.760 --> 20:29.440
that we find in the Elliot poem.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.520
But these are not the only heirs of Elliot.

20:31.520 --> 20:35.600
And so what I want to suggest is that Elliot and Williams, if you put them together, if

20:35.600 --> 20:41.280
you take Elliot's classicism or at least his architecture and you combine it with Williams'

20:41.280 --> 20:47.920
local belief in local modernism, you get other groups of poets like the American Sublime,

20:47.920 --> 20:54.080
the Heart Crane, Wallace Stevens group, or the Confessional Poets, the Lowell and Plath

20:54.080 --> 20:58.640
and Sexton and Varyman, and I thought maybe I'd give you a couple of examples, one example

20:58.640 --> 21:02.320
of a Confessional poem and then I would pretty much end the talk there.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.240
But we have this one by Sylvia Plath, Lady Lazarus.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.840
Actually put it next to this line from Elliot in Prufrock, I am Lazarus.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.320
Come back from the dead.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.640
Come back to tell you all.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.280
I shall tell you all.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.400
There's another side to Elliot to balance their tradition.

21:18.400 --> 21:23.560
He often includes his own anguish or expressions of his own anguish in his work.

21:23.560 --> 21:28.840
And Confessional poets like Elliot in the Wasteland in this moment describes under that his wife

21:28.840 --> 21:30.640
having a nervous breakdown.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.240
My nerves are bad tonight.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.240
Yes, bad.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
Stay with me.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.240
Speak to me.

21:35.240 --> 21:40.200
And that passage ends with I think we are in Rat's Alley where the dead men lost their

21:40.200 --> 21:41.200
bones.

21:41.200 --> 21:45.640
So you can see the influence on the hill poem, the contemporary poem, but you can also see

21:45.640 --> 21:51.480
that Elliot is talking about a problem in his marriage, about a mental breakdown, about

21:51.480 --> 21:53.560
his wife's nervous breakdown.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.040
And she did end up in an asylum.

21:56.040 --> 22:00.800
And Elliot finished the Wasteland while making clay pots in a sanatorium.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.120
And he lets you know it in the poem.

22:04.120 --> 22:10.480
That's why his influence is so great because a lot of poets in the late 20th century and

22:10.480 --> 22:15.800
21st century are interested in revealing intimate details about themselves in their

22:15.800 --> 22:16.800
poems.

22:16.800 --> 22:21.240
So this poem by Sylvia Plath for example, in it she describes a suicide attempt or

22:21.240 --> 22:23.160
multiple suicide attempts.

22:23.160 --> 22:28.520
The second time I meant to last it out and not come back at all, I rocked shut as a seashell.

22:28.520 --> 22:33.760
They had to call and call and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.320
Dying is an art like everything else.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.640
I do it exceptionally well.

22:38.640 --> 22:41.400
I do it so it feels like hell.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.440
I do it so it feels real.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.080
I guess you could say I have a call.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.720
And then she did take her own life.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.320
So she's revealing how she feels.

22:52.320 --> 22:59.040
And Sexton took up poetry when her analyst suggested that it might be cathartic for her.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.040
It might be a way for her to deal with her postpartum depression.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.600
I also included here we don't have time to talk about it.

23:04.600 --> 23:09.720
In the lower left corner of Franz Wright poem, contemporary poet writing in the Confessional

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
mode.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.920
And on the next page poems by Tracy K. Smith and Ocean Bong, which I don't think are as

23:14.920 --> 23:20.440
raw and intense as the Plath poem, but are still in the Confessional mode.

23:20.440 --> 23:25.000
So Sharon Olds, there are many contemporary poets writing in this mode.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.840
And other groups that I don't really have time to talk about right now would include

23:27.840 --> 23:31.880
the postcolonial poets, Derek Walcott and Company.

23:31.880 --> 23:36.400
Or what do you think, for instance, of erasure poems?

23:36.400 --> 23:38.040
Is that a new kind of poetry?

23:38.040 --> 23:42.400
Or is that just a tool or a technique that poets use to inspire them?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.960
What about slam poetry, a new econ poetry?

23:44.960 --> 23:47.160
Maybe some of you have heard of that.

23:47.160 --> 23:53.160
Heavily influenced by the beat poets, but that's another possible group we could talk

23:53.160 --> 23:54.160
about.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.760
What about what's happening on the internet today?

23:55.760 --> 23:58.080
Tumbler poetry.

23:58.080 --> 24:02.240
Is that a good enough platform for poetry?

24:02.240 --> 24:04.320
What do people think about conceptual poetry?

24:04.320 --> 24:08.360
Maybe Anne Marie or others on the panel could explain what that's about some more.

24:08.360 --> 24:12.400
But the point I might end with is that I didn't really have time to talk about Walcott the

24:12.400 --> 24:18.120
way I wanted to, but there is also a multicultural postcolonial strand.

24:18.120 --> 24:21.200
And I want to suggest that poetry today is much more diverse.

24:21.200 --> 24:28.080
So the few strands I gave you merge and some poets are hybrid and there are a lot more

24:28.080 --> 24:33.320
women poets and there used to be a lot more openly gay poets and lesbian poets.

24:33.320 --> 24:40.600
So poets from Whitman to Ashbury were gay, but they didn't always write about that directly.

24:40.600 --> 24:45.960
A lot more recent immigrant poets or poets who write about their background and so forth

24:45.960 --> 24:46.960
and so on.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.440
So maybe that's one place to look for the difference.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.640
And I thought I would just open this up to the panel.

24:51.640 --> 24:58.680
Do people on the panel agree with this schema, with this map, or where do we want to take

24:58.680 --> 24:59.680
it from here?

24:59.680 --> 25:00.680
So.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
Yes.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.120
And I'm going to supplement Stephen's remarks.

25:04.120 --> 25:08.920
I'm going to give you the Twitter version of where we've come from and where we are

25:08.920 --> 25:09.920
now.

25:09.920 --> 25:15.120
And I'm very glad to look at these because these are examples of a lot of what's happened.

25:15.120 --> 25:20.120
American poetry today, we are very lucky to be readers of it, which brings me to the question

25:20.120 --> 25:21.880
and do not be embarrassed by this.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.640
How many of you actually read poetry regularly?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.640
Most people do not.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.680
Oh, that's wonderful.

25:28.680 --> 25:33.720
And a much bigger proportion than usual because usually today people remember poetry from

25:33.720 --> 25:37.440
college or they'll see a couple of poems in the New Yorker.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.280
They're not really conversant with it.

25:40.280 --> 25:45.760
But American poetry is definitely the most diverse energetic poetry in the English-speaking

25:45.760 --> 25:48.040
world today.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.480
How did we get here?

25:49.480 --> 25:52.240
That's what I'm going to talk about briefly.

25:52.240 --> 25:58.360
American poetry has always been marked by improvisation and very idiosyncratic invention,

25:58.360 --> 26:04.720
especially when we finally turn finally away from European models and from overvaluing

26:04.720 --> 26:08.240
all things European in the arts.

26:08.240 --> 26:15.480
In this century, the 21st, our poetry is fully, finally, triumphantly American.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.040
What does that mean?

26:17.040 --> 26:20.520
To better understand where we are now, we can look at where we've been.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.840
And here comes the Twitter version of it.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.360
American poetry has a forefather, Walt Whitman.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.640
And it has a foremother, Emily Dickinson.

26:30.640 --> 26:36.920
And in some sense, all later developments point to one or another of these wildly different,

26:36.920 --> 26:40.080
wildly idiosyncratic poets.

26:40.080 --> 26:45.520
They invented kinds of poetry the world hadn't seen before, which is still going on.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.240
And they also invented themselves.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.080
The invention of the self is a very American undertaking.

26:52.080 --> 26:57.040
And I would argue at the heart of what's happening in poetry right now.

26:57.040 --> 27:01.720
A good place to start in recent times, and this is supplementing or complimenting what

27:01.720 --> 27:09.080
Stephen said, start with the 1950s, marked by beat poetry, Ginsburg, and a competing formalism,

27:09.080 --> 27:12.720
very traditional poems, meter and rhyme.

27:12.720 --> 27:18.480
Think of Alan Ginsburg, whom I'm sure most of you have heard of, and Richard Wilbur, who

27:18.480 --> 27:21.840
really until 96, still going strong.

27:21.840 --> 27:26.800
In the late 50s and the early 60s, confessional poetry dominated as the new thing.

27:26.800 --> 27:29.120
And you notice this again as the self.

27:29.120 --> 27:34.320
But I would want to say that even when it purports to be your actual self, talking about

27:34.320 --> 27:36.640
what's going on in your life, it isn't.

27:36.640 --> 27:43.880
It's a linguistic creation of a self that speaks in the poem.

27:43.880 --> 27:49.840
Think of Ansexton, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, some of the people that Stephen mentioned.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.320
Oh, well, I hope that's not the first time.

27:53.320 --> 28:00.080
Here it is, in the late 60s and in the 1970s, language poetry arrives on the scene.

28:00.080 --> 28:05.200
And this is an avant-garde movement that's generated instant heated controversy.

28:05.200 --> 28:12.000
Traditionally, which I mean hundreds of years, a lyric poem was marked specifically by the

28:12.000 --> 28:19.120
creation of a single, stable speaking voice, and a poem that was led by the author to a

28:19.120 --> 28:22.960
certain conclusion, in other words, closure.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.440
Practitioners and theorists of language poetry insisted no.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.160
Language is speaking itself in any given poem.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.560
There is no stable single self or speaker.

28:33.560 --> 28:39.280
And a reader has to step in to create and make meaning out of a poem.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.720
No one authorial voice controls meaning in a poem.

28:42.720 --> 28:47.160
I think this is the most significant thing that happened in this very brief history.

28:47.160 --> 28:52.160
This poem also raises closure, bringing you to the neat end you'll be familiar with in

28:52.160 --> 28:54.080
any traditional poem.

28:54.080 --> 28:59.080
Instead, a poem is a process and it stays open-ended.

28:59.080 --> 29:04.200
These poetry wars raged for decades and they were heated.

29:04.200 --> 29:11.840
Uptown mainstream traditional versus downtown, experimental, innovative, resisting belief

29:11.840 --> 29:16.400
in a single self and in the authorial imposition of meaning.

29:16.400 --> 29:21.520
And you can think of the movements really geographically as centered Uptown, 92nd Street

29:21.520 --> 29:26.840
High, downtown, St. Mark's, and the poetry project.

29:26.840 --> 29:32.280
But what happened is that where we are now is that gradually poets writing simply took

29:32.280 --> 29:38.880
devices from every point on the poetic spectrum, a lot of which Stephen has touched on.

29:38.880 --> 29:45.760
So what were once bitterly thought and contested ideological matters simply were co-opted as

29:45.760 --> 29:51.960
techniques that a poet would deploy to expand his or her expressive range, which is very

29:51.960 --> 29:55.160
much what I do and almost everyone I know does.

29:55.160 --> 30:03.040
For example, collage, fragmentation, multiple voices speaking within a poem, disjunctive

30:03.040 --> 30:08.560
development, great big leaps from one thing to another, and very quick shifts of tone

30:08.560 --> 30:11.680
and speech registers.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.000
The distinctivity of distinctions between high culture and popular culture.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.120
So you could say no more Uptown or downtown, everybody's gone to Brooklyn, which is where

30:21.120 --> 30:22.760
we are now geographically.

30:22.760 --> 30:26.200
I'll say a couple more things.

30:26.200 --> 30:32.080
External conditions have radically impacted poetry today and one very important development

30:32.080 --> 30:36.640
in my opinion is the diminished influence of the gatekeepers.

30:36.640 --> 30:41.560
I don't want to put a particular, what I'd say the last 10, 20 years, to get your poems

30:41.560 --> 30:47.200
into publication you would pass through an elaborate series of people who put their imprement

30:47.200 --> 30:50.120
to her on yes, this is worthy of publication.

30:50.120 --> 30:56.640
But recently, journals and presses have proliferated and the web provides another very far-reaching

30:56.640 --> 31:03.200
and very different means of disseminating poems, which I'm happy polo is going to talk about.

31:03.200 --> 31:07.360
Which though certainly not all of the most interesting work in poetry is coming out of

31:07.360 --> 31:09.880
small independent presses.

31:09.880 --> 31:15.240
And there's no one kind of poetry that predobinates it, Stephen's also indicated.

31:15.240 --> 31:21.240
An anecdote here a few years ago, the National Book Awards, the five finalists for poetry

31:21.240 --> 31:28.800
were all from tiny little barely known presses, which understandably annoyed the more commercial

31:28.800 --> 31:33.360
and mainstream presses who after all as they pointed out were funding these awards.

31:33.360 --> 31:39.360
So that mistake got corrected in the next series of national poetry awards.

31:39.360 --> 31:46.240
At this moment, I conclude there is no center in American poetry, but at any given moment,

31:46.240 --> 31:51.720
one or another of these many strands you mentioned tend to be highlighted or spotlighted.

31:51.720 --> 31:57.640
So right now for example, we're hearing more from traditionally underrepresented voices.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.160
Here's an example.

31:59.160 --> 32:05.240
Besides Frank B. Dar who won the National Poetry Award this year, two of the four finalists

32:05.240 --> 32:11.200
drew on their experiences, African-Americans, and the third drew on her experience as a Lakota

32:11.200 --> 32:14.040
Indian, Native American.

32:14.040 --> 32:18.240
The other big thing that I notice and you'll all notice is as you'd expect there's an outpouring

32:18.240 --> 32:23.640
of poems responding politically to the dire situation, the country and in fact the world

32:23.640 --> 32:25.880
is finding itself in.

32:25.880 --> 32:31.520
I'm struck by the melding of political response with intense lyricism, which is something new

32:31.520 --> 32:35.280
in political or social response poetry.

32:35.280 --> 32:41.560
Ocean Vuon, you have an example there, his new book, his only book, Night Sky with Exit

32:41.560 --> 32:43.480
Wounds is an example of this.

32:43.480 --> 32:50.880
He is a Vietnamese-born refugee, but there is no center now and no one kind or kinds of

32:50.880 --> 32:55.320
poems that predominate.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.000
It's good that there's no center.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
I agree.

32:59.000 --> 33:08.280
One way in which you evaluate any country or any time period in literature is to go to

33:08.280 --> 33:12.200
see who's publishing these particular writers.

33:12.200 --> 33:19.360
For the poets especially, the literary journal, literary review, literary magazine however

33:19.360 --> 33:30.480
you call it, whether in print or online and if online, whether it also involves audio,

33:30.480 --> 33:38.000
that's there may be hundreds, probably more than a thousand literary journals and they're

33:38.000 --> 33:41.720
not all doing the same thing.

33:41.720 --> 33:48.000
There is going to be some overlap on what people consider to be good poetry.

33:48.000 --> 33:54.280
It will, in what Patricia and Stephen have talked about, they will be representing certain

33:54.280 --> 34:02.920
kinds of poetry, styles of poetry, certain modes, whether it's formal or not.

34:02.920 --> 34:08.080
But I think there's a kind of poetry for every kind of person.

34:08.080 --> 34:13.640
Unfortunately, schools where we get poetry from the beginning don't represent the wide

34:13.640 --> 34:20.120
variety of poems available that people are writing.

34:20.120 --> 34:29.120
Literary journals are the means by which poets get read.

34:29.120 --> 34:36.400
There should be wider reading of the literary journals but online there's a wider readership.

34:36.400 --> 34:41.960
It takes a long time to put together a collection of poetry as a book.

34:41.960 --> 34:46.200
So the magazines support writers and give them readers.

34:46.200 --> 34:53.360
They're stepping stones in some cases, some smaller magazines read the larger magazines.

34:53.360 --> 35:00.160
But one thing that they do represent is all the different subjects that you could be writing

35:00.160 --> 35:01.160
about.

35:01.160 --> 35:13.640
Surfing, beekeeping, art, science, math, money.

35:13.640 --> 35:21.120
No matter who you are, if you have an ability to write about something in the form of a

35:21.120 --> 35:30.880
poem, a poem can be a form of communication, a way to almost a different kind of language

35:30.880 --> 35:35.000
by which to talk about something.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.200
And it is also its own form.

35:39.200 --> 35:47.200
But so while there are many general interest literary journals, Barrow Street would be

35:47.200 --> 35:53.480
one, Kenyan review, Agni, all of those that are in essence interested in whatever you

35:53.480 --> 36:01.440
may want to send them if you write in the way that they deem is good poetry.

36:01.440 --> 36:07.240
There are lots of magazines that want very specific subjects.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.240
I don't know.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.600
That's an anthology on food.

36:12.600 --> 36:20.640
But there's a specific magazine called Alimentum, who's the publisher is a chef and a poet.

36:20.640 --> 36:25.080
And they take poetry and fiction and nonfiction about food.

36:25.080 --> 36:30.880
But the food verse contest out of literal latte is also an option.

36:30.880 --> 36:41.520
I have a huge number of my own poems in this book so we don't even know if it's an anthology

36:41.520 --> 36:43.600
or a book of recipes.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.000
But this is what we can do today.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.160
There doesn't necessarily have to be.

36:49.160 --> 36:53.600
The rules are there are lots of ways to blur boundaries.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.480
And there are lots of points I could pick up but I'll let you finish.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
Yes.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.120
And I would just want to mention that there's a poet laureate of the Union Square Green

37:02.120 --> 37:03.120
Market.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.440
There is a perfect example.

37:06.440 --> 37:16.120
There's never anything that you can't write about or some post you can't have in poetry.

37:16.120 --> 37:20.640
And for the time there are two off the bat that I can think of literary journals focused

37:20.640 --> 37:22.680
on work and being out of work.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.920
There's one called Draft Horse.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.360
And there's one called Work.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.720
That's an online magazine.

37:30.720 --> 37:36.240
And they have a very nondescript white sort of background so that if you want to read

37:36.240 --> 37:42.400
it at work and look like you're just looking at it, not looking at a magazine.

37:42.400 --> 37:49.080
But these are like any kind of work, blue collar, white collar, pink collar, sex work,

37:49.080 --> 37:52.480
volunteer, anything they say.

37:52.480 --> 37:57.400
There's Jay Journal, which is out of the John Jay School of Criminal Justice.

37:57.400 --> 38:04.760
And they want justice, just the letter J. There's the five two crime poetry weekly.

38:04.760 --> 38:12.560
And there's politics and ends up in most successfully and everywhere.

38:12.560 --> 38:21.760
But new verse news, the Boston Review, which is a magazine that doesn't have to take poetry

38:21.760 --> 38:31.600
on politics but has a focus overall in the magazine on progressive politics.

38:31.600 --> 38:39.480
There's pop culture and is wanted by many magazines, but it's all that barrel house

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
wants.

38:40.480 --> 38:45.080
Everything, poetry fiction, nonfiction, if it doesn't have pop culture, send it elsewhere

38:45.080 --> 38:46.240
they say.

38:46.240 --> 38:53.760
But Gargoyle, they like history and subculture and culture and pop culture.

38:53.760 --> 39:07.760
The largest areas now are the health injury illness death as represented in these magazines

39:07.760 --> 39:13.160
that come out of medical universities by and large.

39:13.160 --> 39:18.360
There's Bellevue Literary Review, which is actually out of NYU Medical.

39:18.360 --> 39:24.440
These are edited by doctors and nurses who may also be writers as well as some writers

39:24.440 --> 39:28.880
who are not in the medical fields.

39:28.880 --> 39:35.800
They want, that magazine tends to, so they ushered in this idea, but there are now, that

39:35.800 --> 39:41.960
I've counted 29 that come out of medical universities.

39:41.960 --> 39:49.720
There's the Healing Muse up in one of the SUNY colleges bioethics.

39:49.720 --> 39:54.000
They like a little more of a lyric poem than a narrative poem that Bellevue likes.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.120
And then there's hospital drive down in Virginia.

39:57.120 --> 40:03.480
There's one that's not associated with a medical program, Recovery, which is an online magazine.

40:03.480 --> 40:08.440
They spell it rk.v.ry.

40:08.440 --> 40:14.640
That's all for definition, well, among the, write something about, from one of the four

40:14.640 --> 40:22.840
definitions of recovery, which can include also obtaining usable resources from unusable

40:22.840 --> 40:27.680
sources, but it can also be recovery that isn't successful.

40:27.680 --> 40:34.720
You can write along a wide range of health and injury related subjects.

40:34.720 --> 40:42.840
And then the other big area is the nature environment ecology place.

40:42.840 --> 40:48.280
And if you, if you just want to write about the pleasure of nature and human interaction,

40:48.280 --> 40:53.000
Snowy Eagret is one, maybe eco tone.

40:53.000 --> 41:01.800
And if you want to write about the ecology, there's poecology, there's a precipitate journal

41:01.800 --> 41:11.320
and avel set and about place that are interested in the more environmental, the loss of nature

41:11.320 --> 41:16.120
rather than the pleasures of nature.

41:16.120 --> 41:22.400
And I don't know, there's step away magazine if you want to write about neighborhoods.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.400
There's just everything out there.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.960
That's a start.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.880
There's so much more I would say.

41:28.880 --> 41:33.960
But you know, and it goes into books, of course.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.480
There's one of my favorite more recent books is by Nick Lance.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.480
It's called We Don't Know We Don't Know.

41:40.480 --> 41:49.480
And he uses either Pliny the Elder or Donald Rumsfeld quotes.

41:49.480 --> 41:53.880
So the We Don't Know We Don't Know is a Donald Rumsfeld quote.

41:53.880 --> 42:00.680
And he uses elliptical, elliptical quality of those statements in poems about very serious

42:00.680 --> 42:03.800
things as well as humor.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.200
So even if we're just talking about poems about nature and place, I can think of a few

42:07.200 --> 42:12.120
more like terrain.org is just about the environment built or natural.

42:12.120 --> 42:16.760
And there are others like Appalachia people are going camping and want to read a poem when

42:16.760 --> 42:18.440
they're learning how to make a tent.

42:18.440 --> 42:24.560
So what Amy's suggesting is just the diversity and the range of subject matter that is sometimes

42:24.560 --> 42:27.280
a revelation to people.

42:27.280 --> 42:33.880
But to also speak to a point that, and I think that Paolo's going to want to pick up a little

42:33.880 --> 42:38.560
bit on the point about the homogenization in education or something like, no, okay,

42:38.560 --> 42:39.560
not necessarily.

42:39.560 --> 42:48.400
Okay, but I think I first want to pick up on the point that Patricia raised about

42:48.400 --> 42:52.960
the fragmentation of voices in contemporary poetry.

42:52.960 --> 42:58.480
And I was going to ask, how would we make a distinction then between, because there's

42:58.480 --> 43:03.800
one thing that I tried to point out is that we can draw a line from poets earlier in the

43:03.800 --> 43:06.680
modern era to poets who are contemporary.

43:06.680 --> 43:13.160
It seems that as soon as this was happening, as soon as modernism cracked the egg, so to

43:13.160 --> 43:14.160
speak.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.640
And I was suggesting, kind of giving an answer, Elliot kind of wanted to put the chicken back

43:17.640 --> 43:18.640
into the egg.

43:18.640 --> 43:23.800
But he ends his wasteland with a pistiche of different languages.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.320
And it's somewhat radical to a modern reader.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.440
He called it classicism, but it can look like craziness.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.000
The end of the wasteland goes like this.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.960
Shall I set my lands in order?

43:34.960 --> 43:40.680
And then the next slide is, por esas cosi ne que yafina cuando, fiam ootie keli down

43:40.680 --> 43:42.480
oo swallow swallow.

43:42.480 --> 43:48.520
And the plants that we tan ollato averi, these fragments I have short against my ruins.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.320
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.720
Why then I'll fit you.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.960
Hirani Mo is mad again.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.520
Datta, dham yatta, di yadvam.

43:59.520 --> 44:03.040
Chantish, shantish, shantish.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.320
So that's Elliot's version of classicism.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.160
But to us it might sound like craziness.

44:08.160 --> 44:14.120
More poets today in their embrace of different voices in different languages doing something

44:14.120 --> 44:16.080
different from what Elliot is doing.

44:16.080 --> 44:21.240
Well, I think what Elliot is doing in that sense is formal and technical.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.080
It's a tissue of voices.

44:23.080 --> 44:30.160
But I also want to suggest that Elliot had a pretense of objectivity in that he's writing

44:30.160 --> 44:35.480
about a disarray and a dissolution of Western civilization.

44:35.480 --> 44:38.840
But more and more when people read Elliot, it's pretty clear he's talking about his own

44:38.840 --> 44:39.920
psyche.

44:39.920 --> 44:44.320
And this is far more personal poetry than Elliot would ever have acknowledged.

44:44.320 --> 44:50.440
In fact, almost all of Elliot's notes and essays, and he's not alone among poets in doing this.

44:50.440 --> 44:57.680
Most poets develop anesthetics or a poetics that happens to be what they're doing.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.600
And he was no exception to that.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.680
In his view, you couldn't be subjective.

45:02.680 --> 45:06.840
You had to be objective, but almost everything he does is subjective.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.080
Here is what I would say about Elliot.

45:09.080 --> 45:14.000
The difference between Elliot and what happened in what I consider to be current happens in

45:14.000 --> 45:18.360
that fault line when you move to language poetry.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.360
And it's very connected.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.600
I don't know how many of you remember the 70s or have read about?

45:23.600 --> 45:25.480
They're intensely theoretical.

45:25.480 --> 45:30.360
That's where I may add importation mostly of European ideologies.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.240
Again, it's not really American.

45:32.240 --> 45:38.000
And that's what the cracking of the self is coming from.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.240
And where I would draw the fault line is really in a self-conception of the self.

45:43.240 --> 45:48.800
I think that what happened is people, both culturally and ideologically, lost the sense

45:48.800 --> 45:50.760
that they were one person.

45:50.760 --> 45:53.840
And now that doesn't mean there aren't people writing eye poems.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.840
Of course, there are.

45:54.840 --> 45:55.840
It's a lyric.

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
I did this.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.840
I love this one.

45:57.840 --> 45:58.840
I feel this way.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.920
But it's a constructed eye.

46:00.920 --> 46:05.680
And a stable self has simply dropped out of the equation.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.000
And that's where I would draw the distinction.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.640
That wouldn't have been something that Elliot himself writing about would have acknowledged

46:12.640 --> 46:15.000
or any of the other people.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.600
So I would draw it.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.880
Modernism is considered to be the cracking and destruction of the past.

46:20.880 --> 46:26.000
Postmodernism is considered to be a return to that, but in an ironic way.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.360
And I would want to suggest that what's happening now is really something different.

46:29.360 --> 46:34.320
And then it's back to that conception and reinvention of a multiple self.

46:34.320 --> 46:38.760
If you look, actually, if you think about yourself for a minute, aren't you kind of

46:38.760 --> 46:43.440
one person on Monday at four and another person Thursday at seven?

46:43.440 --> 46:49.000
And it's that sensibility that I think has crept across all of these different schools.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.840
And the one other thing I want to say is I think that we are, which is helpful, all

46:52.840 --> 46:58.120
of us, dividing poems and poets into schools and into movements.

46:58.120 --> 47:03.320
But when you come right down to it, every strong poet is a school of one.

47:03.320 --> 47:10.760
And these groups that we all do, that I did it myself, they're birds eye or schematic

47:10.760 --> 47:11.760
maps.

47:11.760 --> 47:17.520
But like a map, you know, if you get right down on the ground, an area that looks as

47:17.520 --> 47:18.720
if you could group it.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.840
No, there's a rock here.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.800
There's a pond here.

47:22.800 --> 47:27.280
And they are, in fact, quite individual and idiosyncratic.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.880
That would be my long answer to your somewhat short question.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Right.

47:30.880 --> 47:35.600
So we went from a time where people, especially those with a Eurocentric leaning, were having

47:35.600 --> 47:37.760
a crisis of faith.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.800
And they're representing a kind of trauma.

47:39.800 --> 47:44.760
Also associated with, you know, became a kind of trauma that a lot more people could relate

47:44.760 --> 47:46.840
to once World War I hit and so forth.

47:46.840 --> 47:52.000
And, you know, people asked if civilization was moving backwards as we just developed

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
greater weapons and greater ways of creating mass destruction and so forth.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.200
So there's a lot of trauma that underlies the fragmentation and even the fragmentation

48:02.200 --> 48:03.200
of voices.

48:03.200 --> 48:08.320
But what I think Patricia is saying is people, you know, across the modern era, writers and

48:08.320 --> 48:15.000
artists learned to also embrace the fragmentation and to see it as an expression of just ones.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.240
Well, think of it the way the Buddhists will say that there is no self that once fundamental

48:19.240 --> 48:23.880
humanity depends on not being attached to that ego.

48:23.880 --> 48:29.040
There's a tortured quality to some who let go of that ego and others celebrate that.

48:29.040 --> 48:33.000
And I think the ones that celebrate it more are more influenced by that local American

48:33.000 --> 48:34.200
modernist group.

48:34.200 --> 48:37.640
The fragmentation in Williams is very different from the fragmentation in Eliot.

48:37.640 --> 48:39.160
But I thought I'd give an example.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.280
I have this poem by Charles Bernstein.

48:42.280 --> 48:45.640
Just a fragment.

48:45.640 --> 48:53.280
And again, you know, the, well, this is, he sometimes categorizes a language poet and

48:53.280 --> 48:58.400
they trace their influence to new school poets who loved Williams.

48:58.400 --> 49:01.080
But take this harrow off my chest.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.040
I don't feel it anymore.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.440
It's getting stark to stark to see.

49:05.440 --> 49:11.800
I feel I'm barking at hell's spores, the new sentence.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.160
What is the eye in that poem?

49:13.160 --> 49:17.120
Is that the speaker or is that coming out of a Bob Dylan song?

49:17.120 --> 49:19.800
Or have I just given too much away?

49:19.800 --> 49:26.000
But you know, there's a way in which the part of the language is appropriated as earlier

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
modernists.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.600
Eliot Pound appropriated a lot of foreign languages and even whole lines from other

49:30.600 --> 49:31.920
texts into their work.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.440
But here it's much more playful.

49:34.440 --> 49:38.080
I don't think he's making some grand statement about civilization.

49:38.080 --> 49:42.800
And it's a medium for play.

49:42.800 --> 49:47.680
I'm barking at hell's spores, hell's spores, heaven's door.

49:47.680 --> 49:50.760
The words correspond and yet we're almost saying the opposite.

49:50.760 --> 49:54.560
But we're not really talking about hell the way a confessional poet would.

49:54.560 --> 49:59.160
I wanted to say I think actually this poem is about language poetry.

49:59.160 --> 50:06.000
The new sentence is a very influential book, criticism written by Ron Siliman.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Yes.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Right.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.880
And Charles Bernstein is based in the East Coast and the term language poetry is an arbitrary

50:12.880 --> 50:20.160
designation for a group of poets primarily in the Bay Area, some in the East Coast, who

50:20.160 --> 50:28.640
were reading marks very deeply and considering capital and its relation to language.

50:28.640 --> 50:34.480
And in the new sentence, Ron Siliman, he's exploring and I'm just generalizing here because

50:34.480 --> 50:36.920
he explores a lot.

50:36.920 --> 50:42.840
Parataxis, you have syntax where you have word order, right, determining meaning, then

50:42.840 --> 50:49.520
you have hypotaxis, which is the kind of sentence that James Baldwin was great at, a lot of subordinate

50:49.520 --> 50:50.520
clauses.

50:50.520 --> 50:58.760
And they have parataxis, which I think ancient Greek is in, where you don't really know

50:58.760 --> 51:02.520
every word isn't in its rightful order.

51:02.520 --> 51:05.000
And so that opens up meaning.

51:05.000 --> 51:14.000
And Gertrude Stein is considered to be still even a limit for language writing and a goddess

51:14.000 --> 51:22.400
and a god for language writers because her writing truly desenters, opens up the English

51:22.400 --> 51:30.240
sentence and maybe open as a euphemism, right, destroys it, right?

51:30.240 --> 51:38.240
And that has everything to do with her growing up hearing and speaking four languages, being

51:38.240 --> 51:46.960
queer, Jewish and occupied France, living in France as an American, right?

51:46.960 --> 51:53.880
And really writing at midnight till six in the morning, right, when everyone's asleep,

51:53.880 --> 51:54.880
right?

51:54.880 --> 52:00.120
And so your brain is not really paying much attention to word order at that time, right?

52:00.120 --> 52:03.920
But she embraced that negative capability.

52:03.920 --> 52:09.560
So I think also with Charles Bernstein, who I know personally, he's also interested in

52:09.560 --> 52:13.960
the tradition of Jewish comics coming out of the Catskills.

52:13.960 --> 52:19.600
And so there's a playfulness that is very specific to his work that you will not find

52:19.600 --> 52:21.720
in other language poets.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.720
But I'm so glad you mentioned playfulness, no quote.

52:24.720 --> 52:25.720
And so did Stephen.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.920
I didn't mean, please go on.

52:28.920 --> 52:31.200
Oh, okay.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.080
I just wanted to add my two cents.

52:34.080 --> 52:37.360
I don't have an elaborate outline prepared.

52:37.360 --> 52:42.120
I just want to say in terms of how I see poetry being different today, there's a lot more

52:42.120 --> 52:44.360
diversity, right?

52:44.360 --> 52:50.480
And by diversity, I mean, you have a lot of poets of color with first books, a lot of

52:50.480 --> 52:57.520
well, the last 35 years, I think there have been more female poets being published.

52:57.520 --> 53:03.760
But now you have a lot of poets of color, a lot more women poets, a lot of GLBT poets,

53:03.760 --> 53:09.080
a lot of trans poets were not just coming out with collections, but gaining visibility

53:09.080 --> 53:13.120
because their books are actually being given awards.

53:13.120 --> 53:18.120
I think the first book of trans poetry came up, came out two years ago, published by Night

53:18.120 --> 53:24.320
Poet Books, which published my last full collection.

53:24.320 --> 53:28.200
And you actually see poetry bestsellers.

53:28.200 --> 53:34.200
Claudia Rankine, who has a background in experimental poetry, she published Citizen, which has sold

53:34.200 --> 53:37.720
an astonishing number of copies, right?

53:37.720 --> 53:42.640
So maybe that also speaks to the moment that we're in that's unique, where we are dealing

53:42.640 --> 53:49.360
with social, right, in a way that we haven't before because of the mediums that are disposal

53:49.360 --> 53:52.160
to engage with it, right?

53:52.160 --> 53:58.520
So you have Rupi Karr, I don't know if you've read Rupi Karr, K-A-U-R, she's from Toronto,

53:58.520 --> 54:01.720
she's South Asian Canadian.

54:01.720 --> 54:08.400
She was publishing her poetry on Tumblr, I believe, and a mass or Instagram, and a mass

54:08.400 --> 54:16.640
like a following of two million followers, and she's published three books of poems that

54:16.640 --> 54:22.120
are bestsellers, number one on Amazon, everywhere, right?

54:22.120 --> 54:27.960
And you couldn't see more diverse aesthetics in these two best-selling poets, right?

54:27.960 --> 54:34.520
They have a very popular populist poet and Rupi Karr, and then you have Claudia Rankine,

54:34.520 --> 54:38.800
whose work is challenging, right?

54:38.800 --> 54:47.240
I also wanted to say perhaps these sensations are also made possible because of social media.

54:47.240 --> 54:55.480
I don't think Claudia Rankine has a very palpable digital footprint, but certainly her press

54:55.480 --> 54:56.800
does.

54:56.800 --> 55:01.920
Most poetry publishers, let's bear in mind, like most of us poets are published by small

55:01.920 --> 55:04.720
presses, it's a gift economy, right?

55:04.720 --> 55:09.880
But let me correct that by saying their poets were making a lot of money these days, and

55:09.880 --> 55:11.720
they have careers, right?

55:11.720 --> 55:18.680
But social media, you get on YouTube, you get on Instagram, you know, Lin-Manuel Miranda

55:18.680 --> 55:24.560
was in the White House dropped that Hamilton piece, and that was it, right?

55:24.560 --> 55:28.360
I mean, it's more than that, he worked his butt off for that and it was a build up, but

55:28.360 --> 55:35.920
yeah, social media can really give you a visibility and then an agency that poets 10 years ago

55:35.920 --> 55:38.720
couldn't enjoy, right?

55:38.720 --> 55:43.440
Now having said that, and I mentioned poets have careers now, there's a professionalization

55:43.440 --> 55:45.720
of poetry, right?

55:45.720 --> 55:48.600
Like you have career tracks as a poet.

55:48.600 --> 55:51.960
Poets have agents now, right?

55:51.960 --> 55:55.800
They do, like they have agencies, there are three big agencies now.

55:55.800 --> 56:00.480
If you want a book of poets, you got to talk to their agent, right?

56:00.480 --> 56:02.720
That's relatively new, right?

56:02.720 --> 56:07.760
They used to be exclusive to folks' big names, you know?

56:07.760 --> 56:15.400
But now it's not so exclusive, folks with first books that make a mark digitally, they

56:15.400 --> 56:17.320
had agents, right?

56:17.320 --> 56:23.880
And that's also, I think, a phenomenon made possible because of rise in prominence and

56:23.880 --> 56:26.560
prevalence of the MFA.

56:26.560 --> 56:29.520
MFA programs, right?

56:29.520 --> 56:35.640
That's a master of fine arts, so creative writing programs, which we're not nearly so

56:35.640 --> 56:38.160
numerous even a few decades ago as they are now.

56:38.160 --> 56:42.960
Now every university and community college has one, right?

56:42.960 --> 56:48.760
So probably you seem to be saying that it's something of a mixed bag that there might

56:48.760 --> 56:54.320
be poets that we've heard of like Rupi Kaur, but at the same time you're saying that

56:54.320 --> 57:01.720
that getting known might depend on the internet or depend on how a press promotes the work.

57:01.720 --> 57:07.960
And yet to take the Rupi Kaur example then to write in a way that's suitable for an

57:07.960 --> 57:13.560
Instagram post, you have to write really short poems that would appeal to everyone, and you

57:13.560 --> 57:17.800
might actually sell over a million books between one and two million books when you put them

57:17.800 --> 57:24.960
together in a book, but is this really the way to construct the best poems, is online

57:24.960 --> 57:25.960
construct?

57:25.960 --> 57:30.200
Because I mean, poesis, the Greek word means a made thing.

57:30.200 --> 57:35.480
Is there enough of an artifact there or enough agency on the part of the poet?

57:35.480 --> 57:40.000
Or is it a matter of pursuing what's trending or a matter of pursuing the bigger audience

57:40.000 --> 57:41.920
as you move?

57:41.920 --> 57:47.360
And does that take us out of the creative space that a lot of poets would want to operate

57:47.360 --> 57:48.360
in?

57:48.360 --> 57:51.440
And that's a question that you might be raising.

57:51.440 --> 57:57.360
Well, I guess in terms of, I mean, there's no questioning taste, and I'm always hesitant

57:57.360 --> 58:00.360
to sort of qualify a poet's work.

58:00.360 --> 58:03.480
I'm always mindful of Gertrude Stein's reception.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.480
Right.

58:04.480 --> 58:05.480
Right.

58:05.480 --> 58:10.560
Look, now she's undeniably one of the greats and she's still influencing poets.

58:10.560 --> 58:16.720
But what fascinates me about Rupi Kaur is the platform that enabled her success.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.720
Right.

58:17.720 --> 58:18.720
Instagram.

58:18.720 --> 58:22.880
Which is also the platform, Instagram, Twitter, you got to have a Twitter handle.

58:22.880 --> 58:28.120
You don't have to, but that's how a lot of poets coming up are thinking.

58:28.120 --> 58:34.760
Like they feel that it's incumbent on their career that they have a digital presence or

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
digital citizenship.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.920
Get an Twitter account.

58:38.920 --> 58:42.240
You have a nice author photo that gives you traction.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.240
Right.

58:43.240 --> 58:45.720
But it makes you write very short poems.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.240
Not necessarily.

58:47.240 --> 58:51.640
I think what's interesting then maybe for me, my question would be, well, let's talk

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
about that.

58:52.640 --> 58:57.880
Like these platforms that are enabling greater visibility for poets.

58:57.880 --> 58:59.600
And then we can talk about the poetry after.

58:59.600 --> 59:04.760
I always am mindful of the fact that myself personally, I've been Facebook free for eight

59:04.760 --> 59:05.760
years.

59:05.760 --> 59:06.760
12 point.

59:06.760 --> 59:16.200
This is way before the fake news scandal.

59:16.200 --> 59:21.560
But I was always very uncomfortable about it just because it was so distracting from writing

59:21.560 --> 59:23.120
poem for me.

59:23.120 --> 59:28.320
It's so hard to do that to begin with.

59:28.320 --> 59:32.720
And so what I think my point is that you've got Tumblr, you've got Facebook, you've got

59:32.720 --> 59:37.200
Instagram, Twitter, they're owned by billionaires.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.200
Right.

59:38.200 --> 59:48.880
So there's an inescapable matrix there of poetry and capital that is new but is not

59:48.880 --> 59:50.200
discussed.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.680
Right.

59:51.680 --> 59:59.040
So I think as a poet, what you make your poems on now is definitely something that I think

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.360
about.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.960
And who am I giving it to?

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.040
Not to be a paranoid or anything but I think about it because I'm going to be giving money

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.400
to, I don't want to get, you know, I can fight the power on Twitter but what's his name is

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
cashing it in?

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.360
A person who runs Twitter.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.000
You're probably looking at the only two Facebook free poets in the country.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.520
You're gathered right here.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.000
Dead.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.960
It's, you know, the professional, I'm thinking about it just in what's come up two things.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.800
One is the professionalization of poetry which is actually an odd and rather modern thing.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:41.320
There didn't used to be a career track but there absolutely is now complete with resumes

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.920
and credits in a mess.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.480
That's partly because although there are some poets on the net and that's just going

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.600
to increase who can actually make money at this.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.480
Most poets still cannot.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.440
They're dependent on a day job and the day job has increasingly been in the university

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.800
which has also had an effect on the poetry.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.560
It's a cyclical feedback kind of thing I think.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.160
And then the second part of that that I wouldn't want to lose is play which you brought up

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.840
and which Paolo brought up.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.200
You can forget about all of this that the purpose of poetry is pleasure and the way to

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.000
read a poem is to immerse yourself and experience the poem and you mentioned negative capability

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.600
and it was Keats thing about poetry is ruined for many people.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.600
I'm happy that I read it way before I ever got any of it in school.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.160
It's taken into school and what is this poem saying?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.280
No, that's not what poems are doing.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.840
What they're doing is setting forth something in a dance with the language that creates

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.840
pleasure, play and the meaning of the experience which you will only feel if you let yourself

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.320
experience it.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.840
So as though we're trying to map it here we all know and you all know too that's really

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.440
not the poetry escapes that and it's not where it should be.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.920
It's only a useful way of doing it.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.480
I don't know what's going to happen.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:06.720
I still don't, when you look at the history of poetry which I tend to take a long view

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:15.080
of, really a very long view of, going back actually a couple thousand years, what survives?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:21.520
What survives of people's poems at the most is a handful of really good poems and I think

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.000
that's going to be the same thing.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.800
That isn't to say that I don't have a negative or positive view of what's going on now.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.760
It's one way of disseminating it.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.800
Claudia ranking to me is a superb poet.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.400
I really love her work.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:42.520
And what she did in her book particularly called Don't Let Me Be Lonely is she put all

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:48.040
kinds of logos and things from newspapers and all kinds to give you the felt sense.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.360
What is it like?

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.520
What does it feel like to be an American at this moment?

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:56.160
I really don't know any book that does it as well.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.800
That's what poetry can do.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.440
But the other thing I'd say is that Keats referred to poets as possessing negative capability

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:10.520
which is the ability to take something in without he said any irritable reaching after

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
reason.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.880
I would want to suggest that that's not about poets.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.840
That's about the way everybody should be reading poems.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.080
You should look at your own response first.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.720
And then you can say afterward, well what in this poem gave me that response?

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.360
And the last thing I'd say is about poetry always pulling two ways.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.840
It's language so it may look more intellectual to people than it in fact is.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.880
But it's words on a page and in one way they're pulling toward meaning but in the other way

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:43.120
they're pulling toward sheer play, tending toward music and that's where you see Stephen's

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.840
great examples.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.400
Even look at the Bernstein, look what he's doing with rhyme in there.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400
W.H.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:58.560
Auden when he was judging the Yale series, Younger Poets, he said and he also edited a book called

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:04.000
Good Bad Poetry which was just a whole lot of things, Ogden Nash kinds of things and

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.720
liberal kinds of things and he said, I have much more confidence in a poet who is just

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.080
playing around with everything.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.280
Reverse of it than I do in anybody who is more purportedly serious.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.960
So that would be my take on this phenomenon and I like Paolo have no idea what's going

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.480
to happen now that you can sell a million copies of something.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.960
I still think a handful of poems are going to survive of anybody's.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:37.280
Well, it is very hard to know the trajectory of something that's very big at one time

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.080
might not be so significant later.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:46.080
To take an example from England, we went back a hundred years, the most renowned poet would

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.360
be Robert Bridges poet laureate of England and an unknown poet who he was actually aware

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.760
of but nobody knew who he was was, Dr. Anli Hopkins.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:02.000
Hopkins was published, he died in his 40s, was published after his death and if you look

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.840
at anthologies, there is some point where Robert Bridges disappears and Hopkins becomes

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:13.320
because he invented his own language, becomes the forebear of a whole, you know, talk about

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.640
play, you know, a dappled, dawn drawn falcon.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:20.920
Is that a falcon drawn by the dawn or is that a falcon drawn like a picture in the dawn

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.120
or is the dawn drawing the falcon?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.720
He just created compound complex words that no one had ever seen before in language combinations

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.480
and I think there are poets now doing them just to talk about play so I'm segging into

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:40.000
this comment on play, you know, like Bill Nott who invented his own language or Joan

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.280
Houlahan, I mean, most people don't know who they are because people really want narrative

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.280
very often.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:53.440
That's something they can get right into but those poets are not all that well known necessarily

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.440
but they might end up being much more important in the long run and so it takes a while for

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.160
all these things to sort out to talk about reception.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:09.880
Well, I want to also add in about play and also about the platform and back to the editors,

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:16.960
the more curious and flexible editors of magazines is that if you do, there are Twitter, there

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:24.680
are a lot of magazine editors who are on Twitter and they, and so if you're a poet, you can

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:33.600
find out about things and they post when poems are published but they also have Twitter-specific

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.200
contests and little things.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.040
So you're writing these tiny things.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.920
So maybe it's not what you're going to do all the time but it's another way in which

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:50.600
to play and be confined by something and then to create within a form which is part of what

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.840
poetry does and other platforms are like that.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840
Well, Iku and perfect that.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:04.480
Well, yes, they do have specific Iku ones but they also have other kinds of poems and

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:10.880
then you can also do it with us as we know a series of tweets can create a poem.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.080
You don't have to, just like it can be a rant.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:25.160
So I would say that the language is first, I agree, in a poem and just what that language

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:31.080
is matters to a whole lot of different people in a whole lot of different ways.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080
So, yes.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:42.800
Well, one would think, I mean, Natasha Saye asked Campbell McGrath who does really interesting

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:51.280
work with pop culture and so forth but that makes political statements.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.760
What do you think of Twitter approaches over?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:08:01.040
He said it seems like now because we have these short-form platforms that would be perfect

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.040
for haikus and everyone would be writing great haikus but that's not really happening and

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.760
perhaps because it's all disposable.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.760
It's a disposable context and people don't really want to stop and think about a poem

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.640
all day, they want to keep swiping.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.440
And poetry really requires sustained attention.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:27.080
The play is play but it takes a while to sink in and it's a very kind of artful chaos even

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.960
when it looks chaotic.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.480
For example, if we look at the Gertrude Steinpung which strikes me, I put it next to the Bernstein

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.080
poem because it's also based on music.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.320
People will look at it and see sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet tea, Susie

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.840
Asato, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet tea, Susie Asato.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.760
First of all, it sounds good so we're already, there are things we like to say like when

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.800
Wallace Stevens says, be, be, finale of scene, you just want to keep saying that and I think

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.040
that's part of the appeal.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.400
So, I realize that Susie Asato is a flamenco dancer and she's imitating, I wouldn't say

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.520
imitating because she's not a representative poet, she's embodying the sound of the flamenco

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.520
dance.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:10.600
And I wish I could stand up and dance a little bit but it's like, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.440
sweet, tea, Susie Asato.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:20.960
So the language is its own music and then if you look at the syntax, there's no one

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:27.720
more radical today, Susie Asato is a told trayshore, a lean on the shoe, this means slip slips

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.720
hers, it's completely ungrammatical but people will even look at told trayshore and they'll

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.520
see a tray there and maybe the tea could go on a tray and that would be domestic calm

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.360
that could contrast with the passion of the flamenco dancer or maybe trayshore is T.R.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.480
E.S., S.U.R.E. like the French word Tleisue or maybe it's treasure like something we really

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.480
value.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:55.000
And the opportunity to just play with words and associations is great and yet she didn't

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.760
want us to as say a confessional poet like Plath or a poet like Elliot might have wanted

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.120
to say, you know, I think we are in Vat Sali where the dead men lost their bones, you say

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.520
Vat Sali could be the trenches of World War I, you're comparing the breakup in your marriage

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:16.280
to world, to a battle and she didn't want to do that, she wanted to get the words clean,

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:22.680
to wipe them free of the associations with which you come to them and you know it's

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.720
striking to see how much the language poets can resemble a poet who really just founded

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.040
the movement you know much earlier in the modernist era.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040
So but Stein actually was trying to be a bestseller, right?

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:43.360
She wrote books that she would like be on the way out of Vat Sali, to make money and be

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.360
a bestseller.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.360
She became the bestseller.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360
But she felt bad about it.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.640
She planned it right like this, but she couldn't get published.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:57.600
But you know what she never was accepted as much in the you know in the ivory tower and

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.880
you can find this you know with the poet, there are those who are accepted more in that

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:07.240
kind of, it's the way the beat poets had a hard time getting accepted as establishment

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.680
writers, they were viewed as activists who just, the way perhaps their followers of the

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.880
New Yorkan poets today and slam poetry.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:20.680
And some of it is not good, I mean we have to admit because it's poetry for everybody,

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.600
but some of it you know is based on written poems that are actually, that's why I put

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.800
a slam poem next to a Ginsburg poem so you can see the you know really it's obviously

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.360
coming out of Ginsburg.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:37.600
But people are still writing like this, I'm not going to read it to you, but it's very

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.520
political as Ginsburg was and as Whitman was.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.800
Different kinds of political you don't have to be, you know like the social issues are

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:56.480
a political way of you could write about violence, you could write about not being able to find

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:03.240
a job, you could write about all kinds of social issues and be in a in a in some way

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:10.960
or have a social conscious without it being the upper politics of you know what's happening

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.760
in the presidential office.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.320
There are all kinds of politics and then there's a and then you can have it almost

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:26.160
back rounded in a poem, you can you know they're all different ways and again lots of bissat

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:33.800
and you mention New Yorkan because another way in which poets are supported in by support

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:40.440
not just you know being heard, having their poems heard is by giving readings or performances

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:46.600
of their work and that's another, there's a set of people who are running regular reading

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:55.440
series around any, around the country in any city and in suburbia to libraries, cafes,

01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:07.280
bars, universities, literary centers and those people are also flexible in who they present

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:14.280
and it's up to the audiences just as it's up to the readers to help determine who should

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:21.840
be, who should continue really being heard and part of what everybody loved Gertrude

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:26.120
Stein was because she was so different, they liked that they didn't, she didn't make the

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:29.280
ivory tower certainly once it came after.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.560
But they were just what they wanted.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.120
They wouldn't publish this stuff, they she had no idea.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.280
No, the later people loved her.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:43.480
But even so apparently in an archive of Yale there's a thousand pages of unclamat writing.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.960
I think how much poets loved her now.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.360
The poets based on self.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.680
We forget because we you know we edit when we look back at history, we forget how radical

01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:00.120
and how maligned she might have been in certain circles and that's what I'm saying but it

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.080
is tricky because there are, you know you go to some open night night and people are

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.680
reading off you know cocktail napkins and a lot of it is just awful and that could be

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:14.000
true of a lot of slam poetry but if it's a gateway drug that brings people into the art

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.960
form maybe that's all that matters sometimes.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:21.840
But there are lots of people who believe that yes in performance writing that it really

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:27.440
ought to work on the page or be more about this so you know there is good and bad in

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:34.000
every yeah and we know that the more that we are immersed in our own field there's

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.440
always the good and the bad.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.720
The poets used to have it all.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.880
I mean there was the Iliad and then you know two millennia later there was war in peace

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:46.960
and it all the popular genre became the novel and so a lot of questions that what poet struggle

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.400
with is how to reach that audience without you know because we don't want to say what

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.840
reaches a bigger audience is better or that what's even what's more moral is better.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.360
I mean that seems desirable but you know maybe that's not possible maybe there could be you

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.800
know just because it's well meaning it doesn't always mean that it works as great art but

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.080
there is that challenge to try to reach out and at the same time preserve a certain amount

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:21.440
of integrity and I think I don't know maybe I'm just free associating what do you think.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.080
So but at the same time I think these avant-garde movements even when they're a little bit rough

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:32.480
around the edges often have much more to them than people recognize at the time.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.640
So people might have looked at that Richard Simon thought it was just drag.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:43.960
I mean and now I think a lot of people reject a lot of work because they think that it's

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.840
not formal enough for them or but they also reject it because they think the opposite.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.960
You know maybe it's to ivory tower.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.520
So I think everything has to be taken on its own term.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.480
I'm not sure the ivory tower in that sense really exists anymore.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.120
I know exactly what you're talking about but that's what I meant by the gatekeepers

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.560
are gone and that has also to do with the way MFA programs have moved into the universities.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.960
It's a feedback loop both ways.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:13.520
But isn't that a kind of gatekeeper system because there are all these programs where

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.800
people are taught to write a certain way.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:20.480
They can't start with the spoken word the way writers of the Iliad did and then move

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.480
on to something else.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.480
They have to start writing short poems that follow certain criteria.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.000
I don't really think that's true about MFA programs.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.760
I think they get a bad rap.

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.960
I think it just depends who's teaching them.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.960
I understand what you mean.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.240
It does put a certain constraint around what's happening.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.240
You know the common thought about MFA programs is they're just producing a lot of people

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.120
who are writing perfectly crafted poems, all of them a muchness and nothing really exciting.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:51.200
But you know in any age there's only ever been a couple of people who were any good

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.200
and would last.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.040
All you have to do is look at the 16th century when the sonic comes along.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.160
I unfortunately have looked at these.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.000
There are hundreds of these utterly forgettable sonic sequences that were extremely popular

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.560
in their own day.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.520
And I think that's the equivalent of what's happening now.

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:12.800
You know we don't know till 50 or 100 years who the people are going to be that people

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.800
will still be reading.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.000
We can't tell that now.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.880
But I think they're there.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.280
And I don't see formal academic rejection the way they're used to be.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.360
They're certainly what where you wouldn't let certain things in and you would just let

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.480
the curriculum alone if you looked at it.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.600
It's broadened in a certain way that I don't know.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.560
I can think of a large number of poets though that talk a lot about how much rejection they're

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.680
getting and so forth.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.400
So it's not as if there is I mean there are certain rules you're supposed to follow.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.400
Think even about poetry books.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.440
What if you tried to write a poetry book that you didn't put any blurbs on it and there

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.160
was nothing on the cover.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.360
This would affect its reception.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.360
That's the perfect.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.360
That's the professionalization.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.200
At the same time I think Rope Rope Kord go back to her.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.520
She published herself.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:14.840
I think she self published and then it sold so many copies on Amazon and then a big press

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.640
latched onto her.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.080
And that's what's happened now.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:26.960
So I do agree with you that the MFA is really powerful right now.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:35.120
The desire to write poetry and publish a poet feeling incumbent to enroll in the MFA.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:40.040
And unfortunately most MFA programs only admit 10 people per year.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.280
So there is gatekeeping that's happening and who gets to teach in these programs.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:52.280
It's sort of like connect the dots and the template for poetry that in the MFA programs

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.760
is adopted is still the traditional lyric narrative poem.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.360
Which is a long tradition.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:08.360
And so if you are writing left of center, if you are exploring performance poetry, there

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.720
are programs that would would over accept you.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:17.040
But you have to do a little bit of research and perhaps the great equalizer or the great

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:23.200
Satan depending on who you ask is the internet where you're a reader I think you're at a

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:29.440
very golden age for experiencing so many different types of poems and poets more so

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440
than ever before.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.800
And to your point that's it.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:35.720
There's another way now.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.640
It's another instance of gatekeeping.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.640
Gate's falling down.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640
No gatekeepers there.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.240
On to the net.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.560
To go to performance poetry for a minute because that's so important.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:48.400
I mean poetry began obviously in the oral tradition.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.600
There are no cultures ever been without poetry.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:55.200
And really until very recently there were still cultures like in Yugoslavia when people

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.040
wanted to know about Homer.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.640
They sent somebody to Yugoslavia where they were still repeating epics orally.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.400
The tradition it's gone now but only the last like 40 years something like that.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.400
But here's the thing about performance poetry.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.640
I agree with Amy.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.320
There is no kind of poetry that doesn't yield.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.160
I think we all agree with this.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.080
Really good instances of what it is.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.400
It's not the kind of thing you're doing.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.280
It's how well are you doing it.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:26.600
So for performance poetry the question is if you want to translate it you may take the

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.960
position that you don't want to translate it to the printed page.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.840
You are only about the spoken word.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:37.080
But if you want to translate it then you have to put it on the printed page so that a reader

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.480
who is unaccompanied by you reading it will hear what it ought to sound like.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:45.960
Which I think a number of performance poets are able to do to make that transition from

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.960
one to the other.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.480
It's because there's also a lot of publishers publishing.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.360
A lot of performance poets who want to be published in book form.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.920
So it's not just that they want to remain in the performance.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.920
No, no, I'm saying that.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.840
Yes, I'm going along with that.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:13.200
So it is hard to regain the oral tradition but this might be one way in which we're reminded

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:21.120
of it and that certain groups of poets are keeping the eye on what poems sound like when

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.120
they are read out loud.

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:28.960
And I think that really if a poem to be worth its salt it has to sound right.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.960
Yes.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.720
And Amy brought up readings which is a good thing.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:36.240
Buildings have proliferated, it's another way of disseminating it and I noticed just

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.760
from when I used to go to readings when I was a lot younger poets read terribly.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:45.080
They were almost embarrassed to be reading as if it were something that took away from

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.480
the sacredness of the page so they would read in a certain poetry voice to understand

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.720
anybody which was over-inflated and pretentious.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.280
I opened the door to the twilight.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.160
It was unbearable.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.160
There's been a feedback loop where poets read much better, they write differently because

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.480
they're reading to audiences.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.200
You know it works when you're reading a poem.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.960
My poem's got a lot better when I started doing a lot of reading because I understood

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.960
what worked not just on a page in reading.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.960
So I would want to add that too.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:15.960
Yes.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.240
I want to say that I actually disagree.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.200
I think the oral tradition has never been more popular.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.680
In fact, I'd say the most popular poetry has never been more popular if we are going

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.240
to keep an open mind and accept hip hop and rap.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.560
Oh, that's what I say.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:37.800
And it's because of hip hop and rap that we have seen tremendous diversity in terms of

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:43.320
young people who are taking a chance at expressing themselves and instinctively going to the

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320
poem.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.720
But it's actually not instinctively because they've grown up listening to this very old

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:56.400
tradition of poetry, oral poetry, which is, and rappers are great poets of our age.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.400
I know I agree with that.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.400
They're just not straight white nails.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.600
I'm not sure what made you think I was disagreeing with that.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.160
I'm saying the opposite.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.720
That readings are one of the most important ways that the oral stuff is disseminated.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.120
And I also would want to say if you look at a poem, I hope people go and read lots of

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120
poems.

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:20.240
If you go look at a poem, it's ego that gets in the way when you're a grown up.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.760
When you're a kid you hear something.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.400
Think about the way kids parody a poem.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:33.480
Remember, like a match and watch the schoolhouse burn to ashes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:34.480
sort of thing.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:39.160
They just look at a poem and they don't feel that they're challenged to understand it.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:43.400
And if you go back as an adult and you just read a poem, the best way to pick up your

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.560
poem, it's just read it aloud and listen to yourself.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:50.840
And if you do that a couple times, you will understand what that poem means.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.560
It will come into you because that's where it is.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:59.520
But one thing about rap is that it is performed with instrumentation or with singing voices.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.360
And I think that it also has a lot more followers than poetry.

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:08.000
I mean, we're talking the, you know, the, not just, I mean, I say it's unheard of to

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.960
sell a million poetry books, but to sell rap music, I've heard out for a song to go platinum.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.720
It's no big deal, really.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:21.040
So the question the poet's always asking themselves is how, especially in this day and age where

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:27.880
there are some poets just like conceptual poets that are using appropriated material and there

01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.080
is no political meaning to what they're doing.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.440
It's not about social engagement.

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:38.120
And right next to that, we've got other writers.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.960
I think Powell mentioned the diversity of poetry today.

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.840
I mean, I mentioned the Harlem Renaissance.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.680
We can draw a line from there to the Black Arts movement of Brooks and Baraka and how

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.640
activist they were in their time.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:58.080
But, you know, if you go to St. Ross, you know, I don't know, Ross Gay's poem on Eric Garner,

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.960
even if he makes an important statement or a sensitive statement about that, who will

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.120
really see that?

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.080
How, except other poets.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:07.320
And so it's a question we have to ask.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.240
Is there a way to, that poets can reach out, especially this time where so many poets want

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.200
to be activists?

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:21.280
And I don't know if we really have a platform for doing that because poetry requires that

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:26.920
one not right propaganda that every line has to be, it's own, it has to undercut itself

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:31.000
on so many levels when I hear politicians use lines out of poetry, they almost invariably

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.720
use them incorrectly or demonstrate they don't understand the work.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.200
But I think right now it's a very challenging time for the poets who want to be socially

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:44.920
engaged and want to convey their responsibility to make a difference.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:45.920
Go ahead, yes.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.120
I actually don't think so.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:54.080
I think poets have always been the first to respond with language in response situations.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:59.320
It's just in our culture in the United States, we don't really care as much about poets

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:04.120
giving voice to what we're experiencing compared to Mexico, compared to South America, where

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:08.880
poets actually have a voice in terms of expressing what's going on in current events.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.120
I would argue that a lot of publishers right now, when they're publishing poets, they want

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.200
to look for poets who are engaged.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.200
Not I do.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.600
Yeah, but let's go back to 9-11, which is not that long ago.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.240
How did people grieve?

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.400
Most people who don't really write poetry, their first instinct was to write poem.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.880
I went to Union Square, so many poems, Angel Island, right?

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.560
The immigrants are denied immigration, the Chinese are non-European Americans.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:41.360
I mean, they wrote poems instinctively.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:50.520
I just think that it now seems to be there's greater agency for you to be a poet who is

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.800
socially engaged.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:02.040
Combination of social media, combination of the visibility of poetry, and combination

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.640
of, I mean, hip-hop.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.000
Hip-hop rap has always been about what's going on in social realm.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.920
It seems that you also for a moment talked about poetry as therapy, which is because

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.760
it goes back to what I said about sexten.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760
Yeah.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760
But it's interesting.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.160
On the other hand, I'm not sure that that always works because poetry and psychology

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.960
is a very big theme, but for instance, when his father James Wright found out that he

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.840
had become a poet, he said to his son, welcome to hell.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:39.160
I mean, I like the saying that I like to say that a sad poet is a happy poet, but really

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:45.560
it is a whether poetry really works as a way to grieve.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:52.080
It seems like it should be cathartic, but it also can become an obsession or a dark obsession

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.200
of sorts, and I don't know.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.600
It's about transformation, though, of what's dark.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.480
That's the difference, transformation through language.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.520
It's like opera, you ask yourself, why is this pleasurable?

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520
They're all deaf.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:05.520
Yeah.

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.360
Or Shakespeare, but it is.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.880
And because it's been transformed through the art.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.040
The terrible view that is born.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.680
Well, yes.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.720
But the other thing is we're talking about terms of reaching people, which is important

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:24.480
in all of us who love poetry, would like poems to reach more people, but they may never.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:28.440
And when you think about it in absolute numbers, they're probably because there are so many

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.520
people alive.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:34.400
The tiny percentage here that are reading it or interested in it probably are more than

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.640
people who've ever lived at any other time, and it doesn't ever have to be.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:39.640
Just about rap.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.120
You're bringing that up because I grew up in New York and they are street rhythms.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.640
And I was so struck by that I just saw Hamilton, and this is the thing.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.440
It was completely, it wasn't a gimmick.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:54.840
It was so appropriate because of the amount of, that's what I mean by American poetry,

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:59.680
that it finally comes into its own in this century, partly through those responses.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:05.440
Because our revolution was a thrusting upward from the ground up and the city up of these

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.160
energies that couldn't be contained.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.600
And that's what you hear in rap and hip hop.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.240
And it's wonderful because the second act of that is a really very sad act.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.640
It's devolved from that into politics as usual.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.640
But there it is.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:25.920
Shall we open it up?

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:31.480
Well, does anyone have any questions?

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.440
Good.

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.040
I think the microphone works if you...

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.040
Can I have people out speaking for you?

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.040
Okay, people behind you won't hear you.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040
Yeah.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:51.320
I am a singer and I live in an artist's building on the west side.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:56.720
And we have a group of people who have met for more than 10 years every other week, who

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.560
get together and read poetry.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.040
We read what we've written.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.960
We read whatever interests us.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:08.120
And we always discuss it in terms of what can we know about the poet, what was going

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.160
on at the time.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:17.440
And it's just been extraordinarily valuable for us as a venue for us to find out what's

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.720
universal, where we are in our growth in 10 years.

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.080
We have people in their 90s, two people in their 90s, one, two people in their 70s,

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.960
people in their 60s, people in their 30s.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.920
We have about eight people that show up for this thing.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:36.600
And the growth that we've all had by reading aloud every week, and we read poems more than

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.040
once and ask, and we're not area-dyed to say, I don't know what this means.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.040
What do you think this?

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.200
No one's trying to be crazy about their ego with it.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.400
It's really there for an exploration.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:57.880
And I think it's the universal and necessary expression for us to experience intimacy through

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.240
writing.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:06.440
And I think it's very exciting that the written word is happening on the Internet.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:14.560
I have a young niece in rural Massachusetts who reads a ruby car, and she's a young woman

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.040
finding out about her own voice as a woman.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.880
And here's a great venue for her.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:24.200
And this is a kid who would never be exposed to poetry.

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.680
So I think there's a lot of hope about what's going on.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.800
And I'm very happy to have listened.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800
That's nice.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.520
So there are more avenues for people to share their work.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.520
Yeah.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:39.800
For published work to be accessible for longer to a greater number of people, there are a

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.200
lot of advantages to the online presence of poetry.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.640
And it's 80 points out.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.840
Even though there are downsides, of course, yes.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.280
And Amy's pointing out those are only journals you can read, and for those of you who write,

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.040
those are the journals you can send to.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:58.680
And many of them are web scenes, like the one I mentioned had a dot org at the end.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.160
And so, yes.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.160
Thank you.

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:06.080
I was very interested to hear you talk about the pleasure and the pain in poetry.

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:15.400
How much is known about the neurobiology of poetry, particularly in the developing brain

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.360
and in the deteriorating brain?

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.800
How much do we understand in this area?

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:26.280
Young children, people with neurodegenerative disease.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:31.960
Well, we do know that I'm going to have very limited knowledge about this, but I do know

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.920
that play makes a difference at both ends of that, that it's very important for people

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:43.880
to engage and in play, not necessarily to worry about what they need to get done.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.800
And poetry provides that.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:51.280
It is a lifesaver for a lot of people who engage in that art, I think.

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.120
Well I want to give two personal anecdotes about that.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:33:01.240
One is my publisher, one of the fellow poets in the list, had a book out that was a really

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.720
fine book of poems, but she was losing her mind.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:06.880
And she was unable to function in any other way.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.400
I don't know what this says about poets, it was a terrific book.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:15.440
And the second experience I had was in a public school in Queens.

01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.120
In April, the Poetry Society asked some of you have done it, I'm sure poets to go into

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.440
the public schools and teach a few classes.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:27.600
So I was teaching sixth, seventh and eighth grade, which was a first.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.400
And the sixth graders were incredibly good.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:35.000
They had an instinctive sense of aesthetics, which is what may survive as in my colleague

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.400
who were nothing much else survived.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400
Manily.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.360
They were wonderful, they were moving.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.160
My husband Roy came along with me, he was struck by the same thing.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:48.120
At the end of it, the principal was debriefing and I said, well I take it the sixth grade

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:53.400
was your advanced class and she said no, they were our special needs kids.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.440
They were so far ahead of the other classes.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:01.800
So you were probably the scientist and doctor, I leave that to you to figure out what that

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.800
means.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.080
But I don't know if the study has been done about the effect on the synapses or if someone

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:14.520
has been hooked up to a bunch of sensors and then reads a poem and what parts of the brain

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.520
might have.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:22.040
There was a, I didn't end up getting very far in the reading and I put it off.

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:29.400
But there was a book called The Midnight Disease written by a neurologist who was also a writer

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:40.120
trying to evaluate the brain and she referenced more than just poets but perhaps that's the

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:45.880
contained something of the answer.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.240
I guess you could ask the question about creativity in general.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:52.160
It doesn't have to be just language.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.920
I mean some people like deconing the painter.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.720
I think he has Alzheimer's or some form of dementia and I think he went right on painting

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:05.280
good paintings to the end.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:11.160
They may have been affected by what happened to his brain but he was still a great painter.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:15.240
Things like that are interesting but I don't think we really know.

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:26.360
I don't have anything to say about that question specifically although I suppose I should.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360
I'm a psychiatrist.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.080
There's not that much research I think done on that particular topic but in general is

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:39.760
interested in comparing languages that's used in let's say prose where, and we Patricia

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:46.960
you touched on this a little bit at one point, the meaning of the message is sort of intended.

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:49.640
And anyway the writer intends to intend it.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.600
They intend to make the meaning clear.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600
They don't always.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.080
It sometimes spills out over.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:59.280
They have messages they intend to create but that's the point of prose.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:03.960
And then in poetry it seems there's an interest in pushing past, gushing past the limits of

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.760
what the words are actually meaning on the surface.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.560
There's that sort of pushing past.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.080
I thought that's really interesting and it raises two questions.

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.240
One relates to this gentleman's question.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.440
So playing is a little bit of, we know animals play, right?

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:26.200
We know that they are rehearsing physical programs so they learn how to hunt and move

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:31.240
in a certain way but they do exceed whatever is improvisational.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:36.800
So they're not practicing like someone might practice playing the piano where you feel

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:40.040
you need to meet especially with classical let's say.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.200
Where you're trying to meet the particular notes.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:46.920
They're moving around but they're also exceeding, they're being inventive and improvisational

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.440
and that's what play involves the sort of pushing past whatever the sort of the sheer

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.240
formal aspect of what the brain seems to be doing.

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.120
So that's one important thing.

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:04.680
But the other was to bring up the question about poetry as being changing over time as

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.680
being an evolution of the constraints on poetry.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:11.240
I thought that'd be an interesting topic that just touched on briefly.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:16.720
Because we talked about constraints like Twitter, somebody letters can be allowed or another

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:22.000
constraints whether it's professionalized, capitalized, whatever is, that's another

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.040
interesting way of looking at what's happened with poetry.

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.760
Well I think poetry does require, for a poet to write a poem, certain restraints are required

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.160
even if they're arbitrary.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.680
So it's helpful when writing a sonnet to know what the rules are and one can decide when

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:38.520
to follow them, when not to.

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.160
The same would be true if I would assume if one's writing on Twitter one is a certain

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.000
number of characters and that might actually inspire creativity.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.720
But without some constraints we know how it's like Emily Dickinson gave themselves their

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.320
own strange constraints and they invented their own rules.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.560
And I think all of us do that to a certain degree.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.280
And yes, I think the play starts very young.

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:07.480
I remember being just a child and loving the word hippopotamus and wanting to say it over

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.600
and over or showing the machine which sometimes came out as mass wing shine or whatever.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:20.040
But a lot of people start off as little gertrude stimes before they lose.

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:27.520
Before they forget the wonder that is possible in the discovery of language whereas poets

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.520
are always trying to discover it.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.520
And yes.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:37.680
And I do think constraints are at the center of everything that poets do and poetry does.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.280
Obviously in a traditional form somebody gives it to you.

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:47.400
But I think all of us and people I know I teach a workshop of actually awfully good

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.680
poets and what we're doing is setting ourselves our own constraints.

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.840
We're learning how to give ourselves our own assignments and set a constraint.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:01.760
And it develops maybe as you write a poem but the constraint is what makes the poem.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.760
I think.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.400
I wanted to add to that.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:10.160
You have poets who are actually responding to these developments in terms of the new platforms

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.960
that we're writing and poetry.

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960
You've got Tommy Pico, Morgan Parker.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:18.040
I mentioned to you, Morgan Parker has one book out.

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.120
Tommy Pico has two books out.

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:25.400
Tommy Pico's First Nations Native American Poet Queer came out with a book called IRL

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.080
which is an Internet term.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:34.360
So he's actually embracing the language that he experiences daily.

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.320
In real time on the Internet and that's actually changing how maybe not consciously but he's

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.160
allowing it to enter into his poem.

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:46.600
He wrote a book called it's based on the pastoral.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.720
But it's also like an anti-pastoral because he uses a lot of language that you don't

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:55.240
typically consider would be pastoral worthy.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.560
You find on blogs, you find on Twitter.

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.760
And he's very self-aware when he's writing this long poem on nature thinking about the

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.760
pastoral.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.960
Then go back ten years ago you had Tom Lin who teaches at New Jersey.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.320
He came up with a, he's a conceptual poet.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.160
He came up with the idea of poetry as boredom.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:18.680
And boredom as actually being a pleasurable thing.

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:22.840
So he published this book called Blips Soak O1 which is fantastic.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.880
And when you're reading his work, language is scattered all across the page like My

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.400
Army.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.760
And he doesn't expect you to read it, read it.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.280
Like treat it ambient.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.920
He calls it ambient stylistics.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.520
Why can't you engage in poetry like you do music?

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:43.120
You can do three chores at once while listening to Tchaikovsky and still appreciate Tchaikovsky.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.440
Why can't it be the same thing for poetry?

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.280
So I understand if it's the poetry of boredom you're not even necessarily required to read

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.400
the poem when you read it.

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:53.400
You can skip a rounder.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.800
Well you are reading it but you've got three senses right?

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:59.960
You've got sight, sound and then meaning.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.960
Yes.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.800
So you can look at the words and if you look at his book he's playing around with type

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.280
face and but you don't have to read the whole poem.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:10.280
It's impossible.

01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.280
It's 300 pages long.

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.600
But you can read bits of it and sip your coffee, go water the plants, take the dog out for

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:23.840
a walk, go back to it and appreciate it as an ambient experience.

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.800
But it's on the page.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.560
And that's I think a response to this oral and visual environment that we were finding

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:38.240
ourselves immersed in 10 years ago before the success of YouTube.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.560
We're now like you have eight windows open on the internet and you're reading the times.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.800
I've been talking to Anne Marie too.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.680
There's something called visual poetry which is really a branch of concrete poetry where

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.440
you arrange the words on the page to represent what your subject matters.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:42:00.720
So I mean it actually has a long history but Anne Marie had an example of a poem about

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.800
a dog shaped like a dog.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.280
There's one older one by E. Cummings called Grasshopper where the letters of the Grasshopper

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:09.120
jump across the page.

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:12.920
So it might seem a little gimmicky but this goes all the way back to Robert Herrick and

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.000
Herbert's Easter Wings and so forth.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.080
There's a long tradition of representing the words visually.

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:23.080
That said when there was this, because you mentioned Malarmé when there was a discussion

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:26.200
with you Malarmé and Edward D'Agat.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.640
And D'Agat said you know I've been painting so much, I'd love to write poetry, I have

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:35.000
so many ideas and Malarmé said to him my dear D'Agat poems are not made out of ideas,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.080
poems are made out of words.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.280
So but then if you can arrange the words in pictures maybe poems are made out of images.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:48.160
I mean images in two senses of the word, go on, yes.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:53.880
I think of Borden as a kind of repressed anxiety so if it can be transformed into pleasure

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.640
that's very interesting.

01:42:55.640 --> 01:43:00.840
I have a question.

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:07.400
One number of things I've been puzzling over in the course of your presentations, one in

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:15.840
particular and that is well wider and wider dissemination through more and more channels

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:27.120
and venues, engagement in social and political activity, performance in a number of ways,

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:32.160
and even intimacy, all phenomena of the present moment.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:40.680
And at the same time Patricia you were mentioned at least twice, maybe three times, the notion

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:49.360
that only a handful of poems perhaps in any given era tend to last, to endure.

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:54.600
And I'm wondering about the sort of dialectic between these two things.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:03.120
Because for example if you read, as I tend to do, a lot of poetry reviews, you often

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:09.320
hear the phrase so and so is the greatest poet writing in English at the present time.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:15.440
Or so and so is the greatest American poet of the end of the 20th century.

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:25.160
Now if that's more than sure to move books at Farra Stralster Norton in these reviews,

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:31.360
what does that have to do with this more and more what seems like democratization of

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:38.240
poetry, huge diversity of poetry, and then what's the meaning of the greatest poet writing

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:41.760
in whatever language?

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.880
There's a clash there that I can't quite recognize.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.200
You may well wonder about that.

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:51.440
I can listen to you, I'm thinking if we just collected all the blurbs on the back of poetry

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.920
books.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:45:00.480
But here's the real situation as opposed to even 20 years ago maybe.

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.120
You would ask a list of people interested in poetry, well give me a list of the 10 most

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.720
important poets writing now.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:10.240
And most of the net, there'd be a lot of overlap.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:15.720
You did that now with even 10 or 20 names, there might be no overlap or maybe two or three

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:18.480
names.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.480
I don't think there's exactly a contradiction in what you're saying.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.960
I think it's again the winnowing effects of time.

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.760
I think reading the blurbs could skew that in your mind.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.440
I think the best things reviewers can do, I really think most poetry reviews, first of

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.200
all they're hardly any which is really sad.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:41.840
And secondly, the best of them don't really talk that much about poetry.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.560
They'll give you enough of a selection from the book under review so you can judge for

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.320
yourself what you think of this book.

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:49.840
But most of them don't as you probably realized.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:51.200
They'll talk about it.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.200
I don't know if that answers your question.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.920
Well the point is it is a subjective claim no matter how we look at it.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:02.080
If someone says this is the greatest writer, the greatest writer according to whom and

01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:09.800
according to what standards, what is the, and I think that's the place to start.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.640
The Herrick who I mentioned has worked in visual forms.

01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.680
The reception of poets can be so odd.

01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:24.120
He was completely unknown during his time and then was discovered, which is centuries

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:26.800
ago and then was discovered in the 19th century.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.200
So that's a really odd one.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.960
Sometimes people die and then they become really big after that like Emily Dickinson.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:35.160
But here's someone who just lay underground for centuries.

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:42.240
I mean there's every kind of, and others who like Oscar Wilde who did write some poems,

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.360
very popular in his time, very popular afterwards.

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.680
It's very hard to know.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:47.680
We can't know.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.960
I think that it's important that you have, there are going to be those who last through

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:54.960
time.

01:46:54.960 --> 01:47:01.920
In the meantime we're living now and it's who we are interested in as individuals.

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.600
And that's important.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:13.440
It's important to living life who we are interested in seeing and watching and reading everything,

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:14.440
who we are.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:22.280
This is now and these are various, you know, any used bookstore in a small town will make

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.480
you sad because you'll become across books that were published, major publishing houses

01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.640
and you don't know who these people are.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:33.960
So greatest can only be temporal really.

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:37.720
And if you know the future you don't have one anyway.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.040
It's not just.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:45.320
The fact of every strong poet being the school of one, but every reader is also a school of

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.320
one.

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.280
And I think what Amy's saying is just look at what appeals to you.

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.280
That's the only important thing.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.440
And the word greatest is a superlative which means it can only be one.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.560
And if many, many people are saying so and so is the greatest, then it can only mean

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.480
I like this where it speaks to me.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.040
Yeah, I think great should be a word.

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.680
There should be a list of little words you can't use in poetry.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.720
It's great would certainly be one of them.

01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:13.920
It says absolutely nothing.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:20.240
But you touch on the connection to capital in that statement, right?

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.400
Like you talk about the industry.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.000
And you can't ignore thinking about great and greatest because every year we've got

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.800
every month we have a new award that is going to somebody.

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:35.280
Which requires qualifications and all that.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.800
We need to combine greatest and scarcity.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.800
For Americans.

01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:40.800
Yeah.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.520
American blurbs are especially hyperbolic actually.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.040
If you would just compare American blurbs to Irish blurbs or English blurbs or others

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.720
in the poetry speaking world, it's pretty striking.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.640
Look at a list of who won Pulitzer Prizes or something all the way back in fiction and

01:48:56.640 --> 01:48:57.640
poetry.

01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:01.960
You'll see a lot of names that nobody knows or writers that nobody reads anymore.

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:02.960
It's astounding, right?

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:05.920
And that's a relatively new prize, the Pulitzer Prize.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.560
If there were something that went back to the thousands of years, we can only imagine

01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.600
what would be on that list.

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.560
Robert Bridges did write at least one great poem, Arrow's Tearinos.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:20.800
I feel that actually Arrow's the one that begins.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:21.800
Arrow's Tearinos.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.800
Yeah, that's the problem.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.800
That's the problem.

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.800
That's the problem.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:25.800
That's the problem.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.800
That's the problem.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:27.800
That's the problem.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.800
That's a great poem.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:31.400
There's an example of a great poem, whatever else you want.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.360
That's all you need to do.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:39.600
I'm told that we need to wrap up.

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.800
I'm really glad to have to stop things.

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.240
It means everyone's so interested.

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:45.240
Thank you.

01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.240
Thank you very much.
