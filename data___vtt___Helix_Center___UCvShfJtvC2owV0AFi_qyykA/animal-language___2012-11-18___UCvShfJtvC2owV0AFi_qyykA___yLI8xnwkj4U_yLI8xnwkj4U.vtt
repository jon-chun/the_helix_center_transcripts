WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.080
Okay, we're going to get started.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.600
Welcome to the Helix Center for Interdisciplinary Investigation of the New York Psychoanalyx

00:18.600 --> 00:19.600
Society Institute.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.840
I'm Rob Penzer, associate director of the center.

00:23.840 --> 00:28.120
Before I turn the program over to Beth Hayes to introduce this, the last Helix roundtable

00:28.120 --> 00:33.440
for this calendar year, I wish to entice you and entreat you.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.720
First the Intreaty.

00:34.720 --> 00:39.920

01:03.360 --> 01:04.920
Now the enticement.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.600
We have in the work some extraordinary roundtables coming your way in calendar year 2013.

01:09.600 --> 01:17.360
Unsynthetic biology, the topography of fear, known and unknown, complexity and emergence,

01:17.360 --> 01:23.800
love, icons, God and different religions to name but a few.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.840
Follow us on our website, on Facebook and Twitter for announcements about these roundtables

01:28.840 --> 01:32.440
and next year's poetry, music and film events too.

01:32.440 --> 01:37.920
If you're not on our mailing list, please go to our website, sign up with your name and

01:37.920 --> 01:41.560
make sure that you also enter your email address.

01:41.560 --> 01:46.000
Now I'd like to turn things over to Beth Hayes of our executive committee who deserves great

01:46.000 --> 01:52.440
thanks today for developing and single-handedly organizing today's roundtable on animal language.

01:52.440 --> 01:59.440
Thanks Beth.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.120
Okay, this is the best I can do.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.240
This is Chris Clark here on my lab.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.960
Chris is the director of the bioacoustics research program at Cornell's lab of ornithology

02:34.960 --> 02:39.240
and is a senior scientist in the department of neurobiology at Cornell.

02:39.240 --> 02:44.560
He works at the interface of science, applied engineering, industry regulation and NGOs.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.520
Dr. Clark's work includes monitoring of large whale distributions and other oceanographic

02:49.520 --> 02:56.000
studies using passive acoustic detection and aerial surveys and genetic and photo ID data.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.040
He and his staff have developed a suite of analytic procedures and metrics for understanding

03:00.040 --> 03:04.880
the acoustics of ocean ecosystems and they're launched through human interference and he

03:04.880 --> 03:08.960
uses these collaboratively with other research departments and institutes also.

03:08.960 --> 03:14.080
And then over here we have Dr. Ray Doherty, associate professor of linguistics at NYU.

03:14.080 --> 03:21.080
Dr. Doherty completed his PhD combining electrical engineering work at MIT with studies of coordinate

03:21.080 --> 03:39.180
structures and recursion in language at the linguistics department at NYU under N

03:39.180 --> 03:43.880
which is on the use of Chomsky's universal grammar to represent English, French and German

03:43.880 --> 03:45.800
in a prologue computer language.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.800
And most recently he's been working on the evolutionary biology of the inner ear using

03:49.800 --> 03:54.880
some mathematical representations and analog digital converter models to understand human

03:54.880 --> 03:59.800
sound processing and how it's evolved over millions of years.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.480
Over here we have Dr. James Fuller.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.800
He's now Dr. James Fuller as of a few weeks ago who recently defended his doctoral dissertation

04:07.800 --> 04:09.200
in Columbia.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.680
His research focused on the evolution and expansion of vocal signal repertoire focusing on the

04:14.680 --> 04:17.480
communication systems of blue monkeys.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.200
He has also lectured on the evolution and usage of communication systems in birds and

04:21.200 --> 04:24.600
mammals and the sensory systems of vertebrates.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.480
And then we have Dr. James Higum over there.

04:27.480 --> 04:32.280
He is an assistant professor of biological anthropology at NYU.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
Is it Higum or Ohio?

04:33.280 --> 04:34.280
I am.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.280
It's okay.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.280
I am.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.280
My professor.

04:37.280 --> 04:43.160
His research interest is sexual selection and communication and primate signaling behavior.

04:43.160 --> 04:48.120
From a variety of perspectives that he uses, genetic, neuroendocrine, behavioral and morphologic.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.920
He studies everything from the cocks, baboons and guanons.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.920
Guanons?

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
Guanons, yeah.

04:55.920 --> 05:00.920
To a game theory signaling models and computational models of primate perception.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.360
He's author of a number of dozen publications and the guest editor of a number of journals

05:05.360 --> 05:09.880
on primate signaling, primate coloration and multimodal animal communication.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.920
And then finally we have Dr. Diana Reese who is a cognitive psychologist and professor

05:14.920 --> 05:19.840
in the department of psychology at Hunter and the department of biopsychology and behavioral

05:19.840 --> 05:23.000
neuroscience at the graduate center of CUNY.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.320
And Dr. Reese develops and directs the Dolphin Cognition program at the National Aquarium

05:28.320 --> 05:33.440
in Baltimore and studies elephant cognition at the Smithsonian National Zoo.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.440
I had the great good fortune when my kids were little of having a special backstage dolphin

05:37.440 --> 05:41.600
tour with her at the New York Aquarium where she was then the director of the marine mammal

05:41.600 --> 05:43.040
program.

05:43.040 --> 05:48.480
And so in addition to her scholarship in cetacean and animal cognition and the evolution of

05:48.480 --> 05:53.480
intelligence including pioneering work in the investigation of dolphin abilities through

05:53.480 --> 05:55.720
underwater key birds and responses to the mirror.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.240
Dr. Reese is known for her protection of dolphins in the tuna industry and the rescuing of stranded

06:00.240 --> 06:03.880
marine animals everywhere such as Humphrey the whale.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.160
Her most recent book is the Dolphin in the Mirror.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.440
So those are our panelists and I will just route to the question of what do we mean when

06:10.440 --> 06:13.360
we say animals communicate and let you guys go from there.

06:13.360 --> 06:19.840
Maybe a good way to start off is to sort of define the word communication and in the essence.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.520
I mean there are many different definitions but it really comes from the Latin word meaning

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
to share.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.520
It's exchange and share signals.

06:27.520 --> 06:33.760
And I think we all agree pretty much that's a real basic as low as we can go sharing signals.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.520
And I think the one thing that I'd like to throw out there today is that we used to think

06:38.520 --> 06:41.560
that we were the only communicating species.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
We really did.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.640
We thought we were the only species certainly with language and for a long time we thought

06:45.640 --> 06:49.880
that we were the only species that could think and or could communicate in any meaningful

06:49.880 --> 06:50.880
way.

06:50.880 --> 06:58.120
So I think one of the things that is a big idea is that all animals communicate in some

06:58.120 --> 07:01.720
way so maybe we can take it from the other.

07:01.720 --> 07:11.360
So a caveat to that is the notion that the communication is intentional as opposed to

07:11.360 --> 07:16.960
a deer is not communicating as it rustles leaves as it runs through the forest.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.960
You can't hear me.

07:21.960 --> 07:25.200
Is that louder?

07:25.200 --> 07:28.640
And the great rustling begins.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.560
Yes, the sweet beans.

07:30.560 --> 07:35.120
So I was saying that one of the components of this notion of communication is that it's

07:35.120 --> 07:36.120
intentional.

07:36.120 --> 07:41.560
It's not some byproduct of an action.

07:41.560 --> 07:46.320
But there's a difference between evolutionary intentionality and cognitive intentionality

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
and the way that we use it.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.160
I wouldn't say most animal communication is intentional.

07:50.160 --> 07:57.160
I give a baboon has a large sexual swelling or a little insect flashes a light to another

07:57.160 --> 08:07.440
that, speaking of communication, I mean, evolution has acted for signaling to occur over evolutionary

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
time.

08:08.440 --> 08:14.760
It's not that a female baboon is thinking I'm going to grow that morphology on my hind

08:14.760 --> 08:17.840
quarters so that I can indicate my ovulation.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.400
But there's still clearly communication going on there.

08:20.400 --> 08:26.600
So I wouldn't say, I mean, there's a difference between signals which have, I think there's

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
two different issues.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.440
If you're talking about a deer rustling in the forest, you could argue that that's a

08:32.440 --> 08:36.320
cue rather than a signal and there's the whole cue signal debate.

08:36.320 --> 08:42.440
But then there's a separate argument, I think, about the difference between signals that

08:42.440 --> 08:52.000
have been selected for over evolutionary time and what goes on in here when animal signal.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So you brought up something very interesting.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.760
It's a signaling right here.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.040
It's going to happen every few minutes.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.280
Only when very good points are made.

09:02.280 --> 09:08.240
I think one of the points actually that Diana said is that people, I think what you said

09:08.240 --> 09:12.680
was that people didn't realize or didn't at least accept that animals, that non-human

09:12.680 --> 09:15.280
animals communicate until relatively recently.

09:15.280 --> 09:20.880
But I think one of the problems with communication is how difficult it is to talk about it.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.920
In that the word humans are an inherently linguistic species.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.920
We use language, we think linguistically, we communicate linguistically.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.000
Just about every example we ever give has a linguistic framework to it.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.080
So we can't imagine any other way of communicating.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.800
And so when we find that non-humans animals are communicating in non-linguistic paradigms

09:43.800 --> 09:48.880
or non-linguistic frameworks, we can't make sense of it and therefore we dismiss it.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.360
And I think what James may, well, we don't because we're learned at scholars.

09:53.360 --> 09:59.280
But I think a lot of people have a tendency to dismiss it and I think what James was referring

09:59.280 --> 10:03.920
to was the fact that from an evolutionary perspective, there's a lot of communication

10:03.920 --> 10:09.960
behavior that takes place on many, many different levels.

10:09.960 --> 10:15.000
And I would assume that very few of them reach the cognitive complexity of human language

10:15.000 --> 10:16.600
or human communication.

10:16.600 --> 10:22.720
But that doesn't make them any less or more fascinating or evolutionary important.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.440
No, I would throw out this idea again.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.160
I'm throwing out ideas here that we don't know.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.520
I mean, we often say it's not as complex as what we do.

10:31.520 --> 10:38.360
But I think there's this vast sort of ignorance about what we really know about the content

10:38.360 --> 10:40.840
of the signals, what it's actually conveying.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
And I'll give you a good example.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.680
When I was in graduate school, I was actually a linguistics major.

10:45.680 --> 10:50.840
I was really interested in studying communication in humans and other animals and how they use

10:50.840 --> 10:52.200
these signals.

10:52.200 --> 10:58.000
And I found that there was a man named René G. Bismell who had been studying the human-wistled

10:58.000 --> 10:59.520
languages in the world.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.600
Now these are languages where people send whistles back and forth, much like you hear

11:04.600 --> 11:07.640
birds' bird whistles or dolphin whistles.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.600
But it's based on the spoken language.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.840
So in that very nice way, we know what the content of those whistles are.

11:14.840 --> 11:20.680
And you hear sounds like, now if I heard that coming from a dolphin or a bird, I might

11:20.680 --> 11:23.520
just think, that's really simple because what can you put in a whistle?

11:23.520 --> 11:28.560
But when you look at these whistle languages, they're conveying the words that we whistle.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.720
And that was a real lesson, I think, and a humbling that you can pack a lot of information

11:33.720 --> 11:38.640
into what looks like perhaps a very simple set of signals, three whistles.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.480
And those are actually words and sentences.

11:40.480 --> 11:45.800
So I actually would argue that we simply don't know in many cases what's encoded in those

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
whistles.

11:46.800 --> 11:55.280
So do we assume that to qualify as having language or linguistics that it has to follow

11:55.280 --> 12:00.280
the syntactical and grammatical rules of these?

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
And so...

12:01.280 --> 12:05.280
Do you want to do more distinctions made now or later?

12:05.280 --> 12:08.280
Now we'll probably do this.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
Sure.

12:09.280 --> 12:18.840
I'm going to guess we're not going to actually solve anything.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.800
That's just my prediction for the day.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.560
He just came out of his PhD.

12:23.560 --> 12:31.560
No, I think that what I was saying earlier that one of the inherent challenges in studying

12:31.560 --> 12:36.440
communication is terminology and specificity in what we mean by it.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.640
I mean, I actually got about halfway through a book before, and I won't mention who it

12:40.640 --> 12:46.080
is in case they're here, on language and whether or not apes have language or the capacity

12:46.080 --> 12:50.640
for language and not once in at least 150 pages before I threw it away, did he define

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
language?

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
Correct.

12:52.640 --> 12:58.800
I find that fascinating that we can actually question whether or not a species or even

12:58.800 --> 13:04.560
a group of organisms has the capacity for something without actually defining what the

13:04.560 --> 13:06.200
criteria of that are.

13:06.200 --> 13:12.280
And so I've read very, very, very simple, simplistic definitions of language that speak

13:12.280 --> 13:17.280
to referential, semanticism, syntactic capacities.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.280
And if that's the case, then we may have some evidence of non-humans using it.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.200
But I don't believe that that's the case.

13:24.200 --> 13:31.560
So to answer your question again, to readdress it, the whole world of semiotics and zoosymatics,

13:31.560 --> 13:33.400
the study of signs and symbols.

13:33.400 --> 13:39.800
So let's take the case of an animal that has a swollen rear and it's red.

13:39.800 --> 13:47.400
That could serve as a signal that's been selected for to attract a mate, a certain time, a signal.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.040
If we think about or assign perhaps.

13:50.040 --> 13:55.440
If we think about a symbol and the way symbols are defined, if we all agree, is it something

13:55.440 --> 13:57.400
that represents something else?

13:57.400 --> 14:03.000
I think we have evidence in the animal world, at least, that certain animals can be taught

14:03.000 --> 14:04.640
to use symbols.

14:04.640 --> 14:12.120
It may not qualify as language the way we define it, but certainly we've seen with dolphins

14:12.120 --> 14:16.240
in training at the University of Hawaii and there's some evidence in some of the work

14:16.240 --> 14:18.480
I've done, although I haven't called them symbols.

14:18.480 --> 14:23.400
And in Alex the African Ray Parrot, work that's been done to train him on functional communication

14:23.400 --> 14:27.320
skills and some of the chimp language studies and the chimp communication studies, those

14:27.320 --> 14:33.400
animals under double blind conditions without any cueing from the people who work with them

14:33.400 --> 14:35.240
can use the word symbolically.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.720
So I think we have some evidence for that.

14:37.720 --> 14:42.400
And it doesn't mean we know how they use it in their own world or if they do use it symbolically,

14:42.400 --> 14:44.000
but they seem to have this capacity.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.480
I think that's an important finding.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.720
So I hope that helps.

14:46.720 --> 14:52.720
I mean, the classic functionally referential example in animal communication is the chaney

14:52.720 --> 14:59.600
and so forth vervet monkey alarm calls, where vervet monkeys respond in one specific way

14:59.600 --> 15:03.840
to see in a snake and a different specific way to seeing an eagle and a different specific

15:03.840 --> 15:06.520
way to seeing a leopard.

15:06.520 --> 15:13.680
And individuals then, everybody else, has a specific response in response to the specific

15:13.680 --> 15:19.160
call that's an appropriate anti-predator response to that predator.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.360
Now that's the standard like when that first came out, that was in a science paper in

15:23.360 --> 15:26.720
1980 and it was a big brahuhar at the time.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.440
And when that first came out, it was called referential communication.

15:31.440 --> 15:36.520
And then it got switched to functionally referential communication because they weren't sure they

15:36.520 --> 15:40.400
didn't want to imply so much about the cognition of the vervet monkeys and they were saying

15:40.400 --> 15:44.200
they're scared, sorry, heaven forbid.

15:44.200 --> 15:50.240
So they wanted to say more that look, as long as the monkey is, I guess they switched

15:50.240 --> 15:56.840
the emphasis from the signaler and what the signaler meant to the receiver, the perceiver,

15:56.840 --> 16:02.240
the second individual, what they could infer as a perceiver.

16:02.240 --> 16:07.480
And therefore, if you're walking through the forest as a vervet monkey and you see a snake

16:07.480 --> 16:12.000
and that makes you give a certain call because it arouses you to a certain level.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.040
As long as there's a statistical association with you giving that call and there being

16:16.040 --> 16:21.360
a snake such that whenever you hear that call as a perceiver, it always means there's a

16:21.360 --> 16:27.000
snake, you as a perceiver can create the referentiality.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.360
It doesn't have to be a construct of the signaler.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.480
It doesn't have to be that the vervet monkey sees the snake and thinks snake.

16:32.480 --> 16:39.280
So vervet monkey can just be aroused to a certain type of call by that stimulus and

16:39.280 --> 16:44.720
the perceiver as long as that level of arousal is always associated with the snake, it doesn't

16:44.720 --> 16:47.080
really matter what goes on the first vervet monkey's head.

16:47.080 --> 16:51.600
The second vervet monkey is able to infer snake regardless.

16:51.600 --> 16:56.560
So it became a more, it shifted towards a more kind of referential view to a more functionally

16:56.560 --> 16:57.560
referential.

16:57.560 --> 17:03.280
And all the discussion you have in communication is pretty much between adults with some internal

17:03.280 --> 17:06.440
mental structure of some sort.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.720
Almost all the work I've done just is on signal structures.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.360
For instance, I think there's a lot of things that couldn't be explained using that kind

17:13.360 --> 17:14.360
of a model.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.840
For instance, the very first cochlea that was in an inner ear was a very tiny little thing

17:19.840 --> 17:23.560
the size of a disc and it was kind of brittle.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.880
And then it gradually turned into a cylinder and that's what dinosaurs had.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.560
And then that stayed with the mammals, millions, hundreds of millions of years, until about

17:32.560 --> 17:34.320
200 million years ago.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.440
And then you got the double helix, which the human beings have, which is a spiral.

17:38.440 --> 17:43.160
And I told people I would work in the word helix.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.760
So there it is, that's one already.

17:45.760 --> 17:52.680
But in any event, if you try to account for why it evolved in these different ways, first

17:52.680 --> 17:53.920
it's hard to do.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.320
But the cylinder is still what birds have.

17:56.320 --> 18:01.880
And now when it broke off from the cylinder and became a helix, what happened was there's

18:01.880 --> 18:04.200
an animal called the tenrec, T-E-N-R-E-C.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.560
It's worth looking up.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.000
It's a crazy little thing.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.160
It lives in Madagascar.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.280
And the mother has 22 children.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.960
It's at the bottom of the food chain.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.000
It looks like a small porcupine.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.280
But that's the first mammal there probably was.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.880
The second one was something along the lines of a platypus.

18:19.880 --> 18:25.680
Now, the tenrec evolved a cochlear that's enormously big.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.920
Wars is two and a half turns.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.600
This one's six and a half turns because it could hear an enormously high frequency.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.120
And the big problem was predation from lizards and snakes or something that could hear that

18:35.120 --> 18:37.800
high frequency like a bird.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.800
The way they communicated was not orally, they have porcupine things, and they flick

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
their quills.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.780
And it goes, and the mother can immediately locate where the child is, and the child can

18:47.780 --> 18:52.240
call to the mother, since they're mammals, they must nurse, so the children must call

18:52.240 --> 18:53.240
to the mother.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.240
And the mother must be in close contact.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
This is not adult.

18:56.240 --> 19:00.400
I think a large amount of evolution of the internal organs of the body that are responsible

19:00.400 --> 19:05.760
for many of the speech phenomenon in fact comes from things like mother-child interaction.

19:05.760 --> 19:10.240
Now the platypus, which is my favorite animal, I think.

19:10.240 --> 19:14.240
I didn't know there were so many that were all over the place, apparently, in Australia.

19:14.240 --> 19:19.560
The platypus is a lizard-like animal, and it lays an egg, and then the mother hatches

19:19.560 --> 19:23.880
the egg, and the baby has a little egg tooth, and then nurses it.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.640
But the mother does not have breasts.

19:25.640 --> 19:31.000
The milk oozes directly out from her fur and her skin, and the little animal licks it off.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.320
Now they also have the bird cochlea.

19:34.320 --> 19:40.160
Now why did the platypus not need to evolve a very big cochlea to nurse the babies?

19:40.160 --> 19:42.000
Well, it's poisonous.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.360
Everything that crawls into a platypus nest becomes dinner.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.360
It's not going to eat something.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.360
It's going to be eaten.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.840
If it eats, I don't want to eat sound or any way.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.440
But it's a funny thing, that this kind of thing happens.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.600
And also if you just look at various complex signal communications, I've worked a lot

19:55.600 --> 19:57.960
with insects because they're somewhat different.

19:57.960 --> 20:03.400
And the reason I studied the insects is because the bird cochlea evolved to hear a very highly

20:03.400 --> 20:07.640
specific sound, and in fact it's the sound made by insects.

20:07.640 --> 20:11.120
So let me just give you one example, and then I'll be quiet.

20:11.120 --> 20:15.000
As you look at crickets, and I've started studying crickets for any number of reasons,

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
but it was in Santa Domingo.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.880
There's more crickets there than you can believe.

20:18.880 --> 20:24.920
If a cricket puts one wing up like this and puts another wing out to the side, and there's

20:24.920 --> 20:29.840
another cricket over there doing the same thing, if this cricket wiggles this wing, the other

20:29.840 --> 20:31.600
one this wing wiggles.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.360
And if it wiggles this wing, then this wiggles.

20:34.360 --> 20:38.680
And if it wiggles both of them, then both of them wiggle on the other cricket.

20:38.680 --> 20:43.400
A cricket can send three completely different signals to another cricket across the room,

20:43.400 --> 20:46.120
but you will just hear it as brrr, brrr, brrr.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.840
They have extremely complicated communication systems.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.760
And when you think he's only got 80,000 neurons in his head, and he is processing signals

20:53.760 --> 20:59.640
that are beyond the human capacity to process, there's something going on here.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.840
Evolution must have, I mean I sort of agree with many of the people that say evolution

21:03.840 --> 21:04.840
goes and jumps.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.600
In fact that's my main work.

21:06.600 --> 21:12.120
I mean just with the thing I told you about the cochlea, to transform from a cylinder cochlea

21:12.120 --> 21:17.880
to a triple concentric helical spiral, working the second time he likes, has to have happened

21:17.880 --> 21:19.280
overnight.

21:19.280 --> 21:24.400
It couldn't be that it took 20 million years because the ear wouldn't work.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.080
It had to work and that's, it had to work overnight.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.760
And in fact, I can show it to you a little later on.

21:29.760 --> 21:34.080
I don't get too boring, too fast.

21:34.080 --> 21:39.640
The distance in a mathematical space from a cylinder to a helix is trivial.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.880
One tiny little thing away.

21:41.880 --> 21:47.120
So what happened was something instead of growing this way, grew that way.

21:47.120 --> 21:51.640
And it's an interesting sort of seed to see how these signal complexities grew.

21:51.640 --> 21:56.400
And the other thing that's kind of explicable is not only mother child for human beings,

21:56.400 --> 21:58.560
that's very crucial because we're all mammals.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.480
But the human ear is almost identical to that of a cat apparently.

22:02.480 --> 22:06.880
The cats were the greatest predators of human beings in the early days apparently.

22:06.880 --> 22:11.120
And I don't know how they do this, but archaeologists, anthropologists, flossed at the teeth of

22:11.120 --> 22:16.640
the old, I don't know, saber-doot tigers, and find there's a human remains between them.

22:16.640 --> 22:22.360
It could very well be that the earliest predator, the human ear, tuned itself to hear exactly

22:22.360 --> 22:23.880
like what the cat's here.

22:23.880 --> 22:28.760
And it's my understanding of the doctors that do operations on ears practice on cats.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.880
So it's pretty close.

22:30.880 --> 22:34.880
It's not the case that all animals, or all animals, have the same kind of frequency response,

22:34.880 --> 22:36.560
but the cats do.

22:36.560 --> 22:41.720
And in fact, if you look at the way the human being responds to a specific kind of sound

22:41.720 --> 22:46.880
variation, which is called frequency modulation, which would be if I took a rubber band and

22:46.880 --> 22:52.600
twanged it and then went back and forth like that, that would essentially be the kind of

22:52.600 --> 22:55.560
sound your ear is particularly tuned to.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.200
And that's particularly the kind of noise that would be for a lion with a roar.

22:59.200 --> 23:05.000
But actually, big cats have now been shown to have a very special adaptation for Inpersonic.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
For what?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Inpersonic.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Yeah, could well be.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
No, it's...

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Oh, yeah, it's...

23:10.000 --> 23:13.400
And that's actually pretty bad, as big cats.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.400
Yeah, yeah.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
Well, yeah.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.600
But human ear probably just heard what it did.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.800
You know, it could localize cats in space.

23:20.800 --> 23:26.160
I mean, it gets very complicated mathematically because if you have something with a constant

23:26.160 --> 23:29.440
frequency coming at you, the frequency goes up.

23:29.440 --> 23:33.280
So if a cat were roaring and running away from you, the frequency wouldn't go up and

23:33.280 --> 23:35.440
you might think he's standing still.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.880
But our ear is not fooled by that.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.880
See, it's a funny sort of thing.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.640
I think it's a little complicated.

23:40.640 --> 23:47.880
I don't want to get into it, but there's no simple example I can think of.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.960
But suppose I had just a rubber band who was twanging it and going back and forth like

23:50.960 --> 23:51.960
that.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.760
And now suppose I had a tuning fork and moved it back and forth like that.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.760
The frequency would sound like it was going up when I moved the tuning fork towards you

23:59.760 --> 24:01.880
and low when it was going away.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.000
And it would sound like the frequency was going up when I pulled the rubber band apart

24:05.000 --> 24:07.960
and down when I pushed it together.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.000
Are those two sounds distinguishable by all animals?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.760
And the answer is no, they're not.

24:14.760 --> 24:16.680
They're very different to some.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.240
And some human beings hear the big difference other ones don't.

24:19.240 --> 24:22.040
And I think that's why this people, I don't know this at all.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.080
They have perfect pitch and some people have really phenomenal sense.

24:26.080 --> 24:30.360
They don't like the sound of the hall because there's too many reverberations or something

24:30.360 --> 24:34.440
like that where someone like me would walk in and wouldn't even know there was any difference.

24:34.440 --> 24:41.600
I mean, I think we see matching of sensory systems to signals very broadly across the

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
animal kingdom.

24:42.600 --> 24:50.760
You know, all sensory systems are matched and there's a lot of talk about whether the

24:50.760 --> 24:57.760
use of certain types of colors, certain types of sounds, et cetera are sort of hidden channels

24:57.760 --> 24:59.680
are targeted at specific species.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.840
So for example, birds, so humans are trichromats.

25:03.840 --> 25:09.880
So we're able to see we have three cone classes in our eye, medium wave and short wave, red

25:09.880 --> 25:11.400
green, blue vision.

25:11.400 --> 25:16.720
But of course birds have an extra super, super short cone.

25:16.720 --> 25:21.240
And either a UV cone or an SUV cone.

25:21.240 --> 25:28.080
And they also signal using a lot of ultraviolet colors, a lot of UV coloration.

25:28.080 --> 25:32.680
And a lot of people in the bird literature have discussed whether that UV might be a

25:32.680 --> 25:34.640
hidden channel, right?

25:34.640 --> 25:41.680
For non-human primates, catterines and propoys is a whole host of red coloration news.

25:41.680 --> 25:46.680
Since we evolved trichromacy and we can actually distinguish reds from greens, from baboons

25:46.680 --> 25:52.360
to gelada to mandrels to vervet monkeys to the Gwenons.

25:52.360 --> 25:55.160
All these anthropologies are a lot of red coloration.

25:55.160 --> 26:02.640
And of course, for their dichromatic mammalian predators, you can't distinguish red from

26:02.640 --> 26:03.640
green.

26:03.640 --> 26:10.520
So maybe it's a particularly good color to use because it's detectable to other catterine

26:10.520 --> 26:11.520
primates.

26:11.520 --> 26:16.880
It's detectable to bird predators, but not to other mammalian predators, not to large

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
cats, some things like that.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.440
They just wouldn't be able to see a bright red face in a green tree.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.760
It would just be all the same color.

26:23.760 --> 26:28.760
So you know another thing that we tend to not think about is the subtleties in our

26:28.760 --> 26:29.760
non-vocal signaling.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.400
I mean, we're talking about colors and different kinds of visual signals.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.600
But for many of you in this room, if you're working with people and watching their behaviors,

26:38.600 --> 26:42.480
speaking to you, you're paying a lot of attention to what they're doing.

26:42.480 --> 26:47.320
I mean, we know that about between 70% and 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal,

26:47.320 --> 26:53.880
from micro-momentary movements to the tone in which we say something so I can say, Chris,

26:53.880 --> 26:57.000
really nice shoes.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.600
We hear the words, we hear the order, we get the basic idea, but what's the meaning of

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
that message?

27:03.600 --> 27:07.600
And you're looking at how I'm looking at you and really nice shoes, Chris.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.600
You've got a pretty strong affect there.

27:09.600 --> 27:18.280
And to me, that is the perfect example of the difference between communication in terms

27:18.280 --> 27:25.240
of signaling system that's evolved and language that has meaning, that has a shared cultural

27:25.240 --> 27:28.840
elaboration on an understanding.

27:28.840 --> 27:34.360
And maybe I oversimplify it, but I see that as if you had written down Chris and I shoes

27:34.360 --> 27:38.920
and handed it to him, he'd probably not be as annoyed with you.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.400
I really mean I like your shoes.

27:40.400 --> 27:46.600
Because the meaning in language is based on a shared understanding of this symbolically

27:46.600 --> 27:57.400
referential constructs, whereas what we like to call body language, but your gestural,

27:57.400 --> 28:04.600
chemical, visual signaling is intrinsic, is it's our species to some.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.600
There are cultural variations on this.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.760
But it's still contextual.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.560
Even in non-humans, it's contextual.

28:12.560 --> 28:18.040
If you show a racist monkey, a female racist monkey during the birth season compared to

28:18.040 --> 28:20.280
the mate's season, he treats it differently.

28:20.280 --> 28:26.360
If you show an ambiguous face that could be interpreted as being a positive face, it

28:26.360 --> 28:28.560
could be interpreted as being a negative face.

28:28.560 --> 28:33.280
If you showed that to the same animal, when the animal has just had a vet check versus

28:33.280 --> 28:36.640
when the animal hasn't had a vet check, they treat it differently.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.040
Because it makes sense.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.800
It's a form of cognitive bias, right?

28:40.800 --> 28:43.400
It's a emotion mediating attention.

28:43.400 --> 28:48.280
If bad things are happening to you and you see something that could be good or bad, if

28:48.280 --> 28:52.440
lots of bad things have been happening, maybe it's best to assume this will also be a bad

28:52.440 --> 28:53.440
thing.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.280
And if lots and lots of good things have been happening and you see something that could

28:56.280 --> 28:59.560
be good or bad, maybe it's safe to assume it's probably going to be good.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.800
So there's an awful lot of context that goes on.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.880
I don't think we're the only ones that add a lot of context to this.

29:06.880 --> 29:13.240
You can see the same signal given to the same individual and depending on recent experience,

29:13.240 --> 29:15.960
depending on things like this, it can be interpreted very differently.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.160
But I imagine, and I fully accept that.

29:18.160 --> 29:24.520
I think though that there are certain examples where there's probably very little variation.

29:24.520 --> 29:30.080
Alarm calls, indications of extreme aggression, things like that, where there probably isn't

29:30.080 --> 29:34.880
so much where selection wouldn't favor variation in response, where selection would favor high

29:34.880 --> 29:36.680
specificity in response.

29:36.680 --> 29:41.960
So it doesn't, I am sure there are examples, but selection wouldn't favor one to spend

29:41.960 --> 29:47.640
a lot of time thinking about what just happened when you hear a predator alarm call.

29:47.640 --> 29:49.920
Selection would favor an instant and immediate response.

29:49.920 --> 29:54.880
Whether there's any, and it's interesting because the term mental construct or mental

29:54.880 --> 29:57.600
cognitive awareness gets tossed around a lot.

29:57.600 --> 30:02.440
And in my work, I don't actually need to know what the animals are thinking, to know

30:02.440 --> 30:04.160
that they're responding.

30:04.160 --> 30:10.040
And from an evolutionary perspective, what the animals are thinking might be the mechanism

30:10.040 --> 30:11.760
by which they respond.

30:11.760 --> 30:16.400
But for the trait to be favored, they just need to respond in a way that's beneficial.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.520
So if an alarm call is given and animals come raining out of the trees and that keeps them

30:20.520 --> 30:24.640
from being eaten, that's going to get passed on.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.360
Whether they think that there's an eagle or whether they think that trees have suddenly

30:28.360 --> 30:31.560
become uninhabitable is a secondary question.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.600
I have a question about that.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.880
I saw a movie once.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.680
My wife's father was a movie maker and I saw a lot of documentaries in my life.

30:39.680 --> 30:44.640
And my wife's father was a movie maker and I've seen loads of documentaries and there's

30:44.640 --> 30:47.800
this gigantic tree in Africa, I think it is.

30:47.800 --> 30:53.880
And the monkeys, whatever they are at the top, could see the eagles first.

30:53.880 --> 30:57.400
And the ones in the middle see the pythons first and the ones at the bottom see the black

30:57.400 --> 30:58.880
cat.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.720
Now each one had a different call.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.400
And so the guy at the top goes yelling in German, let's say.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.720
And then the guy in the middle speaks French and the guy at the bottom is English.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.840
So they recognize each other's calls and you hear them all yelling but each one is their

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
own thing.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
They are like a trilingual monkeys.

31:14.840 --> 31:22.240
Well, there's a whole, like particularly in West Africa.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.200
There are these kind of communication networks.

31:24.200 --> 31:29.880
So actually not even just monkeys, a range of monkey species and monkeys on the ground

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
and various of it.

31:30.880 --> 31:36.360
So you get monkeys and some, I think it's mangebiz on the ground at the various.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.440
You share each other's lines.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.040
And basically every single species.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.520
So they have a different call for a leopard from an eagle from a snake.

31:45.520 --> 31:50.920
And every single species recognizes every single of the species specific calls.

31:50.920 --> 31:56.160
So if a Diana monkey gives a leopard call, then you'll hear the black and white collar

31:56.160 --> 31:58.080
bus monkey start to give it a leopard call.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.600
Then you'll hear that the all start to give a little call.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.520
So they all recognize all of them.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.960
What do they come up with a common word?

32:04.960 --> 32:06.560
When I was doing playback experiments.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.560
Same thing happens.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.560
It happens.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
Right?

32:09.560 --> 32:17.320
And actually that's an even more interesting and bigger leap is when hugely diverged taxes

32:17.320 --> 32:23.080
such as primates and birds can actually respond to the alarm calls of the other.

32:23.080 --> 32:27.160
And I'm not familiar enough with the literature to know if anyone has any great opinions on

32:27.160 --> 32:31.920
whether or not those are learned responses or whether they're evolved responses.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.200
But either way it's a pretty impressive.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.400
They're learned responses.

32:36.400 --> 32:41.240
So if you look through development, individuals are very, very poor when they're young.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.480
And they show perceptual narrowing as they get older.

32:43.480 --> 32:49.040
So if you take a young vervet monkey, they're given a legal call to any bird.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.040
Right.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.360
Yeah, but they are predisposed to this.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.920
They're predisposed to do it.

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
But they're terrible at it.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.520
But it's that's perceptual narrowing.

32:57.520 --> 32:59.480
And you can see the range of.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.440
We can say the same about our taste buds.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.920
We can say the same about our taste buds.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.280
There's perceptual narrowing that isn't necessarily based on learning.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.960
There's ontogeny is involved in it.

33:07.960 --> 33:14.160
But I'm not necessarily convinced that we can distinguish clearly that these are all learned

33:14.160 --> 33:16.200
behaviors versus they're innate behaviors.

33:16.200 --> 33:20.160
And probably like almost everything, there's a combination of the two.

33:20.160 --> 33:26.640
Where you've got an innate predisposition that is then affixed through ontogeny.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.280
As a little monkey grows up and is making wrong calls.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.280
Everyone ignores them.

33:31.280 --> 33:35.040
No, but they were like a day and they all say, I think he's not pulling our leg.

33:35.040 --> 33:37.120
Or is it a slow thing?

33:37.120 --> 33:38.120
They just show maybe.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.960
They just narrow in through development.

33:39.960 --> 33:45.640
And they do tend to go from all birds to all large birds to all large birds.

33:45.640 --> 33:49.480
But when the rest of the people decide to fall out of the tree, because if this guy's

33:49.480 --> 33:51.400
calling bird every other day.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.800
They're calling people.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.800
They just ignore them when they're doing it.

33:53.800 --> 33:56.800
They tend to ignore the jouve and all of the jouve and all of the other things.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.520
And then they'll look at the juvenile and they'll go back to feeding.

33:59.520 --> 34:04.920
But one of the interesting things we're talking about, the heterospecific responses, I do

34:04.920 --> 34:09.320
playback experiments in the species that I study to look at responses.

34:09.320 --> 34:16.520
And one of the hardest thing I had was that I would playback the eagle call of blue monkeys

34:16.520 --> 34:18.480
to a group of blue monkeys to look at their response.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.960
And then every other species in the forest would start responding.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.200
It would just throw everything off.

34:22.200 --> 34:25.000
It was really interesting, but I wasn't looking at their responses.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.240
I mean, animals are going to live or die by the information they can take in.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.160
I mean, the way animals have to learn what to eat.

34:33.160 --> 34:34.920
I mean, they're going to learn fast.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.840
And whether it's learned or somehow there's some hardwiring that it's been selected for.

34:38.840 --> 34:44.480
I mean, you've got to figure out what information, you know, what the contingencies are basically.

34:44.480 --> 34:48.320
And I think one of the things that was very compelling about some of the work we heard

34:48.320 --> 34:51.880
in vervet monkeys was something called the audience effect.

34:51.880 --> 34:56.600
Where, you know, you might argue, well, the vervet is hardwired or she's hardwired.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.880
There's a martial eagle up there and it's going to just do this emotive call because

34:59.880 --> 35:03.400
first people thought it was just these were just emotive react responses.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.240
They weren't what's actually they didn't call them referentical.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.960
They called them semantic signals, meaningful signals.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.200
So they weren't fixed action patterns at least, right?

35:11.200 --> 35:12.200
Right.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.200
Right.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
So yeah, exactly.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.880
And there was some control, which is a big thing to think about that animals can control

35:16.880 --> 35:18.480
what they're doing.

35:18.480 --> 35:24.200
And so the vervets, if it's an ice, if it's a single vervet and that martial eagle is there,

35:24.200 --> 35:26.840
that snake is there, they don't call.

35:26.840 --> 35:29.560
They only call it there's an audience if there are other vervets around.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.880
So that's interesting and very important when you think about it.

35:32.880 --> 35:38.640
But it could just be that they're only aroused to that level when there are other individuals

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
around too.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.760
I mean, you can always send, I mean, it's Morgan's canon, right?

35:42.760 --> 35:45.200
You can always sort of up your cats.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.200
Yeah.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.200
What about the cute?

35:48.200 --> 35:52.720
Well, some of their alarm calling their sentinels and they stand up and they have jobs and they,

35:52.720 --> 35:53.720
you know.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.720
Right.

35:54.720 --> 36:02.000
I think I recently sat in a room full of people who looked at animal communication from a psychological

36:02.000 --> 36:03.480
perspective.

36:03.480 --> 36:07.240
And I sat there and discussed my work from an evolutionary perspective.

36:07.240 --> 36:10.480
And there was a lot of confusion.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.480
But we worked it all out.

36:12.480 --> 36:17.520
But I think that that's one of the things that from an evolutionary perspective, we

36:17.520 --> 36:24.920
look so much at is this behavioral pattern or is this trait adaptive in any way.

36:24.920 --> 36:30.320
And the mechanism by which it becomes adaptive isn't necessarily part of the equation in

36:30.320 --> 36:32.760
terms of is it adaptive.

36:32.760 --> 36:41.080
And I personally, when I read some of the literature, I see a lot of people wanting to make cognitive,

36:41.080 --> 36:44.200
draw cognitive conclusions based on behavior.

36:44.200 --> 36:49.800
And so when that, and I think that was, I mean to their credit, Cyfarth and Chaney actually,

36:49.800 --> 36:53.680
you know, pulled back and the whole functionally referential took over for semantic.

36:53.680 --> 36:57.760
But the very first thing anyone thought when they said, oh, they use a different call for

36:57.760 --> 36:59.200
eagle and snake.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.880
And the animals respond as if there's an eagle or a snake when they hear that call in the

37:02.880 --> 37:04.840
absence of the predator.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.560
We immediately went to a linguistic cognitive explanation.

37:09.560 --> 37:16.560
And I think what James was alluding to is that there are so many more parsimonious evolutionary

37:16.560 --> 37:21.000
explanations that don't demand that degree of cognitive awareness.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.320
It's not saying that they aren't there.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.680
And I think people have heard me say things like this, suggesting, well, there is no

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
animal.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.880
Absolutely not.

37:27.880 --> 37:32.440
I just don't think we've necessarily proved it simply by seeing, when an animal does

37:32.440 --> 37:39.960
something, we can't necessarily assign the same mental state that we would have when

37:39.960 --> 37:41.360
we did the same behavior.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.520
We just say they did it and we'll have to try to figure out what they're thinking.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.120
Have any of you ever watched hunting spiders?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.120
Mm-hmm.

37:48.120 --> 37:52.040
Like Porsche or something like Porsche?

37:52.040 --> 37:56.400
You watch this animal which you typically would want to step on.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
Watch it hunt.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.360
So these are animals that actually hunt other spiders.

38:00.360 --> 38:05.600
When you look at what their actions are and they're basically figuring out where from

38:05.600 --> 38:10.720
what position they're going to jump onto their prey, how they're going to do it, and

38:10.720 --> 38:13.680
you watch them and you're going, wait a minute.

38:13.680 --> 38:17.000
They use acoustic camouflage.

38:17.000 --> 38:21.120
They'll wait till there's wind blowing and it'll shake the web of their prey so that

38:21.120 --> 38:25.040
the prey can't necessarily detect them on the web.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.840
And you're going, this is a spider.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.840
Is a spider thinking?

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
Right.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.600
It's the same with, I mean, some of the most complicated communication at all occurs in

38:33.600 --> 38:34.600
the social insights.

38:34.600 --> 38:35.600
Yeah, bee dances.

38:35.600 --> 38:41.640
The honeybee wiggle dances are phenomenally complex where depending on how they, when

38:41.640 --> 38:47.640
the honeybee gets back to the nest after finding a food source, depending on how they dance

38:47.640 --> 38:52.840
in the nest, the angle and for how long it tells exactly the distance, the angle you

38:52.840 --> 38:54.760
should fly with respect to the sun and for how.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.520
So do we agree that that's language?

38:56.520 --> 38:57.520
Absolutely.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.520
You do?

38:58.520 --> 38:59.520
I don't.

38:59.520 --> 39:03.480
And one reason I will say it's fundamentally different.

39:03.480 --> 39:07.240
Well, again, I would just want for the record, we still have not defined language.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.880
So I can say it's not language, but I won't tell you what I think language is.

39:10.880 --> 39:18.400
But one of the big differences is that you can raise a bee in isolation or novice bee,

39:18.400 --> 39:22.640
a juvenile bee that reaches maturity and stick it in with the hive and it will do the dance

39:22.640 --> 39:24.640
the same way as its fellows.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.640
Not right away.

39:25.640 --> 39:26.640
Are you sure?

39:26.640 --> 39:28.640
All right.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.880
I will bow to your experience then.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.880
My reading of it was that they were...

39:33.880 --> 39:38.880
You know that bees go through a whole series of changes in their lives to adapt to different

39:38.880 --> 39:39.880
roles in the hive?

39:39.880 --> 39:40.880
No, absolutely.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.160
There's take any old bee and stick it in there and it's going to do what you want it

39:44.160 --> 39:45.160
to do.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
True.

39:46.160 --> 39:51.760
My reading of it was that novice bees were still capable of both interpreting and producing

39:51.760 --> 39:55.400
the correct waggle dance, the correct nectar dance.

39:55.400 --> 40:01.240
They've been put into the right state of mind.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.240
But whereas...

40:02.240 --> 40:03.240
I'm challenging.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.240
Bring it.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.880
But there's no...

40:05.880 --> 40:10.160
But I'm not aware of any human that has ever been raised in isolation that no matter what

40:10.160 --> 40:15.600
his state of mind could ever start speaking a language that they had not been taught.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.600
So the...

40:16.600 --> 40:18.760
And this goes back to your friend Nom Chomsky.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.360
I mean, the capacity for language is very different from the language.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.920
I might wrap you up to the bee hive.

40:23.920 --> 40:24.920
You wouldn't do too well.

40:24.920 --> 40:28.120
You would do a very poor job of...

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
At most things, actually.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
Yes.

40:30.120 --> 40:36.080
But I think one of the things that really distinguishes at least my view of language

40:36.080 --> 40:47.000
versus inherent or involved or inherited communication modalities of communication is that language...

40:47.000 --> 40:49.200
Not language the capacity, but language the...

40:49.200 --> 40:51.000
Is there another word?

40:51.000 --> 40:56.120
What would we call French, an example of a language rather than language capacity?

40:56.120 --> 41:00.200
Well, language in the field I'm in is very specific, defined thing.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.360
And all these concepts of meaning play no role.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.360
Right.

41:03.360 --> 41:04.360
All these concepts are what?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
Meaning.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.760
There's no particular reason to assume it has meaning.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.360
But it happens to when we use it.

41:10.360 --> 41:15.160
But in the theory of Chomsky, that communication is a secondary role for language.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.760
And in fact, what it is, it's a series.

41:16.760 --> 41:23.040
It's just a very complicated series of strings of symbols that people recognize and they

41:23.040 --> 41:25.520
know some of them are good and some of them are bad.

41:25.520 --> 41:31.640
You know, when you stop to think about what a person knows, these are standard examples.

41:31.640 --> 41:36.440
If you went to a major library in New York City and opened up any book, I don't care

41:36.440 --> 41:41.000
what it is, and put your finger on a page and took that sentence and wrote it down, how

41:41.000 --> 41:44.880
many more books in the library would you have to read till you came to that very same sentence

41:44.880 --> 41:45.880
again?

41:45.880 --> 41:48.960
And the answer is, it's not in any other book.

41:48.960 --> 41:52.600
If it's 20 words long, it's not in any other book.

41:52.600 --> 41:58.120
Now where in the world is there anything that human beings can do that they can immediately

41:58.120 --> 42:04.360
recognize a 20 word sentence and tell you whether it's grammatical English or not when

42:04.360 --> 42:07.720
there's a bazillion trillion gadillion of them?

42:07.720 --> 42:09.880
And the thing is it's a very odd capacity.

42:09.880 --> 42:12.720
It's probably related to the concepts of numbers.

42:12.720 --> 42:17.760
And it turns out every human being is a prodigy for that particular kind of symbolic logic.

42:17.760 --> 42:25.000
But the people that are particularly good at this unfortunately tend not to be articulate.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.640
And in particular Alan Turing and people, you know, it's very difficult to understand what

42:29.640 --> 42:30.640
they have.

42:30.640 --> 42:36.920
But it is very odd to see that human beings have this odd ability all around the world

42:36.920 --> 42:38.920
with no particular instruction.

42:38.920 --> 42:44.160
Look, suppose I say, I don't want to give you too many linguistic things, but suppose

42:44.160 --> 42:48.880
I say he is tall, he is not tall, he isn't tall.

42:48.880 --> 42:53.160
And I can say, you are tall, you are not tall, you aren't tall.

42:53.160 --> 42:57.200
And I can say, I am tall, I am not tall, I am not tall.

42:57.200 --> 43:01.480
Now none of you is going to go home and say, well, he's a professor and he said ampeh.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.360
So I'm going to start saying, I am tall.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.680
It's not going to work.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.760
Ampeh became ain't in English.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
Why?

43:08.760 --> 43:10.400
Nobody has any idea.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.520
But why don't people use ampeh?

43:12.520 --> 43:13.960
Nothing wrong with it.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.680
And why did they pick up ain't?

43:15.680 --> 43:18.880
And then once they picked up I ain't, they would say you ain't and he ain't and they

43:18.880 --> 43:20.160
put it everywhere.

43:20.160 --> 43:24.600
And then in some dialects you can say, I have not a book, you can say I ain't a book.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.560
So it moved from to be to have.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.840
There's very strange generalities.

43:28.840 --> 43:33.080
If you take the word himself, John saw himself.

43:33.080 --> 43:34.080
Everybody knows what it means.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.240
Shakespeare never used any reflexives.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.760
This came in in 1600.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.760
You can date it precisely.

43:39.760 --> 43:44.400
But then you said she likes herself and two dialects came off.

43:44.400 --> 43:48.760
One said, I like myself and the other one, I like me self.

43:48.760 --> 43:52.760
See since himself was the first one, you don't say his self, circularly.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.240
Well you should say, I like me self, but you don't.

43:55.240 --> 43:56.240
Why?

43:56.240 --> 43:57.240
I don't know.

43:57.240 --> 43:58.240
It's just strange.

43:58.240 --> 44:01.080
There was nobody saying you should say this and not say this.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.180
There were huge, I mean in the United States there were huge arguments as to whose dictionary

44:05.180 --> 44:07.160
was the best dictionary.

44:07.160 --> 44:11.440
And the Miriam Webster won because he gave a free copy to every editor of every newspaper

44:11.440 --> 44:12.440
in the United States.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
That's actually not it.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.520
And nothing to do with academia.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.720
And the other went to Columbia, didn't give anything away so nobody uses the Columbia spellings

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
or anything.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.720
They all think it's weird.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.720
I mean, it's not a spell.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.480
They didn't know how to make money, that's what they do.

44:25.480 --> 44:26.520
But it's a funny sort of thing.

44:26.520 --> 44:31.520
But language is a very formal kind of thing when you stop to think of what you know.

44:31.520 --> 44:36.400
If I gave you a big long sentence, everybody could correct it and everybody has razor-sharp

44:36.400 --> 44:38.200
intuitions about these things.

44:38.200 --> 44:40.360
And take a word like eke out.

44:40.360 --> 44:44.680
I can say I have a student that just barely ekes out of living and I can't say, but he's

44:44.680 --> 44:46.680
been ekeing for years.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.720
He's eke for 30 years and now he's trying to work it out.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.520
Now how in the world do you know that you can't say eke?

44:53.520 --> 44:55.120
You can say eke out.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.280
Your mother didn't tell you, come on.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.920
Nobody said always say eke out, kids, if you're saying eke.

45:00.920 --> 45:01.920
It's just something.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.200
It's some pattern to English that has nothing to do with that sound, right?

45:06.200 --> 45:07.200
I'm right.

45:07.200 --> 45:12.200
You're saying that somehow there's inherent rejection of the phonetic...

45:12.200 --> 45:14.520
Yes, inherent pattern to English.

45:14.520 --> 45:15.520
We don't know what it is.

45:15.520 --> 45:16.520
It's not acceptable.

45:16.520 --> 45:21.440
So if you raised someone in a cage in Borneo and taught them this, but then they'd never

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
heard the word eke.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
And if they heard ekeing, they would say...

45:24.440 --> 45:26.960
Well, the good problem with teaching the eke, man, it's up to gels.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
But take the...

45:27.960 --> 45:29.200
Go back to the one that's really hard, the amped.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.200
No, I don't think.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.800
If I used amped and told everybody it'd be a dollar if you use it too, it's not going

45:33.800 --> 45:34.800
to catch on.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.800
Well, not now because it's not socially acceptable.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.120
That's not as much more than it's not socially acceptable.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.120
It's not a pattern.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.480
You've got to remember you sent the syntax.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.320
It's some syntactic pattern.

45:45.320 --> 45:48.000
Look, I'm not tall.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.920
And I can say, I am...

45:49.920 --> 45:56.840
You aren't tall and you're not tall, but I can't say you're tall and do a double contraction.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.200
I bet you could say that if that became socially acceptable, it'd be fine.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.360
You do that all the time.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.360
We develop new...

46:02.360 --> 46:03.360
Look at rap.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.360
I'm from North Carolina.

46:04.360 --> 46:08.360
You should hear what I'm talking about.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.400
You could make up anything you want and sell people that you're going to have to use it.

46:11.400 --> 46:12.400
But you think language is deterministic?

46:12.400 --> 46:15.000
Well, I think it's like mathematics.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.160
I think nobody's going to come up and tell me there's a new integer between three and

46:18.160 --> 46:19.640
four and nobody's ever seen before.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.360
It's not going to happen.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.520
And language is very much like that.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.760
I think I'm not sure that I fully agree with you, but I do think there are rhythms in...

46:27.760 --> 46:31.480
I mean, human language has this bimodal rhythm.

46:31.480 --> 46:38.280
This bimodal rhythm and all human languages have a rhythm of between three and eight hertz,

46:38.280 --> 46:39.280
which is the...

46:39.280 --> 46:40.280
The...

46:40.280 --> 46:41.280
The...

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
The...

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
The...

46:43.280 --> 46:44.280
The...

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
The...

46:45.280 --> 46:46.280
The...

46:46.280 --> 46:47.280
The...

46:47.280 --> 46:48.280
The...

46:48.280 --> 46:49.280
The...

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
The...

46:50.280 --> 46:51.280
The...

46:51.280 --> 46:52.280
The...

46:52.280 --> 46:53.280
The...

46:53.280 --> 46:54.280
The...

46:54.280 --> 46:55.280
The...

46:55.280 --> 46:56.280
The...

46:56.280 --> 46:59.640
That's very, very unique like nonhuman primates don't show that bimodal rhythm in any type

46:59.640 --> 47:00.640
of...

47:00.640 --> 47:01.640
So that doesn't mean that they can...

47:01.640 --> 47:02.640
In your language?

47:02.640 --> 47:03.640
Right.

47:03.640 --> 47:04.640
No, no.

47:04.640 --> 47:05.640
But I'm...

47:05.640 --> 47:07.360
I'm just saying that whether I agree with that or not, I do agree that there are rhythms

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
to human...

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Oh, yeah.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.360
It's a human.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.360
It's a human...

47:11.360 --> 47:12.360
Well, there's a...

47:12.360 --> 47:13.360
There's a Macaque study.

47:13.360 --> 47:16.300
So since you shot down my v-argument, I'll bring up Macaque study and hopefully you haven't

47:16.300 --> 47:17.460
read that too.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.320
You're down to challenge that...

47:19.320 --> 47:21.800
There was a Macaque study that...

47:21.800 --> 47:27.760
that I'm one of those people who really get very uncomfortable

47:27.760 --> 47:29.960
when people start talking about captive studies,

47:29.960 --> 47:31.440
because I do all field work.

47:31.440 --> 47:35.240
But I'm really glad that the information is available to us.

47:35.240 --> 47:39.160
But they raised macaques in captivity

47:39.160 --> 47:41.600
without ever, I think they took them from their birth mother

47:41.600 --> 47:44.040
at one hour old.

47:44.040 --> 47:46.640
And they were never exposed to the vocalizations

47:46.640 --> 47:48.640
of their own species.

47:48.640 --> 47:51.400
And by adulthood, they had developed the entire,

47:51.400 --> 47:53.880
we already discussed, repertoire, whether or not

47:53.880 --> 47:54.480
it was a real thing.

47:54.480 --> 47:57.760
But they had developed the entire vocalizations

47:57.760 --> 47:59.120
and used all the vocal signals.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.960
I'm not sure if they tested whether or not

48:00.960 --> 48:03.400
they used them in appropriate context.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.720
But they used them all.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.560
And again, to go back to your friend

48:06.560 --> 48:09.000
in Borneo in the cage, there's no human that

48:09.000 --> 48:13.440
could ever develop any of the known living languages

48:13.440 --> 48:15.120
without ever being exposed to them.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.560
They are fundamentally different things.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.520
But I think where things get interesting is that.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.600
Try birds.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.880
Well, Ocines.

48:22.880 --> 48:27.960
There are different taxa that show different degrees

48:27.960 --> 48:30.040
of learned versus not learned and having these windows

48:30.040 --> 48:31.040
and all these different things.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.120
But I think one of the things that's really interesting

48:33.120 --> 48:37.680
is that my understanding, which is extremely limited

48:37.680 --> 48:41.400
about human linguistics, is that, and this may be

48:41.400 --> 48:45.400
a horrible simplification, is that language, the spoken

48:45.400 --> 48:46.800
language, or the written language,

48:46.800 --> 48:50.240
or any sort of symbolic language that we use as a species,

48:50.240 --> 48:52.840
reflects our cognition.

48:52.840 --> 48:55.760
We have this inherent, maybe it's not inherent,

48:55.760 --> 48:58.680
but we have thoughts in our head for one of a better term.

48:58.680 --> 49:01.680
And then language is a way we use to express that.

49:01.680 --> 49:03.520
And I think that as a result, when

49:03.520 --> 49:07.400
we look at non-humans when they vocalize or gesture

49:07.400 --> 49:08.840
or any other way, we assume that there

49:08.840 --> 49:11.880
must be something similar going on.

49:11.880 --> 49:15.200
And I don't know if that's true or not.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.800
I don't have an opinion that's not.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.080
But I think Diana does.

49:19.080 --> 49:20.080
I think I do.

49:20.080 --> 49:21.800
I want to jump in here.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.720
Because this is one of my favorite subjects right now.

49:24.720 --> 49:27.760
Because, again, you go back to ancient times.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.880
And the idea was that language and speech

49:29.880 --> 49:31.720
was inextricably linked.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.360
Ratio and ratio is what they talked about.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.960
And that because we thought that no other animals

49:36.960 --> 49:39.760
were communicating, or they didn't do anything

49:39.760 --> 49:42.840
that we could recognize as anything like our speech,

49:42.840 --> 49:46.440
even though birds are singing and dolphins are doing things

49:46.440 --> 49:48.680
and bees are doing it, we didn't know enough about that.

49:48.680 --> 49:52.080
We made the assumption, and it's continued to be an assumption

49:52.080 --> 49:55.960
that other species are devoid of thought.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.120
So I think one of the things that's really important

50:00.120 --> 50:04.800
to realize is that the brains of most animals

50:04.800 --> 50:09.240
are composed of the same building blocks.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.680
There's nothing that different about it.

50:10.680 --> 50:12.760
The organization may be really different

50:12.760 --> 50:14.800
than the number of neurons, even the cell bodies,

50:14.800 --> 50:15.800
may be different sizes.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.320
Elephants and dolphins actually have bigger neuronal bodies

50:18.320 --> 50:20.040
than do many other animals.

50:20.040 --> 50:23.600
And we don't really know very much about even our brains now.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.280
But we've tended to make this assumption.

50:25.280 --> 50:28.640
It's almost like a religious or cosmological assumption

50:28.640 --> 50:30.880
that we are different from the rest of the animal world.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.640
We're at the top of the pinnacle, and everybody's below us.

50:33.640 --> 50:35.280
And nobody else is thinking, we're

50:35.280 --> 50:37.120
the only ones who think we're the only ones who

50:37.120 --> 50:38.320
communicate using language.

50:38.320 --> 50:41.200
And language, the word language, comes from the tongue.

50:41.200 --> 50:41.760
We have a tongue.

50:41.760 --> 50:45.760
We think about speech more than any other body language,

50:45.760 --> 50:47.400
as we said before.

50:47.400 --> 50:51.480
And as we're finding more and more

50:51.480 --> 50:53.120
details, as we're discovering more details

50:53.120 --> 50:55.800
about other animal systems, we see that there

50:55.800 --> 50:58.400
is more going on than we ever thought before,

50:58.400 --> 51:03.400
behaviorally, acoustically, in terms of sensory systems.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.680
And I just think we're kind of pompous at assuming

51:06.680 --> 51:09.560
that nobody else is out there thinking.

51:09.560 --> 51:13.360
The question used to be, do other animals think?

51:13.360 --> 51:15.120
And I think the question has shifted.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.240
And I think it's no longer a question do they think.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.320
It's how do they think?

51:18.320 --> 51:19.000
How do they think?

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.440
Or how do they communicate?

51:21.440 --> 51:22.720
One thing on that.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.400
Most of the, I mean, I've worked in a lot of this stuff

51:25.400 --> 51:26.800
long before I got into linguistics.

51:26.800 --> 51:30.320
And most of the people that worked with chimpanzees

51:30.320 --> 51:32.840
and things treated them very nicely.

51:32.840 --> 51:35.480
The Georgia Institute of Technology one time decided

51:35.480 --> 51:37.280
they would put a monkey in an overwhelmingly

51:37.280 --> 51:38.840
deprived situation.

51:38.840 --> 51:41.320
And instead of giving it a banana, if it got the right answer,

51:41.320 --> 51:43.880
it would loosen the cage or open a window

51:43.880 --> 51:45.680
or let it breathe a little bit.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.440
And they tried, like crazy, to teach

51:48.440 --> 51:50.800
the animal what's called grammatical relations.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.360
No animal, apparently, can differentiate.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.280
John touched Mary from Mary touched John.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.400
This is also across the board in all web browsers.

51:59.400 --> 52:01.800
You could be rich if you could figure out a way for a web

52:01.800 --> 52:06.240
browser to do what's called thematic relations.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.600
And you can't.

52:07.600 --> 52:10.600
You can do it for trivial cases, but it doesn't work in most

52:10.600 --> 52:11.960
in all cases.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.720
And so what happens is they were never

52:13.720 --> 52:16.200
able to teach an animal to differentiate John

52:16.200 --> 52:18.440
kissed Mary from Mary kissed John.

52:18.440 --> 52:20.960
And they did it by having a, Mary was a triangle and John

52:20.960 --> 52:22.320
was a square or something.

52:22.320 --> 52:24.360
And they would try to get it so that they would put the things

52:24.360 --> 52:24.840
up.

52:24.840 --> 52:26.840
Now some animals could learn verbs,

52:26.840 --> 52:28.640
like chimpanzees could learn verbs,

52:28.640 --> 52:30.560
like kiss, touch, and things like that.

52:30.560 --> 52:34.520
Most animals can't learn a sign for verb for a verb.

52:34.520 --> 52:36.840
But every child in the world, immediately,

52:36.840 --> 52:39.720
from the time they're born, knows it's not his fault.

52:39.720 --> 52:41.880
And it's somebody else's fault.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.840
And they use grammatical relations all the time.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.040
He hit me.

52:45.040 --> 52:45.760
I didn't hit him.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.000
He hit me first.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.640
And the thing is, no animal, even with all the attempts

52:50.640 --> 52:52.680
they do to teach them grammatical relations,

52:52.680 --> 52:54.000
it doesn't work.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.440
And this is a huge thing right now,

52:55.440 --> 52:56.840
because I don't know if this is true,

52:56.840 --> 53:00.120
but it seems to be the entire web is going to be English.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.320
And they're going to have, when you put a question in in

53:02.320 --> 53:05.040
Spanish, it'll translate it into English and answer it.

53:05.040 --> 53:08.440
But in English, if you say, John took Mary the book.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.680
Mary has the book.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.280
But in German, if you say, Johann Haakmaritas Booked

53:12.280 --> 53:14.920
in Omen, it means he took it away from her.

53:14.920 --> 53:17.400
So now, when you're doing translations from one language

53:17.400 --> 53:20.040
to another, you have to know all the grammatical relations

53:20.040 --> 53:21.360
in all of these languages.

53:21.360 --> 53:22.360
She gets to be very passionate.

53:22.360 --> 53:23.720
They have to challenge you on that one.

53:23.720 --> 53:24.720
Yeah.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.520
It's important for the other.

53:26.520 --> 53:30.000
Thinking about this idea of translation,

53:30.000 --> 53:33.160
and then in school, are you not a writer?

53:33.160 --> 53:36.040
And then, what you did was you decided

53:36.040 --> 53:38.360
to then multiply the English system work

53:38.360 --> 53:42.240
to study the language that was traditionally

53:42.240 --> 53:45.280
the model language of from my culture,

53:45.280 --> 53:48.280
the language that they were drawn to by my parents.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.280
Yeah.

53:49.280 --> 53:52.120
Speak that language, learn about the language at the top.

53:52.120 --> 53:53.980
So at the age of six people, I said,

53:53.980 --> 53:58.440
well, let me see what that level one was just to say.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.240
And it was a word.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.480
I thought that I would go to English, these are two completely

54:03.480 --> 54:05.520
different concepts.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.840
But in that language, this model language of mine

54:09.840 --> 54:10.840
is the same word.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.480
What is that word?

54:12.480 --> 54:15.000
Pray and rest it.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.040
So I said, oh, so that's what they're doing when they're

54:17.040 --> 54:17.960
crying.

54:17.960 --> 54:22.320
And the idea of the passive resting,

54:22.320 --> 54:24.520
and I said, it wasn't really active.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.320
If I tell them, go out on the other hand,

54:26.320 --> 54:28.720
get something done, I'd go to that.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.640
And then this breakthrough in terms

54:31.640 --> 54:35.040
of understanding my culture.

54:35.040 --> 54:38.520
And the activity and the identity

54:38.520 --> 54:40.480
help things get done.

54:40.480 --> 54:42.920
And to me, as a writer, I'm interested

54:42.920 --> 54:46.140
in the organization of my thoughts

54:46.140 --> 54:48.120
and how, what's that next word?

54:48.120 --> 54:49.240
What's that next word?

54:49.240 --> 54:51.080
What's that next thing that we're writing?

54:51.080 --> 54:53.800
That the most exciting thing that we're writing is

54:53.800 --> 54:55.320
the next question.

54:55.320 --> 54:59.200
It's the most important one.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.720
The most important thing is the most

55:00.720 --> 55:02.640
important kind of direction.

55:02.640 --> 55:06.640
But what's interesting is, here now, looking at the language,

55:06.640 --> 55:10.320
the mother of the tongue is now giving ideas

55:10.320 --> 55:12.240
that are seen to be very contradictory,

55:12.240 --> 55:13.680
resting and praying.

55:13.680 --> 55:17.160
But it's a wonderful, kind of great thing to me as a writer

55:17.160 --> 55:19.440
to start looking at other languages.

55:19.440 --> 55:21.960
But who is about where you go?

55:21.960 --> 55:24.800
Well, each language has its own little city of synchronies

55:24.800 --> 55:26.840
to be much more mundane than prayer and resting.

55:26.840 --> 55:31.880
But suppose you want to ask, we're interested in painting something.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.920
We're interested in painting a wall.

55:33.920 --> 55:36.560
The web browsers will soon have dialogues with you

55:36.560 --> 55:37.320
rather than tell you.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.160
So if I said I want to paint a wall,

55:39.160 --> 55:40.840
I suppose I could go into a paint store here

55:40.840 --> 55:42.200
and they'd give me wall paint.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.640
But if in German, the word for von,

55:44.640 --> 55:48.040
here that's a von and a mower is outside of the house.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.480
But the word wall in English is both of them.

55:50.480 --> 55:53.240
So it could very well be, if I'm dealing with some German guy,

55:53.240 --> 55:56.280
he'd say, is the wall inside the house or outside the house?

55:56.280 --> 55:58.480
Which is not something he might ask me down here

55:58.480 --> 55:59.920
because he'd give me a different paint,

55:59.920 --> 56:02.120
but it doesn't make any sense to ask, I want to paint a wall.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.520
And there's words in different languages

56:04.520 --> 56:07.000
that they'd have to ask you a lot of context.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.520
I mean, the farthest out one I know of,

56:08.520 --> 56:11.400
some American Indian languages,

56:11.400 --> 56:13.760
most languages make a difference between I, you and me

56:13.760 --> 56:15.240
and the singular and the plural.

56:15.240 --> 56:17.400
But some American Indian languages make a difference

56:17.400 --> 56:19.320
to whether you're standing up or sitting down

56:19.320 --> 56:20.640
when you talk to me.

56:20.640 --> 56:21.960
And that's because the chiefs,

56:21.960 --> 56:23.000
I don't know what it's all about,

56:23.000 --> 56:23.840
were something like this.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.200
The chiefs never ate until everybody else ate.

56:26.200 --> 56:28.520
And so if I'm standing up and talking to you,

56:28.520 --> 56:31.400
that means I'm higher than you in the social order.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.080
And so I can imagine somebody would say,

56:33.080 --> 56:35.280
John said to Mary, what time is it?

56:35.280 --> 56:36.880
The guy'd say, was John standing up?

56:36.880 --> 56:39.200
What was Mary standing up or sitting down?

56:39.200 --> 56:41.200
And this is going to happen to you in the future

56:41.200 --> 56:44.520
as Google tries to get data out of other kinds of things

56:44.520 --> 56:48.160
because in some, we have a student from a,

56:49.080 --> 56:50.640
I won't mention the culture,

56:50.640 --> 56:52.840
but it's a culture where he cannot come in and just say,

56:52.840 --> 56:54.720
Ray, would you please sign this?

56:54.720 --> 56:55.840
He has to say, how's your wife?

56:55.840 --> 56:56.680
How's your dog?

56:56.680 --> 56:58.560
How's your child?

56:58.560 --> 57:00.160
How, what are you going to do later?

57:00.160 --> 57:01.520
And I say, what do you want?

57:02.560 --> 57:05.440
But they have to ask all these questions about your family

57:05.440 --> 57:07.080
before you can get down to things.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.960
And it's very interesting because that's a cultural thing.

57:09.960 --> 57:10.800
It's learned.

57:10.800 --> 57:12.840
That's certainly learned, I should think.

57:12.840 --> 57:13.680
Ray just said something, though.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.680
I just want to set a record straight here

57:15.680 --> 57:17.400
because I don't think that this idea

57:17.400 --> 57:19.880
that no other animal can learn anything grammatical

57:19.880 --> 57:22.120
through training, they may not use grammatical structures.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.320
We don't know enough to say they do where they don't.

57:24.320 --> 57:26.240
But the study I think you're referring to

57:26.240 --> 57:29.280
was by Dwayne Rumbaugh, one glosser filed,

57:29.280 --> 57:30.600
and Gil, is that the one?

57:30.600 --> 57:32.240
He'll be mentored, so long as I'm doing it.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.560
Yeah, and that, as the study actually I'm pretty familiar with.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.280
And what they did is they took a chimpanzee named Lana

57:37.280 --> 57:40.200
and they trained her to use an interactive computer system.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.360
And she was trained to order,

57:43.360 --> 57:47.040
to either accept or not accept grammatical sentences.

57:47.040 --> 57:47.920
And they were either grammatical

57:47.920 --> 57:49.480
or non grammatical, she actually could do it.

57:49.480 --> 57:50.480
That's black, she came up with it.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.600
Yeah, it's lexigrams, and she actually did it.

57:52.600 --> 57:54.960
She was trained to do it and to reject non grammatical.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.360
It was a science paper.

57:56.360 --> 57:59.880
And then she actually used it in some novel ways

57:59.880 --> 58:02.680
to manipulate and get one of the trainers

58:02.680 --> 58:04.480
into this very sterile environment

58:04.480 --> 58:06.120
that you described as extremely sterile.

58:06.120 --> 58:10.200
And then years later, Lou Herman out the University of Hawaii,

58:10.200 --> 58:13.040
and again, it was a fairly rigid system,

58:13.040 --> 58:15.560
but he actually trained dolphins using food

58:15.560 --> 58:19.200
to respond to a set of rules.

58:19.200 --> 58:25.720
And they were take hoop to window or take ball to hoop.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.680
And they had to do the correct behavior.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.600
So animals can be trained to do it.

58:29.600 --> 58:32.040
We don't know if they do that in their own forms,

58:32.040 --> 58:33.920
but they have that capacity.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.280
So I think, I don't think it's completely accurate

58:36.280 --> 58:37.960
to say that no other animal shows it.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.600
And then the other point I just want to make,

58:39.600 --> 58:41.560
since we're talking about animal communication,

58:41.560 --> 58:45.440
and language is that we used Chomsky and others

58:45.440 --> 58:48.880
have argued that we have these special syntactic structures,

58:48.880 --> 58:52.560
some module in our brain, and that propels us

58:52.560 --> 58:54.680
to learn language with very little effort,

58:54.680 --> 58:56.000
and that no other animals do it.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.280
So if you're a human, very young children

58:58.280 --> 59:01.600
can distinguish between paw and paw and paw,

59:01.600 --> 59:03.720
and well, that was evidence that we

59:03.720 --> 59:05.000
have these special structures.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.160
But guess what?

59:06.160 --> 59:07.760
Other animals do the same thing.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.880
You can play birds, and you can play gerbils,

59:09.880 --> 59:12.440
and other animals, paw, paw and paw.

59:12.440 --> 59:15.160
And they can distinguish those sounds too.

59:15.160 --> 59:19.520
So the view has moved, I think, in my world, at least,

59:19.520 --> 59:21.760
what I've learned, that we certainly

59:21.760 --> 59:23.880
have varniki and broca's area in the brain

59:23.880 --> 59:25.640
for production and comprehension.

59:25.640 --> 59:29.040
But this idea of processing sounds

59:29.040 --> 59:31.160
that happen to be language sounds

59:31.160 --> 59:33.800
may be much more due to general mechanisms

59:33.800 --> 59:35.160
for acoustic perception.

59:35.160 --> 59:37.120
But they're also very speechless.

59:37.120 --> 59:40.320
And a lot of the studies, if you did the reverse of that,

59:40.320 --> 59:45.560
I always have a quizzical opinion of tests

59:45.560 --> 59:50.560
of non-human animal cognition when they give them animal tests.

59:50.560 --> 59:53.280
Because I saw the study where they had this puzzle,

59:53.280 --> 59:55.520
and they got a four-year-old human girl,

59:55.520 --> 59:57.720
and they said, how long will it take her to do the puzzle?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.760
And she figured out the puzzle, and she got the treat out of it.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.480
And then they got a bunch of chimpanzees through,

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.880
and eventually they did that.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.480
And they said, ah-ha, we figured out

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.640
that chimpanzees are about as intelligent as a four-year-old

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.480
human girl.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.360
And I said, stick that four-year-old human girl out

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.040
in the forest and see how intelligent she looks

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.640
in a chimpanzee context.

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:17.720
And I think that's, so for example,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.360
we've done the same studies with non-human primates

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.120
in terms of their ability to distinguish

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.360
what are acoustically, practically identical.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.920
Green did a study on the cacks where he kept seeing

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.200
these different responses to what he thought was the same call.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.360
And then using spectrographic analysis,

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.800
he found that there was this minute difference

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.160
that we couldn't perceive acoustically,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.520
but that the macaques were responding to categorically.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.360
And so in the same way that people, even among humans,

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360
people have a heart that lived in Thailand for a while,

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.960
and people, it's tonal language.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.720
And I never could understand the difference,

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.440
but to them it was very categorical.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.600
We're in the same species.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.920
So imagine the differences, how each species is genetically

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.200
and physiologically tuned to the specificity

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.880
of their own communication system.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.000
And when tests are fairer and more appropriate,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.320
they typically do much better.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.360
So there was a whole host of studies in research monkeys

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.960
that looked at pointing as a gesture,

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.440
where the human observer pointed towards something,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.320
and then they tried to see whether the research monkey would

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:33.160
look, was capable of following the attention

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.920
of another individual.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.520
And they didn't get any results, of course.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.160
But of course, research macaques don't point with their arms.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.880
And actually when they started doing it with gaze and with heads

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.800
and things, then they started to do much, much better.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.800
Because they are actually interested

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.560
in where other research macaques are looking.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:54.160
But of course, it's not a very fair test to show how they point.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.080
Just to come back to your point on the brain mechanisms

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.040
of some of these things, I think I broadly agree

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.520
that a lot of the central structures are the same.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.640
There are some of the, and this comes back

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.600
to what you were just saying before, some of the properties

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.800
of human language that we do understand,

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.960
like the bi-modal rhythm and stuff.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.320
We do understand kind of the mechanisms

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.640
that that's a coupled oscillation between neurons

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.280
and the brain line.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.440
And that's pretty much a unique human thing

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.600
as far as you're aware of which.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.880
And that gives human language that unique rhythm cognitively.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:32.680
I'd like to come back to what you said.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.880
Yeah, you said the poor monkeys in the cages,

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.800
but they weren't feeding them very well.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.200
And they had to do with a minimal thing

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.760
to even get some water.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.280
It wasn't that they just did grammatical sentences.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.840
They were trying to teach them the difference

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.600
between John Kist, Mary, and Mary Kist John.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.440
But in children, very young ones, even,

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.280
that extends far beyond that.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.880
For instance, suppose there was a big ink stain on the floor

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.200
and somebody comes in and says, who put it there?

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.280
I can't say I confess he did it.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.600
I can say, it doesn't make any sense.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.760
I can say I confess I did it.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.400
I can accuse him.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.440
I can say I confess he did it.

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:11.760
But now suppose it's in my class and the dean

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.360
comes in and says, professor, who put that ink stain?

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.000
I can say I confess it was one of my students.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.880
Then I can point to him.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.680
Now suppose the president of the college comes in.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.440
And he says, who put that ink stain there?

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.200
I can say I confess the dean did it.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.120
See, as long as there's a hierarchy of people,

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.960
you can confess for all sorts of people

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.120
if you're vaguely related to them.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.040
Now take something else.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.000
Suppose I walk out of the building here

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.240
and some woman comes up and says,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.040
I just want to van Klyburne competition and piano.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.520
I can't say I'm very proud of you

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.960
because I don't have anything to do with it.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.720
Now if she had been one of my students years ago

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.400
and I'd say, oh, why don't you pick up the piano?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.080
Linguistics is dead.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.040
And she went to the piano.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.720
Then I can say I'm very proud of you.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.000
But I can't be proud of somebody.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.120
I don't even know who they are.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.600
And I can't confess for a large number of people.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.560
But in every, I don't know if this is true,

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.800
but we tried it out on dozens of languages.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.200
The word confess is the same in every language of the world.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.040
That's what it tells you.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.760
There's something about who did it.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.080
And the other thing is there's a word for blame

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.480
because the concept of agency to a child

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:16.200
is supposed to be your kid and you still live on the floor.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.400
You said, who did it?

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.360
The kid will say, I did it, but he made me do it.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.080
So it's not his fault.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.600
It's transference of agency or something.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.760
But very concrete.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.440
This is after a certain age, up to their three or four,

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.480
they're not even capable of having

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.560
very mental states at all.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.240
Yeah, it's a belief test.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.720
But it's one of the very first things

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.840
that's emergent in an intelligent brain.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.600
And it's not in any computer.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600
You can't program this.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.920
It's impossible to even think of how you program it.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.280
And it doesn't seem to happen in any animals.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.960
We don't know what's happening in the brains

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.720
of other animals, though, because we have no way to know.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.520
Yes, it's like bugs.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.200
What can do is observe behavior.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.840
So you can look at some of the work that Franz Zivall

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.160
has done with primates and look at this idea of inequity

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.840
and think about what's fair.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.120
I mean, you can do two tasks.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.840
And if Chris has those two tasks,

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.640
and he gives you a cappuccino for doing that.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.040
And I get that crappy glass of water.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.480
I'm going to be pretty ticked off

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.360
that I didn't get the cappuccino.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.800
And you can see primates will also feel that way.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.880
So the Great Apes will.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.840
The monkeys may not, but the Great Will Monkeys do as well.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.120
So they have a sense of inequity.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.040
They're animals that seem to show empathy.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.280
They don't talk about it like we do in a way

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.200
that we can understand.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.600
Maybe they do communicate it some ways,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.040
but we don't understand that it gets us to the point of us

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.520
being blind and deaf to what these other animals are doing.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.960
Because we can talk all about what we're doing here

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.800
is we're still talking about human language.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.120
We understand human language.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.120
We're humans.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.280
We're talking about animal community, other animal systems.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.720
What do we really know about those systems

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.480
when we can decode them?

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.520
And I think that's why putting in an adaptive framework

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.000
is a good place to start.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.840
Even if the ultimate objective is to understand cognition,

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.400
understand the way of thinking, I think

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.320
putting in an adaptive framework first

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.720
sort of levels the field.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.040
Because again, to go back to that poor little girl

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.040
that I wanted to throw in the forest with the chimpanzees

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:23.800
to prove that that intelligence equation wasn't appropriate

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.960
is that animals evolve within the social and ecological context

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.720
of their species, or sorry, species

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.760
of all within their ecological and social niches.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:39.240
And so if a particular trait wasn't beneficial

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.920
or wasn't adaptive, we have this sort of hierarchy.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.240
I think humans have this sort of sense of, well,

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.400
we say words like intelligence in where humans have superior

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.160
or inferior intelligence.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.480
And I just think we have species that

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.000
have adapted appropriate strategies

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.120
for dealing with their ecosystems and their social context.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.040
And if language or the ability to communicate

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:06.840
through complex and tactical structures

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.560
was never necessitated or was never selected for,

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.960
we would likely see its absence.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.520
And I think one of the things, just because I'm

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:18.080
talking about keep going.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:19.960
One of the things I noticed that we haven't mentioned

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.880
is that when we tend to distinguish

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.120
between human communication and we call it

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.800
and we say language, and non-human communication,

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.480
which we, you know, vocalization, whatever.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:31.440
But what about crying and screaming and laughing

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.320
and smiling and all the innate blushing?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.760
That's true.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.280
It's right up James's alley.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.960
He studies coloration in his face.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.560
It's not that he blushes his life.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.160
He might blushing.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:41.760
Now he's blushing.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.120
He's blushing.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.120
Yeah.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.400
But a lot of communication, but no words.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:46.900
Right.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.320
There's an enormous amount of what

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:56.000
I consider non-linguistic communication evolved

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.960
inherited traits in terms of human communication that

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.080
is utterly outside of the scope of linguistics and language.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.680
And when I look at non-human communication systems,

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.480
they tend to appear to me a lot more similar to things

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.640
like laughing and crying and screaming

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.080
and smiling and blushing.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:19.280
Then they do to Shakespeare.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.000
So you said something before that made an assumption

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.480
about why we're sitting here and that

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.680
was they were interested in cognition?

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.040
I thought because Beth and I did us.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.080
But I thought we were talking about animal communication.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.360
Well, and actually, it's, well, I think that's,

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.600
and maybe I'm creating a strong man here,

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.480
but I think that a lot of the communication literature

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.240
that I've read and I tend to be very

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.440
focused on communication from an evolutionary perspective.

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.720
I think there is a tendency to inappropriately and often

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.920
unintentionally conflate a cognitive mechanism for a major

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.000
or evolutionary explanation.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.400
But I think it's, so I think that that happens a lot.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.720
But I think another thing that happens

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:06.880
is that people who are interested in cognition

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.960
look at communication.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:14.040
So in the same way that humans infer the cognition of fellow

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.960
humans based on self-reporting.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.600
So we use communication to understand

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.440
what one another is thinking.

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.360
I think part of it's a terminology problem

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.080
because people in animal communication

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.120
talk about signalism receivers.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.440
So you have some sort of signal or sender.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.560
Senders and receivers.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.960
You have a sender and a receiver.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.280
And you communicate between the sender of receiver

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.720
and then the receiver somehow changes their behavior.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.920
So as soon as you have senders, you

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.680
have a message that the sender has constructed,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.720
packaged up, and sent to the receiver.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.840
So there's this informational package

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.800
somehow that's a product of the sender.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.920
Now I'm happy with informational constructs

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.080
in animal communication, but I think

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.080
there are products of receivers, not a product of senders.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:05.120
So if an individual, if I do anything right now,

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.040
what it communicates depends on you.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.640
It depends on what you extract and perceive

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.920
from what I'm doing.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.320
I can say all the words I like.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.720
I can make all the gestures I want.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.920
I can do everything I want now.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.480
But the information that's in my communication that

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:25.160
goes to you as the receiver is not a construct of me at all.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.120
It's a construct of you.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.560
So I think that the whole, I'm happy with information

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.120
being an extractive amount of more communication,

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.080
but I think it needs to be as long as we're talking about it

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.640
as a construct of receivers rather than.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.400
So I think senders and signalers and words like this

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.360
are unhelpful, because they give the idea that somehow the message

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.320
is a product of me rather than a product of you.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.440
And the mistake I think that people

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.480
make without study communication theories,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.440
that there's some inherent meaning in the message is what

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.360
you're saying.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:55.880
There's nothing in the message itself.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
It's how it's perceived.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.600
It's in the meaning.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.240
It's in the sense what you're saying.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.200
But a message can be extracted from it.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.760
That's it to the receiver.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.480
But there's not an inherent message there

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.480
that you can objectively look at.

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.520
It's in them.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.120
So because of that, some people would

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.560
argue that, therefore, we should just

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.720
cut information as a concept out of communication.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.080
Look, information isn't really.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.960
Don't talk to me.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.840
They just want to talk to me out here.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.000
They're in the round up.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.880
The information can't be contained within animal communication

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.200
because it's not a thing that's packaged up by senders.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.080
But for me, as long as the perceiver

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.120
is able to extract something from something

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.560
that they've observed and have a reduction in uncertainty

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.840
about the state of the world, which

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.160
is a true definition of information.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.000
I can understand an weaver type definition.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.240
Then I don't see how can they not have been informed

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.720
in some way as a perceiver?

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.480
Because I, well, it's going to get long.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.360
But I think one of them is recently.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.680
But I failed miserably then.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.680
I don't expect to do any better now.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.480
But I actually had to pull that out of my introduction

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.560
chapter, my whole diatribe against the information theory

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.400
and animal communication.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.000
It's a question of interpretation.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.880
And I think there's different uses of the word information.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.880
I think most lay people use it as sort of synonymous with data.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.240
So you're wearing a blue shirt.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.640
Well, that's a piece of information.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.720
And then mathematics and linguistics.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.220
Right.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.240
Well, that's a function of view.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.600
Because if you can't see blue, then you don't know.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.280
So there's nothing to do with me.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:31.780
Right.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.760
There's nothing inherent in it.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.760
But if you weren't wearing a blue shirt, I know.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.800
We wouldn't be talking about.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.720
But interesting that you talk about the reduction

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.600
of uncertainty, which is an inherent, I take to believe

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.280
and I was wrapped on the knuckles for this firmly.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.480
But I still take to be a cognitive state

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.480
that uncertainty is a state of awareness to some degree.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.320
And so information theory in a way

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.400
that's used in communication is really

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.880
talking about a predictability or a state.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.240
And I think a lot of communication doesn't necessarily

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.040
have anything to do with predictability or state.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.800
So you wouldn't think that a B drone that's

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800
just seen a waggle dance is now capable of totally flying

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.400
straight to a food source that they were completely unaware

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.360
of previously has obtained any information about the state

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.600
of the world from the waggle dance.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.880
It depends on how we construe the term information.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.320
So I mean, what narratives?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.920
You really don't think that gained information.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.880
I know.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.760
I told you, I would lose this fight.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.600
I would keep fighting it in one of these days.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.240
I'll figure out how to articulate it.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.720
So what's the word we use other than information?

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.000
If you would like to look at this after my dissertation

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.360
that I pulled out, I've said that signal content actually

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.760
is a useful construct.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.640
And the way I define it, and some would say

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.000
that there's really no difference.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.520
And I use a rather sophomoric example.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.800
But if a tree falls in the woods and no one's there

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.680
to hear it, does it make a sound?

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.080
Absolutely it makes a sound.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.400
The laws of physics say it makes a sound.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.360
And the weight of the tree, the angle of its trajectory,

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.760
how hard it hits the ground, what's

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.800
on the ground underneath it, will determine characteristics

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.880
of that sound, how the amplitude, the frequency,

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.680
the degree of crackle, or whatever you want,

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.720
however you want to describe that sound.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.840
If no one's there to hear it, there's

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.160
no information gained.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.600
There's no uncertainty changed.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.160
But there is content in that, just

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.240
to use the analogy of a signal, the sound that that tree makes,

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.280
has characteristics that relate to the event.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.640
So in the same way, my voice has in heron

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.200
as indexical properties about my body size.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.240
So if I hollow out, there will be

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.480
formants and all sorts of things you can measure,

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.560
and it will relate to my skeletal length.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.720
But if none of you are here to hear it,

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:57.200
there's no difference in your understanding of my body size.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.360
But it doesn't take away from the fact that that signal is.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.560
But we can distinguish potential information

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.720
from perceived information.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:02.720
Of course.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.640
I mean, it's fine.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.320
I think it's the same.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.920
That's what we talked about.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.480
But then to go just to push that a little bit further,

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:12.760
if in a linguistic model, if I were to say to you,

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:17.000
there's a person outside with a birthday cake just for you,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.200
that would be information.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200
It'd be pretty much.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.240
I think it's afternoon before camera time.

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.600
I've been told that before.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:31.000
I think it's very important that we have an audience with information.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.320
But we really want to hold that question.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.320
Oh.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:41.320
We're going to go for about another five-time.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.800
We should probably not end on information theory,

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:47.520
because everyone will end saying that James' character really

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.080
just lost it there at the end.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.360
But the one thing I would distinguish, I think,

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:55.240
is that I have softened my objection to this somewhat.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.960
I think the distinguishing characteristic

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:03.120
is that from a human linguistic and cognitive framework,

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.560
we process information very specifically.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.600
We think there's a birthday cake out there,

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.040
and that will change.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.760
Now I'm no longer uncertain as to what's waiting for me.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:18.000
And now my behavior will be based on my conscious awareness

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.960
of that outside thing.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.200
When we look at non-human responses,

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.800
there can be evolved responses that

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.640
have absolutely nothing to do with a conscious awareness of anything

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:34.080
that was related to the signal itself.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.880
And so I think probably, as you said earlier,

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.480
one of the problems is terminology.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.160
So depending on how we want to define information,

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.640
I don't necessarily have a problem with it.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.960
But what I have a problem with it is the assumption

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.880
that animal responses have to be based on some sort of awareness,

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.280
necessarily, of the quote, information in the signal.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.520
I actually don't think most people start there,

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.040
because I'm a cognitive psychologist.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.560
I think we look at animal signals and try to look at,

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.320
when we talk about, you can look at communication

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.200
from the order in which the signals occur,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.520
the structure of the signals, how they're used

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.360
pragmatically in terms of how do they function.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.000
And then when you look at those things,

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.640
there are times at which you say,

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.240
I think I'm seeing something systematic here.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.440
And then you can then design an experiment to test it further.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.320
But I don't really know that many scientists who

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.200
have looked at signals that animals produce and say,

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.800
oh, there's some heavy-duty cognitive underlying thought

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.600
there without doing some pretty hard studies.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.520
I mean, people may stay.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.840
There's too much in the alarm call.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.400
Yeah, you should read the primary people.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400
The primary people.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.200
The bystander in search.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.720
They get worked up about it in the primary.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.520
The alarm calls.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.040
But I'm talking about the other.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.520
I'm talking about outside of that.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.000
With the birds song.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
With whale song.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.440
I don't think people are really putting all that heavy

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.560
cognitive stuff in there.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.080
I think that's one of the problems here,

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.320
is that when you were before describing

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:04.200
this whole movement or the distinguishing

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:07.400
between communication and cognition,

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.640
I think one of the problems is that, first of all,

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.760
I think some of these arguments are basically

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.160
cul-de-sacs, they're going nowhere.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.200
They're infatuations with our own self.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.720
And cognition is a projection of our own abilities

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.360
onto these other systems.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.680
And so you're never going to find it because we'll always

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.320
argue about whether it is or it isn't.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.280
We'll come up with new terms and whatnot.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.480
So the question is, what are we talking about?

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:37.040
Are we talking about do animals communicate?

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.880
What level, what depths do they communicate?

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.240
I think we impose a value system

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:48.560
so that a Porsche, when Stem Wilcox actually

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.320
shows these animals look like they're thinking,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.400
and they are anticipating what's going to happen

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.720
in the future in the past, we go, oh, but it's a spider.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:00.760
But if we have a non-human primate,

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.080
we go through all these elaborate expectations,

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:04.720
et cetera, et cetera.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.840
So we impose a value system on it.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.560
If it has cognition, it must be greater value.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.600
Wales, primates, greater value.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.200
And I think that is a really false paradigm

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.720
for looking at life.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.880
Because any way you look on this planet,

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.240
there are just amazing things going on

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.600
that have gone through the evolutionary process

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.640
that we can't really explain.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.280
How can you, any of us here, understand,

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.280
imagine being in a system where the animals are working

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.160
over 100,000 hertz bandwidth.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.120
They have three simultaneous sound production mechanisms.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.560
They can perceive sound through multiple channels

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.120
at the same time.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.960
You and I can't even appreciate it.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.520
And yet we're trying to make a distinction

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.680
of whether it has cognition or doesn't have cognition.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.640
Do you mean different sensory systems?

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.000
Hmm?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.640
No.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.440
Within the same sensory system.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.840
Auditorium.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.120
Sitations will be receiving signals

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.200
through multiple places in their heads.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.480
But then is it all, does it all feed in through the same kind

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.040
of sensory system or such?

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.360
Well, eventually, presumably it ends up somewhere

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.560
in auditory cortex.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:13.760
I'm asking because there's, I think there's interesting

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:17.920
questions here about what we consider to be universities

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.760
multisensory in communication.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:25.280
Because we have quite specific, we have quite specific sensory

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.040
systems.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.320
So if I see you and I hear you talking at the same time,

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.480
I have my auditory and visual cortex, et cetera, et cetera.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.600
So there's plenty of animals, insects, for example,

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:44.120
have a completely separate system for detecting the same chemical

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.800
signal that was sent through the air, then contacts came out

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.000
reception, right?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.040
So then do we define a signaling modality

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.840
on the basis of its production?

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.960
I get some vocal signal that's sent through the C.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.800
Or if there's more completely separate multiple sensory

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.800
systems for detecting it, does that then become a multisensory

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.520
signal?

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.840
Here's my question.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.360
But in the incitations, it sounds like that.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:16.080
So they have, it's just actually one sensory system,

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.360
but just multiple ways of detecting it.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.120
They have basically receptors into the physical entity

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.320
called their body.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.280
They are coming through different parts of their skull.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.120
And I almost want to, this is sort of challenging,

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.640
but I almost want to say, well, does it really matter

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.360
if we define that they have a multisensory system?

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.320
I think it does matter, yeah.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.120
Why does that matter?

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.920
Because multisensory communication is different.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.600
Well, who cares if it's different?

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.960
I think it's different cognitively, functionally,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.040
it evolves differently.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.840
So does that mean we place a different value

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.880
on that system that has multisensory?

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.200
No, but I think of it somehow inflates ourselves

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.720
and says, oh, wow, we found something that's

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.120
more complicated than us?

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.120
Why can't you just enjoy the fact that there's

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:07.120
an animal that works up to 220 kilohertz, right,

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.040
that has received through its jaw,

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.120
receives through the back of the head, receives through it, right?

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.800
I mean, I can appreciate that from a static sense,

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.480
but as a scientist, I'm also interested in studying it

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.680
and asking questions or something.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.600
But also, they're visual, they're tactile.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.920
They should, the general, if we are.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.000
And actually, we've had a lot of communications.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.320
Stations aren't very visual.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:26.320
They are.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:26.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.280
They change their positions.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:31.480
They have a visual phobia that works in the air

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480
and in the water.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.280
Nice to see you.

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.960
We've talked a lot today about human language, for example,

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.320
and you started touching on gesture.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.760
But actually, human language is completely

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.320
multisensory from the start.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.480
It's impossible to make the words that we make

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.240
without concomitant movements of the lips.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.640
And this, from looking at people,

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.960
we get a much, much better understanding of what they're saying.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.240
Even if you can only see the lips,

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.520
if you cut the rest of the head off,

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.200
everything, if you just see their lips,

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.760
you get a much better understanding.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.120
And this visual signal, following the lips,

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.040
is not something that's piggyback to on,

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.280
that humans have evolved a vocal communication system.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.200
And then we've added on a bit of visual signal.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.880
It's right from the start.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.920
The visual signal of watching the lips

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.360
and the vocal signal coming into the ears

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.040
are integrated at the very, very first step

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.840
of cortical processing.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.000
And it's the same in non-human primates,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.440
as well as in humans.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.120
And your dolphins don't have any facial gestures, right?

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.640
No, but they have body positions.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.240
They have body positions.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.320
But most of them can't even see each other

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.240
when the community can see this.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.240
Right.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.320
Well, that's a species I study.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.720
They have a series of what are called loud calls,

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.520
which I think is rather uninformative.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.880
They have calls that can be heard almost a kilometer away.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.880
And then they have calls that can barely be heard

01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.760
more than a few meters away.

01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.440
And they use them in different contexts

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.880
and presumably selection has favored them

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.920
for having different functions.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:06.320
So there are, I think, so what James was saying there.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.440
And clearly with the whales, we're

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.840
looking over 1,000 kilometers of the ability

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.360
to communicate, the ability to produce and perceive

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.040
a signal with no other, with no additional information,

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.200
no other modality to accompany it,

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.520
no other visual or gestural or chemical, et cetera.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:27.040
And then we have others that are

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.960
evolved within this very close multi-dimensional or multi-modality

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:32.880
space.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.000
And I just think that selection favors them

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.560
for different reasons in different ways.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.760
But they're probably built on some fundamental underlying

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.880
foundation of perception and reception

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.640
and then diverged over time.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.140
Great.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.640
Thank you guys for just a few minutes.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:51.640
I don't know.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.640
I don't know.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.640
I'm not going to be honest.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.240
I was asking John and Dwight, who

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.160
would have been asking to rock for us to be the first to speak?

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:05.660
Really?

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:08.280
Because I think he's going to yell at me.

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.000
You might be yelling at me.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.320
Now he's the young vervet that needs to be.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.640
I'm going to try to yell at him.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.640
What I wanted to clarify was this.

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:25.760
You said that the understanding is created in the receiver.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.280
Well, that's true unless the sender and the receiver

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.480
have previously agreed a set of signals.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:35.680
If the sender and the receiver have previously

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.800
agreed what the various signals mean,

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.240
then it's the sender who constructs the semantics

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.320
and not the receiver.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.440
So if I have a very simple system,

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:48.480
which is to tell you to turn on a light switch or turn it off,

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.080
and we agree before that when I raise my arm like this,

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.240
you turn it off.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.160
And when I do this, you turn it off.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.640
Then I'm the one who's giving meaning to the signal.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.840
Now that's important because we may fallaciously

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.640
have assumed that built into each of us

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.840
is some standard set, which is biologically determined.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.120
And therefore we have agreement built into us before.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.120
And therefore when an animal sends out a signal,

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.200
it's the sender who is generating the information

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:25.960
and not the receiver, namely if we're all hardwired,

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:30.520
if animals were hardwired to respond to it when the tail goes up,

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.760
there is something hardwired in an animal

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.160
to say, I know what that means, not

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.360
know in the cognitive sense, but to know the response.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:41.120
Then indeed it would be the reverse of what you were saying.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.440
So I just wanted us to be careful about the fact

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.680
that we're giving up on information theory

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.880
as it was originally created by Shannon,

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:54.520
was exactly this notion to have this prearranged set of signals

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.480
from which you are choosing.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.760
And so if you're going to use the word information theory,

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.720
that does presuppose this.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:05.320
And so I think you do need to worry about that.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.320
That's right.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.560
No, I was just going to say, so if you look at basic communication

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.080
books for human communication, you see these diagrams.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.360
And we talk about a transactional model.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.200
So you've got sender, receiver, both being both,

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.120
because it's a highly dynamic system.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.280
You're sender, receiver at the same time.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.120
And then the meaning, the sender has an understanding,

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.400
like you're saying, they have an idea of what this message is

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.440
in their head.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.800
And the receiver has an idea.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.360
But there's not an absolute message.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.000
They both have a meaning in their heads

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.200
in terms of the information that's going up.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:39.440
But it may not be the same.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.560
That's why there's no inherent meaning in any one message.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.920
It's what they both perceive.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920
Here's an animal communicating.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.440
Perfect.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.720
This is what we needed.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.680
And there it goes.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:00.520
I have an interesting, I'm not sure that it's all gone.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.480
You bring a cute puppy in, and it's all,

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.040
I should have brought a cute puppy to my defense

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.840
and would have gone a lot faster.

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:10.600
But how would you, I mean, this is all for behavioral signals.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.360
But most animal communication, a lot of animal communication

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:16.000
is not about behavior.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.640
I mean, how would you consider the bright red sexual swelling

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.160
of an olive baboon, say, something that grows?

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.440
And arouses the male.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.120
And because it's associated with fertility and blah,

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.480
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we can, you know,

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.480
the male gets excited and they send that on the other

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.800
and he copulates and blah, blah.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.920
And from the male's perspective, it

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:43.600
may be that he has some idea about that in terms of where

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.720
it's going, maybe it doesn't.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.880
But then certainly, there's nothing

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.200
going on in the female's head, right?

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.560
It's just a morphological grip.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.480
A combination.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:51.960
Right, right.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.160
And I said, if any of you do a combination of simply

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.120
to understand that you have acquired into us

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:01.560
some standard actions that are common just

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.360
from my genetics, then there are

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.280
these information that you have in ones that you have heard,

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.280
which is valid and clear.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.720
And these are not subjects of all this.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.800
We don't know what's going on.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.480
It's like that.

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.960
That's the point that it makes you lose.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:21.040
Right, but the precise information

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.680
that the receiver would take from it

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.880
will always depend on the receiver.

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.320
On their ability to perceive it, their sensory systems,

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.080
their experience, all these things

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.560
are going to nuance how they're going

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.000
to interpret the signal.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Not much of that.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Take the ability to do that in more ways

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.600
and really impact the same thing

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.200
when you get the signal.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.560
I think it can be, but I think a lot of animal communication

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.240
is not like that.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:45.760
I am.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.760
You are the expert.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:47.760
I'm not the expert.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:48.760
I'm the expert.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.040
It's not important.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:51.880
Yes.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.680
I always thought that what did say

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.840
which is language and other forms of communication,

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.840
that the language has an underlying grammar.

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:02.440
And I was just wondering, is it true that all human languages

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.120
have an underlying grammar?

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:07.120
And that if anyone sounds underlying grammar

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:09.280
for any form of animal communication,

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.960
and it's not as anybody even looking into that?

01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:13.920
Well, we talked a little bit about the animal communication

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:15.680
stuff earlier with chimps and teaching them simple.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.320
Are there any grammar?

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.880
Are there any grammar?

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.280
Let's go to the human language stuff.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.520
A very interesting thing to read is this fellow Jimmy Button.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.120
I don't know if you've ever heard of him,

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.160
but he was a whenever the Darwin put down on the beagle.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.320
They kidnapped Jimmy Button, the young boy about 10,

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.400
and took him to England and taught him everything.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.840
He went to Cambridge, you name it.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.680
And they taught him all sorts of foreign languages

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.840
and everything else.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.720
So one of the things that was very popular in the United

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:44.640
States also in the 1600s was to kidnap an Indian

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.400
and bring them to Europe and teach them all sorts

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:47.600
of different languages.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.520
The most famous one was Samuel Occam,

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:53.200
who apparently was a genius of all imaginable sizes.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.520
And he's the one that actually scared up the money

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.000
for all the Ivy League colleges.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.640
Because they said, if you can do that with an Indian,

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.000
what's next?

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.040
So apparently any human being from anywhere in the world

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:07.680
can learn any language anywhere with no trouble at all.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.120
The most complicated language, most linguists agree,

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.120
is a language called Wahlperi, which

01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.480
is spoken at Ayers Rock in Australia.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:18.080
It has cases beyond anybody's imagination for what cases

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.120
could be.

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.880
Children learn it flawlessly with no effort whatsoever.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:23.760
Adults have one hell of a time.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.480
There are two people that I met in my life

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.720
that can learn both deceased now.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.080
But they can learn any human language on exposure

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.360
for about a year and be totally fluent.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.800
This ability usually disappears in most people,

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.560
but it doesn't in all.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.120
So it seems to be the case that there's

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.640
an inherent thing in people's heads

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.320
that enables them to learn languages that are really

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:44.920
honest to God spoken by other human beings.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.880
Now, when it comes down to animals,

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.360
we were talking about this earlier,

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.760
what kinds of symbol systems can they use?

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.080
And can they use mathematics?

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.440
And can they use symbols for different sorts of things?

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.880
Just offhand, to my own feeling on this,

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.600
is they don't tend to symbolize their activities.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.360
It's no particular reason why they should

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:03.840
symbolize their activities.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:05.600
I think with all the things you're talking about,

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:08.400
they do gestural sorts of things and interpret

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.680
each other's gestures rather than noises.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:13.960
And human beings tend to be visual creatures that like sounds.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:18.480
And so I mean, I've seen movies of animals

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.920
that watched people do things, and then they started doing them

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:24.920
too, and maybe they learn that kind of a system.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.320
But there's something very unusual about the human being

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.120
that it's a total symbol using creature.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.080
And in fact, we talk about the messages

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.000
and the message content.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.720
In Shannon's thing, there's no message content at all.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.000
In fact, he has a sentence in there

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.480
that gets many people mad.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.600
He says, I don't even care if there are messages.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.600
He just wants to know how many tell of,

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.440
if you have your cell phone breaks,

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.520
and you take it to the dealer, he's not going to say,

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.040
what do you talk about?

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.720
You don't care.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.800
And he's not going to say, what language do you use?

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.640
He doesn't care.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.120
He's going to plug a bunch of gizmos in

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.400
and get it back working.

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.080
If your TV breaks, the guy's not going to say,

01:32:58.080 --> 01:32:58.560
what do you watch?

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.120
John Wayne movies?

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.480
It doesn't make any difference.

01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:04.360
He's going to put a bunch of signals through that thing

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.880
that are going to be jagged lines, big round balls,

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.200
crazy colors.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.440
And if it absorbs all of those weirdo things,

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.880
then it works perfectly.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.160
And that's what most syntax and Chomsky type stuff is.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:19.520
It's finding those structures that define the boundaries,

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.200
the outer boundaries of human language structures,

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.080
independent of what the meanings might be.

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:26.960
So are any little structures down the language

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.160
from the outer line?

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:30.960
Well, there's a huge, as you can see,

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:33.960
there's huge amounts of debate about this stuff.

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.200
So maybe the closest thing is the puttino's guenan.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.200
You say you're going to bring up a super dealer?

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:41.640
Unfortunately.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.480
So the puttino's guenan has a system.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.760
I mean, we just start into it's body systems, right?

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.640
But they have a system where they use one particular

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:54.920
called a piao call for a leopard or ground-based predator,

01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:00.680
at least, and a hack call, which they use for aerial threats.

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.760
So they're two different predator type responses.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:08.160
And then they combine those two calls in specific form

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.880
when they want to travel.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:14.640
So they use some combination of between two and five piao

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.360
calls, followed by some combination

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.600
between two and five hack calls in a sequence.

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:25.200
They go piao, piao, hack, hack, and then they all move out.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.320
So that's quite interesting-ish.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.400
But quite exactly what's going on in those kind of systems.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.080
I guess we have no idea.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.560
But the vocalizations themselves

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:38.160
seem to be sort of at least some sort of functional

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.680
referentiality in what they do.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.440
And then they're also combined in other contexts.

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:44.360
I think we've made a mistake here today

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:50.360
that we were confusing in my terminology language and speech.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.360
Well, that's a speech.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.960
Speech is what humans do.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.200
Bees have language.

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.200
Other species have language.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.520
Can we define language?

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.120
No, you said you couldn't do it.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.120
I couldn't do it, but you know.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.360
I think what the question there was about was speech.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.360
No, grammar.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.440
Is that grammar?

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.800
Grammar.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.840
So bees don't have language.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.040
I don't know how would you define language?

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.080
If I might interject.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.720
So now what you've done is you've invented definitions

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.520
that exclude anything by humans.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:22.960
Exactly.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.080
So that's a useless concept.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:30.360
But I have an excellent evolutionary behavioral ecology

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.120
definition of communication.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.160
But I don't have the definition of language.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.960
But people have talked about language

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.840
as a set of agreed upon symbols that are used conventionally.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.480
And people like Hawkett and others have listed,

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:46.160
based on human language, certain design features

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.280
that we do, such as grammar, such as productivity,

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:52.640
such as using symbolic forms, such as arbitrariness.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.960
I mean, they're like 18 things.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.640
Just as an example, just to say, how can we

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.920
compare what other species do with what we call language?

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.880
Do other species show any of the properties of human language

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.480
not forcing it into a language game,

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.640
but just say this is how we do it.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.480
So we do have metrics like that.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.400
And many animals do show many of those design features.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.720
Again, if we just throw out the word language,

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.880
just throw out the word language and say, that's what we do.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:22.400
And other animals may use, and that's

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.800
our kind of communication system.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.560
And it could be nonverbal or verbal.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.320
And then we've got other animal communication systems.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.760
And we can call that x, y, and z.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:31.560
It's not better or worse.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:32.400
They're just different.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.400
Certainly not high-level.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:34.960
That would be a little bit more of your blank thing.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.880
But would you distinguish the dialogue

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.360
that we've been carrying on here, which

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:43.440
is through the modality of speech and the almost universal

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:46.640
awe sound that went out when the puppy came in?

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.640
I would distinguish between those two.

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:53.120
I would consider one a vocal communication, a vocal signal

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:57.120
that is probably, to some degree, inherent or inherited.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.000
Arousal-based.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.040
Arousal-based and reflexive and inherited

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.080
and therefore probably has an evolutionary tract,

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.880
whereas the words that are coming out of my mouth

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.440
have to be learned.

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.400
So we have a mode of signals.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:13.000
And we have something that's not a mode of signaling.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.480
But it doesn't have to be speech.

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.720
It doesn't have to be acoustic.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:17.560
It doesn't have to be.

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.720
A mode of could be non-intentional.

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.240
Blushing.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.240
You have an emotion.

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.080
You blush.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.920
So there's this realm of all these signals.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.600
But I think we're still stuck with this idea that what we do

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.200
is that we call language.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.200
No other animal can have it.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.880
It's Chris is saying we're a priorially saying that this

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:36.760
is language is better and no other animal can really do it.

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.120
Because we've already said what it is.

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:39.640
We're letting them.

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.240
And we do this with all sorts of things.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.520
It's quite a circular.

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:43.040
Yeah.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:45.240
And I never put language on any sort of hierarchy

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.760
to say it's better or worse.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.360
But just an ability to somehow distinguish it,

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.960
which is why I continue to bring up

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.840
the inhuman non-linguistic communication of crying

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.320
and laughing and things like that, which are evolved traits

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.480
that have a communicative function.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.840
And I would have no difficulty distinguishing those

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:11.800
from spoken or written or sign language that is learned.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.520
And there's based on a shared understanding of these symbols.

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.120
So since I don't find that difficult to distinguish

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.760
between crying and laughing and the use of written

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.600
or spoken language, I'm not sure why

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:28.720
then we'd have such a hard time distinguishing human language

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:33.680
from non-linguistic forms in other species.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:34.680
Please.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:41.560
I would like to make a comment on complexity

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:44.000
of their communication systems.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:51.160
And I happen to know a guy who was saved by dolphins.

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.240
So I'm never going to tell about this.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.680
So the friends they have a boat, sometimes they

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.400
go to a particular island in front of the put boat there

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:09.040
and swim to the smaller island where there is very good beach.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:13.160
And a lot of dolphins also nearby.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:20.200
Once he stayed by himself to long on this smaller island

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.760
and suddenly where they changed.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:29.120
And he decided to go as fast as possible to the boat.

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:34.280
But in the middle waves became bigger and wind became bigger

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:38.320
and he got the panic attack.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:43.280
And he did not know where to go back to the small island

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:46.200
to be saved to the boat because it was something

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:46.840
in the middle.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:56.760
And suddenly he felt something above him, below him.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.640
And it was dolphins who created the whale.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:01.680
They didn't attach him.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.400
They created the whale.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:06.960
And very fast moved him to the boat.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.400
So this panic attack was like a message for them.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.200
And they know where to go.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.960
They understood where he wants to go.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.200
Although he already was in the doubt.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:25.400
So when they brought him to the boat, they just left.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.000
And that was it.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.800
And I don't know how and actually I

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.400
could give anyone the contact information of this guy.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.600
So you could know he had by himself.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:51.440
So and this event telling us about that there

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.560
is a very complex system of communication.

01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.000
It was a complex message for them, this panic attack.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.880
They understood what's going on, what they could do,

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:08.160
and where this whatever creature it is should go and why.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.880
They did not help him as they probably

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:20.440
help their own members of their own species.

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:27.440
So one of the questions may be our languages that

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.200
we can see, they're very complex.

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.280
And they actually help us to develop very complex technology.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:41.840
That, for example, improve only one hour function

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:46.400
to like iPhone.

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:52.800
Maybe they much more primitive that would actually

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:55.440
animals using in their communications.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.440
And actually one of my other friends

01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:03.400
saying that animals don't need to develop this simple

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.040
and political religious because they don't need them.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.200
They just don't need it because their life is much more

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:11.320
complex than ours.

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:15.320
We're sitting here without anything around except only

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.440
humans.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:20.400
And we're using these our languages

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.960
that we're creating complex technology, which

01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:26.160
is destroying environment.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:29.520
And actually it's not very smart.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.400
So there's the question, what is more complex?

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.240
And what is their living and we are sitting in a token?

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.360
And I'm not saying that I'm like,

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.280
I don't this distinction myself.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.600
I'm also choosing to live in city,

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:50.880
northern, in ancient, whatever it could be said about this.

01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.520
But anyway, what's their system of communications

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.800
and more complex?

01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.960
Well, I'd like to respond to that real quickly.

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.480
Because historically there have been

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.560
reports of dolphins saving people, even, again,

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:06.800
back in Greek times, awry, airy and being rescued by the dolphin.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.320
And I get a lot of letters from people who say they've been rescued.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.360
One of the things we've seen in not just dolphins,

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:16.600
but in other animals like elephants and certainly primates,

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.040
where a child will fall into an enclosure at a zoo.

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.000
And it was, I think, a gorilla that held this child

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.160
till the keepers could get out.

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:28.240
Franz Duval, who's a well-known primatologist,

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.560
was just giving a talk this weekend about this.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.040
And it seems that whether it's communication, per se,

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:36.400
it may not be communication, but there's some awareness

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.480
on the part of the animal, perhaps, of the plight of that organism.

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:43.240
And, well, you're gone.

01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:44.160
Well, let me get.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.120
Wild dogs just did to that kid in the zoo.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:47.640
That's a very different.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.000
But those are wild hunting dogs.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.560
Those are predators.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.400
These, OK, so that may be different.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.240
It may not be all animals are the same.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.760
But nevertheless, there are several animal species

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.760
that show helping, caregiving behavior that's not hardwired.

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.880
Our colleague Ken Norris has shown that with dolphins and whales,

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.280
their behavior is flexible.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:12.440
If you, one could argue that a dolphin that's

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:15.160
an air-breathing animal, it could have been selected

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.840
for that they would hold up anything that's air-breathing

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.640
at the surface, because that would save an organism

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.760
that they're related to or another dolphin.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.520
So it's hardwired.

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:24.200
But they don't do it.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.280
It's not hardwired.

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.720
You can see them not holding up all flailing animals.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.200
I mean, we've all watched that.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:31.360
So there's some selection there.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.040
I don't know what that selection is,

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.000
but you do hear about it.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.280
So I just want to argue that I think

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.040
there is something that may not be based on communication,

01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.040
but on perception or the plight of another that we

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.040
would call empathy.

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.080
And I think there's a high degree of learning there, too,

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.120
because I think the examples where non-humans step in

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.880
and are somehow protective or indicate

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.880
some sort of protection response to human infants

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:59.200
tend to be very highly publicized.

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.600
They also tend to be in zoos or with captive or trade animals.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.640
It's not with wild dolphins.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.400
That's not the case.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.080
There are many cases, and I have a whole collection of them,

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.640
of wild dolphins.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.680
We don't know their whole history of their wild,

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.440
but have done this kind of little Ilion Gonzales.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:13.600
Name is case.

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:16.480
He was hanging on that inner tube,

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.920
and he told a colleague of mine who was with him,

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.800
and Diane Sawyer in an interview,

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.440
that as he slid off the inner tube,

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.480
dolphins pushed him, much like you were saying,

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.880
back up into the inner tube.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.920
So of course, the skeptic in all of us

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:29.960
says the kid's hallucinating.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.200
He's been out there, the whole thing.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.160
But the fisherman who came on the rescue boat

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.000
saw the dolphins, and they left when he approached.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.120
Interesting.

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.560
So let's not jump too fast.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.040
No, certainly not.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:53.320
My question is related to whether studying these orders

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.320
in animals could help us to learn about their communication

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.880
or language.

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:05.080
I just remembered how some people were suggesting

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.240
that it's helpful to understand schizophrenia

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.080
as a disorder of language, for example,

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.640
and how many things that we understand

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:17.040
in the field of psychiatry or neurology,

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.360
we reach there by seeing what doesn't work, actually,

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.280
not what works.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:27.920
So my question is, how is this applied

01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:30.480
into the animal communication, and what

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.480
are, is there limitations for this one?

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:34.600
Thank you.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.400
I think there's loads of different ways.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.480
I mean, you mentioned kind of mental disorders,

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.840
but there's also a lot of sensory disorders.

01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.480
So people are interested in sort of color blindness

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:48.440
and mechanics and understanding sensory perception,

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:51.120
according to the question.

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.640
Yeah.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.640
Really?

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.200
According to things like this, I think

01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:00.640
there's people that are interested in individuals

01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:05.880
with sensory defects and trying to understand communication

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.080
from those perspectives.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.720
And that's quite interesting, particularly in vision,

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.880
because the way our luminance and color vision works,

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.240
which I'm not going to go into in great amount of detail.

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:22.320
But basically, we have a sort of corruption of how light and dark

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:25.480
we can detect things as a consequence of our evolution

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.320
of trigromacy.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.640
So dichromats, dichromatic anthropoids,

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:34.680
and darkromatic humans supposedly have better kind

01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:36.760
of depth perception and various other things.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:39.240
In the Second World War, the RAF used

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:43.320
to have a colorblind man in every squadron,

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:45.360
apocryphal, possibly.

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.960
The, in terms of kind of, I mean, I

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.000
think there's a lot of models of depression,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.800
negativity bias, things like that,

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.480
where people are interested in understanding

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.560
the animal communication.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:03.720
So they're looking at mice and rats,

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.240
but also in non-human primates, rearing individuals

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:10.840
that have had different types of upbringing

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.880
than can get.

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:15.600
You can see types of effects that we would classify as being

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.120
depression.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.120
So you show depressed individuals are characterized

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.800
by negativity biases, essentially.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.360
Like when you show them things that they should be happy about,

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.360
they still think it's really, really bad regardless.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.920
And you can get similar effects.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:36.200
You get very, very similar effects in non-human animals,

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:37.800
depending on their prior experience.

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.840
And I think they're used to touch the Earth.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:42.640
So non-human primates of some of the new world monkeys,

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.000
they look at stress and they monitor

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.160
the vocal modifications.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160
Right.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.960
And I know that's what sort of the one

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.160
that's saying your mind's a good question.

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:53.680
OK.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:54.160
Yes.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.040
I mean, in general, because some people were saying that,

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.400
I think that animals can now ask to bring, for example,

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.480
that this was a kind of baseball game,

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.320
because they're like, they don't have our language.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.520
And it's bringing this sort of language.

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:16.520
So crazy animals are not our parts of the effects.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:17.880
So I was just saying.

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:19.360
I mean, they could step.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.320
I mean, they use it extensively as models of things

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.160
like anxiety and depression and things certainly.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:28.280
And it's important, I think, for our own studies

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:32.400
that we understand these things for our own communication,

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.080
but also for kind of human medicine.

01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:41.280
Like, we often try and test in drugs on rats and mice and things

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:43.640
that are actually not normal mice and rats,

01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.240
like depending on how they've been read,

01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.440
will rare it's completely different.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.200
So the same kind of the same medicine, right?

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.960
Or if they're males or females?

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:56.520
Because of time, I'm sorry, these three gentlemen

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:59.120
are going to have to be our last question.

01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:00.600
We'll be more succinct.

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:06.160
I've been treated many years ago myself being

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.480
not involved much with animals.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:14.440
I found myself running a mental hospital in a rural area.

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:19.080
And they provided a house for me to live in.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:22.240
Somebody gave me a pet.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.240
It was a bird.

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:26.080
It was a cockatiel.

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.640
And I had no real relationship to this bird.

01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.640
It flew around this big, gold place.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.560
And I sort of sat around, wondering

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.920
what the hell I'm doing there.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.120
And there was this bird.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.360
One day it snowed.

01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:44.640
Now, apparently this bird had come from Brazil,

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.360
or some jungle area where there was no snow.

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.280
And I was a city kid and always fascinated

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.480
the concept that snow was covering everything up.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:00.440
So I look out the window, and everything

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.760
was covered in white.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:07.160
All the fields, all the campus, everything, trees and white.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.240
Just looking at this.

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:17.320
And suddenly, right beside me perched on a little bookshelf,

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:22.600
Irma, the bird, is also looking at this.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:26.560
I didn't know Irma was looking at this.

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.360
So I looked at Irma.

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.880
And Irma looked at me.

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.040
And we both knew that we were seeing something very interesting

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.960
that we had not seen before.

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:41.680
And not only did we know that, we

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:44.760
were seeing something that we had not seen before,

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.800
but we suddenly knew that each of us

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.680
was knowing that we knew each of us were knowing that.

01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.320
And we were shocked.

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.200
And so was Irma.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:55.200
I bet she was.

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.640
And so did she realize that I understood what she was seeing,

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:01.560
and she understood what I was seeing,

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.000
and that we both understood what either of us was seeing.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.240
She flew away in panic to the next floor of this place.

01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:10.520
I was living.

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:18.720
Now, to me, a terribly emotional experience.

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:26.160
I had never, never conceived that an animal would look

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:28.840
at something the way I was looking at it

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:32.360
and knew and know that I was looking at my whole view

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:35.600
of animals changed in that momentary flesh.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:42.240
So I would ask this then, a comic about receivers and centers.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.040
Are there any experiments in which animals perceived

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.760
something and communicate this to humans in such a way

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.680
that there's a mutual understanding going on?

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:56.040
And has this documented?

01:52:56.040 --> 01:52:57.760
Is any of this documented?

01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.840
How many of us have gone wrong?

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:01.520
I hope you know what to get to for birds.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.880
I mean, it's too much time, I think.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.600
I mean, there's plenty of examples

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:08.480
of humans and birds having a communication system.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.200
Again, what goes on in their head is unclear.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.960
So the really classic example is the honeygoid?

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.120
You know, the honeygoid?

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:22.120
It's the type of African bird that it finds honey.

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:24.800
And when it finds honey, it flies to the village.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.440
And it does a little song that means I've found that people

01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:29.840
interpret it to mean it's found honey.

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.200
The people from the village, they come out and the bird flies

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:35.840
and it stops on a branch and it keeps doing the call

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.040
and then people move towards it.

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:41.040
And it leads them to the honey because the bird is not capable

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.960
of getting the honey out of the beesness.

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:45.440
It needs people to smoke the bees out.

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:48.520
The people then smoke out the bees.

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.480
They get all the honey out of the nest.

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.440
They take most of the honey and then they leave a big comb.

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:56.320
And then the bird comes straight down and eats all the comb.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.320
So it's an amazing kind of inter-specific communication.

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.320
But what's actually going on in the bird's head

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.640
is quite another matter.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.720
I mean, you can't know that, but I think it's worthy

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:09.120
of exploration as always.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:10.040
Sure.

01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:11.080
Can I take one second time?

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:11.840
Really, first story.

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:12.680
I tell this in my book.

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:13.680
It's called The Time Out.

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.240
I was working with the dolphin in the south of France,

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:17.800
part of my PhD thesis.

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.600
And I was using a technique the trainers will often use.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.560
I was training her to stay in front of me and eat fish

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:27.360
that had been frosted and thawed and cut into three pieces.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.600
And she was a fairly young dolphin.

01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:30.800
She didn't have much experience.

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.200
Her name was Cersei.

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.560
And she learned very quickly within a day

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:35.600
to stay in front of me.

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:38.160
But when she did so, I'd put the bucket up.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:40.200
And if she was there, I'd give her a fish.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:42.600
If she swam away, I gave her a time out,

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:45.080
which meant walking away about 10 feet away from the pool

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.200
and just standing vertical and breaking the social contact.

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.840
So I was cutting the fish into heads,

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.680
middles, and tails, because it was big macro.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.080
And she wasn't eating the whole macro.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:53.720
She ate the heads.

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.720
She ate the middles.

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.960
She was spitting out the tails.

01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:59.560
So I cut the tails so that they no longer had the fins.

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.440
So now she's learned to stay by me using the time out

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.040
as a correction mechanism.

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:08.200
And I was standing at the tank after she had been doing this

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:08.680
pretty long.

01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:11.320
And she wasn't leaving the pool, the position.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.600
And by accident, I threw her an uncut tail.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.120
And she went to the other side of the pool,

01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:18.760
looked up at me, spit out the tail,

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.000
went to the other side of the pool,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.800
and took a vertical position.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:23.520
And I'm, you're laughing.

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.680
This is, I was laughing too.

01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.160
And I thought she couldn't possibly

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:27.760
have just given me a time out.

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:31.040
Now, that's an anecdote.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040
But as a scientist, I could never report that.

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.840
So then I turned it into an experiment,

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.760
which was the unplanned experiment as part of my doctoral

01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:38.160
thesis.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:41.080
I was doing visual discrimination and dolphins at all.

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:42.040
So I waited.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.680
And now I'm feeding her the next day.

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.400
I'm giving her all the properly cut fish.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:47.240
And she stays.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:49.000
And then the next day, on purpose,

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.240
I gave her another uncut tail.

01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:52.520
And Bunch goes across the pool, does it again.

01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:54.000
So I think that's a beautiful example

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.480
of how we synchronize our patterns of behavior.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:58.320
And perhaps there is more joint attention

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.760
and mutual understanding in how other animals can do it.

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:01.760
So that, I just thought I'd.

01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:02.760
That's it.

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:03.760
Go ahead.

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:04.760
Yeah.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:07.600
Was my understanding growing up when I read these texts about animal

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.320
behavior, that intelligence was defined as your ability

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.200
to learn.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:15.680
And if that takes whatever they learn from the experience,

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:18.120
which is based on chance, their current,

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.720
it's been actively used to solve problems.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.600
That was generally the accepted definition of intelligence.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.640
And also, relationship with communication and language,

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.920
I think was that, I guess you'd say

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.440
that language is a form of communication.

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.200
Not all communication is language.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.040
But it's, yeah, a lot of cases where

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.520
language is used to discourage communication.

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.400
So we all know instances of that.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.600
And we say, we're also getting to it

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.680
is that the ability of animals learning from each other

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:49.760
is, I can think of the Japanese monkeys,

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:52.000
Makako, from Scotty, that they would,

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:53.400
it comes from when there was a,

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.520
that's taking the sweet potato dipping in salt water

01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:58.480
and running from the dirt and also

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:01.080
would make it a tasteier for them.

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:06.080
And the other thing is, giving them hands full of rice

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:08.360
to make sure it's sand and they figure it,

01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:11.280
wouldn't figure it out, that if you drop it in water,

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.520
the rice will pull to the surface and sand will sink.

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.080
And the other monkeys start to pick,

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.960
and they've been able to communicate

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:19.000
just to each other how to do that.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
And with, here's what the mechanism was,

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.080
the muzzle there, which is just boiled down

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:25.400
to the old phrase monkey, see monkey do.

01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:28.760
That's what we go for that?

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:31.200
I think it probably is monkey, see monkey do.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.120
There's teaching as far as we know

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:38.920
is not very commonly observed really.

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.000
I mean, it depends on how you define it,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.280
but there's no real good proof of teaching

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.760
as opposed to just kind of observational evidence

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:48.440
and repetition and things like this.

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:50.000
And actually, it's quite interesting,

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:50.840
because when you...

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.640
The definition between teaching and repetition.

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:58.480
The individual undertaking the behavior

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.520
is doing it specifically with the aim

01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.520
of the other individual learning how to do it.

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:04.360
And there's...

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:05.760
Rather than just doing it and other individuals

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.600
can be...

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.440
There's non-optimal repetition.

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:11.200
So, for example, in the famous Gombe chimps

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.800
with the kitty determinates,

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.080
people will watch the adult female will sit there for hours

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:19.480
and stick the stick in and pull the termites out.

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.840
And the young ones will sit then watch very intently.

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:26.000
And people, first sort of casually say,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.360
oh, well, they're teaching the mothers teaching the young ones

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:30.600
because eventually the older one learns how to do it.

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.160
And they go through a lot of trial and error

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:33.720
and they do it very poorly.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.840
The distinguishing characteristics is that

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.800
if there were actual teaching going on,

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.640
the mother would be, or the adult female in that situation,

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:42.800
would be doing it non-optimal.

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:45.200
She wouldn't simply be optimizing her own ability

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.040
to get the termites.

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:46.960
She would be doing it slower.

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:48.880
She would be changing her body position.

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.760
She would be correcting the young one.

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:51.600
So they're right.

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:52.440
When she's finished.

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:55.200
Thousands of examples in humans that we call teaching

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.520
that go right with your second definition.

01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.120
So we call it teaching, but it's not teaching.

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.280
If it's not intentional, if we're,

01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:05.520
I mean, I learned how to change a tire watching my dad

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.520
before he actually took the time to teach you.

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:10.120
So when I watch a wild killer whale parent

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.840
go and grab a seal off the beach

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.160
and then take it and put it in front of their offspring

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.120
and give it to the offspring.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:20.040
And the offspring sort of plays with it.

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:22.360
And the seal ones where the mother goes and gets it again

01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.880
and puts it back in front of the baby.

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.760
And that she is, isn't she teaching?

01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:28.680
I just think one of our points is

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:30.640
I can mention that we're not running cat family.

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.480
But don't.

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:32.480
Right.

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.480
I was like, yeah.

01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.400
Well, sometimes the mother would disable it

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.920
so he can escape and set the stage to learning

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.520
so that the young figure out how to sell

01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:41.880
hadn't just tear it in the environment.

01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.680
Like, you know, they said to stage the work.

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.520
It just like first, that we learn to fly

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:48.360
and that parents, the parents just kind of

01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:50.360
set the stage out and get encouraged by them.

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.400
And I think that's the big distinguishing characteristic

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.240
because in both of, it gets nuanced.

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:56.720
And I don't like all the terminology

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:00.560
between teaching and learning and experiential opportunities.

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:03.240
But the situations that you described and also with the cats

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:06.400
is they didn't actually teach them to do the kill.

02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:08.040
They provided opportunities for them

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.520
to practice the skills that were innate.

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:14.720
So what do you call a woman teaching 10-year-olds in a school?

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:16.400
You don't call it teaching?

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.000
I call it a stereotype.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.520
Sorry.

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:20.040
What are we talking about?

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:26.760
So what you just described is a perfect description

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.720
of what many humans do to other humans,

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.760
and we call it teaching.

02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.920
But you just said it's not teaching.

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.080
I'm not sure I follow you.

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:35.600
OK.

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.760
Just go through your definition.

02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:37.800
Go through that example again.

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:39.040
You just describe teaching.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:45.680
Right?

02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:48.960
I think when it gets to some of these,

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:49.960
it gets very close.

02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.960
And I think, again, there's a bit.

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:55.960
And I think it should be done over glasses of whiskey.

02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960
Since we're running out of time,

02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:00.960
I was just listening to me some interest in this whole animal

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.960
saving human thing.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:04.960
And there's not really any need to go to zoos

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:06.960
or even talk about saving humans,

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:10.960
because there's endless examples of animals saving other animals

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.960
of completely different species.

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:14.960
There are lions that have saved,

02:01:14.960 --> 02:01:18.960
maybe Angelo, there are lions that have saved,

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.960
and pour off the other lions to protect the kid that fell into the zoo.

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.960
I mean, there's just countless examples.

02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.960
So there's no need to distinguish predator

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.960
or predator or zoo or non-zoos.

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:30.960
There's a lot of them.

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:31.960
Thank you.

02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:32.960
Thank you.

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:33.960
Thank you so much.

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.960
Fantastic.

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:35.960
Well, thank you for your attention.

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:36.960
All right.

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:37.960
Thank you.

02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:44.960
Thank you.
