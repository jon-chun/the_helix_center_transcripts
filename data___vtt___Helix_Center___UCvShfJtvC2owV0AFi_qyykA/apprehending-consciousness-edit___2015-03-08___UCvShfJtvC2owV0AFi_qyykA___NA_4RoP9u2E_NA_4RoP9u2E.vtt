00:36.400 --> 00:40.960
On May 2nd, we'll be discussing trauma and its after-effects.

00:40.960 --> 00:47.840
On May 9th, we'll have a program of experimental films and make note that there is a helix

00:47.840 --> 00:56.680
center benefit coming up on May 8th at the Lotus Club and announcements will be forthcoming.

We depend on your feedback greatly for the fulfillment of our Templeton grant.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.240
So I'm going to introduce today's participants and as I say your name if you can just raise

01:45.240 --> 01:48.920
your hand so the audience will identify you.

01:48.920 --> 01:53.400
David Chalmers, professor of philosophy and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain

04:26.600 --> 04:31.240
research includes sleep's role in memory and memory dysfunction, sensory processing during

04:31.240 --> 04:36.400
sleep and learning, the neuro substrates of conscious memory experiences and memory and

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
intuition.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.960
A fellow of both the Mind and Life Institute and the Association for Psychological Science

04:52.960 --> 04:58.000
Nicholas Schiff is Gerald Katz, professor of neurology and neuroscience as well as director

04:58.000 --> 05:03.280
of the Laboratory for Cognitive Neuro-Modulation at Weill Cornell Medical College.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.680
His research focuses on recovery of consciousness following brain injuries.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.200
He and his research group have contributed several landmark advances including the first

05:11.200 --> 05:15.160
demonstrations of brain structural alterations occurring in the setting of very late recovery

05:15.160 --> 05:17.160
from severe brain injury.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.720
He received the 2007 research award for innovation in neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience

05:21.720 --> 05:26.680
for his research on arousal regulation and deep brain's electrical stimulation demonstrating

05:26.680 --> 05:31.400
that long lasting severe cognitive disability may be influenced by electrical stimulation

05:31.400 --> 05:40.360
of the human central thalamus and now to our roundtable.

05:40.360 --> 05:47.600
I thought I'd get you started by saying that two weeks ago we showed the movie Particle

05:47.600 --> 05:54.440
Fever here and the documentary and then we had a roundtable afterwards and as you know

05:54.440 --> 05:59.120
that was about detecting the Higgs boson.

05:59.120 --> 06:04.720
So my question to you is if we can detect Higgs boson why are we having so much trouble

06:04.720 --> 06:07.720
with consciousness?

06:07.720 --> 06:09.720
Sure.

06:09.720 --> 06:21.280
I guess there's a lot of things that make consciousness distinctive and difficult.

06:21.280 --> 06:28.240
This is supposed to be objective but consciousness is this quintessentially subjective

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
phenomenon.

06:29.240 --> 06:34.600
It's defined as subjective experience, this subjective experience of the mind and of

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
the world.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.400
We want to explain everything in terms of objective mechanisms.

06:39.400 --> 06:45.520
That's what we do in science and there seems to be this potential gap in the explanation

06:45.520 --> 06:52.080
between the level of objective mechanisms, how one thing causes another thing and this

06:52.080 --> 06:56.480
billiard ball causation in the universe and consciousness.

06:56.480 --> 07:03.240
How is it that this giant network of neurons we have in the head objectively hooked up

07:03.240 --> 07:04.240
bring about consciousness?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.800
Now this doesn't mean you can't do science on it.

07:06.800 --> 07:14.640
One of the wonderful things that's happened in the last 20 or years now has been an exploding

07:14.640 --> 07:15.880
science of consciousness.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.680
The neuroscientists have been studying it making all kinds of progress on finding the

07:20.680 --> 07:24.320
bits of the brain that go along with bits of consciousness.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.080
But it is for now a science of correlation.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.400
We know that some bits of the brain go along with some bits of consciousness.

07:30.400 --> 07:35.800
We're still working on the part which is about explanation and I think it's these issues

07:35.800 --> 07:39.560
about explanation that really make the study of consciousness difficult.

07:39.560 --> 07:44.560
I'll take a stab at following that up.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.680
I think the evolution and the maturity of theory in physical science is just so vastly

07:48.680 --> 07:54.120
beyond what it is in biological science to give you an idea of what consciousness, what

07:54.120 --> 07:59.280
the rules of the game might be for causal creation of consciousness in a central nervous

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
system.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.640
And the measurements that we have that we can link correlationally are few and far

08:05.640 --> 08:11.240
between so we're just very far behind the curve of anything like what got you to a

08:11.240 --> 08:16.280
Higgs boson, a theory predicting a particular phenomena in the physical structure of the

08:16.280 --> 08:18.280
brain that's linked to consciousness.

08:18.280 --> 08:23.120
It's very hard actually to know if somebody can't show you any response whether they're

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
conscious.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.360
That's a large operational part of what we do at the interface of clinical medicine

08:28.360 --> 08:33.040
and research to try to understand retained consciousness in a structurally injured brain

08:33.040 --> 08:36.560
because we don't have rules that say, okay, you know, if you have these parts of the

08:36.560 --> 08:40.520
brain in there and these states, you definitely have consciousness.

08:40.520 --> 08:50.160
Another problem with trying to explain consciousness is that sort of like other phenomenon

08:50.160 --> 08:56.080
science, when you observe them, you don't necessarily expect them to change fundamentally

08:56.080 --> 09:01.600
upon observation but the nature of consciousness is that the observer in the observed are the

09:01.600 --> 09:02.600
same thing.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.680
What it is to have a conscious mind is to be an observer, to have a point of view.

09:05.680 --> 09:10.040
And so, I mean, the physicists are familiar with this phenomenon.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.800
You know, if you're looking at a conscious state or a conscious process, in virtue of

09:14.800 --> 09:19.560
looking at it, have you artificially changed the thing, the very thing you're supposed

09:19.560 --> 09:20.720
to be explaining?

09:20.720 --> 09:27.720
And so how do you get behind being the observer in focus on the real phenomenon as it's

09:27.720 --> 09:28.720
happening?

09:28.720 --> 09:35.240
So I'd also agree with these reasons for why this is a difficult problem to try to understand

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
consciousness.

09:36.240 --> 09:42.480
But I think it's nice that David came up with this catchphrase of the hard problem of consciousness

09:42.480 --> 09:49.240
because note that he didn't decide to talk about the impossible problem of consciousness.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.480
He didn't say it was that difficult as to be impossible.

09:53.480 --> 09:58.280
There is a science of consciousness and that's moving forward as he mentioned and will continue

09:58.280 --> 09:59.280
to move forward.

09:59.280 --> 10:05.080
So we admit to it being a difficult problem, but I'm not sure if we think it's impossible.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.080
That's the spirit.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
Yeah?

10:08.080 --> 10:15.160
Was this going to follow up on the observer aspect?

10:15.160 --> 10:21.400
I mean, it may be that that aspect of the problem is the thing that makes it hard.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.960
I mean, that's the question, question-wise, it's so hard.

10:24.960 --> 10:28.640
If you follow Richard Feynman that if I want to understand something, I have to be able

10:28.640 --> 10:30.040
to model it.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.800
What you're asking of an understanding of consciousness is the ability to model myself.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.840
And I think there's something fundamentally impossible about a system that can model

10:39.840 --> 10:42.200
itself because it has to represent itself.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.320
And so if it does that, it has to represent that representation and that infinitum.

10:46.320 --> 10:52.400
So there may be something deeply problematic and deeply hard about the brain modeling

10:52.400 --> 10:58.640
itself which is not an aspect of modeling the Higgs boson.

10:58.640 --> 11:03.200
It's very interesting for me to hear your example of the Higgs boson.

11:03.200 --> 11:10.800
Since about 40 years ago, I started my graduate studies, it's hard to imagine 40 years, but

11:10.800 --> 11:16.120
what I did was to compute, to make computations of the Higgs boson.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.160
And I had many different interests.

11:19.160 --> 11:25.360
It was hard to choose, so I tried to do a double PhD in particle physics in astronomy,

11:25.360 --> 11:29.240
the very largest and the very smallest because they are the simplest.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.200
This scale is the most difficult to understand.

11:32.200 --> 11:37.320
And by the time I got my PhD, I got a feeling that it might take a while for the Higgs boson

11:37.320 --> 11:38.800
to be discovered.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.840
So I decided to become a astrophysicist rather than a Higgs boson specialist.

11:42.840 --> 11:48.960
And I'm glad I did because most of my career, I would have to turtle my thumbs.

11:48.960 --> 11:59.200
What you said about physics, so being so different from other brain studies, I think

11:59.200 --> 12:03.760
there are three big problems in all of science, the three biggest problems.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.640
Where does matter come from?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.280
Where does life come from?

12:07.280 --> 12:09.640
Where does consciousness come from?

12:09.640 --> 12:12.880
And the where is really a why question.

12:12.880 --> 12:13.880
Why is there a matter?

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
Why is there a life?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.120
Why is there a consciousness?

12:17.120 --> 12:21.560
If you would have nothing at all, you would never expect that to be something.

12:21.560 --> 12:25.520
Forget about who is asking the questions but in principle.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.960
So big surprise, there is something at all.

12:28.960 --> 12:33.920
And then if you have physics and chemistry, who would have guessed a living cell, so complicated,

12:33.920 --> 12:39.640
big surprise, and giving simple life, who would have guessed consciousness?

12:39.640 --> 12:43.840
So the three questions can also be formulated.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.600
Why is there a matter?

12:45.600 --> 12:47.360
Why is there life?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.160
Why is there the ability to ask?

12:49.160 --> 12:50.640
Why is there life?

12:50.640 --> 12:52.400
Why is there consciousness?

12:52.400 --> 12:56.000
And that is that feedback loop.

12:56.000 --> 13:03.960
But Dave, you think there are some hard problems that can't be solved.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.360
So you think there is an impossible problem with consciousness?

13:07.360 --> 13:12.080
Oh, I think we have a scientific theory of consciousness and I've been very invested

13:12.080 --> 13:15.520
in the movement to work towards such a science.

13:15.520 --> 13:20.000
I think some theories will be good theories and some theories will be bad theories.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.560
So for example, some people out there would like to just reduce consciousness to a process

13:25.560 --> 13:31.400
in the brain and say, oh, there is to consciousness is some neurophysiological process and we

13:31.400 --> 13:38.960
can give a complete explanation of consciousness in terms of a bunch of neural firings in the

13:38.960 --> 13:39.960
brain.

13:39.960 --> 13:44.360
I think that kind of theory, although it's a great thing to aim for, but I think that

13:44.360 --> 13:47.000
kind of theory isn't going to work.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.720
Any explanation that's wholly in terms of the neurophysiology of the brain is basically

13:52.720 --> 13:57.760
going to explain a bunch of the things we do, you know, ability to get around in the world

13:57.760 --> 13:59.280
and to respond and so on.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.920
But it's always going to leave out the subjective experience.

14:02.920 --> 14:08.960
So I've argued that we need a different kind of theory when that takes consciousness as

14:08.960 --> 14:13.520
something fundamental in the world and connects it to all of these other things.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.960
But I would still see that as a solution to the hard problem.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.040
The hard problem is explaining how is it that consciousness arises from the processes in

14:21.040 --> 14:22.040
the brain.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.800
It's just I think you need, you know, you need to, the standard methods we've developed

14:25.800 --> 14:29.520
so far in neuroscience and they go so far and I think a lot of people agree we need new

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
methods.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
The question is what are those new methods and new theories?

14:33.520 --> 14:37.960
What are those new methods?

14:37.960 --> 14:43.160
Why would you need new theories?

14:43.160 --> 14:49.000
Why not just figure out the way, I mean you know what brings about consciousness, don't

14:49.000 --> 14:50.400
you?

14:50.400 --> 14:54.160
You said firing of millions or billions of neurons.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.600
So you know what brings it about.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
Coffee.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
Coffee.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.600
Yes.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.600
But how does coffee bring about consciousness?

15:05.600 --> 15:10.240
I don't think that we do know that.

15:10.240 --> 15:17.040
I think what we have are very good understandings of state correlations and brain state and likelihood

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
of consciousness.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.360
And that's better than nothing.

15:20.360 --> 15:25.200
And it gives us a clue about what aspects of neuronal function are more or less important

15:25.200 --> 15:27.760
to wafer consciousness for example.

15:27.760 --> 15:32.200
And that's I think probably where our best correlational data are right now.

15:32.200 --> 15:37.200
But it's actually not good enough for you to just get the brain data and to make a reasonable

15:37.200 --> 15:41.600
or fiducial inference about whether somebody actually is conscious.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.080
You can make a pretty good risk assessment I think and an increasingly good risk assessment

15:46.080 --> 15:49.200
and that's different.

15:49.200 --> 15:54.520
If you wanted to do this partition of problem.

15:54.520 --> 16:02.040
If there was a problem of how does consciousness arise from neuronal processes, that presumably

16:02.040 --> 16:08.240
is easier than the reverse question is how does consciousness affect or influence or

16:08.240 --> 16:10.000
nuance neural processing.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Absolutely.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.800
So your job in terms of detecting conscious level I think is a testament to the fact that

16:16.800 --> 16:21.760
there's an enormous amount of progress made in mapping from the biophysics to the conscious

16:21.760 --> 16:22.760
level.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.000
I thought the deeper problem is getting back again.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.680
But I think quite frankly it's a very sort of humbling job because you're often left

16:33.680 --> 16:36.640
with a very wide variance of uncertainty.

16:36.640 --> 16:42.560
And as you say I mean once you get to the idea that consciousness might have some emerging

16:42.560 --> 16:49.000
effects like a dynamic element that on top of the brain then has causal effect on the

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
structure.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.120
We don't have a model that gets us even close to those sorts of questions yet.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.560
So I mean from my point of view but that's maybe a limited understanding.

16:59.560 --> 17:04.160
But do you see that margin of uncertainty decreasing through the years?

17:04.160 --> 17:06.400
Yeah no I mean I think we're making a lot of progress.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.560
It's just that we're not anywhere near a standard model which would produce something like a

17:10.560 --> 17:15.040
prediction about something from theory that we might then go measure in the brain and say

17:15.040 --> 17:18.680
aha this model is right and that's sort of the amazing thing about the big suppose I

17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
think.

17:19.680 --> 17:25.080
But Dave is making the assumption that no physiological theory will ever be.

17:25.080 --> 17:31.520
He's sufficient he prefers a theory with consciousness as a primitive which is a fine alternative

17:31.520 --> 17:37.960
for theory but your assumption that a neurophysiological theory is going to come up short is really

17:37.960 --> 17:42.640
based on our current understanding of consciousness.

17:42.640 --> 17:48.800
And you're projecting about future theories of consciousness that haven't been presented

17:48.800 --> 17:49.800
yet.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.800
So how do we.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.000
Well one thing why should the rest of us I don't know if the rest of us are convinced

17:54.000 --> 17:57.720
but why should the rest of us be convinced that none of those future theories are going

17:57.720 --> 18:01.800
to provide what you say you don't think is possible.

18:01.800 --> 18:07.280
Well I think it depends I mean different people are going to get off the bus at different

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
points.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.400
First of all is to make a point about current theories I mean is what current theories

18:11.400 --> 18:13.800
gives us basically of a level of correlation.

18:13.800 --> 18:19.480
I mean what we are getting is this connection from this mapping I think as Kyle was putting

18:19.480 --> 18:26.560
it from neuro processes to consciousness and it's slow and slow progress two steps forward

18:26.560 --> 18:30.240
and one step back but we're getting somewhere in the mapping but it's still of a level of

18:30.240 --> 18:35.920
you know of mappings or correlations there's nothing analogous say to what you got Pete

18:35.920 --> 18:40.440
mentioned the case of life so let's take one central element to the explanation of life

18:40.440 --> 18:46.440
the explanation of the genetic processes in terms of DNA.

18:46.440 --> 18:51.120
What's done Craig didn't do was we discovered that whenever there's life there's DNA look

18:51.120 --> 18:58.280
at this amazing correlation rather they found a mechanism potential mechanism at least in

18:58.280 --> 19:03.080
the structure of the DNA molecule and they told you know at the beginnings of a potential

19:03.080 --> 19:08.880
story about how this could explain the things that we want the gene to explain like the

19:08.880 --> 19:12.960
transmission of characteristics from one generation to the next.

19:12.960 --> 19:19.720
It's of nothing like that kind of story right now in the neuroscience of consciousness even

19:19.720 --> 19:22.480
though we've got we're developing some nice correlations and then the question is why

19:22.480 --> 19:27.720
is that is it just is it just something about the structure of our current theories or is

19:27.720 --> 19:33.760
it something about the character of what you get from these neurobiological explanations

19:33.760 --> 19:37.880
I think the more you look at it the more it starts to look as if it's not just something

19:37.880 --> 19:43.280
about the contingent character of the neurobiological theories we've caught with so far it's rather

19:43.280 --> 19:48.880
something about their mechanistic nature it's all about you know you've got a bunch of objective

19:48.880 --> 19:53.320
mechanisms which are here performing certain functions doing certain things but you can

19:53.320 --> 19:58.040
always raise the further question why does all that give you subjective experience why

19:58.040 --> 20:03.920
should it be why should it feel like something from the inside so either it looks like either

20:03.920 --> 20:08.880
what you've got to do is add some ingredient to that explanation to put some extra thing

20:08.880 --> 20:14.040
in the base or the alternative and it's a important alternative is to somehow deflate

20:14.040 --> 20:18.280
the phenomenon of consciousness either say neurobiology is something more than we thought

20:18.280 --> 20:23.160
it was or consciousness is something less something less than we thought it was some

20:23.160 --> 20:28.320
people have tried to take that move somebody like Daniel Dennett for example has said

20:28.320 --> 20:33.480
so much of consciousness is an illusion my view is that if you want to try and explain

20:33.480 --> 20:39.960
consciousness wholly in terms of these objective mechanisms in the brain you may have to deflate

20:39.960 --> 20:41.600
consciousness to some considerable extent.

20:41.600 --> 20:46.600
But it seems still that the jump you're taking is from our current the current shortcomings

20:46.600 --> 20:52.040
of theories of consciousness to project that then all future theories have that same short

20:52.040 --> 20:53.040
coming.

20:53.040 --> 20:57.800
I think certain time and and and not like there's a million different theories of consciousness

20:57.800 --> 21:02.040
and some of them are I'm totally on board with the question is reductionist theories

21:02.040 --> 21:06.880
of consciousness in terms of neuroscience the question is what resources does neuroscience

21:06.880 --> 21:11.280
give you and the reduction of the explanatory base in neuroscience the stuff we explain

21:11.280 --> 21:17.000
everything in terms of is a bunch of mechanisms which come down to certain structures playing

21:17.000 --> 21:22.840
certain dynamical roles which is fantastic for explaining how it is that the brain does

21:22.840 --> 21:27.640
certain things produces certain behaviors and certain responses but for any explanation

21:27.640 --> 21:34.280
of that kind you can always ask the further question why does all this objective functioning

21:34.280 --> 21:35.520
give you consciousness.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.880
So any theory my view is any theory caused purely in terms of objective structure and

21:39.880 --> 21:43.760
function we'll leave that gap maybe there are other kinds of theories.

21:43.760 --> 21:48.880
Is there a deepest intuition about what would what would resist deflation from your point

21:48.880 --> 21:54.920
of view is there you know what aspect of subjectivity do you see hardest to fit in principle against

21:54.920 --> 21:58.440
the kind of models that exist or could evolve from those that exist.

21:58.440 --> 22:02.560
I would say you know it's the fact that it feels like something from the inside I mean

22:02.560 --> 22:07.080
there's this classic philosophical thought experiment of a Mary the scientist in a black

22:07.080 --> 22:13.360
and white room who knows everything about color processes in the brain and about the

22:13.360 --> 22:19.200
wavelengths that bring them about and about the the retinal and the neurophysiological

22:19.200 --> 22:26.520
responses and about the words we associate with these things but she is herself colorblind

22:26.520 --> 22:30.800
maybe she grew up in a black and white room so she knows all about the brain processes

22:30.800 --> 22:35.240
associated with seeing red which is never had the experience of seeing red and it looks

22:35.240 --> 22:40.760
like okay she knows all the brain stuff but she doesn't know the central thing about

22:40.760 --> 22:45.360
seeing red and then what it's like from the inside that's the subjective experience.

22:45.360 --> 22:52.000
So so so imagine a fast forward of existing measurements and theories where you have

22:52.000 --> 22:58.120
and take a fanciful example of an MRI that can map the column space of the color area

22:58.120 --> 23:02.680
and before or something like that and you look and you see that people who can resolve

23:02.680 --> 23:09.920
certain collections of perceptions that include one that she doesn't have partition activity

23:09.920 --> 23:14.520
and to five dimensions or something and she does it in four and then you have some manipulation

23:14.520 --> 23:20.640
where she suddenly partitions it into five and tells you aha now I see this.

23:20.640 --> 23:26.040
So is an explanation like that what's an identification of something you might measure with the idea

23:26.040 --> 23:31.640
that there's a quality associated with it not count as a at least a possible explanation

23:31.640 --> 23:37.880
not an explanation but enough of enough of a model to kind of say well maybe this is enough.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.600
I agree it's a model and I agree there's a kind of explanation you get from this kind

23:41.600 --> 23:47.000
of work of building up it's basically building up systematic correlations between these things

23:47.000 --> 23:51.400
you know the brain processes and the experiences such that for example one could make some

23:51.400 --> 23:56.680
predictions if somebody has a certain novel kind of brain process here David Hume talked

23:56.680 --> 23:59.560
about the missing shade of blue the one he had never experienced.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.360
So maybe we could predict that if you had a certain neurophysiological process there

24:03.360 --> 24:07.120
in between the other shades of blue then you'd get that experience.

24:07.120 --> 24:12.560
All of the missing shade of blue that's predictive that is to a certain extent explanatory but

24:12.560 --> 24:16.760
what it's not is a full reductive explanation of the experience.

24:16.760 --> 24:22.960
One example that does exist that sort of this reminds me of right away is the difference

24:22.960 --> 24:29.400
between natural naturally deaf signers and people who have acquired deafness and signing

24:29.400 --> 24:33.400
and the use of physical space and I think it's Ursula Luge or somebody who's done a lot of

24:33.400 --> 24:39.920
work on this and they find that the auditory cortex takes over visual functions and there's

24:39.920 --> 24:44.240
a fluency difference and so people who are natural signers will know if somebody's truly

24:44.240 --> 24:48.960
fluent because of the way they use space in front of them in their hands and place things

24:48.960 --> 24:56.400
and there's a whole visual motor component to their language effectively that's not auditory

24:56.400 --> 24:58.880
and there's a neural representation that's novel.

24:58.880 --> 25:03.400
So you know, I mean that's proof that this is all in the brain or that this is an argument

25:03.400 --> 25:08.440
against the philosophical standpoint but there are these kinds of things like this and they

25:08.440 --> 25:11.520
give us a sense that the identifications get larger.

25:11.520 --> 25:15.320
This is what we're getting from the science of consciousness over the last 20 years.

25:15.320 --> 25:20.440
A beautiful set of isomorphisms from processes in consciousness to psychological processes,

25:20.440 --> 25:26.640
some computational processes and some gradually developing some brain level processes.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.480
There's nothing here I think that answers the fundamental question why does all that

25:29.480 --> 25:33.520
brain stuff give you consciousness in the first place rather this science takes the

25:33.520 --> 25:37.120
existence of consciousness for granted as a kind of datum.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.900
It's given that we have it, what does it correlate with and we're getting a very nice

25:40.900 --> 25:47.340
science from that but that's why people always want to put it as if by opposing the reduction

25:47.340 --> 25:51.120
of this explanation of consciousness you're opposing science completely but no in fact

25:51.120 --> 25:55.720
the science has been tremendously productive, it's been predictive and some of it's even

25:55.720 --> 26:01.400
becoming useful in treating patients in clinical settings where we've taken stuff we know about

26:01.400 --> 26:07.760
the correlates of consciousness and put it to practical purposes but it does leave the

26:07.760 --> 26:12.760
fundamental philosophical question open.

26:12.760 --> 26:17.720
I should say I'm curious, we can focus all day on the things that make consciousness

26:17.720 --> 26:21.000
difficult but we've got people here who are speaking in an optimistic tone of voice about

26:21.000 --> 26:24.200
the wonderful theories that might be just around the corners.

26:24.200 --> 26:29.680
I'm curious to hear what some people think are the other places where they see we're

26:29.680 --> 26:35.280
actually likely to be making progress over the next 10, 20, 30 years and what kind of

26:35.280 --> 26:39.760
theories might be the ones that will have some promise.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.520
Gabrielle, do you?

26:42.520 --> 26:49.640
I'm still sort of hung up on this sort of question of what the it is when you say we

26:49.640 --> 26:52.960
can explain all the, we can find out more and more about the brain processes and the

26:52.960 --> 26:57.280
complex dynamic systems that are implemented in the brain but we still haven't explained

26:57.280 --> 26:58.280
consciousness.

26:58.280 --> 27:02.080
I'm just sort of interested in what we think we're trying to explain.

27:02.080 --> 27:08.400
Is it, so we're all sitting in this room and there's this background hum of the air coming

27:08.400 --> 27:13.200
into the room and there's this kind of dispersed consciousness that maybe we're aware of that

27:13.200 --> 27:17.040
and then there's this sort of focused consciousness that brought your attention to the sound of

27:17.040 --> 27:20.800
the air coming into the room so surely we're conscious of that because I've now brought

27:20.800 --> 27:25.040
your attention to it but that's attentional consciousness which is different than dispersed

27:25.040 --> 27:31.160
consciousness that might be just happening in the background and I'm sort of curious

27:31.160 --> 27:35.160
actually to ask the scientists too, so when you're sitting in the lab and you're devising

27:35.160 --> 27:41.160
an experiment about memory or what we're experiencing when we're asleep in dreaming

27:41.160 --> 27:48.600
states, how do you know that we're studying a conscious state unless there's someone reporting

27:48.600 --> 27:51.840
on it saying that I'm conscious of this thing.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.200
Of course once they've reported on it then you're talking about a particular kind of

27:55.200 --> 27:56.200
consciousness.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.480
The consciousness that requires access, attention.

27:59.480 --> 28:06.120
So what is the clever workaround that the scientists here are using to sort of get at that

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
problem?

28:07.120 --> 28:13.560
Yeah, I think we don't have a workaround for understanding awareness during sleep.

28:13.560 --> 28:18.160
Aside from maybe lucid dreaming we know very little about that and I think maybe if we

28:18.160 --> 28:21.880
get somewhere it will be with some brain measures that have a type correlation but we're not

28:21.880 --> 28:28.680
there yet but back to the other idea of memory I think one of the perhaps answers to your

28:28.680 --> 28:34.200
point is in a number of fields in my field in memory research one of the approaches is

28:34.200 --> 28:40.760
to contrast different types of memory and so we have a widely agreed upon contrast between

28:40.760 --> 28:45.440
implicit memory and explicit memory and so we understand the brain mechanisms of these

28:45.440 --> 28:49.080
types of memory and how they differ from each other and the interesting part of that is

28:49.080 --> 28:55.080
that with explicit memory you can do mental time travel and you can relive a past event

28:55.080 --> 28:59.640
you can have a conscious experience of something from the past with implicit memory you don't

28:59.640 --> 29:00.640
have that.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.480
Now both types of memory are very complex so we can look in the brain and ask well what's

29:04.480 --> 29:12.120
happening to allow those memory and phenomena to go forward and then how do they differ?

29:12.120 --> 29:14.760
What fundamental differences are there between those two types?

29:14.760 --> 29:22.040
So that's again not a solution it's not the answer but it's one of the avenues of which

29:22.040 --> 29:29.000
there are many to try to pinpoint the essential features that are happening in the brain

29:29.000 --> 29:36.720
and then my thought is as we pursue that we might have some new ideas about what it is

29:36.720 --> 29:44.680
that's special about the aware memories compared to the unaware memories is one example.

29:44.680 --> 29:50.320
Can you tell us a few questions about the progress that you've been talking about?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.240
I think the progress will come from posing the problem.

29:53.240 --> 29:59.320
I mean you asked a very good question you gave an excellent answer.

29:59.320 --> 30:04.440
I wonder whether just looking at the brain as a scientist might hold the clue to the

30:04.440 --> 30:06.200
hardness of it.

30:06.200 --> 30:11.560
So you've been talking about inferring through correlations through statistical regularities

30:11.560 --> 30:19.640
and mappings that this is a conscious brain that's making its own own sensory input but

30:19.640 --> 30:26.880
if it is the case that the brain is a scientist in the game of trying to infer the causes of

30:26.880 --> 30:32.240
the sensory information then we come back to this fundamental problem.

30:32.240 --> 30:39.040
The brain is actually trying to make inferences about itself and that's not the same as you

30:39.040 --> 30:45.520
try to infer whether this subject is conscious or not or whether somebody is having some

30:45.520 --> 30:51.080
perceptual adventure in a dream during sleep or trying to impute whether they are conscious

30:51.080 --> 30:54.320
when they're not allowed to verbally report.

30:54.320 --> 31:00.920
So all of these issues I think do detract from the fundamental thing it's my inference

31:00.920 --> 31:06.560
and how do I infer that I am making an inference when the machinery I'm using to do it is the

31:06.560 --> 31:09.800
thing that's making the inference means I can sit on top of it.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.680
How about if we make a deal all model you, new model range?

31:13.680 --> 31:17.880
They would have to merge or ego boundaries and they will be all be happy with it.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.600
Because in fact our modeling is a group.

31:20.600 --> 31:25.880
The science endeavors a group process it's not each of us on our own.

31:25.880 --> 31:33.280
Can I ask what you say about changing understanding of existing notions?

31:33.280 --> 31:39.400
It is very much true in my field as a physicist that our understanding of matter over the last

31:39.400 --> 31:42.040
200 years has changed enormously.

31:42.040 --> 31:49.200
So if people tell me I'm a materialist I ask them well do you mean like in 1800 or 1905

31:49.200 --> 31:56.760
or 1925 or maybe you are a string theorist do you see the world in terms of strings?

31:56.760 --> 32:03.560
I mean the same word matter has evolved from something inert and something objectively

32:03.560 --> 32:09.800
existing to something which you can only probe by taking a chance a stance of how you measure

32:09.800 --> 32:14.840
it and something which on a smaller scale can even have completely different properties

32:14.840 --> 32:18.640
maybe even live in a different number of dimensions.

32:18.640 --> 32:25.440
So it may very well be that gradually over time our understanding of the brain mind connection

32:25.440 --> 32:34.040
will also move on and what you sometimes call panpsychism that everything has a conscious

32:34.040 --> 32:35.320
component.

32:35.320 --> 32:40.200
The first time we hear that we think about the physics world and then within the physics

32:40.200 --> 32:46.360
world some sort of spooky fluid field or medium whatever which is in consciousness but that

32:46.360 --> 32:51.680
would be as strange as learning relativity theory and saying there is matter and there

32:51.680 --> 32:56.760
is energy and somehow the two interpenetrate each other it's so mysterious.

32:56.760 --> 33:02.360
Actually there is one thing and sometimes it condenses into matter and sometimes it

33:02.360 --> 33:08.560
shows itself as energy and it's not two different things which interpenetrate or interact with

33:08.560 --> 33:10.680
each other.

33:10.680 --> 33:17.840
The way William James said it I really like about matter and mind he said if two lines

33:17.840 --> 33:24.640
intersect there is one point where they cross not two different points there is one point

33:24.640 --> 33:26.680
lying on two lines.

33:26.680 --> 33:33.200
So mind and matter I can look at this as a physical object but this is also an experience

33:33.200 --> 33:40.040
in my mind that he experienced a bottle and physical bottle for me that are not two bottles

33:40.040 --> 33:48.800
which somehow have to be pushed together it's the intersection of both.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.520
I use the word coupling makes a mindful of that nice example about an understanding

33:52.520 --> 33:59.520
of DNA and how it causes us to be here as phenotypes and how good phenotypes propagate

33:59.520 --> 34:05.320
through their genes in that there is a circular causality which does I think bridge different

34:05.320 --> 34:07.200
levels of explanation.

34:07.200 --> 34:13.120
So the difference between the physical bottle and your inference that that is a bottle causing

34:13.120 --> 34:20.200
the sensations caused by physical bottles that's one example of closing that circular causality

34:20.200 --> 34:22.320
that I think does bridge the levels.

34:22.320 --> 34:28.880
So I think the deflationary expressions are unsatisfactory because they deny the challenge

34:28.880 --> 34:34.440
of coupling the levels of explanation into experiences and beliefs which basically means

34:34.440 --> 34:42.040
that neuroscience has to have a formal machinery to explain quantify and write down beliefs.

34:42.040 --> 34:47.280
It's as simple as that and once you've done that you can then work out how neuronal firing

34:47.280 --> 34:52.280
causes beliefs and then you can work out how beliefs change neural firing.

34:52.280 --> 34:58.160
In this case to your state example which is a very it's not a theoretical example for

34:58.160 --> 35:03.360
me it's an example that kind of enlarges in many of the cases that we see because almost

35:03.360 --> 35:07.440
all of them are like your neuroscientists in a room when they're hard if there's no

35:07.440 --> 35:13.400
output and you start to have correlations that get you close to states that look like

35:13.400 --> 35:17.600
states when that person doesn't have a motor problem they can talk to you and do lots of

35:17.600 --> 35:22.840
things but then you have this kind of limited set of measurements to try and you might not

35:22.840 --> 35:24.840
get a response that's expected.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.320
In other words they seem to have the right parts of the brain they should be able to

35:28.320 --> 35:31.840
if they were just awake and conscious and in the state that you were I were in and do

35:31.840 --> 35:35.600
a few things that you could measure and reliably get the result and you don't.

35:35.600 --> 35:40.040
So then is it is at their point of view are they in a lucid dreaming like state are they

35:40.040 --> 35:45.320
in some other you know altered consciousness because we don't have a model that says you

35:45.320 --> 35:50.760
know you get represent representational stuff with subjectivity when all this happens in

35:50.760 --> 35:55.600
the brain and if you're missing this aspect of it you kind of don't or actually it's

35:55.600 --> 36:00.160
as if you know you're there but you're not really aware so you're not taking in the sensory

36:00.160 --> 36:04.280
information and processing it the way you would be if you were kind of admitting to

36:04.280 --> 36:05.480
the world around you being real.

36:05.480 --> 36:10.120
I mean they're just an endless number of variations on it that you could sit there and kind of

36:10.120 --> 36:17.360
wonder is that what I'm looking at.

36:17.360 --> 36:27.040
I am assuming that you can in your lab say this person is conscious this person is comatose

36:27.040 --> 36:29.160
and this person is dead.

36:29.160 --> 36:34.160
Well okay let's start with the last two.

36:34.160 --> 36:40.800
Okay okay because no because I think you know that's that's meaningful so we know when

36:40.800 --> 36:47.680
someone's dead okay and that's actually and that's the most unambiguous and not present

36:47.680 --> 36:55.080
with uncertainty and determination that we can make given all of our available tools

36:55.080 --> 37:00.520
and so the only time that that becomes an issue of uncertainty is that sometimes we're relying

37:00.520 --> 37:05.240
on a subset of those tools because it's not practical to make every possible measurement

37:05.240 --> 37:10.560
to determine that every person dead person is dead okay but it is it is possible to unambiguously

37:10.560 --> 37:15.280
unequivocally figure out if somebody is dead that we understand.

37:15.280 --> 37:22.360
Coma is also a state that has not too much ambiguity somebody who's comatose with the

37:22.360 --> 37:28.960
right reasons to be comatose in terms of medical problems the correlational data that goes

37:28.960 --> 37:33.800
along with being in a deep coma doesn't have a lot of variation doesn't have a lot of variance

37:33.800 --> 37:38.040
and I would actually say that we shouldn't have a problem identifying with somebody's

37:38.040 --> 37:42.680
in a coma but that's the best that you know this is this is the left hand if we put it

37:42.680 --> 37:46.560
on a linear scale that's the extreme left and the extreme right would be full consciousness

37:46.560 --> 37:51.560
and when you move from coma the next level up would be people who appear to be comatose

37:51.560 --> 37:55.280
in terms of not responding to you in any way but for periods of time their eyes open their

37:55.280 --> 38:00.680
eyes closed that's that's sort of definitionally with vegetative status now vegetative state

38:00.680 --> 38:07.000
should be defined or identified by a whole biological context in which the brain is very

38:07.000 --> 38:11.160
severely injured and that eye opening and eye closure is just reflecting a remnant of

38:11.160 --> 38:15.680
arousal the brain stem and activity above the brain stem not being present but then things

38:15.680 --> 38:19.680
get more complicated because that measurement isn't always that that assessment isn't always

38:19.680 --> 38:23.280
followed up with measurements that would verify that underlying model and you hear stories

38:23.280 --> 38:27.840
about people who are diagnosed as vegetative with high level cognition and that we just

38:27.840 --> 38:31.960
had a whole conference on this about six months ago that's just a contradiction and just a

38:31.960 --> 38:36.640
mistake and those are patients who are misdiagnosed as vegetative and there should be lots of

38:36.640 --> 38:42.360
correlational data that tell you that that's probably bad as an assumption and working

38:42.360 --> 38:45.480
that out as a field and I think everybody's kind of getting to that point but then the

38:45.480 --> 38:49.320
next level up is that you start to show some sign of consciousness you may give a thumbs

38:49.320 --> 38:52.920
up you may give some very limited response but you can't communicate so you can't go

38:52.920 --> 38:58.280
and say well what's inside of this person's subjective response and actually what's their

38:58.280 --> 39:02.600
status of consciousness compared to you and me when we can tell you about it and give

39:02.600 --> 39:07.960
you metaphors and speak in sentences about it and then the grading as you go up gets

39:07.960 --> 39:12.200
more complicated in their elements of memory or orientation or self-awareness and things

39:12.200 --> 39:17.160
like that that don't come back and then finally you get into a range of normative conscious

39:17.160 --> 39:21.560
experience which is really pretty wide because once you get to be near normal then things

39:21.560 --> 39:29.160
are highly multivariate so it's actually the answer is no we can't do that.

39:29.160 --> 39:38.000
You cannot detect what changes in the brain as the person from the vegetative state moves

39:38.000 --> 39:39.400
towards the conscious.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.000
No that I didn't say.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.080
No that's why I'm asking.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.080
That's different.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.320
You can in a coarse grain of fashion do that and increasingly well and that's the engine

39:47.320 --> 39:48.800
underneath our science.

39:48.800 --> 39:52.800
So you can draw a rough line.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.000
You can draw a rough line with some coarse graded points on the grid and that's how

39:57.000 --> 40:01.040
this game is getting played and it's increasingly getting more predictive.

40:01.040 --> 40:08.840
I think it's a great it's moving towards a great science of the correlations between

40:08.840 --> 40:13.640
what brain areas, what brain criteria there are for being conscious and for not being

40:13.640 --> 40:19.120
conscious so that even as a science of correlations I think it has to be said it's fairly primitive

40:19.120 --> 40:20.120
in some respects.

40:20.120 --> 40:24.600
At the moment we've got some clear cases where we think okay there's very good reasons for

40:24.600 --> 40:31.040
thinking these people are conscious and we know the beginning to know something about

40:31.040 --> 40:33.400
the brain processes that go along with that.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.320
As you move away from the clear cases it gets very difficult you know there are cases where

40:37.320 --> 40:41.160
people aren't responding and I always want to ask the question well how do you know there's

40:41.160 --> 40:46.160
not some residual consciousness there that's not showing up in their actions and their

40:46.160 --> 40:47.160
responses.

40:47.160 --> 40:52.200
Just a question of what instrument you are producing to detect and if you could have

40:52.200 --> 40:57.000
instruments that detect those differences then that would be interesting.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.880
This would all be so much easier if we had the famous consciousness meter.

41:00.880 --> 41:06.160
Just wave this instrument at Niko's head and get a read out of his consciousness up on

41:06.160 --> 41:07.160
the screen.

41:07.160 --> 41:14.920
It could be from instruments that detect the activity of the brain that you say is now

41:14.920 --> 41:15.920
detectable.

41:15.920 --> 41:20.720
I can tell you that in practice and this is going to be reduced to an operational set

41:20.720 --> 41:24.240
of problems and I can think of really great cases.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.600
The boundary question that you're posing is what about minimally conscious versus vegetative.

41:28.600 --> 41:33.840
Where you know if you have somebody who has some level of brain activity or some very

41:33.840 --> 41:39.560
low level response you measure when is it conscious versus when is it really like coma.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.360
The answer is we don't know how to do that and there's some very interesting stuff when

41:43.360 --> 41:48.000
you start trying to make sense of some of the things you might measure or observe and

41:48.000 --> 41:51.880
correlate with neuronal function but we don't have a model that says this kind of brain

41:51.880 --> 41:58.640
activity creates a representational, subjective internal state and you can make a few probes

41:58.640 --> 42:01.360
at it and say well it at least has this content.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.360
There's nothing like that.

42:02.360 --> 42:07.760
I have a question about this.

42:07.760 --> 42:12.880
If you find somebody who can have a minimal reaction like a yes or no then in principle

42:12.880 --> 42:17.280
you would think it can take a very long time but in principle you could can the sentence

42:17.280 --> 42:22.320
out of the person by asking is it A, is it B or whatever in a tree.

42:22.320 --> 42:30.080
Yes, you're right in the game and so we have examples on every edge of that.

42:30.080 --> 42:36.320
We have patients who we first detect that they can follow a command to move their eye.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.200
One woman we saw after two years even her family had never seen any response.

42:41.200 --> 42:46.040
Once that was discovered then a huge effort was made to connect with her and she can

42:46.040 --> 42:52.840
inconsistently communicate but she doesn't yet have any way with existing technology to

42:52.840 --> 42:56.480
turn that into a successful communication system.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.040
So we believe she's conscious when there are windows of time when she's aware enough that

43:01.040 --> 43:03.320
she can use that eye.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.520
We know that that state is one in which she has awareness and some of the problems of

43:07.520 --> 43:11.560
memory and things like that that she may have because she's injured medial temporal structures

43:11.560 --> 43:16.240
can kind of be suggested by things she does answer right and things she doesn't answer

43:16.240 --> 43:17.240
right.

43:17.240 --> 43:21.200
We have other examples of patients who have these very narrow communication channels where

43:21.200 --> 43:23.560
you start to get a flavor for it.

43:23.560 --> 43:27.720
But then we have patients who have every correlation in fact examples where their brains look

43:27.720 --> 43:32.600
better than all these patients where we have absolutely nothing.

43:32.600 --> 43:37.320
Now that, there's like the ultimate urgency to kind of figure this out because some of

43:37.320 --> 43:39.080
these people are very young and they're otherwise healthy.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.960
Their problem is just brain injury.

43:40.960 --> 43:44.720
But yeah, so we see that and then we have examples where people transitioned.

43:44.720 --> 43:49.640
So we had one man who came to us who all but one person who saw them thought they were

43:49.640 --> 43:54.520
conscious but the one person who figured out they were conscious worked out a head movement

43:54.520 --> 43:59.080
system so that they could spell very slowly out and it was clear that they were conscious

43:59.080 --> 44:03.280
and then they were given various tools and they harnessed them over time.

44:03.280 --> 44:08.640
Now that patient sent us emails and came back after five years and the great email saying

44:08.640 --> 44:12.040
I'm looking forward to coming so I can show you what I can do now.

44:12.040 --> 44:18.160
And you know and over time had evolved a much more full and complete communication system

44:18.160 --> 44:22.520
so that we could see through his writing, through the book he was writing his interest.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.520
He wanted to go to cooking school.

44:24.520 --> 44:28.360
You know the fullness of his consciousness was there and actually his brain was more

44:28.360 --> 44:32.400
structurally injured than the other five people like this that we've been following.

44:32.400 --> 44:36.440
So you know it's true but it's not trivial.

44:36.440 --> 44:42.640
So is it possible that you've got this case of someone who only responds by a head movement

44:42.640 --> 44:46.200
or maybe by blinking their eyes or something.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.520
That's the only way they can express their consciousness.

44:48.520 --> 44:53.320
This raises the question well couldn't there be someone who didn't have the ability to

44:53.320 --> 44:54.320
make the head movement.

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
And to pick their eyes but nonetheless.

44:56.320 --> 45:00.600
And so we have full questions that we've studied who I worry very much about that and

45:00.600 --> 45:04.640
we think the data give us the probability that that's the way they are.

45:04.640 --> 45:07.400
But you know we don't have the tools to say that it is the way they are.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.160
Do you think they're probably conscious?

45:09.160 --> 45:11.880
Yeah absolutely and the question is what do we do about it.

45:11.880 --> 45:20.360
But know that you can measure their brains you can ask them to use the way of thinking

45:20.360 --> 45:24.480
to use the blood flow in the brain effectively instead of the head movement.

45:24.480 --> 45:29.400
So this is where this gets into the heart, the absolute core of the issue here.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.480
Measurement isn't that easy.

45:31.480 --> 45:35.920
It's not often those measurements aren't super reliable even in normals.

45:35.920 --> 45:41.840
But once you start introducing issues of brain injury state variations because of brain injury.

45:41.840 --> 45:47.320
So that they may have the material there to do a mental imagery response but their arousal

45:47.320 --> 45:51.440
function or their level of their quality of consciousness over their wakeful periods of

45:51.440 --> 45:53.400
time varies dramatically.

45:53.400 --> 45:58.960
You start getting into complexities about not having a reliable model that says this is

45:58.960 --> 46:02.680
what has to happen this is the state it has to be and it has to be held constant in this

46:02.680 --> 46:06.120
way and you know and this is how you're going to get reliable communication.

46:06.120 --> 46:11.520
So you know again these are more practical issues but they make it then hard when you

46:11.520 --> 46:15.960
don't have the communication to make an assessment of where they are subjectively because again

46:15.960 --> 46:20.480
it's an assessment of what's their subjective state that needs some kind of readout from

46:20.480 --> 46:22.960
them to you to make an estimate of it.

46:22.960 --> 46:28.000
And your practical problem is actually twofold because you want to know what their current

46:28.000 --> 46:31.480
state of awareness is and you want to know what the future holds.

46:31.480 --> 46:36.280
Well also how to move them so that they can get better and become part of the world or

46:36.280 --> 46:37.280
interactive with the world.

46:37.280 --> 46:40.480
They're part of the world but to be barbed the community.

46:40.480 --> 46:45.920
That's right and so that's exactly why I think we're pretty close to where the predictive

46:45.920 --> 46:51.600
models tell us what we can do because we would have a consequence if they were better.

46:51.600 --> 47:00.360
So what you're saying now sounds like that depending on from patient to patient even

47:00.360 --> 47:06.320
what could be a marker for activity in the brain is different and this actually reminds

47:06.320 --> 47:09.600
me of another thing that William James says when he talks about consciousness he says

47:09.600 --> 47:15.520
something like I'm going to misquote total pluralism absolute insularity and of course

47:15.520 --> 47:18.600
he's talking about how consciousness is personal and for every person in the room there's a

47:18.600 --> 47:24.320
different consciousness but also it sounds like even scientifically for every brain injured

47:24.320 --> 47:27.960
patient that comes in there's a different potentially different measure that you're going

47:27.960 --> 47:30.200
to need to figure out whether these patients are aware.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.480
In the heart of modern medicine this is the ultimate personalized medicine.

47:33.480 --> 47:34.480
Yeah.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.880
But that doesn't mean there won't be a general model but not brain works.

47:38.880 --> 47:43.680
And in all these different cases if there's for every different possible case there's

47:43.680 --> 47:47.920
a different mechanism that you're looking at then in the normal case.

47:47.920 --> 47:51.280
Well, but this is I mean that's a theory with a lot of disjuncts.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.640
Right now but I mean at some point there should be some simplicity.

47:54.640 --> 47:55.640
Right.

47:55.640 --> 47:56.640
Right.

47:56.640 --> 48:00.920
Like there's brains got parts and they're in the right state and we could be clever about

48:00.920 --> 48:05.640
you know working around brain lesions and the rest of it but you know it is it does come

48:05.640 --> 48:09.400
down to the biology of it so something like coma you know things are very uniform and

48:09.400 --> 48:11.880
how the brain activity appears everywhere.

48:11.880 --> 48:14.760
And once you start getting minimal signs of consciousness then things get much more

48:14.760 --> 48:18.880
complex and they start looking a lot like normal depending on which you know measure

48:18.880 --> 48:22.360
you're looking at and then it's the same problem like what are the correlations that

48:22.360 --> 48:23.360
are meaningful.

48:23.360 --> 48:28.280
Consciousness seems very like almost like leaky or something like it sort of goes like

48:28.280 --> 48:32.600
it can sort of go to like one kind of process and that's going to be the one that's correlated

48:32.600 --> 48:36.080
with consciousness or it can leak into some other area depending on what person.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.400
Well, this is why I like to have a model that said you know if you have a subjective state

48:38.400 --> 48:42.320
that has you know that's a correlate with this belief or that I'm dreaming versus I believe

48:42.320 --> 48:47.040
I'm in the world that you know they're both conscious but what's the what's the what's

48:47.040 --> 48:48.680
the measure that's associated with it.

48:48.680 --> 48:49.680
We just don't have that.

48:49.680 --> 48:55.280
The pluralism here is more about the way that you access or you infer that there is some

48:55.280 --> 48:56.280
inference going on.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
Right.

48:57.280 --> 49:01.920
I get the impression that any modality will do whether it's a pill or a response or a

49:01.920 --> 49:07.800
symptom of a thing as long as there's some embodied expression of it which can be very

49:07.800 --> 49:13.280
different and very individual but implicitly that underneath you think that there is something

49:13.280 --> 49:17.040
canonical about the conscious brain you need to demonstrate.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.560
Can we map to your question though?

49:18.560 --> 49:24.280
If you could never demonstrate it would you say that that person was no longer consciousness

49:24.280 --> 49:25.280
conscious?

49:25.280 --> 49:26.280
Well, okay.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.160
So I mean let's go canonical right.

49:28.160 --> 49:31.720
So it's the stuff that the brain is made of is very stereotyped right.

49:31.720 --> 49:36.960
So you know we have certain I mean there's complexity on complexity but we think of consciousness

49:36.960 --> 49:42.160
is in the corticothlamic system right and corticothlamic system has conservation of motifs.

49:42.160 --> 49:46.000
I mean the cells are different they have all sorts of interesting differences but you

49:46.000 --> 49:50.880
know if we had a whole hemisphere we had these rules from clinical neurology and it's only

49:50.880 --> 49:55.480
an issue when it's only an issue when the motor system is out of the game right because

49:55.480 --> 50:01.040
if the motor system is in the game and we have you know that's there's some fine print

50:01.040 --> 50:05.120
there if I can hear my colleagues jumping up is it inside the motor system in terms of

50:05.120 --> 50:09.520
will to action and other things there might be things that stop you from showing conscious

50:09.520 --> 50:12.880
behaviors even though you have a connection to your skeletal muscle system.

50:12.880 --> 50:20.160
But let's just say that you know the issue is you know is this person in a conscious brain

50:20.160 --> 50:24.120
stable but there are some correlations we have if you have one hemisphere you can be

50:24.120 --> 50:28.920
conscious and if you had enough thalmicortical cells and they were in the right state you

50:28.920 --> 50:32.240
know we kind of think that you should be conscious and if you're not then then it's just

50:32.240 --> 50:34.200
because there's something we don't understand.

50:34.200 --> 50:38.520
So you're saying that I mean it doesn't have to be the strident muscle system it could

50:38.520 --> 50:40.120
be your autonomic system.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.120
Sure I could show a cardiac cellaration or a blush.

50:44.120 --> 50:49.800
So the key thing is acting on the world part of being embodied it's somehow I have to change

50:49.800 --> 50:55.040
the world in order to express my consciousness or not on that.

50:55.040 --> 50:59.480
Yeah practically speaking but are you saying I mean I guess it's a little bit like the

50:59.480 --> 51:03.760
question can you be a scientist if you can never do an experiment.

51:03.760 --> 51:08.000
You can certainly have scientific aspirations and you can certainly have glorious ideas

51:08.000 --> 51:12.560
about all the data other scientists are generating but are you truly a scientist if for the

51:12.560 --> 51:15.720
rest of your life you can never acquire any more data.

51:15.720 --> 51:22.120
Actually that reminds me of my profession of as a physicist the latest cosmology theories

51:22.120 --> 51:29.800
have not one universe but a multiverse multiple universes and the best theories we have predicted

51:29.800 --> 51:32.120
that we know that we cannot check it.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.680
So is that empirical science?

51:33.680 --> 51:35.360
No is it science?

51:35.360 --> 51:41.240
Well it's a consequence of empirical sciences but it's a similar gray area.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.560
Sounds like the situation you're in that.

51:43.560 --> 51:45.200
That's right it's actually not that different.

51:45.200 --> 51:49.280
Right I mean it's because we don't even have the theory that predicts these things we just

51:49.280 --> 51:52.880
have the observations that you know there are different states that look like they could

51:52.880 --> 51:55.000
be supporting consciousness.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.800
So people are trying to come up with unified models of consciousness.

51:59.800 --> 52:04.040
One of the one of the interesting things that's happened recently is people trying to develop

52:04.040 --> 52:09.360
systematic quantitative theories of consciousness that might have some application to these

52:09.360 --> 52:10.360
cases.

52:10.360 --> 52:15.880
There's this Giulio Tiononi's integrated information theory where he basically says consciousness

52:15.880 --> 52:22.880
goes along with the amount of information that's being integrated in the brain or in some other

52:22.880 --> 52:26.960
process and he measures this with a quantity he calls phi.

52:26.960 --> 52:31.280
So you have a lot of phi you've got a lot of consciousness you've got less phi you've

52:31.280 --> 52:36.640
got less consciousness and actually the conference we had one of the more interesting presentations

52:36.640 --> 52:42.200
with someone trying to apply that to the case of people diagnosed with vegetative state

52:42.200 --> 52:44.000
and related conditions.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.880
I mean this thing phi is actually very hard to measure in the brain but people find surrogates

52:47.880 --> 52:50.560
for it that might at least approximate it.

52:50.560 --> 52:51.560
Protebational complexity.

52:51.560 --> 52:55.840
And so one of the things that evolved there was that it's very very good at the dichotomization

52:55.840 --> 52:58.080
of not conscious and conscious.

52:58.080 --> 53:02.400
So it helps you find people who are vegetative proxies that do the Marchal and that's how

53:02.400 --> 53:03.400
many of these work.

53:03.400 --> 53:08.160
So it's very nice to separate people who are in coma, anesthetic coma or vegetative state

53:08.160 --> 53:12.680
from wakefulness but once you start getting into these conditions of minimally conscious,

53:12.680 --> 53:18.840
confusional behavior on your way up to normative conscious behavior, there's no fine line and

53:18.840 --> 53:20.200
there's no separation.

53:20.200 --> 53:24.440
So that it doesn't mean there aren't other measures and there isn't a model but it's

53:24.440 --> 53:27.760
just that that's where we're lacking, we're lacking something that gives us an insight

53:27.760 --> 53:32.440
into the dynamics that are really informative about qualitative subjective consciousness.

53:32.440 --> 53:37.560
And even within these models, nobody knows, you get this number out of it, but phi could

53:37.560 --> 53:40.640
be one or ten or a hundred or a thousand.

53:40.640 --> 53:44.200
Nobody knows which where on this line corresponds to no consciousness.

53:44.200 --> 53:48.560
I mean I think to know in his own view is that even if there's a tiny amount of information

53:48.560 --> 53:54.360
integrating, there's a tiny amount of consciousness but that's in a way philosophical speculation

53:54.360 --> 54:02.120
is a counter-

54:02.120 --> 54:06.120
Yeah that would be, that would convince me.

54:06.120 --> 54:15.200
Was this any different than before you knew that cirrhosis of the liver caused ichters?

54:15.200 --> 54:20.120
And so you saw yellow people and you didn't know why they were yellow but you knew they

54:20.120 --> 54:21.120
were yellow.

54:21.120 --> 54:25.480
Then you discovered that it was because the liver was sick.

54:25.480 --> 54:33.200
So why is the manifestation of the organs so different and so difficult?

54:33.200 --> 54:37.960
It's the number of times you said we don't have the tools, we don't have the tools.

54:37.960 --> 54:40.360
Is it just a question of tools?

54:40.360 --> 54:43.800
Well the tools and the theory and they go together I think.

54:43.800 --> 54:51.040
I mean you can invent all sorts of models which I think Taunonia has one of them.

54:51.040 --> 54:56.840
But and I'm sure in the old days people invented various theories by someone was yellow so

54:56.840 --> 54:58.920
there were many models.

54:58.920 --> 55:03.680
But eventually you discovered why in fact they were yellow and then you even refined

55:03.680 --> 55:07.360
that further and further and further to the chemical level.

55:07.360 --> 55:13.920
So why is that kind of thinking not applicable to the issue of consciousness?

55:13.920 --> 55:18.040
Well it could be that it is and we're just not clever enough to see how existing tools

55:18.040 --> 55:21.600
and models could be used to kind of account for it.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.480
But I think it's qualitatively distinct.

55:23.480 --> 55:27.480
So if you had other people turning other diseases turning people other colors and there were

55:27.480 --> 55:35.080
different substances which there are and I can't remember the history of where it still

55:35.080 --> 55:36.880
pictures came in with all that.

55:36.880 --> 55:42.000
But the I think the feeling is and I think what you're hearing is that none of the models

55:42.000 --> 55:48.760
none of the measurement tools even in principle give a satisfying flavor that they could give

55:48.760 --> 55:54.080
you an account of how there's a subjective internally representational state occurring

55:54.080 --> 55:57.040
with neural activity of any pattern.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.360
One answer though.

55:59.360 --> 56:05.080
I mean you spoke about that I'm a cortical interaction so my guess is you do actually

56:05.080 --> 56:08.920
have an understanding of the functional anatomy of consciousness you know just being a bit

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
modest.

56:09.920 --> 56:14.080
Of course.

56:14.080 --> 56:19.560
I think the difference between jawless and the liver is that there is it's an easy problem

56:19.560 --> 56:25.840
because you know you don't have to explain how being yellow causes liver disease.

56:25.840 --> 56:32.800
I think that there's a much deeper issue when it comes to this levels of description and

56:32.800 --> 56:33.960
the circular causality.

56:33.960 --> 56:40.200
So what the question is for the brain that might be disconnected from the world is there

56:40.200 --> 56:44.040
sufficient evidence of self-organization by which there is coupling between different

56:44.040 --> 56:49.440
scales if you like the scales of neural firing and the scales of belief that might be reflected

56:49.440 --> 56:52.320
in fire or it might not be.

56:52.320 --> 56:56.840
I think you don't need to apply the notion of self-organization to understand the physiology

56:56.840 --> 57:01.280
of jawless but you do need to understand it to find out what is quintessential about

57:01.280 --> 57:04.920
the conscious brain even if it can't tell you it's conscious.

57:04.920 --> 57:12.160
And I'm sure that's in the sort of hierarchy and in that separation of spatial and temporal

57:12.160 --> 57:20.160
scales that clearly you in your head believe is crucially tied ethlaminic orally interactions

57:20.160 --> 57:25.320
and possibly bits of the brain which you might say the prefrontal cortex and I'm sure you'd

57:25.320 --> 57:29.720
have something to say about self-organization as something which is you know to crack that

57:29.720 --> 57:32.760
I think you're in much closer to cracking the concept.

57:32.760 --> 57:33.760
It's not totally open.

57:33.760 --> 57:40.160
There is a lawful set of correlations and they're increasingly available but yeah I agree.

57:40.160 --> 57:45.720
What you said about Feynman and making something.

57:45.720 --> 57:52.200
Only when we knew how to make a pump could we understand the heart and only after making

57:52.200 --> 57:54.960
sonar could we understand bets.

57:54.960 --> 58:00.000
So we are not yet at the point that we can make an artificial brain our computers are

58:00.000 --> 58:05.840
so much worse the hardware and software combined so much worse it's dealing with everyday

58:05.840 --> 58:07.840
life than our brains are.

58:07.840 --> 58:15.720
So by the time we can make an artificially intelligent robot either physically or in

58:15.720 --> 58:21.080
a computer program ideally physically moving around if that robot can really behave like

58:21.080 --> 58:22.280
a human.

58:22.280 --> 58:28.440
I think we will be much much closer to answering the question how hard a heart problem is and

58:28.440 --> 58:34.040
until we are close to that these questions of what is consciousness and what is not even

58:34.040 --> 58:38.680
on the level of information processing it would be like trying to understand the heart

58:38.680 --> 58:40.680
without knowing much about pumps.

58:40.680 --> 58:45.240
My impression is that it doesn't agree with that.

58:45.240 --> 58:50.000
With the robot that will become increasingly self-aware.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.400
I don't see any difference in principle between robots and biological brains.

58:56.400 --> 59:01.760
I think it's very difficult to see how all this silicon inside a robot should give you

59:01.760 --> 59:06.560
consciousness but it's equally difficult to see how a bunch of neurons inside a brain

59:06.560 --> 59:11.200
should give you consciousness but somehow the neurons in the brain go along with consciousness.

59:11.200 --> 59:14.640
I don't see why silicon should be any worse than principle.

59:14.640 --> 59:20.360
I suspect that everything we know about the brain and thinking about cognition in general

59:20.360 --> 59:25.920
seems to suggest that what matters is the information processing and the representation

59:25.920 --> 59:27.480
of the world and so on.

59:27.480 --> 59:33.440
I don't think that's got a lot specifically to do with neurons as opposed to silicon.

59:33.440 --> 59:38.880
I think for example if you replace my neurons my neurons start wearing out and you replace

59:38.880 --> 59:44.120
them with prosthetic neurons made of silicon one at a time and the question is what's going

59:44.120 --> 59:45.840
to happen to my consciousness?

59:45.840 --> 59:49.680
As long as those prosthetic neurons are doing their job right and connecting up to the other

59:49.680 --> 59:53.760
neurons I'm at least going to keep responding the same way.

59:53.760 --> 59:58.840
Is there any reason to think my consciousness is going to fade out or suddenly disappear?

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.400
I don't see why not.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.640
I guess I'm inclined to agree with Pete that if we had the robot that was functioning as

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:11.880
if it was conscious it would probably be conscious but that alone doesn't tell us, doesn't solve

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880
the harm problem.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.400
We're a complete blueprint of Pete's brain right now and that wouldn't necessarily solve

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
the harm problem.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.040
I would say the harm problem will remain equally hard but our chances to deal with it will become

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040
better.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:30.400
We have not only one example of biological consciousness but if we get more than one example

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.280
then we can approach the harm problem from different angles and maybe deal with it better.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:41.360
But I suppose David's point about that is if we have a conscious robot David would say

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.680
perhaps we can't understand how it's conscious just by understanding how the silicon works.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.680
We'd have to invoke a primitive of consciousness to understand it.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:57.840
So you're speculating about our theory about any kind of consciousness that it's silicon

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.440
even though you built it.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.800
I guess you would say even though we built this conscious robot we don't know how it

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.480
works just by thinking about silicon.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:10.200
We have to invoke something else and that's what I'm not really to take that point.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.400
I don't know how we're going to have to explain that theory later and maybe we will be able

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.640
to explain it by thinking about how the silicon works.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.600
But David already knows that that's not going to be sufficient.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.240
One thing that is likely true, once we can produce these computational bases for consciousness

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.960
and robots we'll have the room to do a whole bunch of experiments like come up with variations

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.080
on the computational system and take this part away and take this part away and see what

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.800
matters in producing the consciousness associated responses that might actually give us a whole

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.800
bunch of relevant data.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:50.320
I don't know about the ethics of this, producing new conscious robots with impaired consciousness

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:55.880
but I'm principle of what the basic asthma problem is.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:01.640
In Ryan's movie, what you said earlier about the matter state, because maybe at some point

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.880
there are aspects of the matter state that once you get to the descriptors that are important

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:12.440
in the brain, our material to what we associate with consciousness and then it becomes a problem

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.880
that makes contact with things like strength theory or whatever that become important to

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880
the work you do.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.080
Do you have any intuitions about that?

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080
Absolutely.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:30.920
The history of physics when Maxwell discovered the right equations, he posited an ether

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:37.800
in which the equations were vibrations and it was just a too bitch leap to imagine that

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.360
vibrations without a carrier.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.600
But now we have accepted and children learning in school or as undergraduates and we sort

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.920
of say of how it is and nobody talks about an ether anymore.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.920
So I think the notion of on-psychism or any of that, I think that it's an intermediate

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:02.960
guidance towards a direction of where to go and what an ether less or a pen, a psychism

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.880
less theory will be.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880
Nobody can know.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:14.280
We have to get more data and the beauty of natural science is that if you get more data

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.240
you can sharpen your theory which tells you how to look for better data and that sharpen

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240
your theory.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.480
It really, it's never that the one gives the other.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.480
It is interplay.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.880
That's my guess too.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.200
The measurements are going to drive this and we just don't have a lot of them right now.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:37.040
But I think what is important to realize here is that until we study consciousness, whether

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.960
it's origin of matter or of life, anything in biology or physics, you all can start with

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.840
space and time and the distribution of matter.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.440
Even the origin of life, it's a rearrangement of molecules in space and time.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.680
If once you start about consciousness, then our understanding of space and time and molecules

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.280
is generated in our consciousness.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:08.000
So certainly we have to really question, can we do the type of reductionism in which we

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.760
start with the stage of space and time and then in that stage we find the rules of the

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:13.760
game.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.560
But for the first time the stage is produced in the phenomena we want to study.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.720
So it's a little bit, again, sorry to go back to physics, but I know that many physicists

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.680
are arrogant and they want to explain everything as physics.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:33.360
I try not to be that way, but I use the metaphors of my trade, like everybody tends to do.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:39.040
Within physics, special relativity tells you what happens if you go at fast at very high

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.720
speed and how time and space change.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.000
But it's different from general relativity.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.840
General relativity tells you how matter, warps and curves space and the curved space

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
influences matter.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.560
That is a circle.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.280
So general relativity is much more difficult on a technical level than special relativity

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.520
and also much more interesting.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.840
It can generate black holes, it can explain the big bang because you have the gravity

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.600
influence, influencing space and time and space and time and influence and gravity.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.480
And I think that is a reasonable metaphor, only as a metaphor, I'm not trying to explain

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.040
anything, metaphor for the mind-world problem.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.480
Use your mind to understand the world and in the world you have brains which somehow

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.640
are connected with the mind.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:43.560
You ready to take questions from the audience?

01:05:43.560 --> 01:06:08.480
A while ago, a young guy who was minimally conscious was given something like ambient

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.640
by his mother and he was suddenly alert after a long time.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.640
And that's been duplicated with a few others.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.640
What's going on?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:25.040
So if you're interested you can type in Zolta them which is the trade name for ambient in

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:31.400
eLife, E-L-I-F-E and the first Google hit will be a paper that we published on three

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.400
patients like this.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.000
And we have an idea about what we think is going on.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But in very short description, what's going on is that in the patients who respond, that

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:52.720
drug is creating an activation in an interesting way like other drugs that are sedating like

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.120
anesthetic drugs.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.200
There's an early phase where the brain has an excitation before it goes down.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:05.320
And when you give ambient or other medications like it to produce these effects, it's in

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.760
a low dose, they call it a subsetitive dose.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.760
And it sort of creates this wave of excitation.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.440
What we think is happening is these patients are living on the edge of being able to catch

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.880
a right on that wave and become active.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.440
And the measurements in the paper and the theory and its elaborate.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.840
It says why we think the cells in the thalmo cortical system are poised on the edge of

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.920
being able to catch that wave and then ride with it for a few hours.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.600
And then over time, this allows the brain to be much more active in an expressed behavior.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.880
And it can be very dramatic and this is all free on the web.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.040
You can see the videos of one of the patients where the effect is very clear.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.400
So these are the effects that you're seeing?

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.280
Well so it's an effect across the whole system of the brain.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:56.920
But we think that the primary effect is in the central thalamus and the frontal cortex

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.680
and that the rest of the system follows the changes there.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.040
But that's the theoretical part.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.240
The measurements are the measurements and they're very lawful.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.720
You can see the paper.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.240
So this is the fancy version of coffee.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.360
It's the fancy version of coffee with a lot more bells and whistles and much more effective

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.360
at least in these contexts.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:18.040
Most of the time we put it, you took it, we would go to sleep.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.040
So I see.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.440
Within the limits of what's ethical to test, are any of you taking an evolutionary view

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.200
and looking at consciousness in other animals or are you starting from the assumption that

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.440
we're the only conscious animal?

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.480
I don't think any of us make that assumption.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.760
However, it is through the primary data that each of us has about consciousness comes from

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.760
the first person case.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.600
It's because of my own consciousness that I believe there's consciousness at all.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.400
So the only thing I'm certain of with respect to consciousness is that I have it, maybe

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.040
that humans have it.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.920
Beyond that it's got to be an extension and the speculation that said, I think a lot

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.880
of people are making interesting models of consciousness in non-human animals.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.600
I don't know if that applies to anybody here.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.840
I would agree with what you said.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.480
I mean, ultimately the problem we have is that if we want to know somebody's conscious,

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.080
we need some way for them to let us report it.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.680
And so I mean, I agree with David.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.840
I mean, a lot of animals are conscious, but I can't communicate with them.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:31.960
So the human communication problem sets the operational criteria for us right now.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.760
And you're born baby.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.760
Great question.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.760
Yeah.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.760
Same issue arises.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760
Same issue arises.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.480
I think you have an inference of continuity.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:47.640
I'm trying to puzzle things out.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:59.880
You know, in my mind, a kind of a continuum, if we interject mind, so brain mind and consciousness

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:07.160
in an attempt to distill this, I'm thinking there are these experiments in which a problem

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.360
is presented to the subject.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.840
And in one of them, somebody just makes this, there's a window shade with a thing hanging

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.240
down and they take their finger and it make it swing.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.280
And in trying to solve, it has no relationship to the problem, which is to bring two, to

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.560
tie something together.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.000
And they solve, they come up with a solution.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.480
However, when asked about the solution, they never mentioned that they saw, what would

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.400
you call, you know, hanging from the shade, this thing coming down.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:48.800
They never mentioned that they observed this thing swinging and made an association that

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.760
brought about the solution to the problem.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.240
In my mind, that's a narrative.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:01.880
So theoretically, it might be possible to, if you have the brain hooked up, to find out

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.160
what parts of the brain are involved in this process.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:13.680
So we might be able to distill mind to some extent in relationship to brain through the

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.840
measure as neuroscientists are doing.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:24.480
On the other hand, to the extent that anybody believes in psychic research, there seems to

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:33.400
be some evidence of psychic phenomenon if you accept that this is a science at all, the

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:40.000
statistics that show more than a random or an accidental, you know, number of times that

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.080
somebody comes up with something.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.440
That strikes me like the multi-universe, that you have a string theory, and you can't

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.800
test for it at the other end of the extreme.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:12:00.600
So what I'm asking is, is this somewhere in that an approach where you might distill

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:08.160
consciousness separate from mind in relationship to brain in an attempt to apprehend the name

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:14.640
of this discussion, apprehending consciousness, in an attempt to apprehend consciousness as

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.080
distinct from brain or distinct from mind's relationship to brain?

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.760
Does that make any sense?

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:30.560
I would say the difference between string theory and multi-first is that a string theory

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:36.760
is probably testable, but we don't have the tools yet.

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:43.760
So either in the future, it could be 10, 20 years, it could be a thousand years, we were

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:50.440
likely to find, to develop some sort of tool to test string theory, and if somebody is

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.040
very clever, they may suddenly realize that among their physical observations, cosmic

01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.000
rays, neutrinos, whatever, there is already a test of string theory.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.160
In some ways, we are close, so it may happen.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.560
Multiverse, on the other hand, if you have other universes which are causally disconnected,

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.440
then in principle, you cannot make connection with them.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.280
So that's a very different type of ignorance.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.800
There are levels of ignorance which are different.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:25.120
So if somebody would say there may be consciousness not connected with matter, and if the theory

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.960
would postulate that there is no interaction between them, then as an empirical scientist,

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.000
it doesn't make a difference.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.160
It's like saying there are elementary particles more weakly interacting than neutrinos, so

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.280
weakly that there is no interaction at all.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.320
Oh yeah, there may be those particles, but they are not part of physics because they

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.200
don't make a difference.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:56.920
But I'm saying, can you, if with the experiments between brain and mind in neuroscience, can

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:05.800
one get to a point maybe similar to that where we can see in some way that there is something

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:11.040
like consciousness, but we can't identify it, the situation that you are saying with

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:17.240
strength theory and relationship to multiverse, we're not in a place yet to identify consciousness

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:25.840
where we're at, but we can see that it's separate from the reductionist mind-grained business.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.120
You know, in other words, experiment with mind and brain and neuroscience will bring us closer

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:37.280
to that correlation, but we're still left with some X.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:43.360
I think what you're saying, some X possibly being there that we're not yet close enough

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:51.200
to have a system for, but we can be more certain that there's a distinction now between brain

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.440
and mind, and we have an alternative to a reductionist being left simply with that.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.040
I mean, my view is there's something missing in our theories that need to be added, for

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.640
example, to the ontology of physics to give you an explanation of consciousness.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.320
And the question is whether that's just adding, you said X, so the question is whether X

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.720
just equals consciousness, whether that's the extra thing you need to add a peat and

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.520
a paper 20 years ago said, well, maybe it could be something else, it needn't be consciousness.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.480
For example, I think his analogy was explaining motion in terms of space.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.640
Well, you can't quite do it, you go to add something, but you add motion or you add time,

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.760
or you add time to space and you get motion, maybe there's something else, X.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.240
We add that to physics, we get consciousness.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.840
It's just to say that's an open possibility to it.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.600
Well, I could also add to the beginning part of your question another neuroscience approach

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:48.040
to think of when we're dealing with intuitive problem solving is, and your example is that

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.480
we can make intuitive decisions, is something we study in neuroscience, and the intuitive

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.120
decisions we think about as being driven by implicit learning.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.320
So in other words, their decisions made with information we don't know we have.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:07.400
And so there's nothing we don't need to postulate some extra process there.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:12.200
We understand that sometimes we make strategic decisions, and sometimes we come up with an

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:19.240
answer, some insight that's coming out of our implicit knowledge, information we've acquired,

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.600
and so we can understand how those two types of memory interact.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:30.480
And so this is another approach that is not open to saying there's something missing.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:35.720
We think we have a story there about how these decisions are being made.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.400
Yeah, I'm not jumping to the metaphysics, but I'm asking,

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.040
do you have to say, well, the intuitive, can you find it in the mind brain, like neuroscience?

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.720
We can find implicit learning in the brain.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.560
Yes.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.000
And from the dualness of the whole system?

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.440
Well, a couple of things you mentioned, and also to the previous question about sort of

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.880
how far at the evolutionary scale would you go before you thought consciousness of the

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.880
sort we're talking about emerges.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.760
In my little world, the X is inference.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.720
So in my simple world, consciousness means inference.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.920
And talking about narratives, talking about strategy immediately tells you that you have

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:22.800
the equipment to make inferences about counterfactuals, about things that have not yet occurred.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.320
The discussion we're having about hierarchies immediately tells me that the model I have

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:33.480
of the world is a hierarchical model, and that immediately puts certain formal constraints

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:41.040
on or differences, distinctions between animates or organisms that have deep hierarchical models

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.720
and shallow hierarchical models.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.960
So a virus, from my point of view, does do inference and has a very primitive form of

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.960
consciousness.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.120
But by virtue of the fact it doesn't have a deep hierarchical model.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120
It doesn't have the depth.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.720
It doesn't have the self-reflection.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.440
It can never represent its representations.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.360
I think what you're talking about when you talk about narratives and strategy, again,

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.080
coming back to the brain as a scientist, the ability to plan an experiment and choose

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:11.160
amongst different experiments or different ways of sampling the world is somewhat unique

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.160
to higher organisms.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:20.680
I think that in terms of building sub-organised robots that show conscious-like behaviour,

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:27.320
it is that prospective, both a deep hierarchical model, with the ability to free oneself from

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.320
time.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.640
So you now have a representation of the world, not just now, but in the future.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.640
I think that's a...

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:40.280
So is that almost like an add-on in your mind, like a world-free object as popper and an

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.040
echos would have put it, you know, inference and our deep hierarchical model in addition

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.040
to the basic laws of physics or is it...

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:51.640
I would actually have the basic laws of physics without reflection of that deep inference.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.640
I have a good idea.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.640
My deal list is over here.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640
And Brian comes first in the world.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.640
I have a question for you, quickly.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.400
So you've mentioned implicit memories and tacit problem solving.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.400
Do you think that there's something it's like to be a human?

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.400
I think that there's something that's not a problem solving.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:14.760
Do you think that there's something it's like to be an organism that can only perform

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.280
implicit problem solving and have implicit memories?

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.520
So you're asking me the zombie question.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.280
I mean, sort of, although, I mean, I'm just curious what your answer is.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280
So are these...

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:29.360
Is this like a different kind of consciousness you're talking about?

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.360
Or is there the light...

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.000
I mean, yeah, is it the zombie question, but yeah, are the lights on or off when someone

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
is...

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.960
Well, I think we have to be a little tentative the same way we are with the coma patients.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.960
So when someone demonstrates some knowledge that they're not aware of, you're asking,

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.880
are they a little bit aware of it?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.400
Or is there nothing?

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.360
And so, is that...

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.640
So it seems that there's nothing that it's like to...

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.200
Actually, you can ask the same question of perception, right?

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:05.640
So if I show you something subliminally and your behavior betrays that that information

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.320
was processed, do you have some awareness of that?

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.320
And I would say, well, no.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.680
That's how we're defining it.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:18.120
That's how we're understanding it, that you were influenced by the subliminal information,

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.680
but not aware of it.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.680
Is that your question?

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:28.400
I think most of our...

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:34.000
Maybe it's just me, but I think most of my life goes on sort of in that sort of implicit

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.160
tacit way of mode of being.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.680
And so the question of consciousness for me becomes the question of when the system is

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.400
trying to access itself.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:45.400
That's right.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.640
So I think most neuroscientists would say that most of what the brain is doing, we're

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640
not aware of.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640
Right.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.440
But even if I speak one sentence, when I begin to leave the sentence, I don't know yet how

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.920
it ends.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.200
So each sentence is a mystery and an adventure.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.360
EEM force.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.360
It's translational stuff.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.560
It sounds like, you know, people are talking in different languages, and I'm not sure that

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:18.480
I'm getting what everybody is saying, and maybe I'm just being redundant with my question.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.640
But I've been trying to think of this.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.600
Consciousness seems to be graded, you know, and so that when we have, you know, most of

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:31.920
the time we're running on a habitual mode.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:37.720
And then if we're doing some kind of pattern matching, and that pattern that we're being

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:44.080
exposed to doesn't fit what we're our expectations, in order to make safe predictions about the

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.080
future.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:53.920
And then suddenly we up the ante in terms of the amount of brain that we are synchronizing.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.560
It seems like that reward system, stuff like that is actually part of some kind of switch

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:11.040
that actually enhances the access or the prefrontal cortex to amplify a more granular approach

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:19.760
to a pattern matching that allows for more elementary particles to start to be recomposed

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.840
into a pattern that may be more fresh than UVO.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:33.280
And it is that in that, in this discussion of consciousness, you know, is about this

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:42.800
synchronization process and accessing a broader network that includes more self-awareness

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:50.920
so that we can get some sense of who we are in relationship to this thing that we're,

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.440
you know, which doesn't fit our expectations.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.280
And so we're doing that pattern optimization thing.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:05.360
And then that leads to utilizing a different pattern to drive our behavior.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.760
Does that make sense?

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.640
I think it does.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.920
It strikes me again a notion of hierarchy quite gracefully, it conveys all these issues.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:20.960
So Helmholtz's unconscious influence was right at the level of the visual cortex, and you're

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:21.960
not aware of that.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:29.320
As you say, we go around using our vision all the time, you talk about patterns, patterns

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.320
by definition are relationships amongst elements, therefore you're naturally invoking hierarchy.

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.440
You're talking about speech that has a temporal extent that an instant doesn't have.

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.200
Again, you're invoking a temporal hierarchy of separation and temporal scales.

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.640
I think nearly everything that everybody has said in some way speaks to the notion of

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:56.160
modeling upon modeling upon modeling in a hierarchical sense to give you a deep hierarchy.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:01.200
And for free, well not for free, but almost inevitably, again, this comes back to what

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.160
we understand by the physics of self-organization.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:12.840
The deeper, the more global, the more fiesque you get in the hierarchy, the greater the temporal

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:18.400
extent of your, of the things that are brought together or subsumed under the patterns.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:25.280
So a sentence or a narrative by definition is deep, deep, deep in the hierarchy that sees

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.520
all the stuff on the surface and in the deep past and possibly in the deep future.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.480
So I think that you can relax a lot of the distinction between unaware and unaware or

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.440
aware of being aware or aware of being aware of being aware of being aware and so on, within

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.080
a hierarchical, within a hierarchical sense of perspective.

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.080
Very expensive.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.640
So I think that we try to conserve our energies and we continue to use this habitual system

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:56.000
and then only when our predictions are not going to be met because there's not a good

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.440
fit with the current expectation, the current pattern that's being used.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.200
That's when we access this, the prefrontal cortex and then do this more granulosizing

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.920
and may even make a new assignment in terms of a new attractor net, you know, with a higher

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:20.560
node that instantiates a novel pattern that responds to this, this current situation that

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:27.800
we're in that didn't meet, you know, previous patterns.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:43.480
I am new into philosophy, so right now I'm very confused and divisible and I have a question

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.520
but it's more related to pansecism.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.760
I was reading that is the view that is consciousness, that everything has consciousness.

01:25:52.760 --> 01:26:00.320
So a person can show you that he's conscious, blinking their eyes, a dog can show you consciousness

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.960
rolling around but how a chair can show me consciousness.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.280
I don't understand that.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.920
Well, one of the issues with consciousness is it's very hard to know decisively whether

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.640
any other system is conscious.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.400
The flip side of that is very hard to know decisively that any other system is unconscious.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:24.800
The one really good case, as Diko mentioned, is with people because they can at least

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.480
tell us what they're conscious of and you can even raise questions about that but most

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.440
of us are happy to go along with that, verbal report when it's present.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.840
But when it's not present then we no longer have that materials for those materials for

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:40.840
inference.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:48.480
So monkeys and dogs and mice, well some people are prepared to say there's enough analogs

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.880
of what's present in humans to ascribe consciousness.

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.240
But as that disappears then we're left more in the dark.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.000
But that doesn't mean that, you might say, well in those cases we should say it's not

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.520
conscious once you get down to a bacteria or a virus or a quark.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.720
But I think that would be, you might say that's an overreaction.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:17.280
There's an absence of evidence for consciousness but there's not evidence of the absence of

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280
consciousness.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:21.040
We must separate those two things.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.680
You might say, well going in we should just say we're agnostic.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.200
So the question is two possibilities.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.440
The quark is conscious or it's not.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.560
Now you might say on antecedent grounds it's awfully unlikely that a quark should be conscious

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.040
and fair enough that's an intuition.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:41.360
But there are also philosophical systems that want to say that some precursor of consciousness

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:47.560
is present at this bottom level of reality and there are even scientific theories like

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.320
Chanones that tend to at least give some motivation for ascribing consciousness to simple systems.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:58.400
I think the basic answer is there's no direct evidence of consciousness in systems or a

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:01.400
long way from the paradigmatic human cases.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.520
At best we've got to work with, but there's likewise no direct evidence of unconsciousness.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:10.600
So we're left in this difficult philosophical situations of having to make indirect inferences

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.040
which may always remain somewhat speculative.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:28.320
Okay, so I might just be like a presumptuous undergrad student right here.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:37.640
So I'm affected all the time by people's consciousnesses all around the world in this

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:44.760
social consciousness because I have this social media and kind of connection to people

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:49.080
pass in this room or pass in my direct world.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:55.360
And so I'm kind of wondering is there that social consciousness is that different than

01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:01.280
what we've ever seen before because we have so much more connection than any time before.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.580
And then kind of past that we've talked a lot about consciousness in time and space.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:11.680
And if we do have that social consciousness is it outside of any sort of time and space

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.360
than we've ever worked in before especially because we can travel across time zones so

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.720
easily and then pass that with our mental time travel we can go into predicted future

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.240
and then also absolute archived past.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.560
And so we know through that.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:34.360
And so I'm kind of wondering how is that affecting the immediate research and what we're thinking

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.600
about versus our social consciousness.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.920
Tonight we're all going to time travel one hour into the future.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:46.920
So but does that mean that like we don't we don't kind of think about our new social

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:52.200
consciousness that I've kind of termed all of a sudden in a system of time and space

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:56.440
that we've ever thought about it before is that true or am I just kind of going too

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.440
far out there.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:11.240
It's funny because being a physicist I claim I own space and time and you are all visiting

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.840
me in space and time.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.800
But seriously it's an extremely interesting question.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:25.760
I mean I'm a multi-cell organism as you are and none of you cells as far as we know are

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.880
conscious but you have this different consciousness.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.520
So now we have this internet with billions of people being connected.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.480
Is there a kind of consciousness which we are not aware of?

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.120
It's an extremely interesting question and I don't have any answer.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120
Does anybody?

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120
This is a good question.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.120
Thank you.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.120
Yeah.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:58.040
So I noticed that there aren't any historians on this panel.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.040
Yes.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.040
Used to be.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:08.200
And so I won't infer any insult.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.240
I wonder if you think there's anything that the history of the neuroscience is or maybe

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.400
the history of ideas can offer to this conversation.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.400
Sure.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.400
I'll take that.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400
I used to be.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:22.640
I did a history in philosophy of science degree a long time ago.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.840
I think it does.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:31.760
There's a lot of very interesting rich information and in my field and the subfield of thinking

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.200
about thalmicortical mechanisms underlying consciousness.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:41.160
There's a lot that I learned from going back to work that was done in the 40s, 50s and

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160
60s.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.160
And into the 70s.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.960
Some of the work that was done there is very contemporary.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:52.320
It's just sort of been lost because of interesting historical shifts and how things were funded

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:55.880
through study sections and through grant applications.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.040
And there's quite a lot.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.640
And whenever you get into fields like physiology where the experiments are hard and there's

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:10.520
a lot of detail in them, there's always something to learn if you go back and read good experimental

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.920
work where all the details were taken down.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:18.520
So I mean I could fill that in with lots of examples but I think the answer is yes.

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:22.040
There are points in history where people were actually much more sophisticated about consciousness

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.040
in some respects than we are.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:29.400
I mean even the history of psychophysics, history of psychology in the mid-19th century

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:34.680
was really conceived as the study of consciousness and that was the primary data.

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:38.960
In many respects it was there was certain kinds of sophistication that have since been

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.800
lost in philosophy.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.560
Well there's the phenomenological tradition say from the early 20th century.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.800
I've been recently trying to, you know, talking a lot to people who study Buddhist philosophy

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:54.040
where there's a tradition of really meditating on consciousness from the inside.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:59.120
I think even if you don't take on board all the metaphysical or theoretical conclusions

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:03.120
that went along with these worldviews, we've a lot to learn by studying their methods for

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.160
gathering the data of consciousness from a subjective perspective.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.760
And I think there is a parallel in both physics and chemistry.

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:17.960
Physics started with the observation of the motion of the planets and the data from the

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.960
motion of the planets came from the Babylonians.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:25.960
And the Babylonians saw the planets as gods moving around and having a good time or a bad

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.360
time fighting each other.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:33.880
But then the Greeks took the data from the Babylonians and stripped off the mythological

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.840
they had their own mythology, the Babylonian mythology.

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.560
And they made the mathematical framework and that ultimately helped us to get science

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.560
of the ground.

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.400
There is in physics and in chemistry the alchemy, most of the alchemy books were absolutely

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.760
full of allegorical connections with this and that and the other thing.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:01.360
And then chemistry came from the distillation of the factual knowledge inside of all of

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.360
that.

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.080
So it would have been very difficult to start physics without the Babylonians.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.840
It would have been very difficult to start chemistry without using the alchemy database.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:16.000
And similarly I think if you don't use the Buddhist database at the very least and I

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:22.200
don't say that in this respect, I say that in complete respect for all the observations

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.680
that have been made and all the inferences, it would be a shame if we wouldn't use that

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:30.880
and it would be very different from the physics and chemistry history.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.120
That makes a lot of sense.

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:35.120
Hi.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.120
Hello.

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.120
Hi.

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.120
Firstly, thank you so much for your contributions today.

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:43.200
It was excellent.

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.240
My question is about beliefs.

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:53.240
So I was wondering if there are any new findings or exciting research on how our beliefs when

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:59.520
reinforced health firmer versus held more loosely, how, you know, what the relationship

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.760
with that is with the flow, the speed, the very nature of consciousness.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.520
Perhaps I can address that from the point of view, Bayesian beliefs.

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:21.920
So there's in the past decades, only two decades, there's a theme in neuroscience loosely summarized

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.640
as the Bayesian brain.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.520
Comes along in different guys' predictive processing or predictive coding.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:35.160
So the idea is that the brain is a statistical organ that's generating explanations for its

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:41.520
sensory imports according to Bayesian principles.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:47.240
And in that sense, that Bayesian framework does actually give you a formalism in which

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:54.040
you can write down and quantify beliefs, Bayesian beliefs that are probability distributions.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.480
And those ideas can be traced back to Helmholtz and unconscious inference and write back to

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:03.400
the students of Plato just getting a historical twist into the answer.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:11.520
So much of what I was saying in terms of inference and consciousness presupposes that the understanding

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:15.200
of the brain's function can be described at the level of beliefs.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.280
And what I meant by beliefs was simply probability distributions over fictive constructs that

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:25.120
explain the data that I am sampling from the world.

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:29.880
But there might be beliefs that are not as well formed as...

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.720
So we say the word belief and we have the belief that it's Saturday and that we're sitting

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720
in this room.

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.040
But presumably there's lots of other kinds of beliefs that would fit this model that don't

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:44.120
have that strict kind of formal, articulate, transferable structure.

01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:48.920
Just thinking about the beliefs, the proto beliefs that an infant might have or an animal,

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:54.920
tacit beliefs that sort of work to sort of form and structure our behavior but that we

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:59.720
never entertain consciously but they still have some, they might still have shared this

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.720
kind of Bayesian structure.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.600
So there's also the question that the philosopher always asks is like, what do you mean by belief

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:12.600
and then there's these different kinds and they might all fit into the sort of topic

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:18.040
of consciousness but they all might also play different roles.

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:26.160
Thank you.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:35.720
I wanted to contribute something to the different states of consciousness as a self-report and

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.120
have you respond to it.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:43.040
At 14 I had a concussion playing football.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:53.360
I was aware of events immediately after the concussion and then out of awareness for an

01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:59.080
extended period of time then back in awareness.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:08.440
About eight years ago I had an experience of transient amnesia which is fairly common

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:13.720
to football players as they age.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:21.000
During the period of transient amnesia I talked the EMS squad out of taking me to the

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.200
hospital and have no memory of it.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.800
I was driven to Long Island Jewish Hospital.

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.360
I recognized the road to the hospital.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.880
I was then out of awareness for about 18 hours.

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:48.760
I came to arguing with a psychiatrist that they weren't doing anything for me.

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:58.160
At which point I was fully aware and quite angry at the hospital that nobody was paying

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:09.160
attention to me which apparently I was aware of though I wasn't aware of.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:15.080
During this period I experienced and I had to have you react to it.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:22.640
Different states of awareness that were both physical and implied a great deal about memory

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:32.480
because when I came back to myself as I say it I was aware of who I was.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:40.760
In the other states though I was reactive to the environment and reactive to other people

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:47.760
I wasn't aware of who I am which implies a different state of consciousness involving

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:56.760
some self-awareness and memory or identity which I didn't hear expressed here at all.

01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:01.760
That we have in consciousness a sense of identity.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:09.600
I'm sure we both have comments on this because I've been on the other side of your experience

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.240
interacting with people having transient global amnesia.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.920
I took it in.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.560
I took it one more step which I'd like to give you.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.040
I've had a brain scan.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.840
I've had an EEG scan.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.400
I had a brain scan for medical reasons not associated with the original concussion.

01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:36.120
I followed this stuff on the NFL and high school football injuries very closely.

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:42.760
When I had the amnesia I contacted the people doing the NFL studies when I found out that

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:49.560
all players after 65 have these transient amnesia states.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:58.600
But I also had an EEG recently which in fact might have showed me the area that was originally

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:05.400
damaged in the concussion and the compensations if it is to be believed.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:10.920
The question I have is about identity being part of consciousness.

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:16.120
I'll start because I think you'll have more to say about this.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.280
I've been on the other side of this talking to people.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.280
I obviously wasn't there talking to you.

01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:28.720
With global amnesia you may not know a lot of things.

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.960
There may be aspects of your autobiographical memory.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.040
Certainly where you are and why you are there goes away.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:37.160
But you can be very conscious.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:42.480
It is a question of what you can access in memory and what you remember about what happened.

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:46.960
And I think there are all these different memory systems and perhaps more labored ads

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.440
will follow.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:54.560
But I suspect that it's just another example of how you can take components out of the

01:41:54.560 --> 01:42:00.680
integrated experience of normative consciousness and remove them but still have very much a

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.360
conscious mental state.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.960
That's why it's highly multivariate when you start looking at what normal consciousness

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:10.960
provides you with in terms of awareness.

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.640
Because if you are trained to observe certain things you are aware of some things that other

01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:20.160
people aren't trained to listen to music or look at a picture or pick up on nuances

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.000
of facial expressions aren't aware of.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.680
That's sort of a small version of the larger theme.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.400
If you start losing parts of your memory or types of your memory things are very weird.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.240
If you go under anesthesia and you are given an amnestic you will talk to the surgeons

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240
and you will be fine.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:42.400
You won't remember any of that discourse or any of that period.

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.080
But you haven't actually lost a component of your memory.

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:50.360
You just had something that sets you up to wipe out the memory trace for later.

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:53.360
There are a lot of games you can play.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.080
So you're right the fact that you remember nothing after that anesthesia doesn't mean

01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:00.480
you weren't fully aware at that moment.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:04.840
I think it's interesting the other point you made about these separate components.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:11.200
Of course our own awareness a really important part is our self-consciousness and our complex

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.920
concepts that brings in.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:17.960
But you can put that aside and we could take language and put that aside and still have

01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:23.360
a quite rich subjective experience to try to understand.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.120
So these are in a sense optional parts.

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:31.080
There may be very interesting parts to examine and important parts.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:34.640
But we can also study consciousness with those aside and try to understand them.

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:37.080
So there are many studies of amnesia.

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:41.960
Some with chronic amnesia where you can see that people can't lay down memories of their

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.480
experiences.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.960
But they seem to be quite with it in the moment.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:51.520
So it's possible to be fully conscious and not lay down memories.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.600
So that doesn't mean your consciousness was completely distorted but different in some

01:43:57.600 --> 01:43:58.800
very interesting ways.

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.160
And your observation I think is extremely interesting and is listening very carefully

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:11.040
to kind of what you experience the continuity of your assessment of the neglect in the

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.960
ER which is a very common theme.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.520
I'm sure everybody's experienced that in the modern day.

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:23.040
And then, you know, so that's the clue that there was something that was kind of gradually

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:26.720
making its way back and had continuity between the two states for you.

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:27.720
And that's also interesting.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.320
And maybe it's because it has a limbic balance.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:40.160
And this is that I heard the discussion of consciousness without the concept of identity.

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:49.040
But is there a sense of oneself and consciousness or is there periods of time in which I was

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.720
reactive to the environment?

01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:59.840
I argued to not be taken to the hospital, though I should have been taken to the hospital.

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.000
But I have no awareness of it.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.160
Would the concept of self or identity be implicit in this?

01:45:09.160 --> 01:45:11.720
Some ways in the idea of consciousness.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:17.120
People often distinguish consciousness, primary consciousness, consciousness of the world

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.920
from self-consciousness.

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:25.960
I would think of self-consciousness as one variety of consciousness and especially important

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.920
variety, but certainly not as exhausting all of consciousness.

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:36.920
And it might even be on this view that, for example, a dog or a mouse might have primary

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:42.120
consciousness without consciousness of itself.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:49.040
And one take on what was happening in your situation is that there was consciousness of

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:53.560
the world without a whole lot of self-consciousness, of consciousness of your identity.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:54.560
I'm not sure.

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.560
That's the right diagnosis.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:00.080
It could be that you had some consciousness of yourself and you weren't laying down memories.

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.160
But there are good examples of this.

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:06.880
So there are developmental stages where self-consciousness becomes more evident and easy

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:07.800
to measure.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:14.800
And then in other types of brain injury, there are slower, more slowly evolving recoveries

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.440
of self-awareness as a stage of recovery.

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.880
So you can dissociate these things.

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.320
And there are people who have studied this very precisely.

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.240
There are two selves to talk about, too.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.200
There's the sort of self that seems connected to experience, even if it's a very kind of

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:37.360
loose sense of identity just in an instant or a kind of self-identity that persists over

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.160
time for which we experience it as relatively continuous.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:46.120
But when you have an injury or you black out, then you sort of, there's a discontinuous

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:47.560
personal identity over time.

01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:53.720
So then there are philosophers who do think that any experience of consciousness sort

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.160
of has to have that at center of gravity, a self.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:00.160
And then there are others who don't.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:09.120
I wanted to bring up an aspect of consciousness that seems pretty important to me, but I don't

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:15.160
think anyone's really raised this, but the moral implications of consciousness.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:20.440
I mean, I think all of us think that it's probably wrong to hurt other human beings,

01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:25.480
but it's probably not wrong maybe to pull the plug on someone who's already like in a

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:31.040
maybe comatose state or something, but then many people believe because animals have

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.440
some little consciousness, it's wrong to torture them or harm them.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.920
But then if we think that maybe consciousness has something to do with the integration of

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:47.480
information, then should we worry about things like unplugging the internet or if somebody

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:53.720
develops an artificial intelligence, if we're not sure if it's conscious, should we give

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.000
things the benefit of it out or what's your attitude about that?

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.960
That's a good question.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.920
If you start becoming sympathetic to panpsychism, there's some consciousness everywhere, then

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:05.440
you really have to worry.

01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:11.560
I mean, some people think they shouldn't eat anything, which is conscious, but well,

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.560
maybe we're going to have to draw the line somewhere else if consciousness is very extensive.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.360
I mean, that kind of, you know, there is this intuition that consciousness is what matters

01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:25.440
because morally, but as you start thinking about degrees of consciousness getting lower

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:31.840
and lower, I mean, simpler and simpler systems, you also start to think about matters might

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.720
be the kind of consciousness.

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:37.200
Maybe there are kinds of consciousness that matter more than others, you know, suffering,

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:43.320
for example, my carrier, the special moral way to maybe beings with the capacity for

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.720
a conscious thought and reflection that carries a lot more weight than beings with simply

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.800
the capacity to sense hot and cold.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.400
I do agree with you that consciousness is the ultimate ground, I think, of our moral

01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.440
concern for other beings.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:01.560
So that's got to be somehow where it starts, but you know, exactly what kinds of consciousness

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.560
matter.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:09.400
And with respect to human consciousness, that's how most of the law and most of the moral

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:18.240
intuitions have evolved around whether, so the, you know, the, on the medical ethics side,

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:22.320
the negative right to withhold medical treatment or have medical with treatment withheld was

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:28.280
founded on the lack of a potential for recovery of cognition and consciousness.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:34.160
And I think, you know, what's evolving now is, of course, as we understand the recovery

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.040
of consciousness and the variations of potential, then there's a lot of questions about how

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.200
we, how we start to look at the opportunities that are for people to become more conscious

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:47.200
and the moral obligations to them to become more conscious.

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:53.200
My colleague Joseph Fins is a book coming out in July called Rights Come to Mind, which

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.360
is a full exploration of these issues, lived through the experience of people taking care

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.240
of patients with disorders of consciousness.

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:08.240
And you know, most of these issues are unsolved in our system from a legal and a medical point

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:09.240
of view.

01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:14.120
So it's, you know, I think you're right to pinpoint consciousness as the, as David said,

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:21.280
just the core, you know, issue around moral warrants and, you know, getting into this

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:22.280
space.

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:23.280
Thank you.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.280
Great conversation this afternoon.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:35.600
Wondering if whether you think it's accurate to grade consciousness from an external perspective,

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:42.000
when consciousness is such an internal experience, i.e. the quality of experience, this whether

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.480
you're a human animal, non-human animal, or an individual who experiences a cognitive

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:53.840
disability question, has research been able to determine a consistent experience of consciousness

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.280
between those with and without cognitive dysfunction?

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:05.040
And if so, what does this imply in terms of the ability to provide a universally accepted

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:08.800
definition of consciousness, except in the most general sense?

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:15.040
Of course, we could use neurons, for example, to explain consciousness, but only in the

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.280
most rudimentary sense of what consciousness is.

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.440
I would say research has not provided a clear and distinct set of measurements to categorize

01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:25.440
things that way.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.440
It might want to go.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:36.440
Well, so we do our best if you're asking a person to make a decision, we understand that

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:40.440
someone with dementia may not be capable of making a good decision.

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:47.120
They're legal precedents for how to deal with those situations and form consent and so forth.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:50.440
So we have some operational ways to proceed.

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:53.920
That's the behavior and sort of speech acts.

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.400
I was thinking in terms of measurement.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400
That's what I'm thinking.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.640
I'm thinking in terms of measurement, too, or an outside evaluation of what it has to

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.640
do.

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:08.160
I think a lot of questions circulate around the issues of experiencing a disability and how

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:16.640
we rate an individual and who does not experience this life in the same way we think they should

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.800
experience that life and from our own perspective.

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:29.520
And even the idea of dogs and babies and this kind of hierarchy that we are kind of creating

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:35.240
a definition of consciousness and what's of great value and perhaps what is a lesser

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:41.800
human experience if we put in the realm of just the human experience.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:46.920
There are some really interesting studies of consciousness in schizophrenic patients compared

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:51.560
to in normal patients using a beeper methodology.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:59.440
They get people to carry around beepers that go off at a certain point during the day and

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:02.960
at that point patients are asked to write down in their logbook what were you conscious

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.960
of at that moment when the beeper went off.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:13.360
And it's extremely interesting even for normal patients but Russ Holbert who's pioneered

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.440
this method has done it with schizophrenic patients as well and has found certain really

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:25.320
clear systematic differences between the consciousness in these patients and in ordinary unimpaired

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.360
subjects.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:32.720
This is in a way it's a methodology to take something external, the beeper and the records

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.880
in a logbook, numberless use it as a guide to what's going on internally.

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.360
Thank you.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:48.400
My understanding is we have sensory perceptions.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:55.680
All right we have eyes, we can see things to varying degrees and we have hearing which

01:53:55.680 --> 01:54:03.480
we use to communicate and that I think does affect our consciousness.

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:11.720
So the question is then is what about someone like say Helen Keller who was born both deaf

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.960
and blind.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:24.720
So what can we say about her awareness or her experience, her consciousness of the world

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:31.960
since she has lacked these two different perceptions or these two sensory perceptions?

01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:36.440
That's a great example and actually it's one that got my interest a long time but the

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.520
best way to find out is to read her perceptions of it.

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:46.960
And so there's a fabulous account of her early years before Anne Macey Sullivan was her teacher

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:52.080
who came to work with her and to establish her ability to communicate and to start to

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:55.400
learn and she describes herself.

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:58.400
She actually doesn't, it's very interesting, she doesn't even describe herself with her

01:54:58.400 --> 01:54:59.600
own name.

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:07.120
She calls herself phantom and her memories of being pre-cognitive.

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:15.080
She describes them as being reactive to an external world that just she had experiences

01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:21.480
with and most of them were limbic and she just, her memory is thrashing out at things coming

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.440
into her peripersonal space effectively.

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:29.200
And there's a small section in the book teacher that she wrote where she talks about this.

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:34.800
But you know, you get the sense there's something primitive, you know, awareness but it was

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.720
very unstructured.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.960
It wasn't structured by language, it wasn't structured by concept and it wasn't very much

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:44.280
fun for sure.

01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.480
But then you get the sense that by the time that she's an adult and you know she's giving

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:57.240
lectures at Harvard and she's a fully educated woman, she has a very full normal human consciousness

01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:04.160
with a very unique perspective, you know, everybody has an identity but it's not as alien as a

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:09.240
conscious state as what she describes herself as before.

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:11.400
She had some way of connecting with the human community.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.560
It's very interesting but I think that's the place to go look is what she had to say about

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:18.560
herself.

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:26.680
Thank you for this discussion.

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.760
One sees how many complex aspects they are to consciousness and I'm going to speak now

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:38.800
as an artist where the idea of consciousness is since at least the middle of the 20th century

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:46.000
very complicated because a whole series of determinology came about automatic writing.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.680
You ask an artist what did you mean when you did this and they said I don't know I was

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:57.920
unconscious and one realizes now that that word no longer is valid even for an artist

01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:02.720
to say they were unconscious because there are so many layers as we can see as we're

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:05.000
speaking about what consciousness is.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.400
So if an artist says I don't know what I was doing we know that they were very conscious

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:14.760
on many different planes and levels and so I'm sort of interested in the idea of people

01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:20.800
speaking about conscious and unconscious and automatic writing or things that are how do

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.320
you see the connective points that way.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:33.720
You see it now as one uniform level of consciousness with many facets and planes.

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:44.360
Well, so my brother is an artist and he considers his painting to be very intuitive style so

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:50.480
he has a lot of expertise in the media he uses but he goes after a process that happens

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:58.240
on the canvas and he considers it very intuitive so I consider that part of implicit memory

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:07.120
and part of his mental capacity is to do that without designing it as an explicit painting

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:09.080
that he is conceiving it.

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.320
It's a process that unfolds so is that connected with what you're saying.

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.800
Well, there's another word intuitive.

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:17.120
Do we have to redefine intuitive?

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:21.640
I mean, in other words, I think there are redefinitions that become necessary because they

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:26.800
once were put into categories and I see it as a more fluid aspect.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:33.560
You know, without all these divisions that characterize what's rational, what's irrational,

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:35.560
what's spontaneous.

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.880
Well, you know, we have all these divisions because that's how we try to understand things

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:43.640
in science and we divide them up and then we try to understand how they fit together and

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:44.640
how they interact.

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:49.920
Yes, it's very fluid but we take some steps to divide them up because that's how we're

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:55.760
going to understand the parts and then put them back together.

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:04.760
So, a very selfish question.

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:12.200
What are the easy problems of consciousness or to be more concrete, I guess, what are

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:15.960
you telling your graduate students to do?

01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:23.360
Well, back in the original article I wrote on the heart of the easy problems of consciousness

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:29.720
20 years ago, the easy problems of consciousness were basically ones about behavior and functioning.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:36.040
So how does the brain perceptually respond to a certain stimuli?

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:42.120
How, for example, can we be made to control our behavior in a way that depends on what

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:43.120
it's out there?

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:47.400
How does the brain monitor its own processes and issue verbal reports?

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:52.360
Basically, the easy problems on this definition, the ones all about objective functioning,

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:55.000
the kind that can easily be measured from the outside.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.720
Whereas the hard problem is about how does all that stuff give you subjective experience?

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:03.080
And for the most part, I take it when the neuroscientists are giving their graduate student

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:09.200
problems, they're very often at least about those easy problems, explaining the responses,

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:10.880
the behaviors and so on.

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:14.480
Another class of easy problems though is finding, quote, easy problems because none of these

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:21.520
are really easy, is the correlation issue, finding the brain process that goes along

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:23.960
with certain kinds of subjective experience.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:29.400
And that's something which is also being proven to be a subject where you can make tractable,

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.040
incremental progress in the lab year over year.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.680
But then there's a whole hierarchy of tractable, more and less tractable problems, so maybe

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.120
other people can throw in there.

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:42.440
You never give any hard problem to a student?

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.680
In philosophy all the time.

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:45.920
It's only hard problems in philosophy.

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:48.280
That's a way to do that.

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.640
So philosophers can do the hard problem and the scientists will chip away at it by working

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:53.640
on the easy problems.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:54.640
Yeah.

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:55.640
Thanks for your question.

02:00:55.640 --> 02:01:04.120
I mean, a lot of you have been talking about the fact that when we are conscious, we have

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:09.480
a feeling inside that we have an experience inside and then we use other metaphor to be

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:14.720
a conscious, like to be in an inner world or to be intrinsic or whatever.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:17.080
So my question is inside what?

02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:21.680
Because if we say that conscious experience is inside the mind, it's kind of circular

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:27.880
definition because just the thing, so it cannot be literally inside the head.

02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.560
We do not expect to find consciousness like we find sugar in the blood.

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:35.000
So I just wanted to ask, inside what?

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.440
Well, something we haven't really talked at all about, which I guess we'll wait until

02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:46.640
the last minute to throw it out there, is that consciousness is, as far as we know, embodied.

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:52.280
When I stub my toe, I feel pain in my toe, not in my brain, and I don't feel it in the

02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:54.680
rock that I stubbed my toe against.

02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:00.960
There seems to be this deep interface of consciousness that blends into the body, even though we've

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:03.040
been talking about it being situated in the brain.

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:06.200
And so when you ask the question, we've been talking about consciousness being inside

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.320
what?

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.800
The first thing I think of is it's inside the body.

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:12.960
And that gets us out of that immediate circularity.

02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:16.160
And then you can say, well, what is the consciousness, the embodied consciousness inside of?

02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:17.960
And then that's a different question.

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:18.960
Yeah.

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:24.000
Just to follow up, when I feel that pain in my toe, it's in my body.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.360
But when I see the sound, is consciousness embodied in the sand, too, for the same reason?

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:34.720
When I'm driving my car on the road, I think I'm filling that consciousness in the car

02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:37.040
and filling the wheels of the road directly.

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:39.600
It's like the person with the cane.

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.040
So the body doesn't, the body is at least something which is very flexible here.

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.800
The boundary is very flexible.

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:49.000
If you have the right relation to the tool, then you feel the person with the cane feels

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.440
the strike of the ground, not in their hand, but in the tip of the tool.

02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.040
I totally feel a lot of my consciousness in the self-love.

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.040
Your tacit memory.

02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:04.560
The difference in you would be the last question.

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.480
Hi.

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:16.560
We briefly had a conversation about the morality of consciousness.

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:24.120
And I'm a moral nihilist.

02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:34.240
I was wondering, and that is that you don't inherently believe that there are any reasons

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.800
to make moral judgments on anything.

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:43.920
And so I was wondering if we're trying to make or if we're trying to contrive these moral

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:50.040
judgments about consciousness, are we just choosing to ignore that it's a very real

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.240
possibility that we live in a moral reality?

02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:00.280
Well, that sounds like a philosophy question.

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:04.400
Well, who's to know where morality comes from?

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.640
Maybe there's no absolute fundamental morality in the universe.

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:12.200
If you go that way, you can say at the very least what we have is something like moral

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.800
preferences, there are some outcomes that we prefer to other ones on reflection and moral

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.800
respects.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.160
Maybe there's no deep absolute grounding for that as if it came from a God.

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:25.320
Maybe all there is is what we've been evolutionarily programmed with.

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:31.920
We can still make the distinction between the outcomes that we want, that we think are better

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.160
morally for society and for other people on reflection.

02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:41.240
And it's going to turn into a question about our fundamental values, which may be contingent

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:46.040
and biological, but we can still make these distinctions.

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:52.200
And it could well be that, well, here's the thing which is what we contingently value,

02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:53.200
consciousness.

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.120
That's the thing which makes our lives worth living.

02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.840
And we all have a great preference for being conscious and that we care about the consciousness

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:02.680
of other people around us.

02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:07.120
I'd like to think that even a moral nihilist in some ways could recast some of these questions

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:12.800
in terms of what we value and what we prefer.

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.600
Thank you.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:22.360
I'm a clinical neurologist, one time I was interested in brain evolution.

02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:29.040
And I learned that there were four basic stages of vertebrate brain evolution.

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:35.720
The most primitive is the fish brain and the reptile brain and the paleo and neo mammalian

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.160
brains.

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:44.240
And in my clinical neurology experience, I also have had the experience of patients

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:50.240
presenting with acute stroke syndromes, which are rare, but that affect the midbrain reticular

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:53.480
formation, which is part of the fish brain.

02:05:53.480 --> 02:06:00.520
And if a part of the brain that controls a certain function in humans exists in other

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:08.360
animals and causes alterations of consciousness, would it be reasonable to assume that a fish

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:13.800
is conscious if it shares that structure?

02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:14.800
Yes.

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:24.080
It turns out there are some structures that fish share with us and some that they don't.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:27.960
They actually read a debate in the journal Fish and Fisheries about whether fish feel

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:34.080
pain and one person was saying, yes, fish feel pain because they have this element of pain

02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:36.880
processing and the other one was saying, no, they don't because they don't have this

02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:38.320
element of pain processing.

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:43.000
So it just pushes the question back, which is the thing in the brain that matters?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Yeah.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:52.640
Well, another point about meditation, experience of people with mastered meditation, you know,

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:59.520
each methods of really turning off the more recent brain structures and getting into a

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:10.000
state which is really like focusing on breathing and getting into your brain stem, I guess.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.080
It's not so clear though.

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:15.280
If you look at the data, it's actually very interesting.

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:18.800
The states that experience meditators get into are high energy states.

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:27.640
The dynamics are different, but they resemble more wafer brain activity than they resemble

02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.200
comatose brain activity.

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:36.360
So again, it's another one of these examples where we don't have a great idea about how

02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:40.840
to go from what is a conscious brain state that's a little different than your wafer

02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:47.600
state and its dynamics to where consciousness is and that and what the changes and the representational

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:54.600
aspects of it are because we never model it.
