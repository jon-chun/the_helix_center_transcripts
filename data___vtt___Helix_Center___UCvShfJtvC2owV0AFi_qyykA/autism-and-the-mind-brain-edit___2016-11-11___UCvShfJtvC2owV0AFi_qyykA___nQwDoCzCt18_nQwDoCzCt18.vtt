WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
I'm Ed Nursecien, Director of the Helix Center.

00:03.840 --> 00:07.040
Today's program is on autism.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.200
And the participants are Andrew Gerber,

00:10.200 --> 00:11.720
could you raise?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.720
Andrew Gerber, who's Medical Director

00:13.720 --> 00:18.880
and CEO of Austin Rake Center and Associate Clinical Professor

00:18.880 --> 00:21.760
at the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry

00:21.760 --> 00:24.520
at Columbia University.

00:24.520 --> 00:30.120
The new sheen, Haji Kani, is Associate Professor of Radiology

00:30.120 --> 00:32.680
at Harvard University.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.280
And she does research at the Martino Center

00:35.280 --> 00:41.320
for Biomedical Imaging and directs the Neurolimbic Laboratory.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.040
Craig Neuschafur is sitting there.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.200
He's Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics

00:48.200 --> 00:50.920
at the Drexel School of Public Health.

00:50.920 --> 00:55.240
He's the founding director of the AJ Autism Institute

00:55.240 --> 00:57.920
at the Drexel University.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.520
Jeremy Vistra van der Wig, sitting here

01:02.520 --> 01:07.600
is the Mortimer D. Sackler, Mortimer D. Sackler,

01:07.600 --> 01:10.560
Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.680
He's a child and adolescent psychiatrist

01:12.680 --> 01:16.280
who uses molecular and transitional neuroscience research

01:16.280 --> 01:20.000
tools and applies them to find new treatments for autism

01:20.000 --> 01:23.360
and other genetic disorders.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.160
Martha Welsh is Associate Professor of Psychiatry

01:28.160 --> 01:30.840
at the Department of Pediatrics and Pathology

01:30.840 --> 01:33.240
and Cell Biology at Columbia University.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.360
She's the Director of the Nurture Science Program

01:36.360 --> 01:40.720
in Pediatrics and Director of the Brain God Initiative

01:40.720 --> 01:43.520
in Developmental Neuroscience.

01:43.520 --> 01:50.520
Thank you.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.520
The form that he's who wants to start starts.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.520
Oh, cool.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
Hey Andrew.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
No.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.520
I was flattered to be invited because Dr. Versesian

02:06.520 --> 02:10.520
is a former supervisor of mine and I was trained in Cornell.

02:10.520 --> 02:16.120
And one of the things that I've always loved about this field,

02:16.120 --> 02:18.400
an autism seems to me an example of that,

02:18.400 --> 02:23.080
is how science, basic science and clinical science

02:23.080 --> 02:26.440
and the art of being a clinician all come together.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.600
So I think we're all some combination of those things

02:30.600 --> 02:34.440
here which makes it interesting not things all of all.

02:34.440 --> 02:42.440
So maybe I'll help out a bit in the beginning.

02:42.440 --> 02:48.440
When I was in residency training, we had, I think, one course,

02:48.440 --> 02:51.440
maybe it was two hours on autism.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.440
This is early 70s.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.440
And now autism is a very big subject.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.440
So maybe we could start by you telling me and telling everyone

03:01.440 --> 03:02.440
what happened.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.440
OK, I could start in the 70s.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
OK.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.440
Probably the only one here other than you.

03:09.440 --> 03:15.440
In the 70s, I began my training in child psychiatry.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.440
And we were studying ethology.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.440
Jane Goodall's chimps in Tinbergen.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.440
I learned from Goodall that high nurture mothers raised

03:25.440 --> 03:28.440
the most successful chimps.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.520
And I learned from Tinbergen that animals and conflicts showed

03:32.520 --> 03:35.720
equal portions of approach and avoidance behaviors

03:35.720 --> 03:39.720
when they were feeling threatened or in conflict of any kind.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.120
So I'm putting it when I entered an autism nursery.

03:44.120 --> 03:48.400
And by the way, I had never seen autistic children

03:48.400 --> 03:51.600
till medical school wasn't common way to do so.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.200
And so I went in there and I said,

03:55.200 --> 03:59.680
oh, why did they send me into this nursery to treat children

03:59.680 --> 04:01.240
when there's no treatment for this

04:01.240 --> 04:04.680
and is supposed to be a hopeless neurological disorder?

04:04.680 --> 04:08.880
But then I started thinking, I'm seeing

04:08.880 --> 04:11.960
approach avoidance behavior.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.320
High nurture could eliminate avoidance behavior

04:15.320 --> 04:17.760
and turn it into approach behavior.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.440
And I set out to test that.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.840
And that was accounted for about 25 years of my practice.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.160
I started a nonprofit for that and teamed up

04:27.160 --> 04:29.840
with Nico Tinbergen.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.280
In the meantime, got the Nobel Prize for his work.

04:33.280 --> 04:39.400
And I saw that I wasn't making any progress with my ideas

04:39.400 --> 04:43.400
because, indeed, high nurture did overcome avoidance behavior

04:43.400 --> 04:45.960
and autistic children and liberated them

04:45.960 --> 04:47.840
for normal development.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.720
So this was a big piece of information.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.640
Then I started treating orphans from the world's orphanages

04:55.640 --> 04:59.040
who also couldn't accept nurture and use it for development

04:59.040 --> 05:00.920
in a normal way.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.960
And I found out when the high nurture and dimension

05:03.960 --> 05:09.680
got both groups on a normal path of development

05:09.680 --> 05:14.320
and cured what they both had in common gut problems

05:14.320 --> 05:17.200
that, ah, peptides of nurture.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.520
So I left my dear practice, went to Columbia

05:20.520 --> 05:22.960
to investigate peptides of nurture.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.800
Of course, people thought I was nuts.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.080
What did the gut have to do with autism?

05:27.080 --> 05:31.320
Now we know it's a very big problem in autistic children.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.400
And they stopped laughing at me when

05:33.400 --> 05:36.720
I got a patent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel

05:36.720 --> 05:37.480
disease.

05:37.480 --> 05:41.280
In the meantime, I was trying to study

05:41.280 --> 05:42.840
what exactly was happening.

05:42.840 --> 05:46.200
And we've been looking at the biological

05:46.200 --> 05:51.400
undependents of nurture as well as what's happening in actual patients.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.720
And we just completed a randomized control trial

05:54.720 --> 06:00.120
using my theory of autonomic co-conditioning.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.520
The difference between me and most of psychiatry

06:02.520 --> 06:05.920
is psychiatrists aimed at helping children, even babies,

06:05.920 --> 06:07.160
to self-regulate.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.040
That's the big goal.

06:09.040 --> 06:09.680
No.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.680
It's a misunderstanding of mammalian biology

06:12.680 --> 06:17.440
co-regulation at the autonomic level, get the mother and the baby

06:17.440 --> 06:20.880
to co-regulate a man that liberates the brain

06:20.880 --> 06:22.280
for normal development.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.800
And indeed, what I found in these autistic children

06:25.800 --> 06:30.040
then was normal development and not even normal superior.

06:30.040 --> 06:34.080
So at my nurture science program, we're

06:34.080 --> 06:35.640
moving up the age range.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.680
Now we've done two to four-year-olds, the same kinds of results.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.760
And interestingly, in our preemie group,

06:42.760 --> 06:47.800
there's a high risk of autism and premature infants.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.880
And just on the autism screen 18 months,

06:50.880 --> 06:55.400
we've reduced it from one out of four to one out of 10 testing positive.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.000
So it's very exciting.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.120
And other people are finding, yes, some of these children

07:00.120 --> 07:03.320
can be set on a normal path of development.

07:03.320 --> 07:08.160
So that's what's happened since 1970.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.320
And what do you think?

07:10.320 --> 07:11.280
No, that's very interesting.

07:11.280 --> 07:16.360
But you say, I'm coming from, I was trained in Switzerland

07:16.360 --> 07:19.080
and in the French-speaking Switzerland.

07:19.080 --> 07:26.920
So there we learn that autism is a psychiatric disease

07:26.920 --> 07:30.520
that is inflicted by bad mothers to the kids.

07:30.520 --> 07:35.600
And it's crazy that it is still like that today

07:35.600 --> 07:40.360
and that people are still, I mean, I had parents coming to,

07:40.360 --> 07:44.760
because at some point I was doing research both in Switzerland and here.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.640
And in Switzerland, I had parents coming to my office

07:47.640 --> 07:52.880
and telling me horror stories of, first of all, they would not diagnose

07:52.880 --> 07:56.160
their child because you don't want to label a child.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.240
And then when eventually they got a diagnosis and a dialogue,

08:00.240 --> 08:03.520
the question was, did you really desire this child?

08:03.520 --> 08:05.320
And then he was going on and on.

08:05.320 --> 08:10.560
And I think it's important that we today hear in this place,

08:10.560 --> 08:14.320
which is the Psychonality Institute, we state high and loud

08:14.320 --> 08:18.560
that bad mothering has nothing to do with autism

08:18.560 --> 08:23.440
and that it's neurodevelopment disorder that has to do with a brain

08:23.440 --> 08:28.120
that is not developing normally for many different reasons.

08:28.120 --> 08:32.000
No matter what the cause is, it doesn't mean that it can't be overcome.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.720
Absolutely.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.480
I totally agree with most of the identified causes,

08:36.480 --> 08:40.080
underlying cause of autism, are on stress pathways.

08:40.080 --> 08:45.640
And so an anti-stress modality has a good chance to intervene.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.640
But no, mother shouldn't be blamed at all.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.240
And in fact, she's powerful, powerful.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.560
And my insights about the gut in autism came from treating many,

08:54.560 --> 08:57.120
many children from Paris with autism.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.120
So I think I can't comment on the 70s.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.120
I guess I was alive then.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.120
I don't remember much of it.

09:06.120 --> 09:11.120
But I first started working in a lab,

09:11.120 --> 09:17.120
working with the child psychiatrist in 1994 or so.

09:17.120 --> 09:22.120
And at that point, we were still talking about autism as something in 10,000,

09:22.120 --> 09:26.120
which is quite different from the way we describe numbers.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.120
And that's changed quite a lot.

09:28.120 --> 09:34.120
I think there also is a fairly radical shift in terms of societal awareness

09:34.120 --> 09:38.120
and how much conversation happens around autism.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.120
I think that they're also even prior to the 90s has been a shift

09:42.120 --> 09:47.120
from thinking about this as a psychological disorder to thinking about this

09:47.120 --> 09:51.120
as a brain disorder, something that is happening.

09:51.120 --> 09:56.120
I think over the course of this discussion,

09:56.120 --> 09:59.120
we can talk about what that might mean or not mean.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.120
But from my perspective, that increase to a large extent

10:03.120 --> 10:08.120
is about learning to see something that we didn't see before.

10:08.120 --> 10:15.120
In some way, being in this place, it's like before Freud described the unconscious.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.120
That seemed like such a foreign concept.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.120
And once you hear it, like, oh, yeah, of course.

10:20.120 --> 10:26.120
And I think in a lot of ways, that's the experience now for clinicians, certainly,

10:26.120 --> 10:30.120
but I think for a broader society around autism, particularly milder kids

10:30.120 --> 10:34.120
with autism spectrum disorder, where they wouldn't have been seen before.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.120
So when I was in elementary school, we certainly had a child in my class

10:38.120 --> 10:41.120
who had what we would describe now as autism spectrum disorder.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.120
How was that treated? Essentially, she was picked on.

10:44.120 --> 10:48.120
And that was about it, at least from what I know.

10:48.120 --> 10:52.120
And that probably wouldn't happen today.

10:52.120 --> 10:56.120
Today, we would have a way to describe what she was dealing with.

10:56.120 --> 11:02.120
So I think that's most of the increase in terms of awareness,

11:02.120 --> 11:05.120
seeing something we didn't use to see.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.120
I think that there is also likely a real increase,

11:09.120 --> 11:14.120
but it's really hard to measure and to know whether that represents something

11:14.120 --> 11:18.120
beyond better screening, better awareness, different diagnostic tools,

11:18.120 --> 11:20.120
different diagnostic criteria.

11:20.120 --> 11:25.120
But there are risk factors that we know about that have certainly increased in society.

11:25.120 --> 11:31.120
And I think it's reasonable to expect that there is an increase we would measure

11:31.120 --> 11:38.120
if we use the same methods that we apply today back in 1970 or 1940, whatever.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.120
What was hard for you?

11:42.120 --> 11:46.120
So, yeah, I think we have other folks who can talk more about it.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.120
But there are robust ones. Go ahead.

11:48.120 --> 11:54.120
Well, in fact, if we talk a little bit more about the prevalence trend

11:54.120 --> 11:59.120
and the increase that we observe, I think that, you know,

11:59.120 --> 12:04.120
obviously what's root, what's driving the attention in society around autism

12:04.120 --> 12:07.120
is this awareness that it's much more common than we thought.

12:07.120 --> 12:11.120
So the question of why is a challenge.

12:11.120 --> 12:15.120
I'm an epidemiologist, so we study the distribution of disease and population.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.120
So I'm the guy who, in theory, is supposed to be able to figure this out.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.120
And it is for a number of reasons very challenging with respect to autism

12:22.120 --> 12:25.120
because of a lot of the factors that Jeremy alluded to.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.120
In the U.S. of my history, an autism goes back about 15 years,

12:29.120 --> 12:34.120
and it really extends back to the time when public health people and epidemiologists

12:34.120 --> 12:37.120
thought that it might make sense to pay attention to autism.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.120
It really wasn't on the radar screen of public health at all.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.120
Clinicians were aware of it. Of course, it was considered a very rare condition,

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
not likely to have a major population health burden.

12:47.120 --> 12:54.120
But, you know, 15 years ago, it was obvious that more children were being diagnosed with autism.

12:54.120 --> 13:00.120
And in the United States, we had very little tools to measure the prevalence of autism in the population.

13:00.120 --> 13:08.120
So the CDC started conducting surveillance for autism in 2002, was the first year.

13:08.120 --> 13:12.120
And it's a complicated approach. It's far from perfect.

13:12.120 --> 13:18.120
But what it is, is it is measuring prevalence the same way in sequential two-year periods.

13:18.120 --> 13:23.120
And we've seen prevalence continue to increase.

13:23.120 --> 13:29.120
When we first started measuring that in 2002, prevalence was 1 in 1,10.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.120
In 2012, the prevalence is 1 in 68.

13:33.120 --> 13:39.120
So we've seen what's still been over 10 years and measured prevalence according to the CDC adapted.

13:39.120 --> 13:44.120
You know, still a fairly substantial increase.

13:44.120 --> 13:50.120
From 2010 to 2012, it's the first time we've seen a plateau.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.120
So what does that mean?

13:53.120 --> 13:59.120
Just because we measure the same way, you know, from 2002 to 2010,

13:59.120 --> 14:03.120
doesn't mean that that increase that we saw was real.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.120
Because there's still awareness factors going on in the community.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.120
And in fact, in the CDC system, there are some things that we can do to track that.

14:11.120 --> 14:15.120
We can look at different areas in the country where prevalence is higher

14:15.120 --> 14:21.120
and see things like the children who are counted in the surveillance system,

14:21.120 --> 14:26.120
many more developmental assessments than in areas where the prevalence is lower.

14:26.120 --> 14:31.120
So this idea that if you're looking harder, you know, you're going to see things more clearly is born out

14:31.120 --> 14:33.120
in some of this population data.

14:33.120 --> 14:40.120
So to Jeremy's point, the idea of trying to parse out what's driving this is very hard.

14:40.120 --> 14:45.120
And there have been empirical studies that you try to look at individual factors that you can measure.

14:45.120 --> 14:50.120
You can see if maybe if you're estimating prevalence at age 5, right,

14:50.120 --> 14:56.120
and nothing really is changing with real risk, but a certain proportion of children every year are getting detected at an earlier age,

14:56.120 --> 15:01.120
that can introduce what looks like an increase in prevalence at 5, even though real risk isn't changing.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.120
And people have looked at that and that's going on to some extent.

15:04.120 --> 15:09.120
Our colleagues in Scandinavia, where they have very well-developed registries,

15:09.120 --> 15:16.120
have been tracking autism prevalence, and they've been able to estimate things like the shift from DSM-3 to DSM-4,

15:16.120 --> 15:19.120
and how much of the prevalence increase that has accounted for.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.120
And that's accounted for some.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
Not all.

15:22.120 --> 15:27.120
When you look at these diagnostic-related factors and you try to quantify them,

15:27.120 --> 15:32.120
these things that we can measure easily, shifting age, shifting a diagnostic system, they account for a chunk.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.120
But we don't have a good way to measure just this general increased awareness

15:36.120 --> 15:41.120
and how much the fact that nursery school teachers and kindergarten teachers are more aware of this

15:41.120 --> 15:43.120
and are alerting parents and parents are more.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.120
We have no way of measuring that.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.120
So it still is an unanswered question and a very important one about whether or not

15:49.120 --> 15:52.120
how much of this increase is due to real risk.

15:52.120 --> 15:56.120
I sort of fall on the same catamasked bed as I, you know, to give an opinion.

15:56.120 --> 16:03.120
I think a majority of it is diagnostic-related, but I think some of it is due to changing risk factors.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.120
And we can...

16:04.120 --> 16:06.120
There is more asthma than there was before.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
Right.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.120
For sure.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.120
And that's not something that you would diagnose, you know, because you look for it more.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.120
Right.

16:12.120 --> 16:18.120
So I think there are things in the environment that are producing things that might increase risks

16:18.120 --> 16:19.120
for different things.

16:19.120 --> 16:24.120
I'm not saying that it's the same for autism, but there are things changing in the environment

16:24.120 --> 16:26.120
that is changing the health of kids.

16:26.120 --> 16:30.120
I wanted to pose to another piece of this, which I want to make sure we don't skip over,

16:30.120 --> 16:37.120
which is the question of what point does or is autism a unitary thing?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
Never.

16:38.120 --> 16:43.120
And because it's so easy to slip, because it's such a hard discussion to have, we slip into

16:43.120 --> 16:46.120
the discussion of autism or not.

16:46.120 --> 16:51.120
And I'll tell you with the perspective that I brought to this, you know, we are in the

16:51.120 --> 16:56.120
psychoanalytic institute, and I think it's unfortunate that probably the best-known heritage

16:56.120 --> 17:04.120
of the psychoanalytic field is this travesty of having autism thought of as a parent-induced

17:04.120 --> 17:05.120
disorder.

17:05.120 --> 17:09.120
But there's something, to me, much more valuable of the psychoanalytic perspective has always

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
had to offer.

17:10.120 --> 17:15.120
And that is this notion that the way we construct our worlds, the way we symbolize, the way we

17:15.120 --> 17:20.120
name things, then affects the way we see them and interact with them.

17:20.120 --> 17:27.120
And so there's something about this story of autism where it meant one thing to Leo

17:27.120 --> 17:33.120
Canner, and it means something entirely different to us now, and how we got from one to the

17:33.120 --> 17:38.120
other, that, all right, it's largely different now.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.120
And it's not from one to the other.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.120
Using the same word is such a complex thing.

17:45.120 --> 17:50.120
I mean, I don't know how many times I've had colleagues outside of Chatsukhaitra or autism

17:50.120 --> 17:54.120
say to me, oh, I believe in autism.

17:54.120 --> 17:59.120
But this person you diagnosed with autism, that you shouldn't call that autism.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.120
And I don't know how many debates I was part of in various places.

18:03.120 --> 18:09.120
And people get into these arguments about this is or isn't autism.

18:09.120 --> 18:14.120
And when you strip out what they're arguing about, it's not actually about a different

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
behavior.

18:15.120 --> 18:21.120
It's about some construct that they're coming up with that isn't, that is not designed in

18:21.120 --> 18:25.120
nature, at least to my view, as neatly in this category versus the other.

18:25.120 --> 18:31.120
Now, it's certainly not the only thing in Chatsukhaitra or in other fields like that, right?

18:31.120 --> 18:36.120
Why do we call hypertension over 160 systolic?

18:36.120 --> 18:43.120
Why do we call ADHD over some arbitrary score on a certain test?

18:43.120 --> 18:46.120
It's not because we don't think there are people with attentional difficulties or that

18:46.120 --> 18:51.120
it isn't risky to have higher blood pressure, but because we have continuous and then we

18:51.120 --> 18:53.120
make some kind of a line.

18:53.120 --> 18:56.120
We draw some line because it serves a function.

18:56.120 --> 19:01.120
And I worry that that's not, we don't talk about that enough.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.120
Or it's perceived, if you talk about it, it's perceived as you're somehow against the

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
public health problem of autism.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.120
Whereas I don't think we all agree on it.

19:10.120 --> 19:14.120
I mean, the last thing I'll say on that for now is there's this great study that Kathy

19:14.120 --> 19:19.120
Lord, who Jeremy works with and I worked with at one point, published from the

19:19.120 --> 19:24.120
Simon Simplex collection, you know the study, I'm sure better than I do Jeremy, but where

19:24.120 --> 19:31.120
they looked at what predicts across, I think, was 14 sites, all very impressive places.

19:31.120 --> 19:38.120
Harvard Yale, you know, Vanderbilt, Michigan, Columbia, et cetera, what predicts who got

19:38.120 --> 19:44.120
called by expert clinicians autistic, this was in DSM four days, pervasive developmental

19:44.120 --> 19:46.120
disorder, Asperger's.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.120
And there was only one thing that predicted it to my recollection, which was site.

19:50.120 --> 19:56.120
In other words, there were cultures within the sites that used terms in certain ways, but

19:56.120 --> 19:59.120
it wasn't consensus.

19:59.120 --> 20:04.120
Now there's a lot of work to correct that, but we need to still talk about it.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
Yeah, that's why we don't have those categories anymore.

20:06.120 --> 20:11.120
Kathy's description, I don't know, it's her term originally, but it's carving meatloaf

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
at the joints.

20:12.120 --> 20:18.120
So you don't have lines between things, and I think we would all acknowledge that it's

20:18.120 --> 20:23.120
really difficult to say for kids who are sort of on the bubble, whether they truly have

20:23.120 --> 20:29.120
autism spectrum disorder or they don't, and a lot of it was driving those cultural differences

20:29.120 --> 20:33.120
between sites was actually not something specific about those clinicians.

20:33.120 --> 20:38.120
It was the services available in their state, depending on diagnosis.

20:38.120 --> 20:44.120
And by the way, this is also what drives some of the differences between states for the

20:44.120 --> 20:50.120
CDC epidemiology, where it seems like it's this really clean thing, but it's quite dependent

20:50.120 --> 20:56.120
on school records and clinicians making judgments that determine whether a child gets no services

20:56.120 --> 21:03.120
in the school or gets sometimes quite exquisite services that are specifically for autism

21:03.120 --> 21:09.120
and wouldn't pertain if you said that the child has intellectual disability plus mixed

21:09.120 --> 21:17.120
receptive expressive language disorder plus ADHD, that wouldn't necessarily generate any

21:17.120 --> 21:22.120
services for that child, whereas autism and the child may have a lot of those features

21:22.120 --> 21:25.120
will get considerable help.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.120
And I think that's part of the challenge.

21:28.120 --> 21:34.120
The way I think about autism is it's a final common outcome, but that doesn't mean that

21:34.120 --> 21:40.120
the primary problem is a social deficit.

21:40.120 --> 21:47.120
Social interaction is just about the most complex thing that we do as humans, and so you can

21:47.120 --> 21:49.120
have sensory problems that lead in that direction.

21:49.120 --> 21:55.120
We know that children who have visual deficits or auditory deficits are at higher risk of

21:55.120 --> 22:00.120
autism spectrum disorder, what we don't know is it's because of the sensory deficit, but

22:00.120 --> 22:05.120
we also know that those deficits are really common, sensory difficulties are really common

22:05.120 --> 22:07.120
in kids with ASD.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.120
So what does that mean?

22:09.120 --> 22:12.120
It could be that it's coming separately from a common genetic risk.

22:12.120 --> 22:16.120
We have to be careful about that, but sensory is easy to talk about because we all relate

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
to it.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.120
If you can't get the input, how are you going to interact with others?

22:20.120 --> 22:25.120
But I think that's the thing that is common across the spectrum.

22:25.120 --> 22:30.120
If you take children who have deep disabilities and very high functioning people, they all

22:30.120 --> 22:33.120
share this sensory hypersensitivity.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.120
And I think that's interesting.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.120
There's a range, right?

22:36.120 --> 22:37.120
Yeah, there is a range.

22:37.120 --> 22:44.120
But I think a lot of researchers now tend to agree that there is an imbalance between excited

22:44.120 --> 22:50.120
and inhibitory systems in autism, and I think that's where maybe things are happening.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.640
I mean, it's a brain that is not well balanced and there is too much noise in the brain,

22:54.640 --> 22:56.240
if one wants to say it.

22:56.240 --> 23:02.120
And that leads to difficulties in the most complex things we have, which is social interaction,

23:02.120 --> 23:04.120
but also other drugs.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.120
It's not just the brain, it's the body.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Yeah.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.120
We have to get out of the brain.

23:09.120 --> 23:13.120
The brain is connected, especially to the viscera.

23:13.120 --> 23:23.120
And you will not have any effect really on hyperactivity or even on the ability to be remediated for

23:23.120 --> 23:28.120
auditory and visual processing deficits if you're not calm.

23:28.120 --> 23:35.120
And I think my work in the gut really tells us we better pay attention.

23:35.120 --> 23:40.120
And the octetosa receptors in the gut, we showed it for the first time.

23:40.120 --> 23:45.120
We showed what the signaling is in downstream pain, or the doctor.

23:45.120 --> 23:51.120
And this is one system, this derasionaltism we got to start looking at the whole body,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.120
and not just the brain.

23:53.120 --> 23:57.120
The brain is a motor organ as far as I'm concerned.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.120
And psychiatry only wants to look at the cortex.

24:00.120 --> 24:05.120
There's another piece of the brain here that psychiatry has missed entirely.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.120
And they're modified by autonomics.

24:08.120 --> 24:13.120
Jeremy, can I come, I wanted to come back to your point that we've made a step forward

24:13.120 --> 24:18.120
by collapsing pervasive developmental disorder asperger's and autism.

24:18.120 --> 24:23.120
And I do think that that's a step forward, although I think Fred Bookmark might disagree.

24:23.120 --> 24:28.120
But I don't think we're done because what I hear from colleagues, clinicians,

24:28.120 --> 24:34.120
family is the terms nonverbal learning disorder, sensory integration disorder,

24:34.120 --> 24:40.120
and soid personality in adults, and I don't think we know how those overlap or don't overlap

24:40.120 --> 24:44.120
with various aspects of what we mean by autism.

24:44.120 --> 24:50.120
So even the word autism now, I think is still uncertain, has uncertain boundaries.

24:50.120 --> 24:57.120
And if the more we use it as a singular noun, the more we fool ourselves, I worry

24:57.120 --> 25:01.120
into thinking that we've figured out where the edges of this meatloaf are.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.120
Yeah, I would agree with that, but correct.

25:04.120 --> 25:09.120
Well, so, yeah, I think my comments a little away from that, but related to distribution.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.120
Maybe you go first, Jeremy, and I'll jump back in.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.120
So I would acknowledge, we acknowledge we know where the edges are,

25:16.120 --> 25:21.120
and we also, in particular, don't know where the edges are likely to be for an individual

25:21.120 --> 25:26.120
longitudinally. And that's a real challenge right now because we have kids who,

25:26.120 --> 25:32.120
at two or three years old, clearly have what we define now, carefully as autism

25:32.120 --> 25:38.120
spectrum disorder, who by the time they're 10, don't look that way again,

25:38.120 --> 25:42.120
and sometimes then again by the time they're 20, look like they have

25:42.120 --> 25:46.120
schizoid personality disorder. So there are these sort of ebbs and floes

25:46.120 --> 25:53.120
in expectations and ways of interacting that predict whether a child is impaired

25:53.120 --> 25:57.120
by what presumably are static changes in the brain.

25:57.120 --> 26:01.120
And I think that's one of the challenges we have not just for autism spectrum disorder,

26:01.120 --> 26:07.120
but across all of medicine, but I would say particularly in behaviorally defined disorders

26:07.120 --> 26:15.120
where the expected behavior changes developmentally along with the individuals

26:15.120 --> 26:19.120
or sort of the organisms capacity to do different things, evolves over time.

26:19.120 --> 26:25.120
So, you know, 10 year olds oftentimes can interact quite nicely around restricted

26:25.120 --> 26:29.120
and can do, you know, beautiful parallel play where both kids are watching

26:29.120 --> 26:34.120
and doing the same thing, but by the time they're 15 they have to be facing each other

26:34.120 --> 26:37.120
having a nice social interaction and that may not be as simple.

26:37.120 --> 26:41.120
So I think that there's a lot of ebb and flow and there are a lot of questions around

26:41.120 --> 26:46.120
which difficulties should be defined within the autism spectrum and which shouldn't.

26:46.120 --> 26:50.120
Because one of the sequelae it seems to me to that is when we then start to have

26:50.120 --> 26:54.120
the discussions around treatment, which I agree or ultimately where we all want to go,

26:54.120 --> 27:02.120
it then becomes easy, they vague, a target for projection about what we think made the difference

27:02.120 --> 27:06.120
or not when we don't actually know the normal course of a lot of these illnesses.

27:06.120 --> 27:10.120
So I hear a lot of different stories from a lot of different people

27:10.120 --> 27:14.120
about what achieves some people call it cure or certainly improvement

27:14.120 --> 27:19.120
and without actually understanding the variability, it's very hard to track those things.

27:19.120 --> 27:24.120
I mean, I don't know, I want us to be working in a therapeutic way

27:24.120 --> 27:28.120
but I also want us to be able to agree on what we're measuring.

27:28.120 --> 27:37.120
So I do think the field very much wants to go in the direction of leaving the idea of dichotomy,

27:37.120 --> 27:41.120
autism versus no autism. I think that's the way some parts of the field wants to go.

27:41.120 --> 27:46.120
But I think the critical tension about the need for a diagnostic label to access services

27:46.120 --> 27:49.120
is going to be something that's just going to be pulling back on that.

27:49.120 --> 27:57.120
And I think that from a medical sociologic perspective, not that I'm qualified to have one,

27:57.120 --> 28:01.120
but from that perspective, I think the need to have categorical diagnoses

28:01.120 --> 28:06.120
sort of create these problems for us in other fields too outside of autism.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.120
But part of the two reasons why I think the field wants to go in this direction

28:10.120 --> 28:13.120
and there's some support for going this way. I wanted to just comment on briefly.

28:13.120 --> 28:19.120
It's one etiology. So there's been some very elegant work recently,

28:19.120 --> 28:23.120
although it's really just starting where it's done in large twin samples

28:23.120 --> 28:29.120
where autism diagnosis was measured, but they also did quantitative measurement

28:29.120 --> 28:35.120
of autism-related phenotypes using what are still arguably early days tools,

28:35.120 --> 28:40.120
autism quotients, SRS. These are mostly parent-report questionnaires

28:40.120 --> 28:44.120
that ask about a range of behaviors and generate sort of a continuous score

28:44.120 --> 28:49.120
instead of saying yes, autism, no. And what they did in these family studies

28:49.120 --> 28:53.120
is they estimated some basic characteristics of etiology,

28:53.120 --> 28:57.120
like what component of the condition was heritable,

28:57.120 --> 29:01.120
what component was due to shared environment, what component was due to unshared environment?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.120
There are lots of problems with doing that, but it's one way to sort of take a big picture

29:04.120 --> 29:08.120
look at etiology. And they did that based on the continuous measures,

29:08.120 --> 29:12.120
and they did that based on just categorizing the extreme end of the distribution

29:12.120 --> 29:18.120
what you would do when you're saying these are cases. And they basically found identical results,

29:18.120 --> 29:21.120
which in some ways I think is going to prove to be pretty important,

29:21.120 --> 29:25.120
because I think people were holding onto this idea that this thing that we think of as autism

29:25.120 --> 29:28.120
has its own, it's its own thing that he causes, and if we start thinking about this broader spectrum,

29:28.120 --> 29:32.120
we're somehow going to be diluting our ability to find a spot, because in fact,

29:32.120 --> 29:36.120
I think we're actually going to be increasing the power, because when we measure things dimensionally,

29:36.120 --> 29:40.120
it's very helpful in research and increases statistical power, it's very, very helpful.

29:40.120 --> 29:45.120
So that's point one. Point two is on, you talked about the public health perspective,

29:45.120 --> 29:50.120
and the idea that there's some sort of tension in terms of, you know, ignoring the diagnosis of autism

29:50.120 --> 29:55.120
is really ironic, because actually the public health perspective is really focused on dimensionality.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.120
It's actually this thing called the prevention paradox,

29:58.120 --> 30:03.120
it's termed invented by very famous British epidemiologists called Jeffrey Rose,

30:03.120 --> 30:06.120
and in fact your hypertension example works great for this.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.120
If you think about the distribution of blood pressures in the population,

30:09.120 --> 30:14.120
and you think about the people who are above a clinical cut point, and we consider them hypertensive.

30:14.120 --> 30:19.120
If you have two strategies to fight hypertension in the population,

30:19.120 --> 30:23.120
one was you treat everybody who's clinically hypertensive, and then you estimate, say,

30:23.120 --> 30:26.120
how many heart attacks would I prevent?

30:26.120 --> 30:31.120
And then if you said it, well what if I switched shift the whole blood pressure distribution

30:31.120 --> 30:34.120
to percentile points this way?

30:34.120 --> 30:39.120
You actually would prevent many more adverse events doing that

30:39.120 --> 30:43.120
than you would just treating the people at the extremes, because the folks,

30:43.120 --> 30:47.120
the left of the extremes, there's so many more of them, and that benefit of just shifting.

30:47.120 --> 30:51.120
So that's the prevention paradox, and that's not to say we shouldn't treat the people at the extremes,

30:51.120 --> 30:55.120
or spend some extra time and energy focused on them, of course we should.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.120
But we shouldn't lose sight of shifting these entire distributions.

30:59.120 --> 31:04.120
And I think in behavioral conditions it's a little harder to wrap our heads around that,

31:04.120 --> 31:11.120
but I mean I actually feel that bringing that kind of thinking to autism is very helpful.

31:11.120 --> 31:18.120
Like, you know, if we try to improve social cognition among all preschoolers, right,

31:18.120 --> 31:21.120
and there's going to be some benefits for kids who are at risk for autism,

31:21.120 --> 31:24.120
but there are going to be benefits for other kids too in terms of academic achievement,

31:24.120 --> 31:26.120
other psychopathology down the line.

31:26.120 --> 31:29.120
So I think that's the way we have, so that's why I think the field wants to go this way,

31:29.120 --> 31:33.120
but we have to get around this nettlesome problem of, you know,

31:33.120 --> 31:38.120
very real problem that families need a diagnosis to start getting stuff done for their kids.

31:38.120 --> 31:45.120
Yeah, I think actually my reading of that emerging literature is that the estimates of heritability

31:45.120 --> 31:50.120
are actually higher when you look at social communication as a quantitative trait,

31:50.120 --> 31:52.120
and repetitive behavior as a quantitative trait.

31:52.120 --> 31:57.120
Although some of that's also driven by the one Hall-Mayer study that sort of reports heritability

31:57.120 --> 32:02.120
as being considerably lower, but I think that's an interesting point.

32:02.120 --> 32:09.120
What we really don't understand is why we have so many kids who have elevated scores

32:09.120 --> 32:13.120
in both social communication and repetitive behavior domains,

32:13.120 --> 32:17.120
if these really are just quantitative traits that are independent in the population,

32:17.120 --> 32:18.120
and that's a challenge.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.120
The SRS doesn't do that because it lumps everything together.

32:21.120 --> 32:24.120
No, and it could be, it could be, you know, if we, and again,

32:24.120 --> 32:29.120
probably reducing this to saying that there's one dimension of phenotype for autism

32:29.120 --> 32:33.120
is a gross oversimplification, but let's just say there's one dimension.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.120
What could be is there's one dimension and then there's, you know,

32:36.120 --> 32:43.120
a tiny bimodal sort of peak out here, and some of that overlap is in that peak,

32:43.120 --> 32:46.120
but it may continue.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.120
So this is a sense, and it's very helpful.

32:49.120 --> 32:54.120
There's one other factor, though, which I think we'd be remiss to not acknowledge,

32:54.120 --> 33:00.120
and it's tied to the public health awareness issue, but it can sound nefarious,

33:00.120 --> 33:03.120
and therefore is worth stating clearly.

33:03.120 --> 33:09.120
There's also an academic thing that happens when an area becomes hot,

33:09.120 --> 33:14.120
when something becomes where funding goes, that academics,

33:14.120 --> 33:20.120
treaters, agencies want to join in because A, they get funding for it,

33:20.120 --> 33:25.120
and B, they are then seen as dealing with a contemporary problem,

33:25.120 --> 33:28.120
which is not to say it isn't an important problem or that they shouldn't do this

33:28.120 --> 33:31.120
or somehow this is some evil thing.

33:31.120 --> 33:37.120
I don't believe that, but it does create a kind of, you know, snowballing effect.

33:37.120 --> 33:41.120
I don't think I would have ended up working in the autism field

33:41.120 --> 33:46.120
if I hadn't been looking for funding around the time when this was a major

33:46.120 --> 33:51.120
funding priority, and so that word caught on.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.120
Now, there are people who got to it long before that and can say,

33:54.120 --> 33:58.120
I was there before it became a thing, but certainly the amount that we talk about it today

33:58.120 --> 34:01.120
and the amount that we, of money that's going into it,

34:01.120 --> 34:06.120
has some kind of a feedback loop with our own activities,

34:06.120 --> 34:10.120
and I'm curious what others think about it that way.

34:10.120 --> 34:14.120
I started in 2000, so I will...

34:14.120 --> 34:17.120
No, I think it's important that a lot of people are doing research on that,

34:17.120 --> 34:23.120
because there is so much that we don't know, and I think a lot of us are trying to find

34:23.120 --> 34:29.120
biomarker for autism, if there is such a thing, and because we need something that will help us

34:29.120 --> 34:32.120
measure treatment effects and what changes with treatment,

34:32.120 --> 34:38.120
and maybe also what's common across autism, and I think it's important that

34:38.120 --> 34:43.120
a lot of resources are put into research on autism, because it also informs you about other disorders,

34:43.120 --> 34:46.120
other neurodevelopmental disorders, because we talk about autism,

34:46.120 --> 34:52.120
but I think there is a big family of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD,

34:52.120 --> 34:58.120
and Tourette syndrome, and all kind of things that kind of overlap more or less,

34:58.120 --> 35:05.120
and before the DSM-4-5, you couldn't have autism in ADHD, it was exclusionary,

35:05.120 --> 35:11.120
and she's kind of crazy when you think about it, because a lot of people with autism have ADHD,

35:11.120 --> 35:16.120
and a lot of people with ADHD have autistic traits, so we also need to think about

35:16.120 --> 35:23.120
brain-developmental disorder as a more general thing that I think we need research about,

35:23.120 --> 35:26.120
because it's the future of kids that...

35:26.120 --> 35:30.120
Can I just contrast the way you're talking with the way the last comment you made,

35:30.120 --> 35:36.120
because to me saying we need more resources for this thing called autism is not the same,

35:36.120 --> 35:43.120
as saying we need to understand what these multiple dimensions are that involve a wide range,

35:43.120 --> 35:49.120
including difficulties, and also including normal functioning, that presumably underlie it.

35:49.120 --> 35:56.120
It's much harder to sell that, and it's much easier to sell, there's this thing called autism.

35:56.120 --> 36:03.120
I think we need to be wider. Just focusing on autism. Autism is a strange concept to start.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.120
That's what I said.

36:05.120 --> 36:11.120
In interest of going wide, I was in Washington last week, and I found out that the statistic

36:11.120 --> 36:17.120
for kindergarten readiness is that 40% of kids are not ready for kindergarten,

36:17.120 --> 36:21.120
so we're going to have to go wider, Craig.

36:21.120 --> 36:30.120
I think that part of what's happening again is researchers are still using the term,

36:30.120 --> 36:38.120
but in their aims, mixed in, is sort of more work acknowledging the sort of breadth,

36:38.120 --> 36:43.120
and it'll be a slow transition. It's dangerous, and I agree with what you're saying about

36:43.120 --> 36:49.120
the perils of something becoming hot, but I do also think that there's a little bit of a backlash

36:49.120 --> 36:55.120
against autism, and it's tough to pit funding for one difficult condition against another,

36:55.120 --> 37:00.120
but the prevalence of autism and the prevalence of Alzheimer's are about the same.

37:00.120 --> 37:08.120
Alzheimer's is a terrible condition if it impacts on mortality in addition to quality of life,

37:08.120 --> 37:16.120
but the average age of onset of Alzheimer's, as we know, is 60 or so, autism is a lifelong condition.

37:16.120 --> 37:21.120
So research funding for Alzheimer's is about fourfold for autism right now,

37:21.120 --> 37:24.120
and that's again using these simplified labels and counting things.

37:24.120 --> 37:32.120
Autism, the most common neurodevelopmental condition that's serious, $250 billion a year cost estimation.

37:32.120 --> 37:37.120
So I worry a little bit when we start talking about autism funding, and is it autism hot,

37:37.120 --> 37:45.120
and aren't we that yes, but at the same token, I really don't know that the resources

37:45.120 --> 37:50.120
that are going in this direction are yet at an appropriate level.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.120
Well, I'm hoping research is going to go into prevention.

37:53.120 --> 37:58.120
If it's really true, if we replicate our fine, every use of risk on MCHET,

37:58.120 --> 38:03.120
and more than 14, 1 in 10, the clue of how important prevention could be.

38:03.120 --> 38:11.120
And not only did it go from one to one ten, but dividing MCHET to two categories,

38:11.120 --> 38:19.120
the primary motor and socio-emotional, the family-nusher intervention babies had zero problems in socio-emotional,

38:19.120 --> 38:25.120
which means they're going to not be on your cut-off, Craig, where you move it.

38:25.120 --> 38:33.120
So I hope that it's not just going to go into autism, which speaking of autism, yes,

38:33.120 --> 38:37.120
the biggest increase is calling it a spectrum.

38:37.120 --> 38:45.120
What used to be true autism from the 70s, that's dire and actively rare still.

38:45.120 --> 38:50.120
But at the time it was linked to schizophrenia.

38:50.120 --> 38:56.120
Yeah, the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders was for a time,

38:56.120 --> 39:01.120
Journal of Autism in Childed Schizophrenia.

39:01.120 --> 39:07.120
Now I should remember this, but that definitely went back and forth,

39:07.120 --> 39:14.120
and certainly the term autism came out of the original description of schizophrenia by Broiler.

39:14.120 --> 39:18.120
So it isn't something that Leo Connor just came up with.

39:18.120 --> 39:28.120
It was a descriptive term that he pulled out of the existing literature to describe children who really did seem a part.

39:28.120 --> 39:36.120
I think that's useful to pay attention to, in part as we follow folks longitudinally

39:36.120 --> 39:42.120
and try to understand those kids who are on the edges of the spectrum and what their lives look like.

39:42.120 --> 39:48.120
I think one example is a syndrome that's variously known as Vealicardiofacial syndrome,

39:48.120 --> 39:54.120
or 22Q deletion syndrome, but these are kids who, if you follow them,

39:54.120 --> 39:58.120
some of them have intellectual disability, some of them don't.

39:58.120 --> 40:06.120
Some of them have features that would generate diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, some of them don't.

40:06.120 --> 40:14.120
Many of them develop mood disorders in adolescence, many of them develop psychosis in late adolescence or late adulthood,

40:14.120 --> 40:20.120
and you find a different term applied depending on what age you're looking at.

40:20.120 --> 40:26.120
And yet at the same time, all of these individuals have the same underlying cause, right?

40:26.120 --> 40:32.120
And we look at them differently, apply a different name at different time points in development,

40:32.120 --> 40:40.120
but what they have is this deletion syndrome, not autism plus ADHD and maybe intellectual disability,

40:40.120 --> 40:44.120
and then in another time bipolar disorder, and then another time schizophrenia.

40:44.120 --> 40:52.120
I suspect that what we will continue to find is that where we are able to really define the biology,

40:52.120 --> 41:00.120
we find that it does not respect our diagnostic boundaries and especially does not respect them over time,

41:00.120 --> 41:04.120
but that it will help us those clear, biological risk factors,

41:04.120 --> 41:10.120
which you can sometimes think of as causes, but usually are not causes of autism.

41:10.120 --> 41:18.120
And that causes of an IQ decrement of 20 points compared to family members, some form of social disability,

41:18.120 --> 41:27.120
some degree of anxiety that's higher, some sensory difficulty, and that sometimes yields a diagnosis of this or that,

41:27.120 --> 41:33.120
but what we're really talking about is what's happening in the brain, glimpsed at different points in development, if that makes sense.

41:33.120 --> 41:41.120
And we now have the capacity to do something like that for about 20% of kids with autism spectrum disorder,

41:41.120 --> 41:47.120
not that you're able to identify causes, but that you can do a genetic test and say,

41:47.120 --> 41:55.120
without this thing that we have found in the genome, this child almost certainly would not have autism spectrum disorder.

41:55.120 --> 42:04.120
And where that's true, you can follow a group of kids who have something in common to understand not autism spectrum disorder,

42:04.120 --> 42:13.120
but what is happening in that child related to their biology instead of what's happening at this point in time related to their behavior.

42:13.120 --> 42:19.120
There is one more thing I wanted to say about diagnosis and prevention is if we look at female with autism,

42:19.120 --> 42:26.120
because female with autism get diagnosed much later than males with autism because their way of behaving is very different.

42:26.120 --> 42:31.120
And a lot of them are missed until they become teenager, because they can't flush,

42:31.120 --> 42:39.120
instead of being alone in their corner, they kind of stand in the center, which works pretty well until you are a teenager,

42:39.120 --> 42:41.120
and after that, everything falls apart.

42:41.120 --> 42:49.120
And these females are at so much higher risk of eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and suicide,

42:49.120 --> 42:56.120
that if we were able to diagnose them and follow them up closely, we would prevent a lot of these secondary psychiatric disorders.

42:56.120 --> 43:08.120
And I think that this is something that is totally understudied, and people should be more aware of also the female manifestation of autism.

43:08.120 --> 43:23.120
I agree, and another take on prevention, obviously there's important thinking about preventing downstream psychopathology,

43:23.120 --> 43:27.120
but also upstream.

43:27.120 --> 43:33.120
So, are there a modifiable or avoidable contributing causes to autism?

43:33.120 --> 43:38.120
And that gets to the question of cause, and Jeremy's point was very well.

43:38.120 --> 43:47.120
Just ask a question before in terms of what machines said, or the incidence number between goals and goals different or same?

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
What hasn't been done?

43:48.120 --> 43:50.120
A huge, huge, huge, four to one ratio.

43:50.120 --> 43:57.120
It's a male dominant condition, and basically that's one thing that basically hasn't changed.

43:57.120 --> 44:05.120
A little bit as prevalence has gone up, there's been a little bit of a shrinking back of that prevalence ratio, but really not very much.

44:05.120 --> 44:13.120
And some folks do believe that we're still under-diagnosing in girls, we probably are, especially at the higher functioning end of the spectrum.

44:13.120 --> 44:22.120
But there's no doubt that male prevalence for autism and for developmental conditions is higher.

44:22.120 --> 44:33.120
And understanding the basic biology that's driving that, it's sort of an elephant in the room kind of question that a lot of times when we talk about eating a lot of autism, we just don't even get the mention.

44:33.120 --> 44:38.120
We just avoid talking about, we don't really know why there's this male predominance.

44:38.120 --> 44:45.120
It's not simple things, it's not excellent genes, it could be a little bit, but there's no single obvious answer.

44:45.120 --> 44:52.120
And that's still something that we need to spend a lot more time on.

44:52.120 --> 44:59.120
And then this issue of talk about a genetic cause, and I like Jeremy's definition, you know, a cause is something, if you remove it, you would not have the case.

44:59.120 --> 45:10.120
And what that illustrates, what that definition illustrates, this is important for, I think, folks to think about, when I think about causes, is the five causes is not 100%.

45:10.120 --> 45:19.120
It's actually boundless, because let's say the only way to cause autism was you had a gene, a susceptibility gene, and there were some type of environmental insult.

45:19.120 --> 45:23.120
That was the only, this is hypothetical, that was the only way you caused autism.

45:23.120 --> 45:27.120
Every kid who had autism had this gene and had this environmental insult.

45:27.120 --> 45:31.120
Well in that case, how much, using Jeremy's definition, how much of autism is genetic?

45:31.120 --> 45:39.120
Well if I take away the gene, gene therapy or something, magic, we avoid all autism, so autism is 100% genetic.

45:39.120 --> 45:45.120
But if we remove that environmental trigger, we'd also reduce autism to zero.

45:45.120 --> 45:48.120
So autism is at the same time 100% environmental.

45:48.120 --> 46:03.120
So when you have multi-factual causes, you can say that you have a genetic case of autism, and that's great for potentially treating the kid, if you can figure out how those genes relate to treatment or understanding what's going on.

46:03.120 --> 46:09.120
But there also might be other contributing causes in that case too.

46:09.120 --> 46:10.120
So that's important.

46:10.120 --> 46:24.120
And so I think the prenatal period and understanding potentially avoidable causes, there's a lot of reasons I think there's a little controversy around this, but I think there's a lot of reasons to focus on the prenatal period as a time when the brain is developing.

46:24.120 --> 46:32.120
Molecular biology is suggesting that some of the changes in gene expression that we see that sort of are definitional or pathonomonic of autism.

46:32.120 --> 46:41.120
Well that's a little tricky to get that certain, but some of those changes, you know, they develop mid-gestation.

46:41.120 --> 46:45.120
There's other indicators that the prenatal period is really important.

46:45.120 --> 46:59.120
And trying to think a little bit about whether or not they're a modifiable or avoidable causes in the prenatal period to prevent autism, but probably also would have lots of spillover benefits to these broader endpoints that we were thinking about.

46:59.120 --> 47:07.120
Yes, we looked at the central pathology in our subjects in this pre-me population.

47:07.120 --> 47:13.120
And first of all, they have more pathology, particularly trophoglass inclusions.

47:13.120 --> 47:19.120
And we found no difference in the numbers in the two groups, the treatment group and the control group.

47:19.120 --> 47:29.120
But in the standard care group, the number predicted brain activity a term, whereas family nurture overcame that.

47:29.120 --> 47:34.120
There was no association between the numbers of these inclusion bodies and outcome.

47:34.120 --> 47:40.120
So yes, early prevention, even of biological phenomena.

47:40.120 --> 47:57.120
And that's why I'm so adamant about this, that we have to be looking at nurture and what it can do to overcome the downstream outcomes of these genetic or congenital conditions.

47:57.120 --> 48:02.120
They're not damning.

48:02.120 --> 48:15.120
It seems to me the most likely model that brings all of these together is this very multi-factorial model where there are thousands, if not tens of thousands of small contributions to risk.

48:15.120 --> 48:23.120
And it's very hard when you have that number and the contributions are small to label those causes or not causes.

48:23.120 --> 48:30.120
That isn't to say there aren't more rare cases with that account that have much larger risk associated with them.

48:30.120 --> 48:38.120
But it seems the vast majority of cases will be explained by this accumulation of many, many risks.

48:38.120 --> 48:45.120
And then we as a field in technology will have to figure out which of those can we intervene on and which can we not.

48:45.120 --> 48:55.120
And the question then becomes both on the nurturing side, it seems to me, and on the genetic side, where can we intervene and where do we not know how to?

48:55.120 --> 48:57.120
I don't think we know the answer to that.

48:57.120 --> 49:01.120
In the study? Oh, yes. It is very well documented.

49:01.120 --> 49:05.120
Well Jeremy said 20%.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.120
That's based on molecular genetic studies.

49:08.120 --> 49:15.120
The old twin studies, the original twin studies, and these are very straightforward in terms of how they're set up.

49:15.120 --> 49:24.120
Essentially you're looking at monozygotic twins where one is affected and then you will do it with the second one to see if that child is also affected and die zygotic twins.

49:24.120 --> 49:27.120
So identical versus fraternal twins.

49:27.120 --> 49:32.120
In the case of monozygotic or identical twins, they share 100% of their DNA.

49:32.120 --> 49:39.120
There are some caveats there. In the case of case, I got twins from a genetic perspective, they're like any other sibling.

49:39.120 --> 49:45.120
And so that allows you to make an estimate of heritability. And that's what most of our estimates are based on.

49:45.120 --> 49:53.120
The lowest estimate is hovering around 50%. The highest estimate hovers around 90, 90 plus and a few of those studies.

49:53.120 --> 49:56.120
So heritability clearly matters.

49:56.120 --> 50:02.120
But as Craig said, that is within an environmental context.

50:02.120 --> 50:15.120
So as an example, if you think about susceptibility to skin cancer or melanoma, if we all live in caves, that may look quite a lot different than if we all live outside.

50:15.120 --> 50:22.120
And that's an extreme example. But I think we have to acknowledge this that when we're looking at twins, there are certain aspects that are

50:22.120 --> 50:32.120
really don't come into the model so easily and represent a societal environment, which obviously does change a little bit.

50:32.120 --> 50:37.120
My favorite example illustrates the same point you're making is if you imagined a world in which everybody smoked.

50:37.120 --> 50:42.120
In other words, there was just a cultural norm. Everybody smoked.

50:42.120 --> 50:51.120
Well, in that case, smoking a lung cancer, that kind of lung cancer would be 100% genetic.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.120
Right?

50:52.120 --> 50:59.120
So it's which we obviously think of quite the other way because it would appear to be 100% genetic.

50:59.120 --> 51:02.120
But sometimes it would be if that were the environment.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.120
Yeah, right.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.120
Right.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
If that couldn't be changed.

51:05.120 --> 51:17.120
And to your point about identifying these complex causes, which you know, what unfortunately seems to be the road that we're headed down with autism is this issue where

51:17.120 --> 51:22.120
strong, contributing causes, you know, causes that have higher relative risk or rare mutation.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.120
They're rare.

51:23.120 --> 51:31.120
So the population impact of the things that are that are strong that might generally in epidemiology, we say, if it doubles the risk, it's considered strong.

51:31.120 --> 51:37.120
So, and some rare mutations have effects that are probably much much higher than that.

51:37.120 --> 51:39.120
But there, you know, the prevalence is very small.

51:39.120 --> 51:43.120
So the number, you know, the population impact of that cause is small.

51:43.120 --> 51:50.120
Things that are common, the risk, the magnitude of the risk increase is going to be much more modest.

51:50.120 --> 52:04.120
So, and it really seemed, you know, so back to your lung cancer example, we, you know, got lucky in public health lung cancer that we found the common environmental cause, cigarette smoking, that had a sevenfold relative risk.

52:04.120 --> 52:13.120
I don't think that's lurking around the corner in this sense.

52:13.120 --> 52:16.120
I think we're going to be, it's going to be a little tougher to parse these things out.

52:16.120 --> 52:33.120
But in terms of genetics, I mean, to a little bit like the 22 Q11, if you think of the first neurologic in that was described, in one same family, you had one child with autism and deep intellectual divisibility, another one who had Asperger syndrome, and the third one was just fine.

52:33.120 --> 52:37.120
They all had the same mutation, but the profile was very different.

52:37.120 --> 52:49.120
So, so that also shows the limit of the whole genetic thing in autism because, because we don't know what makes, in one case, something, and in the other case, something different.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.120
Yeah, I would completely agree with that.

52:51.120 --> 52:59.120
And even these strong, and I actually don't say cause, but just, you know, just explain what you mean.

52:59.120 --> 53:04.120
In some ways, you have to say cause or risk factor that manifests in this way.

53:04.120 --> 53:15.120
But as we find more and more of these rare genetic risk factors that are really robust, what we tend to find is that sort of variability, but variability within a range.

53:15.120 --> 53:21.120
And so the, the change is in the range, not necessarily the diagnosis.

53:21.120 --> 53:33.120
So, as an example, there's a 16P deletion duplication syndrome, which is one of these paradoxes that you can have either a deletion or a duplication of the same genomic region.

53:33.120 --> 53:38.120
And in both cases, you end up with autism about 20 something percent of the time.

53:38.120 --> 53:47.120
That's kind of dramatic and tells us something about brain development that at this point, actually, we can only have a laser desert guesses at.

53:47.120 --> 53:58.120
But it's a clue. When you look at folks who are affected, what you see most dramatically is a change in IQ score compared to family members.

53:58.120 --> 54:04.120
That's the clearest thing. And then other things that are like Martha said, not the brain.

54:04.120 --> 54:09.120
So you, well, some of them are. So you look at change in body size, body weight.

54:09.120 --> 54:13.120
You also see change in head circumference, presumably brain size.

54:13.120 --> 54:25.120
These are things that are really robustly associated with these genetic changes, much more so than an autism diagnosis, which I think tells us we, we don't really know what we're doing when we apply these diagnoses.

54:25.120 --> 54:29.120
We do. We're describing behavioral difficulties.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.120
But that doesn't map on that closely to the biology.

54:32.120 --> 54:42.120
Probably the range of difficulties, maybe the pattern of difficulties, or the child who has sensory hypersensitivity versus there are kids who have sensory hyposes.

54:42.120 --> 54:52.120
So I'm working with a child like that right now who really doesn't seem to notice things that most of us would experience is quite painful.

54:52.120 --> 54:58.120
So you can have a kid who's very sensitive and a kid who's totally hypersensitive.

54:58.120 --> 55:01.120
And we apply the same diagnosis to both kids.

55:01.120 --> 55:07.120
Well, I think over time we'll be able to fit some of those patterns on to risk factors more clearly.

55:07.120 --> 55:11.120
Right now we're really at the infancy of that.

55:11.120 --> 55:14.120
Much of that is true of all of psychiatry now.

55:14.120 --> 55:17.120
You could say that.

55:17.120 --> 55:22.120
I think in other areas people are maybe less bothered by this.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.120
And yeah.

55:23.120 --> 55:31.120
Well, I have a theory about that particular question of our intolerance of uncertainty, but I also want to link it to another observation.

55:31.120 --> 55:40.120
I'll bet you if we walked out to 2nd Avenue and stopped 10 random people and asked them, what do you think you'd be most curious about when it comes to autism?

55:40.120 --> 55:43.120
9 out of 10 would bring up vaccines.

55:43.120 --> 55:57.120
And of course it's not a topic we want to talk about because it feels like you end up in these kind of impossible debates where the data points one way, the vaccines are not responsible for autism.

55:57.120 --> 56:06.120
But yet there is a, whatever we want to call this, there's a public feeling in a large number that this must be related.

56:06.120 --> 56:17.120
And what I say is that it is very hard as a society for us to tolerate the uncertainty, particularly when it comes to social disturbances in our children.

56:17.120 --> 56:35.120
And one of the things that I've seen over and over again in the families and the parents in particular is who have autistic children is a feeling inside that if only I could crack open this shell, my real child, my normal child would be inside.

56:35.120 --> 56:53.120
And I think that is in fact because we are so wired to find our children that it is such a profoundly difficult thing to accept children who are different, that this fantasy is perpetuated.

56:53.120 --> 57:02.120
And that leads I think not just within the academic side but in all of society, struggling with what it means to not know the answer to these questions.

57:02.120 --> 57:07.120
Well, it's a perfect storm, it's not only that, but it's also on the vaccination side.

57:07.120 --> 57:20.120
There's a huge history going back to the first cow pops inoculations of widespread social skepticism about this kind of tricky idea of, we're going to take your baby and we're going to put some packaging in them and that's going to be a good thing.

57:20.120 --> 57:34.120
And it comes back generation after generation in one form or another and you take that with your point about concern over the well-being of kids development and you have a perfect storm.

57:34.120 --> 57:53.120
Yeah, I think it's one of the few times when you as a parent in the conflict pain in the child and it's hard not to see why families view this as something all sorts of awful things can be linked to to.

57:53.120 --> 58:05.120
And some ways, blame yourself for anything that doesn't go to like for your child and this is just a really easy one to link on to because you did choose to put them in pain.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.120
We all make this choice, right?

58:07.120 --> 58:13.120
And you oftentimes are holding them as they're experiencing that pain that you are inflicting upon them.

58:13.120 --> 58:23.120
So of course you are quick to latch on to somebody thinking about this as leading to long-term social emotional risk.

58:23.120 --> 58:27.120
But that's, I mean, when you see the amount of evidence showing that there's none.

58:27.120 --> 58:36.120
That to me is insane how just because you have a blonde, good looking woman that goes on TV and tells nonsense, suddenly everybody's buying that.

58:36.120 --> 58:39.120
And it's scary.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.120
It's really scary.

58:41.120 --> 58:48.120
We have an election on Tuesday with 50% of the country potentially voting for something similar.

58:48.120 --> 58:52.120
And I think everybody knows which directs and I will.

58:52.120 --> 59:00.120
You are studying the brain of children with autism. What have you found so far? Anything?

59:00.120 --> 59:08.120
I mean, what I've been seeing a lot in my research was I'm studying how emotion processing is going on in autism.

59:08.120 --> 59:13.120
And the perception of other people, emotions and feelings and social.

59:13.120 --> 59:17.120
And I've been finding a few different things.

59:17.120 --> 59:23.120
One of them was that they seem to have difficulties perceiving emotion expressed by the body.

59:23.120 --> 59:32.120
And on the other hand, I've been showing that when they perceive people in pain, they are not at all insensitive to that.

59:32.120 --> 59:38.120
They actually have exactly the same effective, empathic reaction as we do.

59:38.120 --> 59:45.120
There is no difference in brain activation in kids with young adults with autism and typical controls when they see people in pain.

59:45.120 --> 59:48.120
They share the pain and they just don't know how to deal with it.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.120
So that's one thing.

59:49.120 --> 01:00:01.120
However, I did another experiment with more or less the same group of people where they had, it was a joint attention type of experiment where they had to understand a fearful gaze indicating a potential danger in their environment.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.120
And that's they didn't get at all.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:07.120
So sometimes you have very similar brain activation.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.120
Sometimes you have very different brain activation.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.120
What I'm seeing now, I'm interested in looking at, they have a problem with looking in the eyes.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120
We know that.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.120
And so I've been doing experiments where I kind of force them to look at in the eyes or I let them look the way they want.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:30.120
And very interestingly, when you force them to look in the eyes and you show them low level fear faces.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.120
So I've been morphing neutral to 100% fear faces.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120
I'm showing them 40% fear.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.120
They actually have hyper activation in the whole system compared to control.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:46.120
So they are more sensitive to these fearful faces when they are forced to look at them.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:51.120
And I think that's very interesting because it could be why they look away.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.120
And because it's, again, this too much flow of information that makes them hypersensitive and that would make them look away.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:04.120
And what happens if as a child you don't look into people's eyes and face, you don't learn a whole lot of things.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:10.120
And your social brain doesn't develop normally because you have less input from this thing.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:20.120
So I think it's been very interesting lately to think about this all eye contact effect and what it means in terms of development.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.120
And I see when a baby is born, there is a very crude system that allows to perceive faces.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.120
That's why, after just a few minutes, a baby will orient themselves towards faces.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:41.120
And this root is quick and dirty, but it's the root that is then used by our system to perceive fearful stimuli in the environment.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.120
It's called the sub-cortical root.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:55.120
And what I see in people with autism, young adults, is that sub-cortical root that processes fear is constantly over-activated when there is an eye contact.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:02.120
And I think that's really interesting because what it could mean is that at the beginning of development, this root gets too connected.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:20.120
And that over time, at least the whole cascade of social interaction difficulties, but it could be something very basic in terms of hyper-connection of this very low-level roots that could, I'm not saying this is the explanation about it.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:25.120
But I think it could be a contributing factor to the sum of the problem that we see.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:40.120
That's very interesting because in our study, we looked at the amount babies looked away from the mother, and in the intervention group, they looked away half as much as standard care babies.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120
Interesting.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:51.120
Shall we go and see what questions they are?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:03:05.120
One of the problems that I have here is that from what I know about what psychiatrists are saying about autism, they don't understand what it is.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.120
And they have this thing called autistic spectrum with unrelated disorders.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:21.120
For example, if somebody has a lung problem, they're coughing, short of breath, and he's got tuberculosis, and another one has lung cancer.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.120
They both have shortness of breath, but they're two entirely different phenomenon.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:35.120
Now, we agree with autism is that they are withdrawn, and not socially interacting.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.120
Well, is the cause something inside the brain?

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120
Or is it a speech language problem?

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.120
Because I hear people telling me, I run to people, oh, my son has autism.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120
He can't communicate.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.120
He's withdrawn. He's in a shell.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:04:05.120
Unfortunately, I have an autistic brother, Boulder, and he's not in a group home, and he is totally articulate.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:13.120
But the difference between him and you is that he lacks the normal human needs.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.120
Like right now, we're interacting with each other.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.120
We're curious about each other.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.120
And the autistic people aren't. They're in a different world. They're in a world of patterns.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.120
Like, for example, when he was a kid, he would run away from home to ride on the subways. That's a pattern.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:33.120
Like baseball, it's a pattern. Music is a pattern. Checkers is a pattern.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:40.120
But normal interactions is not a pattern. They just have ceremonies.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:50.120
After my mother died, my father's last years, we go to the group home where he lives out in Suffolk County every six weeks or so.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:57.120
And as soon as he got into the car, we'd take him out for dinner. He'd have to say, do you have enough money for dinner?

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.120
Because for whatever reason, the first time we took him out, he said that. That's a pattern.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.120
Where he'd sit in the car, after the same place.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:12.120
Now, there are also neurological problems. If you looked at, for example, he was normally coordinated.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.120
Normal. Could throw a ball, catch a ball.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.120
But if you ever see his handwriting, it was like someone that had cerebral palsy.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:26.120
Jagged. Or even the way in which they would interact, it's like something falls.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.120
I mean, just to trust my acting.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:35.120
Supposing somebody has this experience, I was walking down the park. I saw a wallet.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.120
So I picked up the wallet, and I flagged down the cop.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.120
And I gave it to him. Didn't have any money in it. So I guess he lost the wallet.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:49.120
Now, when a autistic person telling you the same story, I was walking down the street.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:59.120
I saw a wallet. The wallet was on the floor. I picked up the wallet.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:04.120
I picked up the wallet, and I saw a cop. And I called the cop.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.120
Do you see the difference? It's like they're in a different world.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.120
It's like a whole something very abnormal.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:21.120
So I don't see how you can link that to a speech language disorder.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.120
It's a whole different concept.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.120
Now, I'm sure you're familiar with Temple Graden.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:34.120
She's really weird because I believe is autistic, but actually not that severe.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:40.120
So she can function. And I think the things that she has said about overloading emotions.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:45.120
And the stimulation. Like the way you might imagine.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.120
I can look at you. And we're having a conversation.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.120
But I'm also getting other stimuli. The temperature, the room.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:07:00.120
Extraneous sounds. Smells. The feel of my feet and the shoes.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.120
But I can ignore all that and concentrate on what you're saying.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:08.120
We all do that. And what Temple Graden said is they can't do that.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:16.120
Imagine being bombarded by all kinds of stimuli. Thank you.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:23.120
And you can't control. So therefore, instead of they had the abnormal controls

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:28.120
by having the spony system of ceremonies and patterns.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.120
For example, they have no sense of humor.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.120
They have no capacity to emotionally bond with anybody.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:42.120
So the reason I'm saying this is just because I think that we're talking about autism

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.120
and without even saying, well, what the hell autism is?

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.120
We maybe should have started there. But I think I would agree with a lot of what you've said.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.120
But I would say some in front of almost everything.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:59.120
Some people with autism. Some people. Because there are many different experiences.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:10.120
I would say somebody is clumsy. And because they have bad vision.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.120
And another because they have a neurological disorder.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.120
No, that was clear. We're done because there are other questions.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:24.120
But that was clear. What I thought the first point you were making is that the manifest,

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.120
whatever you see manifestly, doesn't mean it's causal.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.120
That's what I'm saying. So I just want to clarify. Thank you.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.120
Thank you.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:46.120
Hi. One word that I didn't hear, I was surprised I guess, is the social disconnection.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:55.120
And it just seems to me that autism as what schizophrenia should be considered disconnection syndrons,

01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:05.120
that the differences occur because of the point in time which this disconnection occurs in terms of the brain

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:14.120
and as it's encoding experience. And as you've said, there's like 10,000 factors.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:20.120
So there would be all different reasons for disconnections to occur in the brain.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:26.120
And schizophrenia, one of the reasons might be white matted to degradation.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:32.120
But there are many, many other things that are associated.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:42.120
And it seems to me when you think of the brain as a hierarchical processor with a lot of modularity,

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:53.120
that social issues would be the most challenging and that at the highest levels of spectrum spectrum sub-tism,

01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:02.120
there would be those social issues because of the much greater level of integration as necessary to

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:09.120
meaningfully connect the medial prefrontal cortex with the rest of the brain.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:22.120
But in addition, when you talk about the Bellicardio syndrome, you might have a much more severe type of disconnection

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:29.120
that occurs at a much earlier stage. And then you also don't know whether that's really just that one issue

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:37.120
versus the other 10,000 things and that that might be creating the variability in terms of whether somebody

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:47.120
progresses to encode their cortex and then lead to further disintegration, which would be more of a schizophrenic

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:58.120
like pattern versus somebody who disintegration is so early in development that you do not have really meaningful

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.120
encoding and you have a much more significant disability.

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:13.120
So I'm just wondering about this being really part of a disconnection syndrome and that it wouldn't be more helpful

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:21.120
to be calling it that rather than autism. It's almost like the problem of me going to Alaska and speaking to

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:28.120
Eskos and that's going to be having 26 words for snow, yet psychiatrists and neuroscientists really should have more than

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:37.120
26 words for this phenomena. You did hear me say that I thought one of the remedies would overcome many of these

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:49.120
problems in autism would be to emotionally connect to recondition, co-condition and connect. So that's a

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:58.120
lot of the things that I'm trying to imply that I agree with you. So if you see someone disconnected, the idea is get them

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120
reconnected. Yes.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:08.120
You're talking about patients that have much less severe disconnection disorder than many other autism disorders.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:20.120
I think that's not true. The my experience is not true.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:28.120
Hi. So I think what he was referring to the whole disconnection is like spot on because like yesterday I attended

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.120
something on yoga and psyche and then Dr. Dan Siegel who's a neuropsychiatrist was talking about interpersonal neurobiology

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:43.120
and just the mirroring neurons and all these things. So my question is I don't know if the panelists have come across a

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:54.120
study where there was a population or sample groups that they had perfect bloods like as parents, perfect ratios,

01:12:54.120 --> 01:13:04.120
called hormonal ratios and things just everything seemed very good. And the absence of genetics and say even heavy metals

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:13.120
or things that's getting more detailed. But parents that really didn't have much of a chance given all the labels

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:22.120
and environmental, you know where I'm going with this. So any studies or findings or research that was done on that end?

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.120
Any of your knowledge? I'm not sure what you mean. But maybe you know what it means. I don't know what it means. Not much of a chance.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:39.120
You mean that there's no genetic finding anything? I've heard many, many doctors talk about autism and there are different

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:53.120
linkages, fire retardants, vaccines and different things. Whether there's much science to back it up or a little science to back it up, there are a lot of different linkages.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:06.120
So if you get people from a village who you sample their blood and everything looks good and they don't have much of the exposures that we have here in the Western Hemisphere,

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:17.120
were there any, was that ever conducted I guess as well as? Yes, thank you for clarifying. So I don't know that we've done enough of that.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:29.120
And one of the problems is that most of the research on risk factors, etiology has been done in developed countries as you've alluded to.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:38.120
And at a very general level, the background rates of exposure, social exposures, environmental exposures are somewhat similar.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:48.120
The reason why there's been less of it and more pristine, typically lesser developed countries is because the apparatus to do the outcome assessment isn't there.

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:56.120
So that's why we see a little dearth of it. However, there have been some investigations in more remote populations.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:07.120
And these are generally small scale. So it's difficult to compare rates as the prevalence rate of autism in such a population similar to Western society, but you do see autism there.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:25.120
You see autism basically everywhere. But we haven't done large scale studies in what would be lesser developed, very low exposure to the types of environmental concerns that you're raising at a size

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:34.120
where we can estimate with some confidence what the autism prevalence is and to see if there's a shift down or a shift up so that we really have an idea.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:40.120
So there are general causes, but as far as historically there are general causes.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:50.120
But is there any kind of leading indicators of why the ratio has kind of been shrinking so quickly over the last two decades?

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120
Which ratio?

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.120
The ratio of autistic children being born. I think the prevalence is going to be more and more and more.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:03.120
Yeah, just turning back to the original concept, I think a lot of it is diagnostic awareness.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.120
So I'll just give you a more concrete example. And I talked a little bit about this. I don't think I associated the numbers.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:15.120
In the Danish registries where they tracked over a 10 year period prevalence, it actually was longer than that.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:25.120
It was a longer time series, probably 10 years of birth cohorts with maybe 20 years of follow up because they could do those kinds of things.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.120
Many fold increase in prevalence over calendar times as we see everywhere.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:38.120
They looked at just two definable diagnostic related features. One was the shift from DSM-3 to DSM-4.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:48.120
And the other was the inclusion of psychiatric diagnoses in outpatient records, as opposed to just being inpatient psychiatric hospital records.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.120
Those two factors alone, nothing else accounted for 60% of the increase.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.120
Really? Yeah, now it's a big increase and there's still that 40%.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:05.120
But once you factor in the sort of softer factors related to awareness, you know, you're probably going to be eating into that.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:09.120
So, you know, that's why I think folks, and I don't know what others germiners are.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:17.120
Many people believe that a large chunk of this, above 50%, you know, how far above is 75, 80, 90%.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:25.120
It gets harder to know, but a large chunk of this is due to this constellation of diagnostic shifts and diagnostic awareness.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:34.120
But I believe that there is a small chunk that is probably due to some changing, you know, real risk factors in the environment.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.120
Do we know the numbers for maternal age increasing?

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.120
Yeah.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.120
How much that's responsible for?

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:48.120
Yeah, so they haven't said it's looked at that and I think California did that and they found perhaps, I think, I want to say, perhaps a 10% contract.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120
But it's the same.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120
What's that?

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.120
I think it's maternal to the pet.

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.120
It's maternal to the pet.

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.120
It's maternal to the paternal age.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.120
They've looked at the increasing increase of preterm birth.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:02.120
And the other thing you have to remember too is you have that same problem that we talked about, we talked about causes.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.120
A lot of these things could overwrite when things overlap.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:12.120
It's not, you're like, oh, you said 10%, you said 60%, paternal age 10%, you're getting very close to 100%.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.120
But you can't do it like that.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:19.120
You have to look at everything together and account for the overlapping contributors and no study has been able to do anything like that.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.120
Thank you.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.120
Yeah, thanks.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:28.120
I want to thank the panel for some very interesting hypotheses and some interesting facts.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:38.120
Now, as I sort of set my question, which is about how far we've come and where we're going.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:45.120
I graduated from medical school down the street here 67 years ago and there's been a lot of progress.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.120
I'm a gastroenterologist.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:49.120
And let me explain to you what I mean.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:19:00.120
Pectic ulcer disease, two-dee-nolcer disease was more prevalent in the spring and in the fall and it's related in some ways to stress.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:04.120
And then H. pylori, which was there all along, we saw it.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.120
We just thought they were bacteria.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.120
Well, they are bacteria.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:15.120
And it took a long time to convince the community that it plays a major role in causing a due to ulcer.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:24.120
So one has to be patient between the time that somebody first has light gone and the time that the community begins to accept it.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:30.120
Now, one of the questions that I want to ask you is where are we going?

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.120
For instance, there's an opportunity.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.120
Right now, there's a tension on the viral causes of brain development.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Zika has sort of lit the fire.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.120
But there are a couple of others, toxoplasmosis is a factor.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.120
German measles is a factor that we've known for a long time.

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:51.120
CMV is a factor.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:20:02.120
So I think there's an opportunity, these countries that were particularly hard hit, just having a small head is only, I think, part of, is just the tip of the iceberg.

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:10.120
I think these babies are probably affected in other ways that may not really show up for three or five years.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:19.120
Can we mount some studies in these communities and even in Florida with these affected children?

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:26.120
And with, you know, it's very nice to do studies in zebrafish and in mice and you can slice their brains.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.120
But with humans, you have to have more subtle ways of studying them.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.120
Where do you think we're going?

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:38.120
I think that's a great point that there could be an opportunity with all the attention that's going to come and following highs.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.120
You can expose populations.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:49.120
You know, we think about a certain very narrow range of endpoints, but if we're going to go in there and we're going to put these kids under follow-up, there might be a great opportunity to look for a broader range of neurodevelopmental endpoints.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.120
We might learn some things, so I think that's a great suggestion.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.120
With respect to infectious causes of autism, that is an area where there has been an evidence-based growing.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.120
And there is, you know, it's one of those things.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:07.120
There have been a number of studies that have shown that prenatal infection, mostly earlier,

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.120
in the pregnancy period, although there have been some studies with positive findings later on,

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.120
has been linked to higher autism risk.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.120
The types of data, you know, these have not been studies where there's been biomarkers of prenatal infection.

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:27.120
Largely, it's registry data, it's reports of infection on either outpatient or inpatient records.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:32.120
But that is an area where there is real and real interest.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:39.120
Toxo specifically has been looked at a little bit, and the findings there have not been as impressive.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:47.120
But influenza in particular, prenatal influenza, is one particular agent that has shown a positive in a number of studies and folks who have fallen.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:54.120
The most solid one is probably rubella, although we don't see it anymore.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.120
I mean, vaccines prevent autism.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:06.120
And that's just the clear example, that rubella exposure during a particular window, although thankfully we don't see it enough now that we can study it with today's methodology.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:16.120
But that seems clearly linked with not just autism, but a whole array of problems, including sensory problems as well as brain developmental problems more generally.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:28.120
So, you know, I think that it is clear that some of these infectious infections in utero are, in some cases, devastating.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120
And in other cases, less clearly linked.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.120
The influenza data is a good example.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.120
So there's lots of influenza data, but it's all a little different.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.120
And so it's hard to pull apart.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:55.120
I have a different answer to your question, though, about where we're going, not around the issue of Zika or infectious causes, but this is something that makes me hopeful for the field and we alluded to it, which is, I think there is going to be a sea change from sharp marrow categories

01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:01.120
into an expansion all over psychiatry in understanding things along continuum.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:09.120
And, you know, the NIH has played a role in this by advancing this thing called the research domain criteria for ARDOC. And it's had a lot of pushback.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:12.120
It's certainly not been rolled out in the easiest way.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.120
And there's a lot of concerns about it.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:25.120
But I do think that general moving away from what was classically thought of as the DSM system that neatly divides people into groups and seeing many continue on.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:33.120
And I don't think we know what all those continue on are yet. I think the current version of ARDOC is just the first staff at that, but it may look quite different in 10 or 20 years.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:45.120
That that's going to give us the power, the statistical power that you alluded to earlier, to study things in a much broader way and then look at the interactions between these different dimensions.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:50.120
But now, I don't know when that'll be clinically useful. It could be a while, but I think that's a good step.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:24:03.120
I just want to comment on the first gentleman's concern, though, because he was worried about that. And at the risk of doing a really poor analogy, over expansion of the borders is important as well.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:13.120
And so, you know, I think we need to move from the meatball to the meatloaf, but we don't want to include the carrots and the onions and the pan, if you know what I'm saying.

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:19.120
So there is concern about that. I think in your comments, you were worried that there's some dilution of what we think autism is and that that's going to have asthma.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:38.120
And that that's going to have adverse effects in our understanding. I think that is a legitimate concern, but I think as we move towards our doc and other ideas to think about dimensionality, we need to be mindful that I think people are being, even if that didn't come out in some of our earlier comments.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:54.120
So, I, sorry, I tend to be more of a splitter than a lumper when it comes down to it. I think it's important when we're applying diagnoses that are used clinically and informed treatment to be honest about what we can say and not say.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:25:07.120
And I think in that case, it makes sense to say, look, we're somewhere in the meatloaf. But I think when it comes to science, it's much more helpful to not say, well, this child has autism spectrum disorder, but to say that this child has

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:21.120
this particular risk factor that contributes. So it may be that that's a way to get at people who are better defined. And from my perspective, the best definitions are ideologically relevant.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:36.120
So the genetic syndromes, the biomarkers, studying kids who are born extremely preterm, very low birth weight, following them up, most of those kids are not going to develop autism spectrum disorder.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:47.120
But if you can shift their developmental outcomes as a group, that's incredibly powerful. It makes me a little uncomfortable, honestly, to say that we're preventing autism that way.

01:25:47.120 --> 01:26:02.120
But we may well be improving developmental outcomes for a big group of kids in a really powerful way. And I would say that approach where we're studying, say, kids with a defined genetic risk factor that we can put our hands on and understanding

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:13.120
what changes their outcomes, understanding how that comes about. I think that that's the revolution. We're in the midst of. And some people call it precision medicine. I think ultimately it's about just like hypertension.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:26.120
You want to know why? And once you've figured out, oh, this person has hypertension because they have a problem in their kidney, and you define what exactly the problem is and how you treat that particular case, and then expand outward to say, well, how many other folks can we find,

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:41.120
have a related problem that might yield to the same treatments? And I think that's ultimately where we go. And it's initially about splitting, not lumping, although clinically splitting, meaning smaller groups that have better definition

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:44.120
instead of larger groups that are really nebulous.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:58.120
Where you can get every diet and exercise and shift it that way with the right about what it is. I think there's a quality of discussion issue that to me, I think that splitting, lumping isn't the ideal analogy. It goes in the direction of dimensionality.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:13.120
Because in cardiology, there's no question that you have to decide to give the anti-hypertensive or not. I don't think anybody would ever argue that there's something bad about saying hypertension that I'm going to treat

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:35.120
or not going to treat. But nobody is under the illusion that there is some kind of a bimodal distribution of blood pressure. And I think we are under, continue to be in our debates under this false impression sometimes that if we only can get the answer of what is autism and what isn't. And I know, and you don't know, and I'm going to tell you what it is.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.120
I think that's, I don't think that's good for our discussion.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:48.120
We're all really separate. By the way, the blood pressure analogy is interesting because a few years ago, what was the limit? 160 and now it's 130?

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:53.120
Right. Sometimes you have to change depending on what you know.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:28:01.120
Okay. Do a chanchine neuropsychologist. I just wanted to address the question about the heterogeneity in autism.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:12.120
Based on some new work that's coming out of Mount Sinai, they're Sea River Center, they're looking at genetics, they have international, hugely international pooling the genes.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:21.120
And what they basically find is there are certain genes that are rare. And the rare ones that underlie autism, underlie specific subtypes.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:30.120
But then there are other genes that they call common variants that we all have. But we have very few of them, so we don't manifest the autistic spectrum.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:40.120
But those people who have a lot of them wind up showing signs of autism too. So it's a very diverse group with completely different genes.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:48.120
So then you say, well, how do you wind up with autism, with all of those different genotypes, to them looking at the construction of the synapse?

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:59.120
And they're saying that many of these genes contribute in some way to putting together a synapse, and it really doesn't matter which way, like if your chair is wobbly, it doesn't really matter if the person is in the room.

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.120
It doesn't really matter if the front leg or the back leg or the back is thrown off or something like that.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:13.120
You still have a wobbly, probably chair, it's how you get there. But you get there in different ways because it's different components of constructing these synapses.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:19.120
And then the question you could ask is, well, maybe they're different synapses. Maybe some are synapses related to emotion.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:22.120
Maybe those are the ones that are affected because they haven't yet determined that.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:35.120
So the work they're doing now is to give growth factors, neural growth factors, and in very young children to see if that has anything to do with maybe correcting some of the deficit or promoting learning,

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:41.120
because if the synapses prevent adequate communication between the nerves, maybe you could do something to us.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:57.120
So they're looking at that. They're also looking at oxytocin thinking maybe you can promote normal emotional interaction with, you know, just by adding something extra to the situation.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:11.120
And then the third approach that this is not amounts on, but is the ABA therapy, you know, where some people are brought out. I still with that therapy, not everybody talks.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:18.120
And, you know, so then you say, okay, well, maybe their genotype affected that pathway. It's a world different.

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.120
Thank you.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:24.120
Last question.

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:41.120
Thank you for a great discussion. So my question about gender differences and autistic phenotype, because we know that it's one to four prevalence, but in genetics, back then we'll see that it's normal distribution of language and social skills between the relatives of autistic programs.

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:58.120
So how, what's happening, why they're not diagnosed until the lesson year's goals? And is it any, maybe, societal pressure or any language skills which allow goals to overcome this deficit from childhood?

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.120
Because we know that pragmatic language never better develop in females.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:19.120
I think the girls who have intellectual disabilities, those are diagnosed early. The one that are diagnosed late are those who have normal intelligence. And why is because their behavior is very different from the males, because girls are in general better at social interactions than boys.

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:23.120
So maybe it's, and they're at this age.

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.120
No?

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.120
No, these are me and Populate.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:38.120
But what's interesting in the previous studies, in the extremely low birth weight with the premise where they were following these kids from the very beginning and doing all these tests, they don't find this one to one difference.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:45.120
So I think, again, we don't really know.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:58.120
Yeah, so I think that that's important. The girls who have intellectual disability plus autism, actually the lower the IQ, measured IQ goes, the smaller that ratio.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:06.120
So it's one to one if you get down into the range of IQ that most people would describe as almost unmeasurable.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:13.120
And then as you go up in some of the studies, it's as high as 10 to one in very gifted children.

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:19.120
Why that is, so some people think it's based on societal expectations, sexism.

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:22.120
I think that these are relevant expectations.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:36.120
But I think it also is meaningful that if you look at social aptitude measured any number of pace at an average level between men and women, women are more socially in tune on average.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:48.120
You take an individual, man, an individual woman, that isn't always true. But I think that this is something that probably does, in part, flavor the ratio that we see.

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.120
And there's some evidence for why.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:55.120
So the expiratory I have been built on males. Does your child align little cars?

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.120
Well, yeah, if he has cars to play with.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:06.120
I mean, there is a lot of things that were developed for boys that will not necessarily happen with girls.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:34.120
Thank you. Thank you.
