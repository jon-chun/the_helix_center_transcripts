00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm Ed Nersesian, the Director of the Centre.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
I just want to tell you about the next round table in May, on May 12th.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
The subject is the completeness of physics, and the participants are from the physics side,

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Sri Amvada Natalia from Yale, from the philosophy side, Jim Modlin from NYU,

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
and Carol Rovain from Columbia, from the humanities side, Jonathan Kramnik from Yale,

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
and from the mathematics side, Joseph Kohn from Princeton.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
We are planning another round table, which will be the last before the summer,

00:58.000 --> 01:05.000
on June 16th on the Science and Art subject called Turbulence,

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
and it's still being planned, so I don't have all the names of the people who will be involved in that.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
In flux.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
It's in flux. It's in progress.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
So Anne-Marie Levine, who is a poet and a member of our executive board, is the person who proposed this idea

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
and has been instrumental in putting it together, and she will introduce the other participants.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So we have this rather unusual subject.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
I've always been interested in, but don't. I don't know anything about it, but I hope we'll all find out.

01:44.000 --> 01:56.000
Just to introduce boredom a little bit. Schopenhauer described boredom as a tame longing without any particular object.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Dostoevsky said it was a beastial and indefinable affliction,

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
and the poet Joseph Brodsky said it was time's invasion of your world system.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
Unsurprisingly, not many can describe boredom, even though most have felt it, and it is one of the central preoccupations of the age.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
The most current definition comes from John Eastwood, who is with us.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Raise your hand.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
From Toronto.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Drawing from research across many areas of psychological science and neuroscience,

02:31.000 --> 02:40.000
Eastwood and colleagues define boredom as an aversive state of wanting, but being unable to engage in satisfying activity,

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
which arises from failures in one of the brain's attention networks.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
But interestingly, people who investigate boredom find it thus.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Boredom is a blast to a curious and creative scholar, nothing is ever too trivial.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
And Peter Tuay finds a perverse kind of plea in his subject that the Daily Telegraph wrote that.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
Curiously, the subject seems to invigorate those who study it.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
We hope that this roundtable will, in bringing together scholars from literature, psychiatry, neurology, cultural history,

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
and the law who have thought deeply about the subject, encourage the exploration of the meaning and characteristics of boredom,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
and so doing give the audience a chance to enlarge their own ideas.

03:26.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm going to, as quickly as I can, because they have long biographies, introduce the participants.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
So would you raise your hand when I introduce you so that we know who you are?

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, we know John Eastwood is a registered clinical psychologist, holds an academic appointment at York University in Toronto,

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
Canada, as an associate professor of clinical psychology, where he trains future psychologists and conducts research

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
on the intersection between cognition and emotion.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
He has examined how attention is allocated to effective and socially relevant information,

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
the influence of mood and motivation on attention, as well as the effective consequences of attention failures.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
In particular, he is examining the feeling of boredom associated with the unengaged mind.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
Recently, he obtained a research grant to explore the cognitive mechanisms underlying boredom.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
He's been awarded the Ontario Psychological Association Harvey Brooker Award for Excellence in Clinical Training,

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
the Picro-Canada Young of Innovator Award, and the Premier's Research Excellence Award.

04:38.000 --> 04:47.000
Jacqueline Gottlieb is Professor of Neuroscience in the Cavalier Institute for Brain Science

04:47.000 --> 05:00.800
and the Mournemouthies-Cec

05:00.800 --> 05:09.800
Dr. Gottlieb is an internationally renowned expert on the neural mechanisms of attention and decision making and the recipient of numerous awards.

05:09.800 --> 05:20.800
Her work pioneers the study of active information sampling and curiosity, which she investigates using behavioral, computational and neurophysiological methods.

05:20.800 --> 05:33.800
The central goal of her research is to understand cognition as an adaptive process whereby the brain dynamically allocates its resources to best serve the demands of a decision situation.

05:33.800 --> 05:44.800
Gerald Hurwitz, Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology and on faculty for the past 30 years at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

05:44.800 --> 05:51.800
He has a full-time clinical practice in psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry in New York City.

05:51.800 --> 06:02.800
Dr. Hurwitz is a founder and chief medical officer at M3 Information and Information Technology Company that focuses on mental health integration into primary care.

06:02.800 --> 06:10.800
He has authored and co-authored many texts in the fields of psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry.

06:10.800 --> 06:24.800
Dr. Hurwitz received a Master's degree in Philosophy from NYU, an MD from Jefferson Medical College, and a Bachelor of Arts, Physics and Philosophy from Yale.

06:24.800 --> 06:30.800
Your biography is too long.

06:30.800 --> 06:52.800
Mark Paul Sattie has translated more than 50 books from the French, including works by Flabeu, Mariano, D'Oras, T'Bouton and Ramon Rousselle, a Chavalier of the Algredes Aire de L'Etra and the recipient of a 2016 American Academy of Arts and Letters Award for Literature.

06:52.800 --> 07:11.800
He's the author of 11 books, including Revolution of the Mind, The Life of Envoy Wooddell, Louise Bunuels, Les Alvidadas, Bob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited, and Sympathy for the Trader, a Translation Manifesto.

07:11.800 --> 07:22.800
His essays and reviews have appeared endlessly. The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, Art News, The Nation, Parnazas, Partisan Review, Book Form and elsewhere.

07:22.800 --> 07:29.800
And he directs the publications program at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

07:29.800 --> 07:46.800
Josefa Rosvylasco is Associate in the Department of Romance Languages and Literature at Harvard University, and Ray, I don't know about pronouncing this, but Ann Rayell, Collegio Comproutense.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.800
Rayell Collegio Comproutense.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Thank you.

07:49.800 --> 07:54.800
And her postdoctoral fellow.

07:54.800 --> 08:13.800
She is conducting multi-disciplinary research on the evolutionary role of boredom from a philosophical anthropological point of view to argue against the widespread understanding of boredom as a pathological personality trait, whereby medicalization of such a common daily annoyance is legitimized.

08:13.800 --> 08:30.800
As part of this approach, she is examining how the comprehension of boredom in terms of a mental disease has gradually formed historically as a result of the act of taking at face value the metaphor of boredom as an illness, especially represented in 19th century Western literature and philosophy.

08:30.800 --> 08:52.800
She's editor and author of the books, Feminism, Past, Present and Future Perspectives, Contemporary Approaches in Philosophical and Humanistic Thought, and Hans Blumenberg, Lidotura, Estetica, Ihnyi Lismo, and of academic papers such as Hans Blumenberg's Philosophical Anthropology of Boredom.

08:52.800 --> 08:59.800
Boredom Humanizing or Dehumanizing Treatment, Boredom, a Comprehensive Study of the State of Affairs.

08:59.800 --> 09:07.800
She's currently working on her next book, History of Boredom, the Way Towards the Path of Ligization of Boredom and Its Alternatives.

09:07.800 --> 09:19.800
In the future, she would like to read a research project on boredom in old age and the improvement of seniors' quality of life in old people's homes by paying attention to the phenomenon of boredom.

09:19.800 --> 09:29.800
To begin, I'd like Mark Politzati to say if you introductory words on our subject.

09:29.800 --> 09:37.800
Hello everyone, thank you indeed for being here. I apologize for those who are looking at my back.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.800
I would rather you hate me than be indifferent to me.

09:41.800 --> 09:49.800
Bob and Howard wrote that the two enemies of human happiness are pain and boredom, and of the two, the more fearsome is clearly boredom.

09:49.800 --> 09:56.800
We rot our brain cells with drugs or Twitter to avoid it. We willingly endanger life and limb to get away from it.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.800
Here today, I would much rather you throw tomatoes at me than yawn.

10:00.800 --> 10:07.800
So if you must walk out, please do it from anger or disgust, not from lack of interest.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.800
What is it about boredom that so frightens and discomforts us?

10:11.800 --> 10:20.800
Tolstoy defined it as the desire for desires, which speaks of a yearning, but one that can never be satisfied because it's a failure of yearning itself.

10:20.800 --> 10:28.800
The fact is boredom is hard to concentrate on. We get restless. We are literally driven to distraction.

10:28.800 --> 10:34.800
The desperation we feel when we're forced to endure it for long periods can be positively claustrophobic.

10:34.800 --> 10:40.800
And yet, somewhat paradoxically, boredom maintains a real hold on our imaginations.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.800
You find it unexpected references to it everywhere.

10:43.800 --> 10:48.800
Robert Museo, in his novel Three Women, writes of a group of prospectors,

10:48.800 --> 10:53.800
what caused them more suffering than food poisoning was melancholy and boredom,

10:53.800 --> 11:00.800
which seems to buttress my conviction that we'd much rather suffer physical pain than suffer tedium.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.800
Others have taken a more prescriptive approach to boredom, offering recipes on how to be a bore,

11:05.800 --> 11:09.800
that presumably really mean to tell us how not to be a bore.

11:09.800 --> 11:14.800
Well, Tara's formulation was, the secret of being a bore is to tell everything.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.800
A sentiment echoed by the American humorist Bert Leston Taylor in a well-known quip,

11:19.800 --> 11:24.800
a bore is a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.800
Today we would simply say, TMI.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.800
Whoa.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.800
Still others have tried to combat boredom proactively, if not always considerably.

11:35.800 --> 11:40.800
The surrealist leader, Andre Bertone, having cruelly humiliated one of his closest friends in public,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.800
explained afterward to his non-plus companions,

11:43.800 --> 11:50.800
it's only natural when on board to provoke an argument, even a nasty one, to avoid losing stamina.

11:50.800 --> 11:56.800
Now, you have before you five people who are going to spend the next two hours trying to engage your interest

11:56.800 --> 12:00.800
in the negation of interest, which might seem like the very definition of a fool's errand,

12:00.800 --> 12:07.800
but fear not, because for every sage who is dispirited of boredom, others have zeroed in on its redeeming qualities.

12:07.800 --> 12:12.800
The American educator, John Cabot-Zinn, reflecting his work on mindfulness,

12:12.800 --> 12:17.800
points out that when you pay attention to boredom, it gets unbelievably interesting.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.800
Similarly, John Ashbury wrote in his poem, The Short Answer,

12:21.800 --> 12:29.800
why make things more difficult than they already are? Because if it's boring in a different way, that'll be interesting too.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.800
Indeed, the potential of boredom to spur creativity is well known to any artist.

12:36.800 --> 12:42.800
The life of the creative man, said Susan Sontag, is led, directed, and controlled by boredom.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.800
Avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes.

12:46.800 --> 12:52.800
And Robert M. Persig, author of Sen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, put it even more bluntly

12:52.800 --> 12:57.800
when he said that boredom always precedes a period of great creativity.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.800
Are they protesting too much? Putting a happy mask over their agonized faces?

13:02.800 --> 13:09.800
Perhaps. But many are those who have written not only out of boredom, in both senses of out of,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.800
but have even made boredom their pet subject.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.800
Alberto Moravia's most celebrated novel is titled, Boredom.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.800
Though it's actually about a young man's, but a bored young man's, dangerous infatuation.

13:21.800 --> 13:27.800
The decadent writer, Joris Carl Wiesmanz, who we might call literistures, Chairman of the Board,

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
made it career, you know I was going to do that, sir.

13:30.800 --> 13:36.800
Made a career of displaying in book after book his uninteresting society and all its works.

13:36.800 --> 13:41.800
If you search under boredom in the book listings on Amazon, it will return more than a hundred pages of results.

13:41.800 --> 13:46.800
Suggesting that the literature of boredom is practically an industry unto itself.

13:46.800 --> 13:53.800
The mention of literature quickly steered us towards boredom's highfalutin French cousin, Onui,

13:53.800 --> 13:57.800
as well as to his German relative, Velschmätz.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.800
Even though the terms are nearly synonymous, each carries a particular resonance,

14:01.800 --> 14:07.800
and each stands apart from plain vanilla boredom, in its connotations of romantic world-weariness,

14:07.800 --> 14:12.800
of being not only bored, but extravagantly, even exotically bored.

14:12.800 --> 14:18.800
From Kierkegaard to Sartre, Onui has got something that mere boredom hasn't got.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
Caché.

14:19.800 --> 14:25.800
So much so, in fact, that a company making protective sports gear shows it as their brand name.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
Here's the pitch on their website.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.800
Urban sports are extremely fun.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.800
Don't ruin the experience with the wrong gear.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.800
Choose Onui!

14:34.800 --> 14:42.800
No, while Onui and Velschmätz give off a paradoxical whiff of excitement and intensity,

14:42.800 --> 14:45.800
plain old boredom is just well-wearing.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.800
It's Onui's stripped of its glamour.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
It's what we all know when we're at home.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
It's the tedium of the familiar.

14:52.800 --> 14:59.800
Still, I would posit that that very familiarity of the same old, same old, can also be a comfort.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.800
And I'll end my remarks with one last quote.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.800
This was said not by a famous pundit, but by the woman in a couple I know, who for years

15:07.800 --> 15:10.800
have been maintaining a bicoster relationship.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.800
Once when the three of us were dining together, they were lamenting the difficulties of never

15:14.800 --> 15:16.800
quite seeing each other for long enough.

15:16.800 --> 15:22.800
And after thinking it over, she came out with one of the most romantic sentences I've ever heard.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.800
It's not that I want you here all the time, she told her partner,

15:25.800 --> 15:28.800
I just want the luxury of being bored with you.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
Thank you.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.800
Thank you.

15:32.800 --> 15:47.800
So feel free to jump in or if you have something you'd like to say or would you like us to talk about?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
I don't mind jumping in.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.800
First of all, I'm sitting over here just in case the tomatoes start flying.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.800
I thought I'd be as far away from Marcus I could be.

15:56.800 --> 16:02.800
I know I'm really struck as a psychiatrist with sort of the very mundane nature, everyday nature

16:02.800 --> 16:07.800
of boredom and how it's something just in front of us and it's in front of everybody.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.800
A little bit like sleep every night that's still mysterious and I think that's really a wonderful

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
feature of it.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
It was an as to the sort of interest of boredom.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
I make this observation for what it's worth.

16:19.800 --> 16:26.800
A recent review of two books on Jewish humor by Kathleen Shine in the York Review of Books

16:26.800 --> 16:32.800
quotes the poet Billy Collins to say, humor's the dog that leaves the room when you call its name.

16:32.800 --> 16:39.800
It's sort of well known and it's an old saw that if you have a clinical or critical discussion of humor,

16:39.800 --> 16:40.800
it's not funny.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.800
Humor and Mirth are sort of positive effects or feelings, emotional states.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.800
And the more you talk about them analytically the less humor becomes.

16:49.800 --> 16:57.800
Boredom, maybe Mirth's evil twin sibling has a negative valence but it seems the more we speak of it,

16:57.800 --> 16:59.800
the less boring it is.

16:59.800 --> 17:04.800
I thought that was an interesting way to start and also I won't go on at this point now but I

17:04.800 --> 17:12.800
wonder about Mirth as being, you know, more literally a kind of the other side of boredom.

17:12.800 --> 17:23.800
On that point, I mean one of the things that I would like to say is that, you know, I think if you give,

17:23.800 --> 17:29.800
as you said, you know, if you give boredom at least sort of a second thought, it's sort of beguiling really in enticing.

17:29.800 --> 17:39.800
And on the one hand I think that's both a blessing and a curse for scholars of boredom because it is so open to

17:39.800 --> 17:47.800
understanding, definition, interpretation, study in so many different ways, it's almost like, you know,

17:47.800 --> 17:55.800
this war shock that can capture all of our thoughts and it indeed does seem to provide an organizing framework

17:55.800 --> 17:59.800
for a lot of preoccupation and concern that people have today.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.800
So on the one hand that's just plain fun as a scholar, right?

18:02.800 --> 18:07.800
Because you can just roll around in this unconstrained, limitless landscape.

18:07.800 --> 18:20.800
But if we want to, you know, really collaborate with one another, if we want to be able to make some progress,

18:20.800 --> 18:27.800
dare I say, if that's an okay thing to say, in our understanding of boredom, that I think we need to find sort of some

18:27.800 --> 18:30.800
lingua franca that we can all work from.

18:30.800 --> 18:39.800
And we need to find some way to work together to develop some precision around terms and around the uses of our words.

18:39.800 --> 18:46.800
Because the term boredom is so elastic that as a scientist it's really difficult to wrestle with it, right?

18:46.800 --> 18:50.800
When one person uses the term, it might mean something very different than another.

18:50.800 --> 18:59.800
So while I really think multi-disciplinary approaches, multi-method approaches are absolutely the way to go,

18:59.800 --> 19:07.800
I think it would be wise for us to find ways to corral and constrain our thinking

19:07.800 --> 19:12.800
and to find ways that we can communicate across disciplines and work with each other.

19:12.800 --> 19:25.800
Yeah. I totally agree because today concerning boredom, we have to admit that we have more questions than responses, than solutions.

19:25.800 --> 19:31.800
But we all recognize that we have to do that to speak of boredom.

19:31.800 --> 19:40.800
At least we have to admit that boredom, to talk of boredom, is not boring because we are all smiling all the time.

19:40.800 --> 19:53.800
So my first reaction to your presentation, your fascinating presentation, you told in one time that boredom conduct to disaster

19:53.800 --> 20:04.800
at the very beginning. So I think boredom conduct to disasters, because we are worried about boredom,

20:04.800 --> 20:11.800
especially because of the consequences of being bored.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.800
In particular of the consequences of not to be able to get rid of boredom.

20:16.800 --> 20:28.800
So I think boredom leads to disaster in two different situations when individuals are unable to give a response,

20:28.800 --> 20:16.800
or reply to boredom. And also, this is the topic used by

20:16.800 --> 20:44.800
teenagers and psychologists are working on when individuals have problems with regard to attention and so on.

20:44.800 --> 21:01.800
And also on the other situation, when the context is so close that doesn't offer the responses you are expecting.

21:01.800 --> 21:14.800
In this case, when the individual is not able because of their own problems, mental problems and so on, or because of the context,

21:14.800 --> 21:33.800
the situation is when boredom leads to the disaster. I mean to behaviors that anybody could say are pathological, are deviant behaviors.

21:33.800 --> 21:47.800
I completely agree. And I'm wondering to your point, maybe one of the things to try to distinguish between is boredom and the feeling of discomfort that we feel that we call boredom,

21:47.800 --> 21:56.800
which are maybe not quite the exact same thing. Because I feel very lucky in the sense that if I'm on my own, I actually never feel bored.

21:56.800 --> 22:10.800
I mean I can feel tired, I can feel that I don't have any particular activity, I can feel lack of energy, but I don't feel bored in that sense of being almost kind of desperately anxious to get out of whatever that state is.

22:10.800 --> 22:14.800
Where I do get bored sometimes is when I'm in a place where I can't leave.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.800
So I mean boredom is, hell is other people and so is boredom.

22:18.800 --> 22:32.800
And the classic example for me is in my day job, if I'm stuck in a meeting and I just have to be there, and sometimes they can be great, but sometimes they can get really painful.

22:32.800 --> 22:42.800
And it does cause that sense of claustrophobia that I referenced, where my astral self is sort of getting up from the table and walking out of the room and going,

22:42.800 --> 22:55.800
it's running down the hall, but my physical self, because I'm sort of stuck because of the expectations of the job, is still sitting there just waiting for this thing to end, because whatever they're talking about is just a no interest whatsoever.

22:55.800 --> 23:08.800
And there's a memoir I remember reading once by the former director of the Louvre who was talking about his one of his predecessors would go to meetings of which they had zillions and the French are even worse than we are in the museum world.

23:08.800 --> 23:26.800
And they would go to meetings at a certain point, he would just stand up and say, okay, I'm going to the movies now, and all the other curators would be sitting around the table completely non plus, because this man actually dared to do what they probably wanted to do themselves, but he actually stood up and did it and walked away and it eventually cost him his job, but it kind of didn't matter because he just didn't want to be bored anymore.

23:26.800 --> 23:40.800
The first kind of boredom, hide the gut, talk about boredom or a situation in which you are not forced to be there, but you should, you're constrained.

23:40.800 --> 23:59.800
You should, and you decide to go there voluntarily, nobody is forcing you, but you know in advance you are going to be bored. I'm not sorry if this is the first of the second kind of boredom, hey, they get talk about.

23:59.800 --> 24:14.800
I would actually take slight issue with that because the fact is that there are pressures and constraints on it, you are kind of forced, I mean you're not forced physically at gunpoint, it's not like being in jail, but the fact is that the dictates of my job and the position I have at the museum

24:14.800 --> 24:27.800
and the expectations are such that I'm expected to be in that room, I'm expected to pretend that I'm paying attention, I'm expected to pretend that I actually care what these people are talking about, and I mean, that's obviously most of the time I do, but once in a while,

24:27.800 --> 24:39.800
it's where I am in my salary, and this is part of the job, so there are pressures to do it, I can't just walk out, much as I would love to.

24:39.800 --> 24:56.800
I have a question about the other kind of boredom that happens when you're alone by yourself, and some people who don't get bored in that situation, and I propose advice and I think we're very lucky, but then other people who do get bored.

24:56.800 --> 25:11.800
That situation, what do you think is the difference, I know you've studied this a lot, and maybe related to this, what is the role of boredom in mental illness and psychopathology?

25:11.800 --> 25:30.800
Yeah, there's a big topic. What's the difference between people who get bored when they're by themselves and people who are right?

25:30.800 --> 25:49.800
There's lots of different factors, cultural, social, environmental, psychological factors that can cause boredom, there's a wide variety of things, but I do think we need a clear definition of what the state of boredom is, and so I define the state of boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally

25:49.800 --> 26:05.800
unengaged, and while not perfect, I think it does a pretty good job of succinctly capturing the definition, and I think the underlying cognitive mechanism is this state of underutilized cognitive resources, right?

26:05.800 --> 26:23.800
We have mental capacity that's sort of pent up and not being utilized or not being used, and I think that's an inherently uncomfortable feeling, and I think we are just designed, evolutionarily, to experience that state is aversive, and I think that's a good thing, right?

26:23.800 --> 26:37.800
It's a good thing. I mean, we wouldn't be here today having this conversation if we were content to be mentally unengaged, right? We wouldn't be here in this culture, the society, not unless this conversation itself.

26:37.800 --> 26:46.800
So I say boredom is the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally unengaged, and I think you can compare it to physical pain.

26:46.800 --> 27:01.800
I think that the discomfort of boredom is analogous to the discomfort of physical pain. They both keep us safe, or they both keep us well.

27:01.800 --> 27:05.800
So it's a good thing that we have the capacity for boredom.

27:05.800 --> 27:15.800
That doesn't mean that we should cultivate boredom, right? So just because pain is a good thing, we don't go around cultivating it, right? We don't say, yes, we should cultivate it.

27:15.800 --> 27:29.800
Nor do I think we should become preoccupied with trying to avoid pain at any cost. That would not be advantageous, nor would it be advantageous to try to avoid boredom at any cost, right?

27:29.800 --> 27:38.800
Similarly, like pain, boredom can become chronic and problematic, right?

27:38.800 --> 27:47.800
Similarly, like pain, I think boredom is the signal, and how we respond to it is what's really critical, right?

27:47.800 --> 27:57.800
Pain is just a message. It's just a signal that tells us we're in a non-optimal state, we're cognitively unengaged, and it gives us that impetus to do something about it.

27:57.800 --> 28:12.800
Now what we do, you know, one G-jump, go and get drunk, read a novel, whatever, we can all respond in very different ways, and that's where boredom can become problematic, right? It's about our response to it.

28:12.800 --> 28:20.800
I'm not a fan of the idea of pathologizing boredom. I don't think we should consider it an illness. I don't think we should consider it a problem.

28:20.800 --> 28:31.800
In its chronic form, it does co-occur with what I would call mental disorders, but I don't think of boredom itself as a pathological state,

28:31.800 --> 28:37.800
but one that we need to handle carefully in lots of different contexts.

28:37.800 --> 28:46.800
I'd like to expand on that a little bit, and also maybe make it a little bit more intuitive for people who are listening about your, that's an excellent analogy to pain.

28:46.800 --> 29:00.800
When you say that people, we need pain, it does serve a function. I think most of us think of things like you stubs your toe, or it's considerable pain, but you know, there are all these folks out there who don't have pain fibers and don't have any sense of pain.

29:00.800 --> 29:12.800
You know, their number one problem is, see, I'm here, I'm a little constrained, I can't keep changing my posture, but if we stay in the same posture exactly for any period of time, pain is what makes us want to move.

29:12.800 --> 29:22.800
So our joints don't get stiff, etc. And you know, people in hospital who are forced to be in the same position can start to develop pain, and it becomes worse and worse.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.800
So it can really be a very tiny negative feeling, pain can be.

29:27.800 --> 29:37.800
And where we don't even recognize it's occurring, and we shift our posture because it's starting to build, but it's there, that is a little tiny bit of pain.

29:37.800 --> 29:49.800
And so I think using that as an analogy to what important is really useful because boredom can happen in these sort of micro doses and have an effect in spurring us to do whatever hopefully we'll do next.

29:49.800 --> 29:58.800
I'll just say one other thing just to be a little bit argumentative with your wish to define boredom.

29:58.800 --> 30:15.800
It's just simply that there's an idea that goes back to the beginnings of modernism of the enlightenment that if only we could have a language, a scientific language that was precise, then all of our problems would be solved, right?

30:15.800 --> 30:26.800
Whereas I think that the pro-dian nature of boredom is actually a very interesting issue because it has many sides and aspects to it, and it fits in so many places.

30:26.800 --> 30:43.800
And I'm certainly in favor, and I like your definition of it as well, but I think we also can bear in mind that it is a sort of slightly ambiguous term, and it does serve in different contexts, slightly differently, or it has a role in different contexts, slightly differently.

30:43.800 --> 30:50.800
And I think that's actually interesting. We don't want to cut off an idea about boredom by reducing it too much.

30:50.800 --> 31:07.800
Fair enough. I agree with that. I remember actually once attending a conference where this poet was talking about T.S. Eliot's, and he was talking about how any definition of H2O needed to include a little duckweed, right?

31:07.800 --> 31:22.800
So I'm quite comfortable with that idea, but I think right now, if you can talk about a field of boredom study, the problem is we've got too much duckweed and not enough precision, but I certainly think we need to stay open.

31:22.800 --> 31:39.800
And I do think that there are useful, precise ideas that cut across contexts, and finding those common patterns is, I think, very exciting and very useful.

31:39.800 --> 31:58.800
I wanted to ask about the boredom definition and so on, because what Mark was describing, I also have been lucky enough to be in that position sometimes, and I never described that as boredom to myself.

31:58.800 --> 32:20.800
I described it that I was restless, irritated, impatient, couldn't tolerate all the nonsense being talked about, but I felt more annoyance, whereas when I am bored, it's more that I kind of pass, I'm passively not knowing what to do or how to engage.

32:20.800 --> 32:37.800
So there's a difference there, and one question then is, you who think about you people who think about boredom and are knowledgeable about it, how do you define it, what is it exactly?

32:37.800 --> 32:47.800
Actually, if I can just jump in with one thing, because there's anemologically, and this might or might not have a bearing, but the French direct translation of boredom is, of course, ennui.

32:47.800 --> 32:54.800
Ennui comes from Old French, which means annoyance, and that comes from Latin, which means hated.

32:54.800 --> 33:01.800
So there is the annoyance, hatred, boredom, vector, it's very tight.

33:01.800 --> 33:11.800
I had a fellow in my lab once who was from France, and he would always say, this is boring, this is boring, and he was still in the hallway, and this is annoying, this is irritated.

33:11.800 --> 33:25.800
So the shows were also at the cultural quality of boredom, and whether or not one chooses to use that term, because I think when you heard that some people would label what your experience is boredom, I don't think you said, well I didn't have boredom, that was something else.

33:25.800 --> 33:43.800
You said, I didn't think to call that boredom in a way, and I have a different thing I refer to when I think of boredom, but I think there may yet be something in common between those two states, which is, I don't know yet what I want to do with myself, and gee, I wish I did, which is the wishing to have a wish that Mark referred to.

33:43.800 --> 33:58.800
And then there's the underutilization of my cognitive capacity, where I could do more, or I'd like to act, and somehow I'm constrained to not act, and that can create a sense of boredom.

33:58.800 --> 34:13.800
The words that Ed used are all active words, I'm annoyed, I'm irritated, they're all active words where boredom, as you pointed out, is a passive. Well I think it's a passive state, maybe not.

34:13.800 --> 34:29.800
So what else could be in boredom that's not passive? Why would it make a difference? Well, as opposed to annoyed, irritated, all those things, they're active words.

34:29.800 --> 34:42.800
I think that's it, I think that whatever the dichotomy captures it, because the person's both idle in some sense are not acting as much as they might, and yet they have an impulse to do so.

34:42.800 --> 34:46.800
So there's the active impulse, and then there's the feeling, I don't know what.

34:46.800 --> 34:58.800
Because in French, on we has a passive quality to it, whereas if you say someone we, that annoys me. So when you say someone we means that annoys me.

34:58.800 --> 35:05.800
But when you say I have on we, I'm just passively feeling something uncomfortable.

35:05.800 --> 35:24.800
So this goes back to a concept that comes up in many many contexts, and that is the optimal level of stimulation. And it comes up, I mean, I don't really know, it's a very mysterious concept in neuroscience when it's presumably maps on some network state.

35:24.800 --> 35:38.800
If your brain is a state, a big dynamical systems of neurons interacting, and there's presumably some optimal rate of interaction that is just good, and it feels good for whatever reason.

35:38.800 --> 35:53.800
And so this is how I imagine boredom, even though I couldn't tell you what that state was, what the principles are, but imagine boredom as being in some other state that is understimulated relative to that optimal one.

35:53.800 --> 35:59.800
And of course you can imagine being overstimulated, and that feels bad in a different way.

35:59.800 --> 36:06.800
But so it's not really determined by any single external circumstance.

36:06.800 --> 36:12.800
If some people of the same boring meeting maybe experienced as irritating by somebody.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
And fascinating.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.800
I'm boring and fascinating, maybe by others.

36:17.800 --> 36:23.800
Or boring people. Or maybe even by yourself in a different day.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.800
No.

36:24.800 --> 36:31.800
It's funny to read some of the methods sections of some of the papers on boredom where they're trying to, you know, you've been among them.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.800
What can we use as a stimulus for boredom, which is almost again an oxymorp.

36:36.800 --> 36:41.800
It's funny to read like, oh, we got this movie that's so boring, we'll show that.

36:41.800 --> 36:50.800
Yeah. Yeah. And so, but it's never a property only of the external environment is what that external environment does to you.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.800
What kind of memories it evokes, what kind of mental life it stimulates, right?

36:54.800 --> 37:03.800
So if all of a sudden that boring meeting something came that triggered your memory of something, then at least you could distract yourself with some memory.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.800
And you wouldn't be bored anymore, right?

37:06.800 --> 37:13.800
It's bored, huh? So it's not, right? It's not a function just of familiarity or just of novelty.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.800
There's some happy medium.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.800
If things are too simple or too complicated, they can both be boring.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.800
So there's some happy medium there, right?

37:22.800 --> 37:23.800
Whatever that is.

37:23.800 --> 37:32.800
And boring, boredom, I think, is the state where you might be understimulated and don't like it and want to get out of it, as I think you very well say.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.800
And they're still being overstimulated.

37:36.800 --> 37:37.800
There you go.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.800
Well, they're participants of a sort, right?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.800
We're doing a practical demonstration.

37:42.800 --> 37:49.800
So boring, calm, calm, from both, when they are overstimulated and understimulated.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.800
That's when the flow is broken.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Right.

37:53.800 --> 38:00.800
I guess what I would say is that, you know, where we choose to put the definitional boundaries is up for grabs, right?

38:00.800 --> 38:03.800
I mean, there's no a priori right answer.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.800
You know, we have to decide what's useful.

38:05.800 --> 38:10.800
And, you know, well, I think boredom has a long sort of history.

38:10.800 --> 38:17.800
I'm sure that culture and situation and time have shifted where that boundary has been put slightly.

38:17.800 --> 38:21.800
You know, in my mind, I would think about it as an emotional state.

38:21.800 --> 38:27.800
And I think the two neighboring states that we need to distinguish it from our frustration on the one hand and apathy on the other.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.800
And I think boredom fits somewhere in between those two.

38:30.800 --> 38:36.800
And I think it's important not to conflate boredom with apathy, which often people do.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.800
And I think that boredom involves that desire for desires.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.800
We already heard the Tolstoy quote, right?

38:41.800 --> 38:47.800
And that idea goes back to Schopenhauer's formulation of boredom, that there's this restless longing and desire,

38:47.800 --> 38:51.800
but an inability to articulate what is long for, right?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.800
So it's not at all a passive state.

38:53.800 --> 38:58.800
It's a very, there's a sense of urgency and desire for action.

38:58.800 --> 39:08.800
The psychoanalytic writers talked about the desire being too threatening, and so it needed to be repressed.

39:08.800 --> 39:13.800
But that desire for action remained without any target for discharging that energy, right?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
So there's that it's not apathetic.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.800
And on the other hand, frustration, in frustration, you have a goal out on the horizon,

39:20.800 --> 39:25.800
and then something is thwarting your progress towards it, something is standing between you and a desired state.

39:25.800 --> 39:26.800
And that's frustration.

39:26.800 --> 39:31.800
But in boredom, you don't have that future desired state articulated, right?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.800
So you can't be frustrated.

39:33.800 --> 39:40.800
You know, I heard another psychoanalytic writer that talked about a bored person is like putting on a suit.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
You know, it doesn't quite fit, right?

39:42.800 --> 39:43.800
No, is it?

39:43.800 --> 39:44.800
Or trying to remember a name, right?

39:44.800 --> 39:45.800
Like, what is that guy's name?

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
Was it Joe?

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
Was it George?

39:47.800 --> 39:48.800
No, no, no.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.800
What was it?

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
You've got this sense, this wraith.

39:51.800 --> 39:57.800
There's something there that you want, but you can't name it, right?

39:57.800 --> 40:04.800
And in terms of the over-under stimulation, I would, again, go back to the idea that situations that are too challenging, right?

40:04.800 --> 40:09.800
If we attend a lecture on some topic that we know nothing about, it's like we can't get a foothold in, right?

40:09.800 --> 40:14.800
We can't get a foothold in, and so we're not cognitively able to engage with what's happening.

40:14.800 --> 40:24.800
If the lecture is on something we know too well, and it's sort of very, you know, uninteresting to us, below our capacity, then it doesn't engage us either.

40:24.800 --> 40:35.800
And so I think in both, you know, those over-under stimulating or over challenging situations, they have that final common pathway of being cognitively unengaged.

40:35.800 --> 40:43.800
And when I say that that's the underlying sub-personal cognitive mechanism, I don't wish to say that that's all there is to it.

40:43.800 --> 40:49.800
There's a phenomenological, there's a subjective part on top of that underlying mechanism.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.800
It's very important, and that's where all the affective kinds of components come in.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.800
Champion, a little bit.

40:55.800 --> 41:01.800
We are all the time talking about one kind of boredom.

41:01.800 --> 41:11.800
As you know, we should talk of boredom perhaps, because we are talking of this situational, contextual boredom,

41:11.800 --> 41:19.800
but what about society which is bored, completely bored?

41:19.800 --> 41:36.800
This, you know, this differentiation between the situational boredom or, yeah, the situation in which you are bored, but if you can do something, boredom perhaps you may get rid of boredom.

41:36.800 --> 41:46.800
But then you have the profound boredom, the deep boredom that later John Philosophy talk about.

41:46.800 --> 41:59.800
This differentiation was established by Paul Balévy, the French support Paul Balévy in the last century.

41:59.800 --> 42:14.800
And then also, if I'm not, yeah, I think it was crack hour, crack hour, then also repeated this definition of boredom in a certain situation.

42:14.800 --> 42:28.800
And the boredom that a society suffer, a society, this kind of boredom you suffer when you are, as you take it with your cultural, social,

42:28.800 --> 42:31.800
economic structures.

42:31.800 --> 42:44.800
Yeah, so perhaps apart from trying to, attempting to define a definition for boredom, we have to start talking of boredom, different boredom.

42:44.800 --> 42:56.800
I mean, I agree not to make it too focused in one direction, but when you talk about society's societal boredom, is that really boredom in the sense, you know, in the sense, even in the

42:56.800 --> 43:00.800
larger sense, even in the larger sense, we're understanding it, is that more metaphorical.

43:00.800 --> 43:19.800
Because, you know, societal boredom sounds to me like it shades more toward what you were talking about in frustration, that when we talk of a society being bored, it really is that the people in that society are feeling that there's something that's not working, whether it's an economic structure, whether it's a political situation, whether it's their ability to affect it.

43:19.800 --> 43:27.800
Yeah, but that's not really bored. That's really frustration. I mean, we're not bored with, you know, the current administration. We're just frustrated with it.

43:27.800 --> 43:38.800
Well, it might be the case of some part of our inculturation in a particular society may not give us the goals, or may not cultivate the goals in people.

43:38.800 --> 43:24.800
I don't know how to exactly say this, but if those goals are not cultivated by people, you know, it's sort of like some young people are coming up through school, they'll say, I don't know what I want to do with myself and say, well, go see your

43:24.800 --> 43:51.800
career counselor, which is perfectly reasonable. But the idea is maybe that person will find something that's not going to be a problem.

43:51.800 --> 44:00.800
And so, I think it's reasonable that the idea is maybe that person will find some interest the person wasn't aware of where they had or give them some focus and direction.

44:00.800 --> 44:15.800
So frustration implies there are things barring people from expressing themselves. And I think that's a more sort of a description, a philosophical and sociological description of, let's say, anger among the underclasser in feminism and such.

44:15.800 --> 44:22.800
People would say, well, yes, of course, women are, of course, African Americans are angry because they're being mistreated. So why are you treating it like a psychological problem?

44:22.800 --> 44:29.800
It's a societal problem. In this case, I think with boredom, you could say, actually, also, people don't know what to do with themselves.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.800
And they may also be frustrated. It's not just one or the other.

44:34.800 --> 44:49.800
I do think when we judge something to be boring, we're doing social work. We're dismissing, we're denigrating. So to describe something as boring is kind of a social act, I think.

44:49.800 --> 44:59.800
And so I would definitely agree in that regard. And you can think about it, like a child in a classroom who, let's say they're struggling with math.

44:59.800 --> 45:09.800
Well, this is boring. What's happening right there? Well, maybe this child lacks the capacity to be successful in this context, but it's a way to save face.

45:09.800 --> 45:25.800
It's sort of an aloof kind of stepping back. And we use boredom to judge people as well. I had one graduate student who was doing a project cross-culturally looking at boredom in rural communities in Guatemala.

45:25.800 --> 45:35.800
And it's interesting that when people say, well, I'm never bored. I'm never bored because I got too much work to do. It's just those rich guys over there that get bored, right?

45:35.800 --> 45:48.800
It's a way of rejecting the other. So I do think social work is happening around boredom in a way that's interesting and a little different than other kinds of emotions, perhaps.

45:48.800 --> 45:58.800
And so I think your point is well taken in that regard. I also think that there are many different potential factors that can cause boredom when you've touched on that as well.

45:58.800 --> 46:10.800
But I think if you're thinking about it as an emotional state, I would think of it as singular with lots of different causes and then lots of different responses I might make to it.

46:10.800 --> 46:17.800
So there's certainly a variety that needs to be explored and understood.

46:17.800 --> 46:27.800
I remember many, many years ago, we were talking one of the early meetings like that, and Carl Prabram was there.

46:27.800 --> 46:35.800
And Carl Prabram said, many of these words we use, and we were talking about creativity, imagination, and so on.

46:35.800 --> 46:42.800
He said, these are just words we use, that it's because we don't really know what they are about and we give them a name.

46:42.800 --> 46:56.800
Do you think boredom falls into that category? That it's not like, for example, when we say fear as an emotion, it seems to be a lot more specific.

46:56.800 --> 47:09.800
And now you can talk about fear circuits and so on. But boredom seems to be, as I listen, it seems like different people feel it or describe it,

47:09.800 --> 47:19.800
or like your student with the mat who says I'm bored. Does he actually have an emotion that is specific and can be called boredom?

47:19.800 --> 47:30.800
This is kind of where I started, right? I mean, my thought would be that boredom can be like fear if we can work together and come up with a definition.

47:30.800 --> 47:42.800
But I think the person in the street will and should continue to use the term very broadly and very loosely, just the way people use the term fear in a way that neuroscientists would say,

47:42.800 --> 47:50.800
well, that's not actually not quite fear, right? I mean, they would like to think just between fear and anxiety and all kinds of nuances that others wouldn't make.

47:50.800 --> 48:01.800
So I think we should start by listening to the person in the street to develop kind of grounded definitions of our concepts and make sure they're culturally relevant and we should look at theories.

48:01.800 --> 48:08.800
But then I think we need to do a little pruning and kind of come up with that definition so that we can work with it like we can work with fear.

48:08.800 --> 48:19.800
Yeah, I agree. So I think it's so coming from neuroscience where we're not really studying boredom yet, but we're not studying a lot of interesting higher-level concepts like curiosity.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.800
Right.

48:21.800 --> 48:22.800
Right.

48:22.800 --> 48:27.800
But it's not that they cannot be studied. It's just we didn't get to them yet.

48:27.800 --> 48:34.800
So this is why I mean fear is even impossible to study at the biological level not long ago and all these decision-making.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.800
Everything we care about that's interesting. It's very hard to define.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
That's right.

48:39.800 --> 48:44.800
But in a sense, that's why we're not going to give up trying to, you know, operation.

48:44.800 --> 48:52.800
So it's just some disciplines are in terms of studying boredom causes so difficult to define that.

48:52.800 --> 48:53.800
Yeah.

48:53.800 --> 49:04.800
Perhaps I'm for apologies. I think what we are going to say about boredom cause some affection, some emotion, a state of mind is.

49:04.800 --> 49:09.800
Well, I mean, so it's the same as the sort of the dark side of mental life, right?

49:09.800 --> 49:14.800
When we study feeding behavior in neuroscience, we don't say we study hunger, right?

49:14.800 --> 49:22.800
Hunger is a motivation for feeding. So the same thing boredom is the motivation for engaging in mental life.

49:22.800 --> 49:29.800
But so I was going to ask you, speaking of these disconnect, I mean, in a sense, you're a lot farther ahead than we are in neuroscience.

49:29.800 --> 49:37.800
And this is what attracted me to read some of your studies, because I started thinking about what motivates us to engage attention,

49:37.800 --> 49:45.800
what motivates us to be curious. And then I looked in my field in neuroscience, and I'm amazed to find that in neuroscience,

49:45.800 --> 49:55.800
we think of mental activity as a cost. So right? It's really nice to be able to put everything that has resource limitation in an economic framework, right?

49:55.800 --> 50:00.800
So attention, mental capacity is limited. So we have to decide how to engage it.

50:00.800 --> 50:05.800
Either I'm attending to one thing, that means I'm not attending to the other.

50:05.800 --> 50:14.800
And we engage our mental life in order to obtain some benefit. Whatever that is, utility, right?

50:14.800 --> 50:20.800
But optimally or rationally, we want to obtain that benefit with the minimum of effort.

50:20.800 --> 50:28.800
So in that framework, mental life is a cost that if we, everything being equal, I'd rather not pay, right?

50:28.800 --> 50:38.800
So if you give me a choice between doing something that's a bit more difficult and a bit more easy, if you don't pay me extra, I'll just go for the easy stuff, right?

50:38.800 --> 50:46.800
That's our theory. That's the state of our theories that people go by. And of course that opens the question, well, then why are we curious?

50:46.800 --> 50:54.800
Why are people reading books for no apparent benefit when you just go to sleep to conserve energy?

50:54.800 --> 51:00.800
Things like that, right? So clearly that little definition that we're working on is very incomplete.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.800
And anyway, so I was wondering what do you think about that?

51:03.800 --> 51:11.800
Well, I think that's a great question. And so you could summarize that maybe as this cognitive miserly model, right?

51:11.800 --> 51:18.800
This idea that we want to reduce our expenditure of resources and we want to...

51:18.800 --> 51:26.800
Now, so sometimes people when they hear me say that the state of being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive, they say, well, wait a second.

51:26.800 --> 51:34.800
How does that jive with this cognitive miserly idea? But I don't see a conflict there because I'm not...

51:34.800 --> 51:44.800
You know, a cognitive miserly model is about the exertion of effort, right? And there are ways to be cognitively engaged that don't necessarily require a lot of cognitive effort.

51:44.800 --> 51:54.800
So you think about reverie, daydream, mind wandering. These are all ways of being engaged mentally that don't involve cognitive effort.

51:54.800 --> 52:01.800
However, you brought up some other examples like curiosity, which I think is an interesting example.

52:01.800 --> 52:12.800
And you might argue, well, curiosity sometimes does require the exertion of effort and therefore it might be contradictory with this miserly model.

52:12.800 --> 52:29.800
And, you know, I don't have a kind of a solution to that paradox when it comes to curiosity, but I feel confident that we can say that being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive without it being in conflict with this miserly model.

52:29.800 --> 52:34.800
And I think the miserly model, as you're pointing out, is too simplistic, right?

52:34.800 --> 52:47.800
That certainly there are times in which affectance motivation, like we're motivated to demonstrate our competence, to be effective in the world, to make changes.

52:47.800 --> 52:54.800
And that sometimes requires effort. And so I think the miserly model is...

52:54.800 --> 53:04.800
Which has its base in this very narrow cognitive science kind of paradigm, is...

53:04.800 --> 53:07.800
Doesn't apply more broadly when we look at human life.

53:07.800 --> 53:17.800
Maybe I don't know if this affects or where there's a cognitive miserly model, but maybe one pathway into it is to broaden the definition of what payback is.

53:17.800 --> 53:24.800
Because you talk about, okay, I want to do something for the least possible effort if you're only going to pay me x, y, z.

53:24.800 --> 53:38.800
And I'm thinking, you know, just in a very practical, basic term, translations I've done that have taken me enormous amounts of time and enormous amounts of effort, and for which I've gotten, you know, one nth the amount that I would usually charge for one of these, because I just wanted to do it.

53:38.800 --> 53:40.800
It was a labor of love, right?

53:40.800 --> 53:49.800
And so the payback there is my satisfaction in taking the time and putting in the effort to do what I consider a good job and being able to then read it and say,

53:49.800 --> 53:56.800
ooh, that's actually pretty good. That's my payback. I mean, the monetary part is fine, but if it were only because of that, I just wouldn't have done it at that rate.

53:56.800 --> 54:09.800
And if you talk about why people engage in altruistic events or why they, you know, why they do things that don't seem to have any particular return, the return is, you know, potentially the return is, in fact, that feeling of having to be able to do it.

54:09.800 --> 54:13.800
And so that's, in fact, that feeling of having engaged in some sort of altruistic effort.

54:13.800 --> 54:23.800
This reminds me a little bit of what we were talking about earlier about the very small valence attached to pain or boredom, and I think the same thing applies to reward.

54:23.800 --> 54:31.800
We have this new model, new-ish model about how dopamine functioning in the brain and the midbrain affects our anticipation of reward.

54:31.800 --> 54:40.800
And bear in mind, actually, that can easily become too simplistic a model where we think, oh, reward equals dopamine, and that's clearly wrong.

54:40.800 --> 54:46.800
But it's because actually, I was careful to say, the anticipation of reward is different from reward, right?

54:46.800 --> 54:51.800
And so what we, each of us, imagines will be the reward if I do X, Y, or Z.

54:51.800 --> 54:54.800
They have a greater bearing on what we end up doing in the world.

54:54.800 --> 55:11.800
And I do mean, again, just like with the issue about a slight bit of pain in one's joints, if I'm sitting somewhere and I'm just idle and I suddenly see a bottle of water, let's say I just want to move it because it's not where I want it to be, or let's say I'm thirsty.

55:11.800 --> 55:25.800
And a very small valence of interest then motivates me to get up and move and to do it.

55:25.800 --> 55:30.800
And I suppose that does involve something to do with the dopamine that's going through my brain.

55:30.800 --> 55:41.800
I'm sort of a background activity in the brain, and it's interesting to note in keeping with our talk about boredom not being a passive state.

55:41.800 --> 55:52.800
And again, I want to be careful not to equate boredom to the default mode network, but the default mode network, which is sort of how our brain seems to be functioning, the network connections between parts of our brain,

55:52.800 --> 56:04.800
and that's also not a very passive thing, and that's part of the thing that's interesting about it, it's actually an active state that needs to be sustained in some fashion.

56:04.800 --> 56:14.800
And so I know that then switching from that idle state to a more, you know, a salient state where things become interesting and I might want to choose to do X, Y, or Z.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
That's an important area, right?

56:16.800 --> 56:21.800
And I think we have to carefully imagine where might boredom fit in there in that paradigm.

56:21.800 --> 56:31.800
There's not very much, but I think one of the areas that's really exciting is looking for the neural and the physiological signatures of boredom.

56:31.800 --> 56:39.800
So you've already mentioned the default mode network, which is active when you're sort of at rest or when you're engaged in internal thought and internal reverie,

56:39.800 --> 56:44.800
and the central executive network when you're engaged with kind of tasks in the world, right?

56:44.800 --> 56:48.800
I'm trying to figure out something in front of me.

56:48.800 --> 56:56.800
And certainly when you are bored, the default mode network is more active than when you are engaged in some activity.

56:56.800 --> 57:07.800
But importantly, you know, there was a study done by a colleague of mine, James Danker at the University of Waterloo, where they compared someone in a bored state versus a resting state.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.800
And there is a difference, right?

57:09.800 --> 57:22.800
So the insular cortex is another part of the brain that is thought amongst other things to be involved in helping you toggle back and forth between the default mode network and the central executive network,

57:22.800 --> 57:27.800
and is also responsible for tagging saliency in our environment.

57:27.800 --> 57:38.800
And so I'm going well beyond the data in my interpretation here, and this is only one study, but one way of interpreting this is that the person is having a hard time shifting out of the default mode network.

57:38.800 --> 57:48.800
So there's this kind of, you're stuck where you can't disengage from the one and engage in the other, the other neural network.

57:48.800 --> 57:57.800
So indeed, you know, just to summarize, the default mode network is quite centrally involved in boredom, but it's not equivalent with boredom.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.800
There are some very important distinctions.

57:59.800 --> 58:09.800
In fact, external movements are also very different when you are bored, sometimes you're young.

58:09.800 --> 58:12.800
It's totally different too.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.800
There's a thought actually yawning.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.800
I read something about yawning being involved in this toggling.

58:17.800 --> 58:19.800
Did I make that up?

58:19.800 --> 58:21.800
Or do you know whether?

58:21.800 --> 58:22.800
I don't know.

58:22.800 --> 58:33.800
I think I saw some reference where they mentioned that yawning actually helps someone sort of switch out of the default mode network, which is perfectly in keeping with what you're saying.

58:33.800 --> 58:46.800
So when I think about curiosity, again, with very little data, but the way I imagine this, so if the default mode network is engaged in resting state and it's involved in mind wandering, all kinds of mind wandering.

58:46.800 --> 58:51.800
So people, when they don't do anything, people do stuff.

58:51.800 --> 59:01.800
There are studies that probe the thoughts, and usually you're planning stuff on most of the time, and sometimes it's other things like singing songs or reciting stuff.

59:01.800 --> 59:08.800
So that's associated with the default mode network, but that's a resting state which is not boring.

59:08.800 --> 59:18.800
So if you can, so the way I imagine this working is that if you can engage your default mode network together with your memories and somehow engage the reward system, then you're happy.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
You're in a good mental state.

59:20.800 --> 59:26.800
But there must be some other state where you're resting and you can't engage that whole network and then you're not happy.

59:26.800 --> 59:27.800
I agree well put.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.800
What I was trying to get at is you're in between the two.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.800
You can't get into one mode.

59:33.800 --> 59:37.800
You can't activate one neural network fully or the other.

59:37.800 --> 59:45.800
And so I do see mind wandering to be a consequence of boredom in situations where you're constrained and you can't leave.

59:45.800 --> 59:51.800
You might mind wander as a way to engage your cognitive resources and therefore to not be bored.

59:51.800 --> 59:55.800
And when you're able to do that, then you just see default mode network.

59:55.800 --> 01:00:04.800
But when you're being told you have to pay attention to this and you don't really want to, and you're trying to daydream at the same time, it all gets bungled up.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.800
Then there's an interesting loop where you become interested in what your mind's wandering over.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800
Sure.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.800
And that becomes salient in of itself.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
Sure.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.800
And what is that exactly?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.800
And how does the brain adapt or respond in those circumstances?

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:29.800
Because I think people who are creative almost certainly are sort of riffing off these sort of mind wandering events and then paying attention to it and developing it.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.800
And it's interesting.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:39.800
I think maybe this is shifting the topic a little bit, but I'd be very interested to hear what you think about this in terms of curiosity.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:46.800
Because there's a psychologist that talked to you use this term constructive internal reflection.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:54.800
And she was referring to that mind wandering state when you are kind of riffing and that creativity is happening.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.800
And I think what happens with boredom is we often go to the external world for salvation, right?

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800
We're for relief.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:09.800
And I think that short circuits the capacity to develop that constructive internal reflection as a skill or as an ability.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800
And a resource.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800
Yeah.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:23.800
And I think culturally we're in a culture right now where our attention is being yanked around by the collar from all these exogenous demands, right?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.800
Look here, do this.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:32.800
I mean, standing in Times Square, you know, from the big town of Toronto and Times Square is overwhelming, right?

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.800
And your attention is just drawn everywhere.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:43.800
And what happens is that capacity for constructive internal reflection or for endogenous control of attention can sort of atrophy.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:52.800
And I think boredom can maybe push us to seek out that external stimulation as a short term solution to our problems.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.800
But in the long term, it may actually end up really making the situation worse.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:08.800
And so I think that some way you're saying about creativity and about that internal reflection being adaptive kind of pulls it together, right?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800
That's right.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Well, maybe because part of it is to, you know, if you can focus on one thing that's calling for your attention or if you're bored and you focus on one response to it in a creative way,

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:24.800
that does imply some kind of engagement and depth that you have to then go into.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.800
Whereas if it's the Times Square model, you can't.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.800
You know, you start moving in one direction, but there's this other thing calling you there and you never really go anywhere.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.800
There's no attention really paid.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800
It's just constantly.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.800
I mean, the question is, do you get bored in Times Square?

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800
Yeah.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.800
Shall I open it to questions?

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:55.800
Just follow each other in one afternoon.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.800
Dr. Priest, we're really happy to know that you got me thinking, but it was something I was irritated about.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800
Okay.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:11.800
But then you changed it a little bit and I think that it was argued.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:20.800
It was the word you used first, looking for the right word, and you would say the word unengaged.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:35.800
And the grammatical word is disengaged, right? And disengaged for me carries an ethical aspect to it.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:45.800
If a patient would say to me that they were bored, I would say, is there something that you want to do that would be engaged?

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:54.800
Engage you. Something, you know, save the world, help your family, you know, something like that.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:03.800
In other words, it's key to taking some kind of action and actions have ethical aspects.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:21.800
But I'm very glad that you, and not only that everybody started using that term, being engaged, which is a very different than something which is neurological, essentially neurological.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.800
So could you comment on that?

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.800
Well, I'm glad you brought that up.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.800
And I think there's a really important idea here that's fairly complicated, right?

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.800
And there's a number of elements to your comment, to your question.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.800
Engaged is a description of my relationship with something else, right?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:56.800
So I'm engaged with this or I'm not engaged with it, and it's action-oriented, like you said, and as you said, it contains ethical implications, you know, what I choose to engage with, or whether I commit myself to something or not.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:03.800
Unengaged is a description of sort of my cognitive resources, and they are not being utilized.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.800
A way to utilize them would be to become engaged.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:24.800
But I think it's important for me to define boredom in a context-free way, because if you try to define it in a way that is linked to disengagement, then you need the context to define the state.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:34.800
But if you define the state as this unengaged state, then it is a definition that sort of transcends the context.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
I think said that.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:47.800
I think I would agree with all of your points about the ethical connotations of this topic and the importance of seeing the solution through engagement.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:54.800
Thank you.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:01.800
My name is Ronald Aldas from the Paris Analytica, it's a political society, and I apologize for my English.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:09.800
So I have one comment and one question for Mr. Polisotti.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:19.800
I'd like to emphasize the importance of time when we speak of boredom, Brodsky's invasion of time.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:29.800
And this preoccupation of time goes and about how to avoid boredom goes far beyond the enlightenment.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:39.800
I don't know if you know about Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:55.800
It's a beautiful story because Duke of Ferrara in Italy, the family Deste, one of the dukes in the 14th century built a new palace.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.800
And he called it Palazzo Schifanoia.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:10.800
Schifanoia in Italian is Esquivare La Noya, which is to avoid boredom.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:24.800
And he commissioned two painters, so the Renaissance, to paint frescoes on the walls of a room, which is called Ilcello to the Emesi.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:36.800
The room of the month, because these two painters, the Francesco de la Cosa and Cosmetura, which are very important painters for the Renaissance,

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.800
they painted the month of a year.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.800
So it's about time.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:08:00.800
So this preoccupation of boredom led them to a critical creation of representing the time.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:17.800
That's my first comment. And the time is also important because it's maybe leading us to Melancholia and to Melancholia to engage mentally through things.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:32.800
But for example, our patients, very often they are not able to engage because they're not able to, they're not no capacity for cateches.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.800
And that's also about boredom.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.800
Time is everything in boredom.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.800
Is everything.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:47.800
And the relationship just pay attention to the world in German, Lang Bile, on the opposite, could spy.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.800
Lang Bile, the time is long. It does pass.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.800
The subjective impression that the time is not passing.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:08.800
And sometimes the feeling we are experiencing when we are bored is because we feel bad of being spending or time in doing anything or time passes.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:18.800
And the question for you is, as a translator of Kustaf Lubehr, could you say some words on Madame Bovari?

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:25.800
Just to find the words that you can say about Madame Bovari.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.800
If we speak about boredom, we can't avoid Madame Bovari.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:40.800
I suppose the simplest one could say is that she's a good case study and the self-destructive behavior.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.800
The one can indulge in if one is bored.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:56.800
In the French archives, the term Bovari, I don't know if you use it in America, it's a very particular kind of boredom.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:10.800
In the sense that there's something, you know, sort of a grass is always greener kind of a sense that there's this ideal out there that can be attained and that in fact doesn't really exist.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.800
You also brought up something that told you up.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:25.800
You brought up one thing that I actually actually, we might not have time to touch on here, but I'd be curious at some point to know what the scientists and the philosophers think of the relationship between boredom and depression.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:35.800
Because it seems to me that you alluded to this, that those two also have a connection and that boredom and depression might be maybe two sides of the same coin.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.800
I don't know.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:49.800
Sure, yeah, I mean in reference to that, I was about, I don't mean it whatsoever to reduce what you said so well to discussions of neurotransmitters and such.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:11:08.800
There is a nice correspondence here, which is related to the way time is perceived in people based on their sort of how much dopamine we have, sort of, of coursing, there are veins, and you know, the most famous case of someone having a very long, low amount of dopamine

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:18.800
with Parkinson's disease who are almost like moving in slow motion, right, their time is much slowed and their time senses is changed as well.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800
And that's very interesting.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:29.800
Depression, of course, has all sorts of effects in all different neurotransmitters in the brain when one is depressed, but one of the changes, again, is an effect on dopamine levels.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:40.800
Some people, especially elderly patients, when they become depressed, they can actually appear somewhat Parkinsonian, we say, because their dopamine levels have dropped sufficiently for that to be manifest.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:56.800
And so there is the same issue, if dopamine is the sort of stimulus, let's say, that makes us move here or there or elsewhere, and when that is at low ebb, we don't have that sort of guide us forward.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.800
And that doesn't mean our desires or wishes are gone, and that's important.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.800
And I think because they're not gone, that may be a recipe for feeling bored, right?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.800
But Andrea had a question.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:09.800
And so you mentioned the distinction between boredom and apathy.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.800
So it seems to me that you could be depressed, and I don't know if this is true.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:25.800
So you could be depressed and not, I mean, be so apathetic that you're actually not bored, because you don't want, can't even imagine, don't even want to get out of this state.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.800
Because you don't, right?

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.800
And whereas boredom could actually be an improvement of that, the desire to, you know, experience something else.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800
You hid it perfectly.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800
That's right.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:46.800
They very much do overlap, and it's a very common bit of confusion for family members and caregivers to people with Parkinson's, for example, that they think of them that they're depressed.

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.800
Just because they are so apathetic.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:55.800
And so there are pure forms of apathy where there's no boredom involved, they have no wishes.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.800
And then there's sort of, it could shade from one to the other, and you're, again, correct.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.800
If you move towards feeling a restless sort of boredom, that's a movement in the right direction.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Yeah.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.800
It seems that we use the word boredom very, likely, very easily.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800
That's right.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
In all different ways.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800
Yeah.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:21.800
There's so much more that could be said about boredom and depression, so I won't get into that, but they are very much linked developmentally across time.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:31.800
The time is a really important point, which we didn't talk about today, but, you know, it is part of the definition, that phenomenological feeling of the slow passage of time.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:35.800
And we've already heard about the relationship between dopamine and the perception of time passing.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:43.800
We also know that cognitively, when you are not engaged, there's a sense of time passing slowly as well.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.800
And so we know that boredom prone people don't judge the passage of time well.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:57.800
And in our studies, when we try to manipulate and make people bored, we rig the passage of time as one of our variables to try to change that.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.800
And then there's time, but then there's things happening in that time, too, right?

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:08.800
And so you can think about boredom as sort of everything is happening at that moment, and nothing is about to happen, right?

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:19.800
And so you think about, you know, the difference between art versus sort of pornography or propaganda, right?

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.800
And in propaganda, pornography is all there.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800
What you see is what you get.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.800
There's nothing more, whereas art kind of draws you in.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:33.800
There's that sense of walking through the garden, and as you turn a corner, a new vista presents itself, a new possibility.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.800
And in boredom, that stops, right? That possibility of more stops.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.800
So there's time, but then there's also what is happening within that time that's important to think about it.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:50.800
And the worry was not depressed. It was for David.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.800
It was.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.800
The conversation has been anything but boring.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.800
Two quick questions and a quick comment.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:06.800
I'm wondering about mindfulness and meditation and the effect on being bored, being boredom.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:14.800
The second question is, are curious people less bored and can curiosity be in fact an antidote to boredom?

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:22.800
And the third is just a pedestrian definition of perhaps boredom is just the nanosecond before we reach for our phones.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.800
These things.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.800
Nanobordum.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.800
Oh, being nanobordum.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800
Microbordum.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.800
I can say a few things about those questions.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.800
On the issue of about mindfulness, there's a little bit of research on mindfulness and boredom.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:44.800
And as you would expect, people that are high in trait mindfulness or people who regularly practice mindfulness meditation,

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:52.800
when put in a vigilance task or a sustained attention task, which is very, very boring, trust me.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.800
We just have to watch a computer screen for a rare kind of event that may happen and then press a button.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:12.800
People that are high in trait mindfulness experience less boredom and less discomfort and less agitation during those kinds of potentially boring situations.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:23.800
So indeed, mindfulness prevents or protects one from boredom and there's some open questions about precisely why.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:31.800
One idea is that mindfulness actually results in the strengthening of a tensional capacity so that you then can attend more effectively.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:39.800
But there's also the idea that mindfulness may make you less emotionally reactive to the state of being under aroused.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:46.800
And we just have one study that we haven't published yet where we're looking at this and so far the data seems to be more consistent with the idea

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:54.800
that mindfulness has its beneficial effects via that emotional reactivity pathway not through an increasing attention capacity.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.800
So they're definitely related and curiosity.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.800
Yeah, did you want to speak to that issue?

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.800
Yeah, so I think it all goes back to this.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:15.800
So yes, I would definitely think that more curious people are less bored and I think it all goes back to this idea of being able

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.800
to generate questions.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:30.800
So the key about curiosity is the way we think it works is that you encounter a situation that triggers a bunch of hypotheses in your mind.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800
What could be happening here?

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800
It could be XYZ.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.800
And then it's the willingness to engage and answer the question.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.800
That's how it works.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:47.800
So in a sense it goes back to the same thing as being able to generate mental activity which is then very satisfying.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.800
So answering those questions is very rewarding.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.800
It goes back to those internal rewards that I think fuels human civilization.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.800
I mean without, if we didn't have curiosity we'd still be back in the caves I think.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.800
But anyway, so yes, so it's exactly the antithesis.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:11.800
And I think of boredom I guess as the failure in some way to trigger that mental activity.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:20.800
I would add, I'm hoping that your John's last interpretation of how mindfulness might work.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.800
I actually, I don't know if it's true, but I like that.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800
I agree with it.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:32.800
That is that if you feel more comfortable managing the state of being idle minded let's say and not get tense and stressed about it

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.800
and actually think I can master it.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:40.800
That might be a way also to master being able to focus your attention when you want to be able to focus it.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800
Not getting anxious about it.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.800
I think to the other topic we didn't talk on very much that relates to your question, your comment or your question about curiosity

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.800
is that I think this is something all educators would really say yes, a big thumbs up.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.800
We want to be able to cultivate curiosity in people.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.800
And how do we go about that?

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.800
What are the different mechanisms by which we do it?

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:08.800
I think art and science and literature are our most common ways that we try to do that with people.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.800
And I think there's proof that it works.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:17.800
Yeah, so emotional reactivity is very important and there are some studies on that.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:21.800
It actually affects memory.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.800
They're direct studies on memory.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:29.800
So the way that you remember an item or an event depends on the circumstances.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:36.800
So in the laboratory we can motivate memory, for example by rewards or by avoiding punishments.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.800
We can put somebody in a task.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.800
And it's been shown that the encoding of information differs in those two contexts.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:46.800
So if you're motivated by rewards you encode more incidental information.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:50.800
There's more of richer context that's being stored.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.800
Whereas motivation by punishment, which presumably induces anxiety, narrows the focus.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:02.800
It's interesting because all of these seem to be too systematic about it.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:07.800
Sort of a dividing line on the one hand you have boredom and anxiety.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:15.800
And it goes back to the example of the kid who can't get the math so he gets bored with the study of math

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.800
because he's afraid, he's anxious about it.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:22.800
Versus curiosity and ease, curiosity and comfort.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.800
Which is that when you are more comfortable with the state of not doing anything and having to focus your attention

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.800
in a way that many people might find boring you're actually less bored by it.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:39.800
There's kind of a, again, a sort of reward of self-fulfillment that comes from those sectors.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.800
Thank you.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.800
Yes, thank you all very much for this.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:51.800
I'm a person who qualifies as essentially very bored.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:59.800
My name is Nancy Garnier, I'm a musician and performing and teaching.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:07.800
My memory as a child was of incredible boredom except when I was playing the piano mostly fooling around.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:14.800
And when I was about 12, I hit on something in a book by a composer.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800
I knew nothing about anything.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.800
My family was not into classical music at all.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.800
It was within a sonata by Mozart.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:30.800
It wasn't the piece, it was specific sounds within that piece that just blew my mind.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:36.800
I thought, oh, there's been a person in the world who hears as I hear.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:45.800
I then subsequently found that the field of music was not at all interested in that quality of hearing.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.800
That rather, it was assumed that people heard a certain way.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800
I don't believe that's true.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.800
I still don't believe that that's true.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:22:03.800
I believe that this power of shared intensity is epitomized in the action of hearing.

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.800
It's become my life's work, in fact.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:15.800
The thing that has meant most to me in putting together my incredible capacity for boredom

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:25.800
and the intensity of my reaction to specific sounds was measured by A. James Huddspith at Rockefeller University

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:33.800
who found out that there are 16,000 moving hair cells over here in your cochlea

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:44.800
and 16,000 over there and that they impart information to the brain 200 times faster than any other sense perception.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:55.800
When I tell this to a child, a student who's eight years old, they go, wow, and there's no possible way they can get bored.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:57.800
None. It's gone.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:10.800
There's so much happening. It just totally transformed my ability to take in all kinds of information from disabled students to, I don't know, all kinds of people.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:19.800
Anyway, I've joined the Society for Music Cognition and Music Perception and Cognition to my astonishment.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:27.800
They have bought into this kind of mangle ironed approach to listening.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:33.800
So the examples they study are all recorded. They've all been listened to a million times.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:39.800
They're all, it's like hand green beans. It's such a massive disappointment to me.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:53.800
I just throw out to you, you're studying boredom, to consider the dynamic of hearing and how it can inform vision.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:24:00.800
Usually it's the reverse, that vision is used to kind of quiet the hearing down so it won't be so intense.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.800
Is that a question? I don't know. I hope so.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:13.800
It's certainly an inspiring story. I'll say this about what you said. I don't know if this is so. I'd ask you more questions to find out.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:23.800
I think you brought up something very interesting about how having an experience of a shared experience played such an important role in unlocking your feeling of curiosity.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:27.800
Because you said, oh, someone heard this and intended it the way I hear things.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:36.800
And that idea of empathy obviously played a role. And I think that's why the best teachers are often the ones who in part of feeling of empathy in their students.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:50.800
I think it also brings up, you know, this without any scientific basis to say so, that to me instinctively it makes perfect sense that people hear things different ways and that it does bring up what I think we were touching on before about, you know, part of curiosity

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:59.800
or boredom has to do also with personal response. The same reason that someone could be very moved by Mozart and someone else could be very moved by Ozzy Osborn.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:04.800
And, you know, who's to say that it's, who's to say that there's a, you know, a wrong or a right answer there. It just depends on.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.800
Oh, okay. I'm not going to get a answer.

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:16.800
Yeah, so let me give, I want to give a little perspective because you mentioned studies of the year of the cochlea and so on.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:27.800
So in neuroscience, again, I think this is, I come back to this topic of how early we are in neuroscience because, I mean, there's a magic to all the senses.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:33.800
I mean, vision is incredibly rich. All factions is incredibly rich. Hearing as well.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:39.800
But in neuroscience, we study them separately, just like you said, in the field of music cognition.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:47.800
So we study the receptors as some just engineering systems input and how things are represented.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:55.800
And then when we study other things like emotions and decision making, that's a different topic, like the different world, different people.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:02.800
And clearly, there's an enormous interface there because the way much of our pleasure comes from interacting with the world.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:12.800
And there's enormous variability there and how people sense and hear things. And the emotion, anyway, all of that is totally unexplored.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.800
I was just going to say one other thing about the other thing I heard in your story there was the importance.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.800
I would call that of sort of doing ecologically valid research, right?

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:30.800
And so you know the joke about, you know, you come to the parking lot and there's the drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost, you know, and you say, what are you doing?

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:35.800
I'm looking for my keys. Where'd you lose them over there? Why are you looking here? Because the light's better, right?

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:42.800
And so, you know, I think a lot of science can be characterized in that manner, right?

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:49.800
So, you know, I hold that, but I still hold my earlier comments about our need for more precision, right?

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.800
And so it's a balance. It's a balancing act. But thank you for your story.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:07.800
I have one more real quick comment about what you said. I don't know the author. What is a recent study of infants that showed that they observed the effort being made by their parents doing some tasks, some tasks that may be frustrating.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.800
And the infants knew, saw the difference between the parents making an effort or not.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.800
I don't know how they measured the outcome, but there was some sort of outcome.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.800
This is in nature. It was not a obscure journal or anything like that.

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:26.800
But it was interesting that that idea of empathy, and that's important to someone else, important to me.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.800
So that must be important. And as a way of engendering curiosity, you can see that be rather potent.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:40.800
I would want to thank all of you for such an interesting conversation.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:47.800
I live in this neighborhood in which there are a lot of children of working parents,

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:58.800
a number of whom have wherewithal, and increasingly, children go to school after school have a lot of activities that are assigned.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:05.800
Gymnastics, art, whatever. It's sort of like little channels.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:12.800
And in between, I've observed, they will say, I'm bored when one activity is over. I'm bored.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:24.800
And as if they say to them, it will be around. As if that's their responsibility to find how it should be resolved.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:31.800
And I wonder, do you mention internal reflection?

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:38.800
What happens to that in that kind of a situation where you're not allowed to be bored,

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:50.800
or it quickly has to be resolved, whereas another time children were left supposedly to their own finding their own answers to these things?

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:56.800
One metaphor that might speak to that from George Simmel, a sociologist, many years ago,

01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.800
he talked about the relationship between technology and boredom, and how they collude with one another.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:06.800
We're hearing lots about collusion, so the idea that boredom and technology collude.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:15.800
And on this particular issue, the idea is that using technology is like falling into a fast-moving river where you can forget how to swim.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:22.800
The river carries you along, and you don't even need to know how to swim anymore. You just, before you know it, you're downstream.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:29.800
And so I would use that metaphor to communicate the idea that if your time is structured exogenously,

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:37.800
if your attention is directed exogenously, the capacity to endogenously direct your attention may atrophy.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.800
Now, I can't say this based on any kind of research finding at this point,

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:47.800
but this is certainly something that we're trying to see if we can bring under the light, the lamp post,

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.800
of science to see if we can kind of actually quantify that sort of effect.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:52.800
What loss is there?

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.800
What happens then?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:01.800
I mean, to put it very metaphorically, it's like a skill that atrophes.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:05.800
When we're born, we have a hard time directing our attention, right?

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:10.800
Our attention is very much stimulus bound. There's a rattle over here.

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:18.800
And then it takes some development for us to be able to disengage from that and to engage in internal reflection.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:21.800
And so this is a skill that needs to be taught and needs to be developed.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.800
And I think the excessive use of technology may short circuit opportunities to develop that skill.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.800
And it's not only technology. I mean, I completely agree.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:33.800
And I think, you know, I hear what you're saying about those children, and I see it a lot myself.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.800
You know, we are not in a society that actually fosters that sense of self-reliance.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:46.800
And the beneficial effects of being bored, i.e., using your own devices to mentally come out of that state

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:51.800
and to actually use it to some kind of positive, you know, that creative capacity that we were talking about earlier on.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:55.800
You know, standing in the subway. I try to read when I'm in the subway.

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.800
But there are announcements all the time that have nothing to do with anything.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.800
There are people talking. You know, there's just, you're constantly stimulated.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.800
When I was in, when I lived in Boston, there was this one moment that, thank goodness, only lasted about a week.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:14.800
It was an experiment. And I think they must have gotten a lot of complaints where they suddenly started blasting music on the platform

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:19.800
so that, God forbid, you should be bored for two seconds or actually, you know, alone with your thoughts

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:25.800
while waiting for the train to come. And I want my thoughts. I want a little bit of quiet.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.800
I want to actually find out what's going on in there.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:46.800
That's like going into a doctor's office where they're playing some kind of medical TV or something.
