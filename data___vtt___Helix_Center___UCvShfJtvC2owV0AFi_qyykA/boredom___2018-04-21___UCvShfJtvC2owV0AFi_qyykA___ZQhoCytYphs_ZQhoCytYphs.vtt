WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
which she investigates using behavioral, computational,

00:03.680 --> 00:06.000
and neurophysiological methods.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.040
The central goal of her research is to understand cognition

00:09.040 --> 00:13.480
as an adaptive process whereby the brain dynamically allocates

00:13.480 --> 00:16.240
its resources to best serve the demands

00:16.240 --> 00:19.600
of a decision situation.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.120
Gerald Hurwitz, Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology

00:24.120 --> 00:26.160
and on faculty for the past 30 years

00:26.160 --> 00:29.800
at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.120
He has a full-time clinical practice in psychopharmacology

00:33.120 --> 00:36.280
and neuropsychiatry in New York City.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.440
Dr. Hurwitz is a founder and chief medical officer

00:39.440 --> 00:43.440
at M3 Information and Information Technology Company

00:43.440 --> 00:45.720
that focuses on mental health integration

00:45.720 --> 00:47.800
into primary care.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.960
He has authored and co-authored many texts

00:50.960 --> 00:55.520
in the fields of psychopharmacology and neuropsychiatry.

00:55.520 --> 00:58.240
Dr. Hurwitz received a master's degree in philosophy

00:58.240 --> 01:02.960
from NYU, an MD from Jefferson Medical College,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.680
and a Bachelor of Arts, Physics and Philosophy from Yale.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.240
Your biography is too long.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.000
It's actually boring.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.840
Mark Polisati has translated more than 50 books

01:20.840 --> 01:23.600
from the French, including works by Flabeille,

01:23.600 --> 01:28.360
Miliano, D'Oras, Touton, and Raymond Roussell,

01:28.360 --> 01:31.400
a chivalier of the Algaredesar, Edeletta,

01:31.400 --> 01:36.040
and the recipient of a 2016 American Academy of Arts

01:36.040 --> 01:38.000
and Letters Award for Literature.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.280
He's the author of 11 books, including Revolution of the Mind,

01:42.280 --> 01:49.160
The Life of Envoy Bouton, Luis Bunuel's Las Alvidadas,

01:49.160 --> 01:54.280
Bob Dylan Highway 61 Revisited, and Sympathy for the Trader,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.720
a translation manifesto.

01:56.720 --> 02:00.880
His essays and reviews have appeared endlessly.

02:00.880 --> 02:03.280
The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, Art News,

02:03.280 --> 02:07.120
The Nation, Parnassas, Partisan Review Book Form, and elsewhere.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.360
And he directs the publications program

02:10.360 --> 02:15.040
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.360
Josefa Rosvelasco is associate in the Department

02:20.360 --> 02:23.920
of Romance Languages and Literature at Harvard University.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.760
And I don't know about pronouncing this,

02:26.760 --> 02:31.480
but Annrielle Callegio Complutense.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.080
Real Callegio Complutense.

02:33.080 --> 02:33.920
Thank you.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
Annrielle.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.040
Post-doctoral fellow.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.320
She is conducting multi-disciplinary research

02:43.320 --> 02:45.200
on the evolutionary role of boredom

02:45.200 --> 02:48.080
from a philosophical anthropological point of view

02:48.080 --> 02:51.040
to argue against the widespread understanding of boredom

02:51.040 --> 02:53.480
as a pathological personality trait,

02:53.480 --> 02:56.880
whereby medicalization of such a common daily annoyance

02:56.880 --> 02:58.440
is legitimized.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.640
As part of this approach, she is examining

03:00.640 --> 03:04.080
how the comprehension of boredom in terms of a mental disease

03:04.080 --> 03:07.360
has gradually formed historically as a result of the act

03:07.360 --> 03:09.880
of taking at face value the metaphor of boredom

03:09.880 --> 03:13.200
as an illness especially represented in 19th century

03:13.200 --> 03:15.360
Western literature and philosophy.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.360
She's editor and author of the books, Feminism, Past, Present

03:19.360 --> 03:22.720
and Future Perspectives, Contemporary Approaches

03:22.720 --> 03:25.240
in Philosophical and Humanistic Thought,

03:25.240 --> 03:31.200
and Hans Blumenberg, Lidlatera, Estetica, I Nihilismo,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.280
and of academic papers such as Hans Blumenberg's

03:34.280 --> 03:37.440
Philosophical Anthropology of Boredom.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.880
Boredom Humanizing or Dehumanizing Treatment,

03:40.880 --> 03:44.680
boredom, a comprehensive study of the state of affairs.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.920
She's currently working on her next book, History of Boredom,

03:47.920 --> 03:51.120
the Way Towards the Path, The Ligization of Boredom

03:51.120 --> 03:53.120
and Its Alternatives.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.720
In the future, she would like to read a research project

03:55.720 --> 03:59.360
on boredom in old age and the improvement of seniors'

03:59.360 --> 04:01.280
quality of life in old people's homes

04:01.280 --> 04:04.040
by paying attention to the phenomenon of boredom.

04:04.040 --> 04:07.040
So that's my introduction.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.040
Thank you all for being here, world.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.040
And you have missed your comments such a beautiful day.

04:16.040 --> 04:22.040
And I thought again, I'd like to mark.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
I'm glad to have you.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.040
I'm glad to have you.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.040
You can't hear me as well.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
Oh, my goodness.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.040
Yeah, right.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.040
Well, it doesn't matter.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.040
To begin, I'd like Mark Politzati to say if you

04:37.040 --> 04:41.040
introductory words on our subject.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.040
Hello, everyone.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.040
Thank you indeed for being here.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.040
I apologize for those who are looking at my back.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.040
I would rather you hate me than be indifferent to me.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.040
Schopenhauer wrote that the two enemies of human happiness

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
are pain and boredom.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.040
And of the two, the more fearsome is clearly boredom.

05:02.040 --> 05:06.040
We rot our brain cells with drugs or Twitter to avoid it.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.040
We willingly endanger life and limb to get away from it.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.040
Here today, I would much rather you throw tomatoes at me than yawn.

05:13.040 --> 05:19.040
So if you must walk out, please do it from anger or disgust, not from lack of interest.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.040
What is it about boredom that so frightens and discomforts us?

05:24.040 --> 05:29.040
Tolstoy defined it as the desire for desires, which speaks of a yearning,

05:29.040 --> 05:33.040
but one that can never be satisfied because it's a failure of yearning itself.

05:33.040 --> 05:37.040
The fact is boredom is hard to concentrate on.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
We get restless.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.040
We are literally driven to distraction.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.040
The desperation we feel when we're forced to endure it for long periods

05:45.040 --> 05:47.040
can be positively claustrophobic.

05:47.040 --> 05:53.040
And yet, somewhat paradoxically, boredom maintains a real hold on our imaginations.

05:53.040 --> 05:56.040
You find it unexpected references to it everywhere.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.040
Robert Museo, in his novel Three Women, writes of a group of prospectors,

06:01.040 --> 06:06.040
what caused them more suffering than food poisoning was melancholy and boredom,

06:06.040 --> 06:10.040
which seems to buttress my conviction that we'd much rather suffer physical pain

06:10.040 --> 06:13.040
than suffer tedium.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.040
Others have taken a more prescriptive approach to boredom,

06:16.040 --> 06:21.040
offering recipes on how to be a bore, that presumably really mean to tell us

06:21.040 --> 06:23.040
how not to be a bore.

06:23.040 --> 06:28.040
Voltaire's formulation was, the secret of being a bore is to tell everything.

06:28.040 --> 06:33.040
A sentiment echoed by the American humorist Bert Leston Taylor in a well-known quip,

06:33.040 --> 06:38.040
a bore is a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you.

06:38.040 --> 06:41.040
But hey, we would simply say, TMI.

06:43.040 --> 06:48.040
Still others have tried to combat boredom proactively, if not always, considerably.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.040
The surrealist leader, Andre Bertome, having cruelly humiliated

06:52.040 --> 06:57.040
one of his closest friends in public, explained afterward to his non-plus companions,

06:57.040 --> 07:01.040
it's only natural when on board to provoke an argument, even a nasty one,

07:01.040 --> 07:04.040
to avoid losing stamina.

07:04.040 --> 07:08.040
Now, you have before you five people who are going to spend the next two hours

07:08.040 --> 07:11.040
trying to engage your interest in the negation of interest,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.040
which might seem like the very definition of a fool's errand,

07:14.040 --> 07:18.040
but fear not, because for every sage who is dispirative boredom,

07:18.040 --> 07:22.040
others have zeroed in on its redeeming qualities.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.040
The American educator John Cabazzin, reflecting his work on mindfulness,

07:26.040 --> 07:31.040
points out that when you pay attention to boredom, it gets unbelievably interesting.

07:31.040 --> 07:36.040
Similarly, John Ashbury wrote in his poem, The Short Answer,

07:36.040 --> 07:39.040
Why Make Things More Difficult Than They Already Are?

07:39.040 --> 07:45.040
Because if it's boring in a different way, that'll be interesting too.

07:45.040 --> 07:50.040
Indeed, the potential of boredom to spur creativity is well known to any artist.

07:50.040 --> 07:56.040
The life of the creative man, said Susan Sontag, is led, directed, and controlled by boredom.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.040
Avoiding boredom is one of our most important purposes.

08:01.040 --> 08:05.040
And Robert M. Persig, author of Send in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,

08:05.040 --> 08:12.040
put it even more bluntly when he said that boredom always precedes a period of great creativity.

08:12.040 --> 08:17.040
Are they protesting too much, putting a happy mask over their agonized faces?

08:17.040 --> 08:21.040
Perhaps, but many are those who have written not only out of boredom,

08:21.040 --> 08:26.040
in both senses of out of, but have even made boredom their pet subject.

08:26.040 --> 08:30.040
Alberto Moravia's most celebrated novel is titled, Boredom,

08:30.040 --> 08:35.040
though it's actually about a young man's, but a bored young man's, dangerous infatuation.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.040
The decadent writer, Joris Carl-Wiesmanz,

08:38.040 --> 08:42.040
who we might call literatures, Chairman of the Board,

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
made it career, you know I was going to do that.

08:44.040 --> 08:50.040
Made a career of displaying in book after book his uninteresting society and all its works.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
If you search under boredom in the book listings on Amazon,

08:53.040 --> 08:56.040
it will return more than a hundred pages of results,

08:56.040 --> 09:01.040
suggesting that the literature of boredom is practically an industry unto itself.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.040
The mention of literature quickly steers us toward boredom's highfalutin French cousin,

09:06.040 --> 09:11.040
Henri, as well as to his German relative, Velschmätz.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.040
Even though the terms are nearly synonymous, each carries a particular resonance,

09:15.040 --> 09:18.040
and each stands apart from plain vanilla boredom,

09:18.040 --> 09:21.040
in its connotations of romantic world-weariness,

09:21.040 --> 09:26.040
of being not only bored, but extravagantly, even exotically bored.

09:26.040 --> 09:31.040
From Kierkegaard to Sartre, Henri has got something that mere boredom hasn't got,

09:31.040 --> 09:37.040
cache. So much so, in fact, that a company making protective sports gear

09:37.040 --> 09:41.040
shows it as their brand name. Here's the pitch on their website.

09:41.040 --> 09:46.040
Urban sports are extremely fun. Don't ruin the experience with the wrong gear.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.040
Choose on we.

09:50.040 --> 09:56.040
No, while on we and Velschmätz give off a paradoxical whiff of excitement and intensity,

09:56.040 --> 09:59.040
plain old boredom is just, well, boring.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.040
It's on we, stripped of its glamour. It's what we all know when we're at home.

10:04.040 --> 10:10.040
It's the tedium of the familiar. Still, I would posit that that very familiarity

10:10.040 --> 10:15.040
of the same old, same old can also be a comfort, and I'll end my remarks with one last quote.

10:15.040 --> 10:20.040
This was said not by a famous pundit, but by the woman in a couple I know,

10:20.040 --> 10:23.040
who for years have been maintaining a bicoster relationship.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.040
Once when the three of us were dining together, they were lamenting the difficulties

10:27.040 --> 10:31.040
of never quite seeing each other for long enough. And after thinking it over,

10:31.040 --> 10:35.040
she came out with one of the most romantic sentences I've ever heard.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.040
It's not that I want you here all the time, she told her partner,

10:39.040 --> 10:43.040
I just want the luxury of being bored with you. Thank you.

10:43.040 --> 10:55.040
So feel free to jump in, or if you have something you'd like to say,

10:55.040 --> 10:59.040
or if you'd like to talk about.

10:59.040 --> 11:05.040
I don't mind jumping in. First of all, I'm sitting over here just in case the tomatoes start flying.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.040
I thought I'd be as far away from Marcus I could be.

11:09.040 --> 11:15.040
I know I'm really struck as a psychiatrist with sort of a very mundane nature,

11:15.040 --> 11:19.040
everyday nature of boredom, and how it's something that's in front of us,

11:19.040 --> 11:23.040
and it's in front of everybody. A little bit like sleep every night,

11:23.040 --> 11:27.040
that's still mysterious, and I think that's really a wonderful feature of it.

11:27.040 --> 11:33.040
It was an as to the sort of interest of boredom. I make this observation for what it's worth.

11:33.040 --> 11:39.040
A recent review of two books on Jewish humor by Kathleen Shine in the York Review of Books,

11:39.040 --> 11:43.040
quotes the poet Billy Collins to say,

11:43.040 --> 11:47.040
humor's the dog that leaves the room when you call its name.

11:47.040 --> 11:53.040
It's sort of well known, and it's an old saw that if you have a clinical or critical discussion of humor,

11:53.040 --> 11:58.040
it's not funny. Humor and Mirth are sort of positive effects or feelings in emotional states,

11:58.040 --> 12:02.040
and the more you talk about them analytically, the less humor it becomes.

12:02.040 --> 12:09.040
Boredom, maybe Mirth's evil twin sibling, has a negative valence,

12:09.040 --> 12:12.040
but it seems the more we speak of it, the less boring it is.

12:12.040 --> 12:18.040
I thought that was an interesting way to start, and also I won't go on to this point now,

12:18.040 --> 12:26.040
but I wonder about Mirth as being, you know, in more literally a kind of the other side of boredom.

12:26.040 --> 12:35.040
On that point, I mean one of the things that I would like to say is that, you know,

12:35.040 --> 12:40.040
I think if you give, as you said, you know, if you give boredom at least sort of a second thought,

12:40.040 --> 12:46.040
it's sort of beguiling really and enticing, and on the one hand I think that's both a blessing

12:46.040 --> 12:55.040
and a curse for scholars of boredom, because it is so open to understanding, definition,

12:55.040 --> 13:01.040
interpretation, study in so many different ways, it's almost like, you know, this rorshock

13:01.040 --> 13:09.040
that can capture all of our thoughts, and it indeed does seem to provide an organizing framework

13:09.040 --> 13:13.040
for a lot of preoccupation and concern that people have today.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.040
So on the one hand, that's just plain fun as a scholar, right, because you can just roll around

13:17.040 --> 13:27.040
in this unconstrained, limitless landscape, but if we want to, you know, really collaborate with one another,

13:27.040 --> 13:36.040
if we want to be able to make some progress, dare I say, if that's an okay thing to say,

13:36.040 --> 13:44.040
in our understanding of boredom, that I think we need to find sort of some lingua franca that we can all work from,

13:44.040 --> 13:52.040
and we need to find some way to work together to develop some precision around terms and around the uses of our words,

13:52.040 --> 13:59.040
because the term boredom is so elastic that as a scientist it's really difficult to wrestle with it, right,

13:59.040 --> 14:03.040
when one person uses the term, that might mean something very different than another.

14:03.040 --> 14:13.040
So while I really think multi-disiliterity approaches, multi-method approaches are absolutely the way to go,

14:13.040 --> 14:20.040
I think it would be wise for us to find ways to corral and constrain our thinking,

14:20.040 --> 14:25.040
and to find ways that we can communicate across disciplines and work with each other.

14:25.040 --> 14:38.040
Yeah, I totally agree because today concerning boredom, we have to admit that we have more questions than responses, than solutions.

14:38.040 --> 14:45.040
But we all recognize that we have to do that to speak of boredom.

14:45.040 --> 14:54.040
At least we have to admit that boredom, to talk of boredom is not boring because we are all smiling all the time.

14:54.040 --> 15:00.040
So my first reaction to your presentation, your fascinating presentation,

15:00.040 --> 15:09.040
you told in one time that boredom conduct to disaster at the very beginning.

15:09.040 --> 15:18.040
So I think boredom conduct to disasters, because we are worried about boredom,

15:18.040 --> 15:25.040
especially because of the consequences of being bored,

15:25.040 --> 15:30.040
in particular of the consequences of not to be able to get rid of boredom.

15:30.040 --> 15:42.040
So I think boredom leads to disaster in two different situations when individuals are unable to give a response,

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
or reply to boredom.

15:44.040 --> 15:51.040
And also, this is the topic I use, like how you treat and psychologists are working on.

15:51.040 --> 15:57.040
And individuals have problems with regard to attention and so on.

15:57.040 --> 16:14.040
And also on the other situation, when the context is so close that doesn't offer the responses you are expecting.

16:14.040 --> 16:24.040
In this case, when the individual is not able because of their own problems, mental problems and so on,

16:24.040 --> 16:31.040
or because of the context, in this two situations when boredom leads to the disaster,

16:31.040 --> 16:44.040
I mean to behaviors that everybody could say are pathological, are deviant behaviors.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.040
Yeah, I completely agree.

16:47.040 --> 16:56.040
And I'm wondering to your point, maybe one of the things to try to distinguish between is boredom

16:56.040 --> 17:03.040
and the feeling of discomfort that we feel that we call boredom, which are maybe not quite the exact same thing,

17:03.040 --> 17:10.040
because I feel very lucky in the sense that if I'm on my own, I actually never feel bored.

17:10.040 --> 17:17.040
I mean I can feel tired, I can feel that I don't have any particular activity, I can feel lack of energy,

17:17.040 --> 17:24.040
but I don't feel bored in that sense of being almost kind of desperately anxious to get out of whatever that state is.

17:24.040 --> 17:28.040
Where I do get bored sometimes, this is when I'm in a place where I can't leave.

17:28.040 --> 17:32.040
So I mean boredom is hell is other people and so is boredom.

17:32.040 --> 17:41.040
And the classic example for me is in my day job, if I'm stuck in a meeting and I just have to be there,

17:41.040 --> 17:45.040
and sometimes they can be great but sometimes they can get really painful.

17:45.040 --> 17:53.040
And it does cause that sense of claustrophobia that I referenced, where my astral self is sort of getting up from the table

17:53.040 --> 17:56.040
and walking out of the room and going, yeah, it's running down the hall.

17:56.040 --> 18:01.040
But my physical self, because I'm sort of stuck because of the expectations of the job,

18:01.040 --> 18:08.040
are still sitting there just waiting for this thing to end, because whatever they're talking about is just a no interest whatsoever.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.040
And there's a memoir I remember reading once by the former director of the Louvre,

18:13.040 --> 18:19.040
who was talking about one of his predecessors would go to meetings of which they had zillions,

18:19.040 --> 18:22.040
and the French are even worse than we are in the museum world.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.040
And they would go to meetings at a certain point, he would just stand up and say,

18:25.040 --> 18:30.040
okay, I'm going to the movies now, and all the other curators would be sitting around the table completely non-plus

18:30.040 --> 18:34.040
because this man actually dared to do what they probably wanted to do themselves,

18:34.040 --> 18:38.040
but he actually stood up and did it and walked away and it eventually cost him his job,

18:38.040 --> 18:40.040
but it kind of didn't matter because he just didn't want to be bored anymore.

18:40.040 --> 18:51.040
The first kind of boredom, hide the gut, talk about boredom or a situation in which you are not forced to be there,

18:51.040 --> 18:53.040
but you should.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.040
You're constrained.

18:54.040 --> 19:02.040
You decide to go there voluntarily, nobody is forcing you,

19:02.040 --> 19:06.040
but you know in advance you are going to be bored.

19:06.040 --> 19:12.040
I'm not sorry if this is the first of the second kind of boredom,

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
hey, the gut talk about.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.040
I would actually take slight issue with that because the fact is that there are pressures and constraints on the,

19:18.040 --> 19:21.040
you are kind of forced, I mean you're not forced physically at gunpoint,

19:21.040 --> 19:28.040
it's not like being in jail, but the fact is that the dictates of my job and the position I have at the museum

19:28.040 --> 19:32.040
and the expectations are such that I'm expected to be in that room,

19:32.040 --> 19:37.040
I'm expected to pretend that I'm paying attention, I'm expected to pretend that I actually care what these people are talking about,

19:37.040 --> 19:43.040
and I mean obviously most of the time I do, but once in a while it's, you know, it's where I am in my salary,

19:43.040 --> 19:49.040
and this is part of the job, so there are pressures to do it.

19:49.040 --> 19:53.040
I can't just walk out, much as I would love to.

19:53.040 --> 19:59.040
I have a question about the other kind of boredom that happens when you're alone by yourself,

19:59.040 --> 20:07.040
and some people who don't get bored in that situation, and I apologize, and I think very lucky,

20:07.040 --> 20:14.040
but then other people who do get bored in that situation, what do you think is the difference?

20:14.040 --> 20:24.040
I know you've studied this a lot, and maybe related to this, what is the role of boredom in mental illness and psychopathology?

20:24.040 --> 20:27.040
Let's say, yeah there's a big topic.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
Yeah.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.040
That was why the human side board.

20:31.040 --> 20:37.040
What's the difference between people who get bored when they're by themselves and people who don't?

20:37.040 --> 20:43.040
I have a few thoughts to address a number of those issues, and please jump in.

20:43.040 --> 20:50.040
There's lots of different factors, cultural, social, environmental, psychological factors that can cause boredom, right?

20:50.040 --> 20:57.040
There's a wide variety of things, but I do think we need a clear definition of what the state of boredom is,

20:57.040 --> 21:04.040
and so I define the state of boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally unengaged.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
Yeah.

21:05.040 --> 21:12.040
And while not perfect, I think it does a pretty good job of succinctly capturing the definition,

21:12.040 --> 21:19.040
and I think the underlying cognitive mechanism is this state of underutilized cognitive resources, right?

21:19.040 --> 21:24.040
We have mental capacity that's sort of pent up and not being utilized or not being used,

21:24.040 --> 21:31.040
and I think that's an inherently uncomfortable feeling, and I think we are just designed, evolutionarily,

21:31.040 --> 21:36.040
to experience that state as a versa, and I think that's a good thing, right?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.040
It's a good thing.

21:37.040 --> 21:43.040
I mean, we wouldn't be here today having this conversation if we were content to be mentally unengaged, right?

21:43.040 --> 21:50.040
We wouldn't be here in this culture, the society, not unless this conversation itself.

21:50.040 --> 21:55.040
So I say boredom is the uncomfortable feeling of being mentally unengaged,

21:55.040 --> 21:59.040
and I think you can compare it to physical pain.

21:59.040 --> 22:08.040
I think that the discomfort of boredom is analogous to the discomfort of physical pain.

22:08.040 --> 22:14.040
They both keep us safe, or they both keep us well.

22:14.040 --> 22:18.040
So it's a good thing that we have the capacity for boredom.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.040
That doesn't mean that we should cultivate boredom, right?

22:21.040 --> 22:25.040
So just because pain is a good thing, we don't go around cultivating it, right?

22:25.040 --> 22:28.040
We don't say yes, we should cultivate it.

22:28.040 --> 22:35.040
Nor do I think we should become preoccupied with trying to avoid pain at any cost.

22:35.040 --> 22:42.040
That would not be advantageous, nor would it be advantageous to try to avoid boredom at any cost, right?

22:42.040 --> 22:51.040
Similarly, like pain, boredom can become chronic and problematic, right?

22:51.040 --> 23:00.040
Similarly, like pain, I think boredom is the signal, and how we respond to it is what's really critical, right?

23:00.040 --> 23:08.040
Pain is just a message, it's just a signal that tells us we're in a non-optimal state, we're cognitively unengaged,

23:08.040 --> 23:11.040
and it gives us that impetus to do something about it.

23:11.040 --> 23:20.040
What we do, you know, rung jump, go and get drunk, read a novel, whatever, we can all respond in very different ways,

23:20.040 --> 23:23.040
and that's where boredom can become problematic, right?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
It's about our response to it.

23:25.040 --> 23:31.040
I'm not a fan of the idea of pathologizing boredom, I don't think we should consider it an illness,

23:31.040 --> 23:33.040
I don't think we should consider it a problem.

23:33.040 --> 23:39.040
In its chronic form, it does co-occur with what I would call mental disorders,

23:39.040 --> 23:50.040
but I don't think of boredom itself as a pathological state, but one that we need to handle carefully in lots of different contexts.

23:50.040 --> 23:57.040
I like to expand on that a little bit, and also maybe make it a little bit more intuitive for people who are listening about your,

23:57.040 --> 23:59.040
that's an excellent analogy to pain.

23:59.040 --> 24:04.040
When you say that people, we need pain, it does serve a function.

24:04.040 --> 24:09.040
I think most of us think of things like you stubbed your toe, or it's considerable pain,

24:09.040 --> 24:14.040
but you know, there are all these folks out there who don't have pain fibers and don't have any sense of pain.

24:14.040 --> 24:19.040
Their number one problem is, see, I'm here, I'm a little constrained, I can't keep changing my posture,

24:19.040 --> 24:26.040
but we all, if we stay in the same posture exactly for any period of time, pain is what makes us want to move,

24:26.040 --> 24:33.040
so our joints don't get stiff, et cetera, and you know, people in hospital who are forced to be in the same position

24:33.040 --> 24:41.040
can start to develop pain, and it becomes worse and worse, so it can really be a very tiny negative feeling, pain can be.

24:41.040 --> 24:48.040
And where we don't even recognize it's occurring, and we shift our posture because it's starting to build,

24:48.040 --> 24:54.040
but it's there, that is a little tiny bit of pain, and so I think using that as an analogy to what an boredom is,

24:54.040 --> 25:01.040
is really useful because boredom can happen in these sort of micro doses and have an effect in spurring us to do whatever

25:01.040 --> 25:04.040
we can, hopefully we'll do next.

25:04.040 --> 25:12.040
I'll just say one other thing just to be a little bit argumentative with your wish to find boredom,

25:12.040 --> 25:19.040
just simply that, you know, there's an idea that goes back to the beginnings of modernism of, I'm sorry,

25:19.040 --> 25:25.040
of sort of the enlightenment that if only we could have a language, a scientific language that was precise,

25:25.040 --> 25:28.040
then all of our problems would be solved, right?

25:28.040 --> 25:34.040
Whereas I'm really, I think that the pro-dian nature of boredom is actually a very interesting issue

25:34.040 --> 25:40.040
because it has many sides and aspects to it, and it fits in so many places, and I'm certainly in favor,

25:40.040 --> 25:49.040
and I like your definition of it as well, but I think we also can bear in mind that it is a sort of slightly ambiguous term,

25:49.040 --> 25:56.040
and it does serve in different contexts slightly differently, or it has a role in different contexts slightly differently,

25:56.040 --> 26:03.040
I think that's actually interesting, we don't want to cut off an idea about boredom by reducing it too much.

26:03.040 --> 26:14.040
Fair enough, I mean I agree with that, I remember actually once attending a conference where this poet was talking about T.S. Eliot's,

26:14.040 --> 26:19.040
and he was talking about how any definition of H2O needed to include a little duckweed, right?

26:19.040 --> 26:28.040
So I'm quite comfortable with that idea, but I think right now if you can talk about a field of boredom study,

26:28.040 --> 26:35.040
the problem is we got too much duckweed, and not enough precision, but I certainly think we need to stay open,

26:35.040 --> 26:43.040
and I do think that there are useful, precise ideas that cut across contexts,

26:43.040 --> 26:50.040
and finding those common patterns is I think very exciting and very useful.

26:50.040 --> 27:00.040
I wanted to ask about boredom definition and so on, because what Mark was describing,

27:00.040 --> 27:07.040
I also have been lucky enough to be in that position sometimes,

27:07.040 --> 27:15.040
and I never described that as boredom to myself, I described it that I was restless, irritated, impatient,

27:15.040 --> 27:23.040
couldn't tolerate all the nonsense being talked about, but I felt more annoyance,

27:23.040 --> 27:33.040
whereas when I am bored, it's more that I kind of pass, am passively not knowing what to do or how to engage,

27:33.040 --> 27:44.040
or so there is a difference there, and one question then is who think about you, people who think about boredom

27:44.040 --> 27:50.040
and are knowledgeable about it, how do you define it, what is it exactly?

27:50.040 --> 27:53.040
Actually, if I can just jump in with one thing, because there's anemologically,

27:53.040 --> 27:59.040
and this might or might not have a bearing, but the French direct translation of boredom is of course en-wie.

27:59.040 --> 28:07.040
En-wie comes from Old French, which means annoyance, and that comes from Latin, which means hated.

28:07.040 --> 28:14.040
So there is the annoyance, hatred, boredom, vector, it's very tight.

28:14.040 --> 28:20.040
I had a fellow in my lab once, who was from France, and he would always say, this is boring, this is boring,

28:20.040 --> 28:24.040
it's still annoying, and this is annoying, it's very dated.

28:24.040 --> 28:30.040
So the show is also the cultural quality of boredom, and whether or not one chooses to use that term,

28:30.040 --> 28:35.040
because I think when you heard that some people would label what your experience is boredom,

28:35.040 --> 28:38.040
I don't think you said, well I didn't have boredom, that was something else.

28:38.040 --> 28:44.040
You said, I didn't think to call that boredom in a way, and I have a different thing I refer to when I think of boredom,

28:44.040 --> 28:51.040
but I think there may yet be something in common between those two states, which is, I don't know yet what I want to do with myself,

28:51.040 --> 28:56.040
and gee I wish I did, which is the wishing to have a wish that Mark referred to.

28:56.040 --> 29:06.040
And then there's the under-utilization of my sort of cognitive capacity, where I could do more, or I'd like to act,

29:06.040 --> 29:11.040
and somehow I'm constrained to not act, and that can create a sense of boredom.

29:11.040 --> 29:21.040
But the words that Ed used are all active words. I mean, I'm annoyed, I'm irritated, they're all active words where boredom, as you pointed out,

29:21.040 --> 29:29.040
is a passive. Well I think it's a passive state, maybe not. So what else could be in boredom that's not passive?

29:29.040 --> 29:30.040
Why?

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
What would make a difference?

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
Why passive?

29:32.040 --> 29:42.040
Well, as opposed to annoyed, irritated, all those things, they're active words, and boredom is something.

29:42.040 --> 29:49.040
I think that's it. I think that whatever the dichotomy captures it, because the person's both idle in some sense,

29:49.040 --> 29:59.040
or not acting as much as they might, and yet they have an impulse to do so. So there's the active impulse, and then there's the feeling, I don't know what.

29:59.040 --> 30:08.040
Because in French, on we has a passive quality to it, whereas if you say someone we, that annoys me.

30:08.040 --> 30:18.040
So when you say someone we means that annoys me, but when you say I have on we, I'm just passively feeling something uncomfortable.

30:18.040 --> 30:27.040
So this gets back to a concept that comes up in many, many contexts, and that is the optimal level of stimulation.

30:27.040 --> 30:37.040
And it comes up, I mean, I don't really know. It's a very mysterious concept in neuroscience when it's presumably maps on some network state, right?

30:37.040 --> 30:51.040
If your brain is a state, a big dynamical system of neurons interacting, and there's presumably some optimal rate of interaction that is just good, and it feels good, for whatever reason.

30:51.040 --> 31:06.040
And so this is how I imagine, born of, even though I couldn't tell you what that state was, what the principles are, but imagine, born of as being in some other state that is understimulated relative to that optimal one.

31:06.040 --> 31:12.040
And of course we can imagine being overstimulated, and that feels bad in a different way.

31:12.040 --> 31:25.040
So it's not really determined by any single external circumstance. If some people, the same boring meeting, maybe experienced as irritating by somebody.

31:25.040 --> 31:30.040
And fascinating, maybe my others.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.040
Or boring people.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.040
Or maybe even by yourself in a different day.

31:36.040 --> 31:44.040
It's funny to read some of the methods sections of some of the papers on board, and where they're trying to, you know, you've been among them.

31:44.040 --> 31:53.040
What can we use as a stimulus for board on, which is almost again an oxymoron? It's funny to read, like, oh, we got this movie that's so boring, we'll show that.

31:53.040 --> 32:07.040
Yeah, but it's never a property only of the external environment is what that external environment does to you. What kind of memories it evokes, what kind of mental life it stimulates.

32:07.040 --> 32:16.040
So if all of a sudden that boring meeting, something came that triggered your memory of something, then at least you could distract yourself with some memory.

32:16.040 --> 32:28.040
And anyone be bored anymore. So it's not a function just of familiarity or just of novelty. There's some happy medium.

32:28.040 --> 32:36.040
If things are too simple or too complicated, they can both be boring. So there's some happy medium there, right? Whatever that is.

32:36.040 --> 32:47.040
So boring, boredom, I think, is the state where you might be understimulated and don't like it and want to get out of it, as I think you very well say.

32:47.040 --> 32:56.040
There you go. Well, there are participants of a sort. We're doing a practical demonstration.

32:56.040 --> 33:06.040
Or a concept from both overstimulated and understimulated. Yes, when the flow is broken.

33:06.040 --> 33:16.040
I guess what I would say is that, you know, where we choose to put the definitional boundaries is up for grabs, right? I mean, there's no a prior a right answer.

33:16.040 --> 33:30.040
And we have to decide what's useful. And, you know, well, I think boredom has a long sort of history. I'm sure that culture and situation and time have shifted where that boundary has been put slightly.

33:30.040 --> 33:40.040
You know, in my mind, I would think about it as an emotional state. And I think the two neighboring states that we need to distinguish it from our frustration on the one hand and apathy on the other.

33:40.040 --> 33:49.040
And I think boredom fits somewhere in between those two. And I think it's important not to conflate boredom with apathy, which often people do.

33:49.040 --> 33:58.040
And I think that boredom involves that desire for desires. We already heard the Tolstoy quote, right? And that idea goes back to Schopenhauer's formulation of boredom.

33:58.040 --> 34:06.040
There's this restless longing and desire, but an inability to articulate what is long for, right? So it's not at all a passive state.

34:06.040 --> 34:21.040
There's a sense of urgency and desire for action. The psychoanalytic writers talked about the desire being too threatening, and so it needed to be repressed.

34:21.040 --> 34:28.040
But that desire for action remained without any target for discharging that energy, right? So there's that it's not apathetic.

34:28.040 --> 34:38.040
And on the other hand, frustration, you have a goal out on the horizon, and something is thwarting your progress towards it. Something is standing between you and a desired state, and that's frustration.

34:38.040 --> 34:45.040
But in boredom, you don't have that future desired state articulated, right? So you can't be frustrated.

34:45.040 --> 34:52.040
You know, I heard another psychoanalytic writer that talked about a board person is like putting on a suit.

34:52.040 --> 35:01.040
You know, it doesn't quite fit, right? No, is it? Or trying to remember a name, right? Like, what is that guy's name? Was it Joe? Was it George? No, no, no, what was it?

35:01.040 --> 35:09.040
Like, you've got this sense, this wraith. There's something there that you want, but you can't name it, right?

35:09.040 --> 35:16.040
And in terms of the over-under stimulation, I would, again, go back to the idea that situations that are too challenging, right?

35:16.040 --> 35:22.040
If we attend a lecture on some topic that we know nothing about, it's like we can't get a foothold in, right? We can't get a foothold in.

35:22.040 --> 35:26.040
And so we are not cognitively able to engage with what's happening.

35:26.040 --> 35:36.040
If the lecture is on something we know too well, and it's sort of very, you know, uninteresting to us below our capacity, then it doesn't engage us either.

35:36.040 --> 35:45.040
And so I think in both, you know, those over-under stimulating or over challenging situations, they have that final common pathway of being cognitively,

35:45.040 --> 35:55.040
un-engaged. And when I say that that's the underlying subpersonal cognitive mechanism, I don't wish to say that that's all there is to it.

35:55.040 --> 36:05.040
There's a phenomenological, there's a subjective part on top of that underlying mechanism that's very important, and that's where all the affective kinds of components come in.

36:05.040 --> 36:18.040
I can't think of it a little bit. We are all the time talking about one kind of boredom. As you know, we should talk of boredom perhaps,

36:18.040 --> 36:31.040
because we are talking of this situational contextual boredom, but what about society, which is bored, completely bored?

36:31.040 --> 36:49.040
This, you know, this differentiation between the situational boredom or, yeah, the situation in which you are bored, but you can do something, boredom perhaps you may get rid of boredom.

36:49.040 --> 37:12.040
But then you have the profound boredom, the deep boredom that later John Philosophia talk about. This differentiation was established by Paul Balevi, the French support Paul Balevi in the last century.

37:12.040 --> 37:27.040
And then also, if I'm not too, yeah, I think it was cracker, secret cracker, then also repeated this definition of boredom in a certain situation.

37:27.040 --> 37:44.040
The boredom that a society suffer, this kind of boredom you suffer when you are associated with your cultural, social, economic structures.

37:44.040 --> 37:57.040
Yeah, so perhaps apart from attempting to define a definition for boredom, we have to start talking of different boredom.

37:57.040 --> 38:14.040
I agree not to make it too focused in one direction, but when you talk about society's societal boredom, is that really bored in the sense, even in the larger sense that we are understanding it, is that more metaphorical?

38:14.040 --> 38:35.040
And societal boredom sounds to me like it shades more toward what you were talking about in frustration, that when we talk of a society being bored, it really is that the people in that society are feeling that there's something that's not working, whether it's an economic structure, whether it's a political situation, whether it's their ability to affect it, yeah, but that's not really bored of, that's really frustration.

38:35.040 --> 38:45.040
We're not bored with the correct administration, we're just frustrated with it.

38:45.040 --> 38:58.040
Well, in my case, or some part of our enculturation in a particular society may not give us the goals or may not cultivate the goals in people, I don't know how to exactly say this, but if those goals are not cultivated by people, you know, it's sort of like some young people are coming up through school,

38:58.040 --> 39:11.040
they'll say, I don't know what I want to do with myself, and say, well, go see a career counselor, which is perfectly reasonable, but the idea is maybe that person will find some interest the person wasn't aware of where they had or give them some focus and direction.

39:11.040 --> 39:27.040
So frustration implies there are things barring people from expressing themselves, and I think that's a more sort of a description of philosophical and sociological description of, let's say, anger among the underclass or in feminism and such.

39:27.040 --> 39:35.040
People would say, well, yes, of course women are, of course, African Americans are angry because of the being mistreated, so why are you treating it like a psychological problem, it's a societal problem.

39:35.040 --> 39:46.040
In this case, I think with boredom, you could say, actually also, people don't know what to do with themselves, and they may also be frustrated, it's not just one or the other.

39:46.040 --> 40:04.040
I do think when we judge something to be boring, we're doing social work, we're dismissing, we're denigrating, so to describe something as boring is kind of a social act, I think, and so I would definitely agree in that regard.

40:04.040 --> 40:11.040
And you can think about it, you know, like a child in a classroom who, let's say they're struggling with math.

40:11.040 --> 40:24.040
Well, this is boring, right? What's happening right there, right? Well, maybe this child lacks the capacity to be successful in this context, but it's a way to save face, it's sort of an aloof kind of stepping back.

40:24.040 --> 40:40.040
And we use boredom to judge people as well, right? I had one graduate student who was doing a project cross-culturally looking at boredom in rural communities in Guatemala, and it's interesting that when people say, well, I'm never bored.

40:40.040 --> 40:49.040
I'm never bored because I got too much work to do, it's just those rich guys over there that get bored, right? It's a way of rejecting the other.

40:49.040 --> 41:00.040
So I do think social work is happening around boredom in a way that's interesting and a little different than other kinds of emotions, perhaps.

41:00.040 --> 41:09.040
And so I think your point is well taken in that regard. I also think that there are many different potential factors that can cause boredom when you've touched on that as well.

41:09.040 --> 41:22.040
But I think if you're thinking about it as an emotional state, I would think of it as singular with lots of different causes and then lots of different responses I might make to it.

41:22.040 --> 41:28.040
So there's certainly a variety that needs to be explored and understood.

41:28.040 --> 41:39.040
I remember many, many years ago, we were talking one of the early meetings like that, and Carl Pribram was there.

41:39.040 --> 41:47.040
And Carl Pribram said, many of these words we use, and we were talking about creativity, imagination, and so on.

41:47.040 --> 41:54.040
He said, these are just words we use, that it's because we don't really know what they are about, and we give them a name.

41:54.040 --> 41:59.040
Do you think boredom falls into that category? That it's...

41:59.040 --> 42:11.040
For example, when we say fear as an emotion, it seems to be a lot more specific, and now you can talk about fear circuits and so on.

42:11.040 --> 42:25.040
But boredom seems to be, as I listen, it seems like different people feel it or describe it, or like your student with the mat, who says I'm bored.

42:25.040 --> 42:31.040
Does he actually have an emotion that is specific and can be called boredom?

42:31.040 --> 42:42.040
This is kind of where I started, right? My thought would be that boredom can be like fear if we can work together and come up with a definition.

42:42.040 --> 42:56.040
But I think the person in the street will and should continue to use the term very broadly and very loosely, just the way people use the term fear in a way that neuroscientists would say, well, that's not actually not quite fear, right?

42:56.040 --> 43:02.040
I mean, they would like to think just between fear and anxiety and all kinds of nuances that others wouldn't make.

43:02.040 --> 43:13.040
So I think we should start by listening to the person in the street to develop kind of grounded definitions of our concepts and make sure they're culturally relevant, and we should look at theories.

43:13.040 --> 43:20.040
But then I think we need to do a little pruning and kind of come up with that definition so that we can work with it like we can work with fear.

43:20.040 --> 43:31.040
Yeah, I agree. So I think it's so coming from neuroscience where we're not really studying boredom yet, but we're not studying a lot of interesting higher level concepts like curiosity.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.040
Right.

43:32.040 --> 43:39.040
It's, right? But it's not that they cannot be studied. It's just we didn't get to them yet.

43:39.040 --> 43:46.040
So this is why I mean fear is impossible to study at the biological level not long ago and all these decision making.

43:46.040 --> 43:50.040
Everything we care about that's interesting. It's very hard to define.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.040
That's right.

43:51.040 --> 43:56.040
That's in a sense that's why we're not going to give up trying to, you know, operation.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.040
So, yeah.

43:57.040 --> 44:03.040
Just some disciplines are in terms of studying boredom because it's so difficult to define that.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.040
Yeah.

44:04.040 --> 44:13.040
And perhaps some anthropologists think of what we are going to say about boredom because it's an affection, it's an emotion.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.040
A state of mind is...

44:16.040 --> 44:20.040
Well, I mean, so it's the same as sort of the dark side of mental life, right?

44:20.040 --> 44:25.040
So even when we study feeding behavior in neuroscience, we don't say we study hunger, right?

44:25.040 --> 44:33.040
Hunger is a motivation for feeding. So the same thing boredom is the motivation for engaging in mental life.

44:33.040 --> 44:40.040
But so I was going to ask you, speaking of these disconnect, I mean, in a sense you're a lot farther ahead than we are in neuroscience.

44:40.040 --> 44:50.040
And this is what attracted me to read some of your studies because I started thinking about what motivates us to engage attention, what motivates us to be curious.

44:50.040 --> 44:59.040
And then I looked in my field in neuroscience and I'm amazed to find that in neuroscience we think of mental activity as a cost.

44:59.040 --> 45:07.040
So, right, it's really nice to be able to put everything that has resource limitation in an economic framework, right?

45:07.040 --> 45:12.040
So attention, mental capacity is limited, so we have to decide how to engage it.

45:12.040 --> 45:17.040
Either I'm attending to one thing, that means I'm not attending to the other.

45:17.040 --> 45:22.040
And we engage our mental life in order to obtain some benefit.

45:22.040 --> 45:25.040
Whatever that is, utility, right?

45:25.040 --> 45:31.040
But optimally or rationally, we want to obtain that benefit with the minimum of effort.

45:31.040 --> 45:39.040
So in that framework, mental life is a cost that if we, everything being equal, I'd rather not pay, right?

45:39.040 --> 45:49.040
So if you give me a choice between doing something that's a bit more difficult and a bit more easy, if you don't pay me extra, I'll just go for the easy stuff, right?

45:49.040 --> 45:50.040
That's our theories.

45:50.040 --> 45:54.040
That's the state of our theories that people go by.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.040
And of course that opens the question, well, then why are we curious?

45:57.040 --> 46:05.040
Why are people reading books for no apparent benefit when you just go to sleep to conserve energy?

46:05.040 --> 46:06.040
Things like that, right?

46:06.040 --> 46:11.040
So clearly that little definition that we're working on is very incomplete.

46:11.040 --> 46:14.040
And anyway, so I was wondering what do you think about that?

46:14.040 --> 46:16.040
Well, I think that's a great question.

46:16.040 --> 46:22.040
And so you could summarize that maybe as this cognitive miserly model, right?

46:22.040 --> 46:29.040
This idea that we want to reduce our expenditure of resources and we want to.

46:29.040 --> 46:37.040
Now, so sometimes people when they hear me say that the state of being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive, they say, well, wait a second.

46:37.040 --> 46:40.040
How does that jive with this cognitive miserly idea?

46:40.040 --> 46:41.040
Right.

46:41.040 --> 46:49.040
But I don't see a conflict there because I'm not, you know, a cognitive miserly model is about the exertion of effort, right?

46:49.040 --> 46:55.040
And there are ways to be cognitively engaged that don't necessarily require a lot of cognitive effort.

46:55.040 --> 47:00.040
You know, so you think about reverie, daydream, mind wandering.

47:00.040 --> 47:06.040
These are all ways of being engaged mentally that don't involve cognitive effort.

47:06.040 --> 47:13.040
However, you brought up some other examples like curiosity, which I think is an interesting example.

47:13.040 --> 47:21.040
And you might argue, well, curiosity sometimes does require the exertion of effort and therefore it might be contradictory.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.040
Yeah.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.040
With this miserly model.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.040
Yeah.

47:24.040 --> 47:40.040
And you know, I don't have a kind of a solution to that paradox when it comes to curiosity, but I feel confident that we can say that being mentally unengaged is inherently aversive without it being in conflict with this miserly model.

47:40.040 --> 47:46.040
And I think the miserly model as you're pointing out is too simplistic, right?

47:46.040 --> 48:03.040
That certainly there are times in which affectance motivation, like we're motivated to demonstrate our competence, to be effective in the world, make changes, and that sometimes requires effort.

48:03.040 --> 48:18.040
And so I think the miserly model is, which has its base in this very narrow cognitive science kind of paradigm, is doesn't apply more broadly when we look at human life.

48:18.040 --> 48:29.040
Well, maybe I don't know if this, how this affects or whether it's a cognitive miserly model, but you know, maybe one pathway into it is to broaden the definition of what payback is.

48:29.040 --> 48:45.040
Because you know, you talk about, okay, I want to do something for the least possible effort, if you're only going to pay me x by z, and I'm thinking, you know, just in a very practical, basic term, translations I've done that have taken me enormous amounts of time and enormous amounts of effort and for which I've gotten, you know, one

48:45.040 --> 49:02.040
nth the amount that I would usually charge for one of these, because I just wanted to do it. It was the labor of love, right? And so the payback there is my satisfaction in taking the time and putting in the effort to do what I consider a good job and being able to then read it and say, oh, that's actually pretty good.

49:02.040 --> 49:08.040
That's my payback. I mean, the monetary part is fine, but if it were only because of that, I just wouldn't have done it at that rate.

49:08.040 --> 49:25.040
And so when you talk about why people engage in altruistic events or why they, you know, why they do things that don't seem to have any particular return, the return is, you know, potentially the return is, in fact, that feeling of having engaged in some sort of altruistic effort.

49:25.040 --> 49:41.040
And sometimes a little bit of what we were talking about earlier about the very small valence attached to pain or boredom. And I think the same thing applies to reward. And we have this new model, newish model about how dopamine functioning in the brain and the mid brain affects our

49:41.040 --> 49:57.040
participation of reward. And bear in mind, actually, that can easily become too simplistic a model where we think, oh, reward equals dopamine. And that's clearly wrong. But it's because actually, I was careful to say the anticipation of reward is different from reward, right?

49:57.040 --> 50:10.040
And so what we, each of us, imagines will be the reward if I do X, Y, or Z, may have a greater bearing on what we end up doing in the world. And I do mean again, just like with the issue about a slight bit of pain and one joints.

50:10.040 --> 50:22.040
If I'm sitting somewhere and I'm just idle and I suddenly see a bottle of water, let's say I just want to move it because it's not where I want it to be or let's say I'm thirsty.

50:22.040 --> 50:34.040
Very small valence of interest then motivates me to get up and move and to do it. And I suppose that does involve something to do with the dopamine that's going through my brain.

50:34.040 --> 50:44.040
I was also interested in the whole idea of the sort of default mode network, which hasn't been mentioned so far, which is sort of a background activity in the brain.

50:44.040 --> 50:52.040
And it's interesting to note in keeping with our talk about boredom not being a passive state.

50:52.040 --> 51:07.040
And again, I want to be careful not to equate boredom to the default mode network, but the default mode network, which is sort of how our brain seems to be functioning the network connections between parts of our brain when we're idle, is also not a very passive thing.

51:07.040 --> 51:14.040
And that's part of the thing that's interesting about it. It's actually an active state that needs to be sustained in some fashion.

51:14.040 --> 51:24.040
And so I know that then switching from that idle state to a more, you know, a salient state where things become interesting and I might want to choose to do X, Y, or Z.

51:24.040 --> 51:32.040
That's an important area, right? And I think we have to carefully imagine where might boredom fit in there in that paradigm.

51:32.040 --> 51:43.040
There's actually some research on that. There's not very much, but, you know, I think one of the areas that's really exciting is looking for the neural and the physiological signatures of boredom.

51:43.040 --> 51:56.040
So you've already mentioned the default mode network, which is active when you're sort of at rest or when you're engaged in internal thought and internal reverie, and the central executive network when you're engaged with kind of tasks in the world, right?

51:56.040 --> 52:08.040
And trying to figure out, you know, something in front of me. And certainly when you are bored, the default mode network is more active than when you are engaged in some activity.

52:08.040 --> 52:18.040
But importantly, you know, there was a study done by a colleague of mine, James Dankert, at the University of Waterloo, where they compared someone in a bored state versus a resting state.

52:18.040 --> 52:33.040
And there is a difference, right? So the insular cortex is another part of the brain that is thought, amongst other things, to be involved in helping you toggle back and forth between the default mode network and the central executive network,

52:33.040 --> 52:38.040
and is also responsible for tagging saliency in our environment.

52:38.040 --> 52:53.040
And so I'm going well beyond the data in my interpretation here, and this is only one study, but one way of interpreting this is that the person is having a hard time shifting out of the default mode network into the central executive.

52:53.040 --> 53:03.040
So there's this kind of, you're stuck where you can't disengage from the one and engage in the other neural network.

53:03.040 --> 53:12.040
So, indeed, you know, just to summarize, the default mode network is quite centrally involved in boredom, but it's not equivalent with boredom.

53:12.040 --> 53:14.040
There's some very important distinctions.

53:14.040 --> 53:25.040
In fact, external movements are so very different when you are bored. Sometimes you're young. It's totally different.

53:25.040 --> 53:34.040
There's a thought actually yawning. I read something about yawning being involved in this toggling. Did I make that up? Or do you know whether I don't know?

53:34.040 --> 53:45.040
I think I saw some reference where they mentioned that yawning actually helps someone sort of switch out of the default mode network, which is just perfectly in keeping with what you're saying.

53:45.040 --> 53:57.040
So when I think about curiosity, again, with very little data, but the way I imagine this, so if the default mode network is engaged in resting state and it's involved in mind wandering, all kinds of mind wandering.

53:57.040 --> 54:11.040
So people, when they don't do anything, people do stuff. Usually, there's studies that probe the thoughts, and usually you're planning stuff on most of the time, and sometimes it's other things like singing songs or reciting stuff.

54:11.040 --> 54:29.040
Okay, so that's associated with the default mode network, but that's a resting state which is not boring. So if you can, so the way I imagine this working is that if you can engage your default mode network together with your memories and somehow engage the reward system, then you're happy.

54:29.040 --> 54:37.040
You're in a good mental state, but there must be some other state where you're resting and you can't engage that whole network and then you're not happy.

54:37.040 --> 54:48.040
I agree well put, it's sort of what I was trying to get at is you're in between the two. You can't get into one mode. You can't activate one neural network fully or the other.

54:48.040 --> 54:56.040
And so, you know, I do see mind wandering to be a consequence of boredom in situations where you're constrained and you can't leave.

54:56.040 --> 55:02.040
You know, you might mind wander as a way to engage your cognitive resources and therefore to not be bored.

55:02.040 --> 55:15.040
And when you're able to do that, then you just see default mode network. But when you're being told you have to pay attention to this and you don't really want to and you're trying to daydream at the same time, it all gets all gets bungled up.

55:15.040 --> 55:16.040
That is interesting.

55:16.040 --> 55:20.040
Then there's an interesting answer where you become interested in what your mind's wandering over.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.040
Sure.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.040
And that becomes salient in of itself.

55:23.040 --> 55:24.040
Sure.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.040
And what is that exactly?

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
And how does the brain adapt or respond in those circumstances?

55:27.040 --> 55:40.040
Because I think people who are creative almost certainly are, you know, sort of riffing off these sort of mind wandering, you know, events and then paying attention to it and developing it.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.040
And it's interesting.

55:42.040 --> 55:56.040
And I think on, you know, just maybe this is shifting the topic a little bit, but I'd be very interested to hear what you think about this in terms of curiosity, you know, because there's a psychologist that talked to use this term constructive internal reflection.

55:56.040 --> 56:03.040
And she was referring to that mind wandering state when you are kind of riffing and that creativity is happening.

56:03.040 --> 56:10.040
And I think what happens with boredom is we often go to the external world for salvation, right?

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
We're for relief.

56:11.040 --> 56:19.040
And I think that short circuits the capacity to develop that constructive internal reflection as a skill or as an ability.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
And a resource.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.040
Yeah.

56:21.040 --> 56:33.040
And I think culturally we're in a culture right now where our attention is being yanked around by the collar from all these exogenous demands, right?

56:33.040 --> 56:34.040
Look here, do this.

56:34.040 --> 56:42.040
I mean, standing in Times Square, you know, from the big town of Toronto and Times Square is overwhelming, right?

56:42.040 --> 56:44.040
And your attention is just drawn everywhere.

56:44.040 --> 56:54.040
And what happens is that capacity for constructive internal reflection or for endogenous control of attention can sort of atrophy.

56:54.040 --> 57:03.040
And I think boredom can maybe push us to seek out that external stimulation as a short-term solution to our problems,

57:03.040 --> 57:10.040
but in the long term it may actually end up really making the situation worse, you know?

57:10.040 --> 57:19.040
And so I think that's what you're saying about creativity and about that internal reflection being adaptive kind of pulls it together, right?

57:19.040 --> 57:20.040
That's right.

57:20.040 --> 57:30.040
Well, maybe because part of it is to, you know, if you can focus on one thing that's calling for your attention or if you're bored and you focus on one response to it in a creative way,

57:30.040 --> 57:35.040
that does imply some kind of engagement and depth that you have to then go into,

57:35.040 --> 57:38.040
whereas if it's the Times Square model, you can't.

57:38.040 --> 57:43.040
You know, you start moving in one direction, but then there's this other thing calling you there and you never really go anywhere.

57:43.040 --> 57:48.040
There's no, there's no attention really paid. It's just constantly, I mean, the question is, do you get bored in Times Square?

57:48.040 --> 57:50.040
Yeah.

57:50.040 --> 57:53.040
Shall I open it to questions?

57:53.040 --> 57:57.040
Yes.

57:57.040 --> 58:03.040
Just follow each other in one of the other.

58:03.040 --> 58:13.040
Dr. Rees would be happy to know that you got me thinking, but it was something I was irritated about.

58:13.040 --> 58:21.040
But then you changed it a little bit and I think that it was a target.

58:21.040 --> 58:31.040
It was the word you used first, looking for the right word, and you would say the word unengaged.

58:31.040 --> 58:36.040
And the grammatical word is disengaged, right?

58:36.040 --> 58:46.040
And disengaged, for me, carries an ethical aspect to it.

58:46.040 --> 58:51.040
If a patient would say to me that they were bored,

58:51.040 --> 59:01.040
is there something that you want to do that would be engaged, engage you?

59:01.040 --> 59:06.040
You know, save the world, help your family, you know, something like that.

59:06.040 --> 59:15.040
In other words, it's key to taking some kind of action and actions have ethical aspects.

59:15.040 --> 59:23.040
But I'm very glad that you, and not only that everybody started using that term, being engaged,

59:23.040 --> 59:32.040
which is a very different than something which is neurological, essentially neurological.

59:32.040 --> 59:35.040
So could you comment on that?

59:35.040 --> 59:43.040
I'm glad you brought that up and I think there's a really important idea here that's fairly complicated, right?

59:43.040 --> 59:47.040
And there's a number of elements to your comment, to your question.

59:47.040 --> 59:53.040
Engaged is a description of my relationship with something else, right?

59:53.040 --> 59:58.040
So I'm engaged with this or I'm not engaged with it and it's action oriented, like you said,

59:58.040 --> 01:00:03.040
and as you said, it contains ethical implications, you know, what I choose to engage with

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.040
or whether I commit myself to something or not.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:14.040
So unengaged is a description of sort of my cognitive resources and they are not being utilized.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.040
The way to utilize them would be to become engaged.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:24.040
But I think it's important for me to define boredom in a context-free way.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:32.040
Because if you try to define it in a way that is linked to disengagement,

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.040
then you need the context to define the state.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:45.040
But if you define the state as this unengaged state, then it is a definition that sort of transcends the context.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:52.040
Having said that, I think I would agree with all of your points about the ethical connotations of this topic

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:59.040
and the importance of seeing the solution through engagement.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:06.040
Thank you. My name is Ronald Alvas from the Paris Analytica,

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.040
Skarnelikus Society, and I apologize for my English.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.040
So I have one comment and one question for Mr. Polisotti.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:27.040
I'd like to emphasize the importance of time when we speak of boredom,

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.040
Brodsky's invasion of time.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:37.040
And this preoccupation of time goes and about to avoid boredom

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.040
goes far beyond the enlightenment.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.040
I don't know if you know about Palatsos Kifanoia in Ferrara.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:56.800
It's a beautiful story because Duke of Ferrara in Italy,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.960
the family Deste, one of the dukes in the 14th century

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.200
built a new palace.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.880
And he called it Palazzo Schifanoia.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:16.640
Schifanoia in Italian is Esquivare La Noya,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.080
which is to avoid the boredom.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.800
And he commissioned two painters of the Renaissance

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:32.480
to paint a frescoes on the walls of a room,

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.240
which is called El Sello to the Amazie,

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.880
the room of the month.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.440
Because these two painters, the Francesco de la Cosa

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.800
and Cosmetura, which are a very important painters

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:51.280
of the Renaissance, they painted the month of a year.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.880
So it's about time.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:03:01.560
They painted this appropriation of the boredom,

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.400
led them to a creation, a statistical creation,

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.400
of representing the time.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.800
That's my first comment.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.120
And the time is also important because it's

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.320
maybe could link us to Melancholia and the Melancholia

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:28.160
to engage mentally through things.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:36.080
But for example, our patients, very often,

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.480
they are not able to engage because they're not

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:43.160
able to, they're not capacity for cateches.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.280
And that's also about boredom.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.920
Time is everything in boredom.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.440
Is everything.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.600
So it's a relationship.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.120
Just pay attention to the war in German.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.720
Lang Bile on the opposite cooks.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.520
Bile.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:58.720
Lang Bile?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.560
The time is long.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.280
It doesn't pass.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.560
It's the subjective impression that the time is not passing.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.920
And sometimes the feeling we are experiencing when we are bored

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.680
is because we feel bad of spending our time

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.360
in doing anything or time passes.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.560
And the question for you is, as a translator of Gustav

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.240
Flaubert, could you say some words on Madame Bovari?

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240
Mm-hmm.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:28.760
Fire.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760
Mm-hmm.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.960
Just what you heard is the word that you did.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:40.160
Well, if we speak about boredom, we can't avoid Madame Bovari.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.160
Mm-hmm.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:47.840
I mean, I suppose the simplest one could say is that she's

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.600
a good case study and the self-destructive behavior,

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.760
the one can indulge in if one is bored.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.760
Mm-hmm.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.680
In French psychiatry, the term Bovari, I don't know

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:05.920
if you use it in America, it's a very particular kind of boredom.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.920
Mm-hmm.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920
Mm-hmm.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.880
Boredom in satisfaction.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.800
In the sense that there's something sort of a grasses,

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.280
always greener kind of a sense that there's this ideal out there

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.240
that can be attained and, in fact, doesn't really exist.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.680
You also wrote up something that told me to hold you up.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.440
But you brought up one thing that I actually, we might not

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.440
have time to touch on here.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.800
But I'd be curious at some point to know

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.160
what the scientists and the philosophers think

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.440
of the relationship between boredom and depression.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.600
Because it seems to me that you alluded to this,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.280
that those two also have a connection.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.640
And that boredom and depression might be maybe

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.760
two sides over the same coin.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.560
I don't know.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.560
It's a, I was in this.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.120
Sure, yeah.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.200
I mean, in reference to that, I was about the zag.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.200
I don't mean it whatsoever to reduce what you said so well

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.800
to discussions of neurotransmitters and such.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.200
But there is a nice correspondence

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.520
here which is related to the way time is perceived in people

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.960
based on their sort of how much dopamine

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.160
we have sort of coursing through our veins.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.800
And you know, the most famous case of someone

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.320
having a very long, low amount of dopamine

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.520
are people with Parkinson's disease who are almost

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.000
like moving in slow motion, right?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.520
Their time is much slowed and their time senses

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.960
is changed as well.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.240
And that's very interesting.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:32.360
Depression, of course, has all sorts of effects

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.400
and all different neurotransmitters in the brain

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.800
when one is depressed.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.440
But one of the changes, again, is an effect on dopamine levels.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.840
Some people, especially elderly patients,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.480
when they become depressed, they can actually

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.480
appear somewhat Parkinsonian, who you say,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.880
because their dopamine levels have dropped sufficiently

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.280
for that to be manifest.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.360
And so there is the same issue if dopamine is

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.840
the sort of the stimulus, let's say,

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.840
that makes us move here or there or elsewhere.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.800
And when that is at low ebb, we don't have that

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.360
to sort of guide us forward.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.640
And that doesn't mean our desires or wishes are gone.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.400
And that's important.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.400
And I think because they're not gone,

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.040
that may be a recipe for feeling bored, right?

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.440
But Andrea had a question.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.960
And so you mentioned the distinction between boredom

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:19.760
and apathy.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.560
So it seems to me that you could be depressed.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:24.640
And I don't know if this is true.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.280
So you could be depressed and not, I mean,

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.440
be so apathetic that you're actually not bored.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.400
Because you don't want, can't even imagine,

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.600
don't even want to get out of this state.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.200
Because you don't, right?

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.800
And whereas boredom could actually

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.080
be an improvement of that.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.040
It's a desire to, you know, experience something else.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:44.880
You hit it perfectly.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.040
And that's right.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.360
They very much do overlap.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:51.280
It's a very common bit of confusion for family members

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.200
and caregivers to people with Parkinson's, for example,

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.440
that they think of them that they're depressed.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.440
Just because they are so apathetic.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.960
And so there are pure forms of apathy

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.680
where there's no boredom involved.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.040
They have no wishes.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.800
And then there's sort of, it could shade from one to the other.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.320
And you're, again, correct.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.040
If you move towards feeling a restless sort of boredom,

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:14.840
that's a movement in the right direction.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.640
Yeah. It seems that we use the word boredom very,

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640
likely very easily.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.400
That's right.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.320
In all different ways.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.560
Yeah.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.960
There's so much more that could be said about boredom

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.520
and depression.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.480
So I won't get into that.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:32.360
But they are very much linked developmentally across time.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.400
The time is a really important point,

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.680
which we didn't talk about today.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.760
But, you know, it is part of the definition

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.120
that phenomenological feeling of the slow passage of time.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.720
And we've already heard about the relationship

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.760
between dopamine and the perception of time

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.480
passing.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:51.400
We also know that cognitively, when you are not engaged,

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.560
there's a sense of time passing slowly as well.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.200
And so we know that boredom prone people

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.680
don't judge the passage of time well.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.240
And in our studies, when we try to manipulate and make people

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.760
bored, we rig the passage of time

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.960
as one of our variables to try to change that.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960
And then there's time.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.720
But then there's things happening in that time, too, right?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.640
And so you can think about boredom

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.200
as sort of everything is happening at that moment.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.400
And nothing is about to happen, right?

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.560
And so you think about the difference

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.560
between art versus sort of pornography or propaganda, right?

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.600
And in propaganda, pornography, it's all there.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.800
What you see is what you get.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.480
There's nothing more, whereas art kind of draws you in.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.320
There's that sense of walking through the garden.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.840
And as you turn a corner, a new vista

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.000
presents itself, a new possibility.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.880
And in boredom, that stops, right?

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.200
That possibility of more stops.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.160
So there's time.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.000
But then there's also what is happening within that time

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.200
that's important to think about.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.040
Ema vu vaire was not depressed.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.240
Was for stavid.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240
It was.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240
It was.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240
Yeah.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:07.640
Conversation has been anything but boring.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.360
Two quick questions in a quick comment.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.920
Wondering about mindfulness and meditation

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:16.680
and the effect on being boredom.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:20.040
The second question is, are curious people less bored

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:25.120
and can curiosity be in fact an antidote to boredom?

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.360
And the third is just a pedestrian definition

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.760
of perhaps boredom is just the nanosecond

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.040
before we reach for our phones.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.560
So.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560
Yeah.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
Yeah.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.560
These things.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560
Nanobordum.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.160
That would be a nanobordum.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160
Microbordum.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.040
I can say a few things about those questions.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.880
On the issue about mindfulness, there's a little bit of research

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.480
on mindfulness and boredom.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.640
And as you would expect, people that are high in trait

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:53.400
mindfulness or people who regularly practice mindfulness

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.040
meditation when put in a vigilance task or a sustained

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.120
attention task, which is very, very boring.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.920
Trust me.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.000
We just have to watch a computer screen for a rare kind of event

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.480
that may happen and then press a button.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.680
People that are high in trait mindfulness

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.680
experience less boredom and less discomfort and less

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:22.960
agitation during those kinds of potentially boring situations.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:30.280
So indeed, mindfulness prevents or protects one from boredom.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.600
And there's some open questions about precisely why.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.560
One idea is that mindfulness actually

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.760
results in the strengthening of a tensional capacity

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.400
so that you then can attend more effectively.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.040
But there's also the idea that mindfulness

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.200
may make you less emotionally reactive

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.640
to the state of being under aroused.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.320
And we just have one study that we haven't published yet

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.160
where we're looking at this.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.880
And so far, the data seems to be more

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.200
consistent with the idea that mindfulness

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.240
has its beneficial effects via that emotional reactivity

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:05.960
pathway not through an increasing attention capacity.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.600
So they're definitely related.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.480
And curiosity, yeah, do you want to speak to that issue?

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.880
Yeah, so I think it all goes back to this.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.520
So yes, I would definitely think that more curious people

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.400
are less bored.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.960
And I think it all goes back to this idea

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.160
of being able to generate questions.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.640
So the key about curiosity is the way we think it works

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.360
is that you encounter a situation that triggers

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.200
a bunch of hypotheses in your mind.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.280
What could be happening here?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.840
It could be XYZ.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.840
And then it's the willingness to engage and answer the question.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.400
That's how it works.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.920
So in a sense, it goes back to the same thing

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.360
as being able to generate mental activity, which

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.040
is then very satisfying.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.480
So answering those questions is very rewarding.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.840
It goes back to those internal rewards that I think

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.800
fuels human civilization.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.120
If we didn't have curiosity, we'd still

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.200
be back in the caves, I think.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.240
But anyway, so yes, so it's exactly the antithesis.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.560
And I think of boredom, I guess, as the failure in some way

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.280
to trigger that mental activity.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.880
I would add, I'm hoping that your John's last interpretation

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.240
of how mindfulness might work.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.760
I actually don't know if it's true, but I like that.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.840
I agree with it.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.960
That is that if you feel more comfortable managing

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.280
the state of being idle-minded, let's say,

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.760
and not get tense and stressed about it,

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.040
and actually think I can master it,

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.480
that might be a way also to master being

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.840
able to focus your attention when

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.040
you want to be able to focus it, not getting anxious about it.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.080
I think to the other topic we didn't talk on very much,

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.680
it relates to your comment or your question about curiosity,

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.160
is that I think this is something

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.280
all educators would really say, yes, a big thumbs up.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.280
We want to be able to cultivate curiosity in people.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.520
And how do we go about that?

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.600
What are the different mechanisms by which we do it?

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.320
And I think art and science and literature

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:18.520
are our most common ways that we try to do that with people.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.080
And I think there's proof that it works.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.240
Yeah, so emotional reactivity is very important.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.360
And there are some studies on that.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.920
It actually affects memory.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.440
They're direct studies on memory.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.800
So the way that you remember an item or an event

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.600
depends on the circumstances.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.560
So in the laboratory, we can motivate memory, for example,

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.320
by rewards or by avoiding punishments.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.200
We can put somebody in a task.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.920
And it's been shown that the encoding of information

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.560
differs in those two contexts.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:54.680
So if you're motivated by rewards,

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.840
you encode more incidental information.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.040
There's more a richer context that's being stored.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.760
Whereas motivation by punishment, which presumably

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.440
induces anxiety, narrows the focus.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.800
It's interesting because all of these

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.840
seem to be positive without being too systematic about it,

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.240
a dividing line in which on the one hand

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.400
you have boredom and anxiety.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.240
And it goes back to the example of the kid

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.320
who can't get the math.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.040
So he gets bored with the study of math

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.280
because he's afraid.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.840
He's anxious about it.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.240
Versus curiosity and ease, curiosity and comfort,

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.440
which is that when you are more comfortable with the state

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.240
of not doing anything and having to focus your attention

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.840
in a way that many people might find boring,

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.160
you're actually a less bored by it.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.040
There's kind of, again, a sort of a reward

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.040
of self-fulfillment that comes from those activities.

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.040
Thank you all very much for this.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:59.040
I'm a person who qualifies as essentially very bored.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:03.040
My name is Nancy Garnier, I'm a musician,

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.040
and performing and teaching.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.040
My memory as a child was an incredible boredom,

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.040
except when I was playing the piano mostly fooling around.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.040
And when I was about 12, I hit on something in a book

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.040
by a composer.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.040
I knew nothing about anything my family

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.040
was not into classical music at all.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.040
It turned out it was within a sonata by Mozart.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.040
It wasn't the piece, it was specific sounds

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.040
within that piece that just blew my mind.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.040
I thought, oh, there's been a person in the world

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.040
who hears as I hear.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.040
I then subsequently found that the field of music

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:54.040
was not at all interested in that quality of hearing,

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:59.040
that rather, it was assumed that people heard a certain way.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.040
I don't believe that's true, I still don't believe that,

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040
that's true.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:09.040
I believe that this power of shared intensity

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.040
is epitomized in the action of hearing.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.040
It's become my life's work, in fact.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.040
The thing that has meant most to me in putting together

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:27.040
my incredible capacity for boredom and the intensity

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.040
of my reaction to specific sounds was measured

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.040
by A. James Huddspeth at Rockefeller University

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:40.040
who found out that there are 16,000 moving hair cells

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:46.040
over here in your cochlea and 16,000 over there

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040
and that they impart information to the brain

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.040
200 times faster than any other sense perception.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.040
When I tell this to a child, a student who's eight years old,

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.040
they call me, wow, and there's no possible way

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040
they can get bored.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.040
None, it's gone.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.040
There's so much happening.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.040
It just totally transformed my ability to take in

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:18.040
all kinds of information, from disabled students to,

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.040
I don't know, all kinds of people.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.040
Anyway, I've joined the Society for Music Cognition,

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.040
Music Perception and Cognition, to my astonishment.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.040
They have bought into this kind of

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.040
mangle ironed approach to listening.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040
So the examples they study are all recorded.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.040
They've all been listened to a million times.

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.040
They're all, it's like canned green beans.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.040
It's such a massive disappointment to me.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.040
I just throw out to you if you're studying boredom

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:57.040
to consider the dynamic of hearing

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.040
and how it can inform vision.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:07.040
Usually it's the reverse, that vision is used to kind of

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.040
quiet the hearing down, so it won't be so intense.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.040
Is that a question?

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.040
I don't know, I hope it's a question.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.040
Well, it's certainly an inspiring story.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.040
Now, I'll say this about what you said.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.040
I don't know if this is so.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.040
I'd ask you more questions to find out.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.040
But, no, I think you brought up something very interesting

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.040
about having an experience of a shared experience

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.040
played such an important role in unlocking your feeling of curiosity.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.040
Because you said, oh, someone heard this

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040
and intended it the way I hear things.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.040
And that idea of empathy, obviously played a role.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.040
And I think that's why the best teachers are often the ones

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.040
who in part are feeling of empathy in their students.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:48.040
I think it also brings up, you know,

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.040
this without any scientific basis to say so,

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.040
that to me instinctively it makes perfect sense that people

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.040
hear things different ways and that it does bring up what I think

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.040
we were touching on before about, you know,

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.040
part of curiosity or boredom has to do also with personal response.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.040
You know, the same reason that someone could be very moved by Mozart

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:08.040
and someone else could be very moved by Ozzy Osborn.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.040
And, you know, who's to say that it's,

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.040
who's to say that there's a, you know, a wrong or a right answer there?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040
It just depends on.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040
Oh, okay.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040
I won't get a mama answer.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:20.040
Yeah, so let me give, I want to give a little perspective

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:25.040
because you mentioned studies of the year, of the cochlea and so on.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.040
So in neuroscience, again, I think this is,

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.040
this, I come back to this topic of how early we are in neuroscience

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.040
because, I mean, there's a magic to all the senses.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.040
I mean, vision is incredibly rich.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.040
Or faction is incredibly rich, hearing as well.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:47.040
But in neuroscience, we study them separately, just like you said,

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.040
in the field of music and cognition.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.040
We study the receptors as just engineering systems input

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.040
and how things are represented.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.040
And then when we study other things like emotions and decision making,

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.040
that's a different topic, like a different world, different people.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:08.040
And clearly there's an enormous interface there because the way

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.040
much of our pleasure comes from interacting with the world

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:17.040
and there's enormous variability there and how people sense and hear things

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.040
and the emotion, anyway, all of that is totally unexplored.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:27.040
I was just going to say one other thing about the other thing I heard in your story there

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:32.040
was the importance, I would call that, of sort of doing ecologically valid research, right?

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.040
And so you know the joke about, you know, you come into the parking lot

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.040
and there's the drunk looking for his keys under the lamp post, you know,

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040
and you say, well, what are you doing? I'm looking for my keys.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:44.040
Well, where'd you lose them over there? Why are you looking here?

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.040
Because the light's better.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.040
And so, you know, I think a lot of science can be characterized in that manner, right?

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Yeah, of course you are.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.040
So, you know, I hold that, but I still hold my earlier comments

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.040
about our need for more precision, right? And so it's a balance.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.040
It's a balancing act. But thank you for your story.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.040
I have one more real quick comment about what you said.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.040
I don't know the author. What is a recent study of infants

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.040
that showed that they observed the effort being made by their parents

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.040
doing some tasks, some tasks that might be frustrating.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:22.040
And the infants saw the difference between the parents making the effort or not.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.040
I don't know how they measured the outcome, but there was some sort of outcome.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:29.040
This is in nature. It was not an obscure journal or anything like that.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:32.040
But it was interesting that how, you know, that idea of empathy and that,

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.040
oh, that's important to someone else, important to me.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.040
So that must be important. And as a way of engendering curiosity,

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.040
you can see that be rather potent.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:49.040
I want to add my thanks to all of you for such an interesting conversation.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:56.040
I live in this neighborhood in which there are a lot of children of working parents,

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:03.040
a number of whom have wherewithal, and increasingly children go to school

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.040
after school have a lot of activities that are assigned,

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:15.040
gymnastics, art, whatever. It's sort of like little channels.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:21.040
And in between, I've observed, they will say, I'm bored when one activity is over.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:29.040
I'm bored. As if they say to members around, as if that's their responsibility

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.040
to find how it should be resolved.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.040
And I wondered, you had mentioned internal reflection.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:47.040
What happens to that in that kind of a situation where you're not allowed to be bored,

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:52.040
or it quickly has to be resolved, whereas in other times,

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:59.040
children were left supposedly to their own, you know, finding their own answers to these things?

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:05.040
One metaphor that might speak to that from George Simmel, a sociologist, many years ago,

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.040
we talked about the relationship between technology and boredom,

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:12.040
and how they collude with one another. We're hearing lots about collusion,

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.040
so the idea that boredom and technology collude, and on this particular issue,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.040
the idea is that using technology is like falling into a fast-moving river

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.040
where you can forget how to swim. The river carries you along,

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.040
and you don't even need to know how to swim anymore. You just, before you know it, you're downstream.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:38.040
And so I would use that metaphor to communicate the idea that if your time is structured exogenously,

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:46.040
if your attention is directed exogenously, the capacity to endogenously direct your attention may atrophy.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.040
Now, I can't say this based on any kind of research finding at this point,

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:57.040
but this is certainly something that we're trying to see if we can bring under the lamp post of science

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.040
to see if we can kind of actually quantify that sort of effect.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.040
What loss is there? I mean, what happens then?

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:10.040
It's, I mean, to put it very metaphorically, it's like a skill that atrophies.

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.040
When we're born, we have a hard time directing our attention, right?

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:20.040
Our attention is very much stimulus bound. There's a, you know, a rattle over here, you know,

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:27.040
and then it takes some development for us to be able to disengage from that and to engage in internal reflection.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.040
And so this is a skill that needs to be taught and needs to be developed,

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.040
and I think the excessive use of technology may short circuit opportunities to develop that skill.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:41.040
And it's not only technology. I mean, I completely agree, and I think, you know, I hear what you're saying about those children,

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.040
and I see it a lot myself. You know, we are not in a society that actually fosters that sense of self-reliance,

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:55.040
and the beneficial effects of being bored, i.e., using your own devices to mentally come out of that state

01:25:55.040 --> 01:26:01.040
and to actually use it to some kind of positive, you know, that creative capacity that we were talking about earlier on.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:06.040
You know, standing in the subway, I try to read when I'm in the subway, but there are announcements all the time

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.040
that have nothing to do with anything. There are people talking, you know, there's just, you're constantly stimulated.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.040
When I was in, when I was in, when I lived in Boston, there was this one moment that,

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:20.040
thank goodness, only lasted about a week. It was an experiment, and I think they must have gotten a lot of complaints

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.040
where they suddenly started blasting music on the platform so that, God forbid, you should be bored for two seconds

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:32.040
or actually, you know, alone with your thoughts while waiting for the train to come, and I was thinking, you know,

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.040
I want my thoughts. I want a little bit of quiet. I want to actually find out what's going on in there.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:41.040
That's like going into a doctor's office where they're playing some kind of medical TV or something.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.040
Exactly. That's right. And blasting, usually. So you can't even, yeah.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:50.040
And this also slides into the ethical issue, right, about who controls the focus of our attention, right?

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:57.040
And who controls what's in the focus of our attention and have we given that up, right?

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.040
Have we willingly kind of just said, well, okay, you get to control it.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.040
Right.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:16.040
Along the way, I feel I was taught in the clinical situation to look at boredom as a defense or as a way of avoiding or not feeling

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:23.040
some other affective state, whether it's depression, anxiety, annoyance, anger.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:30.040
I think fear of death and anxiety about death may be present in everything we talked about about time.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.040
We don't have that much time. We're worried about losing it.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:42.040
And then in the clinical situation also, I was taught, Ted Jacobs was one of the great teachers in this,

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:49.040
that to use my own sense of boredom when patients are obsessively going on about something that's not important to them,

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:55.040
to try to bring them back to the things that are important by pointing out their areas of defense

01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.040
and get them to. And what usually happens is once people start talking about something important,

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.040
they're again, become alive and all of that.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:06.040
And this thing, I was thinking about Eric Handel with the Applesia, you know.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.040
You hit the snout, first time the Applesia is really excited about all this.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.040
You hit the snout 20 times after, well, please give me something else.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.040
You know, if it's killing the Applesia, it's probably not that good.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.040
But we haven't, maybe Ed could talk more about this,

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:31.040
and how this comes up in the clinical situation and how people use their own boredom,

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.040
understanding of their patient's boredom, and then this question of,

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.040
is boredom related to some pathological interior state?

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:45.040
If you're very healthy and you're always curious and all of that, you don't get bored unless somebody else annoys you

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.040
with their narcissism. But anyway, discussion of this.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.040
Want to give it?

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:59.040
No, I have to remind my email that I have to put my own way of dealing with it.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.040
Try to always put it in the process of doing it.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040
Yeah.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:04.040
There is a second.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:15.040
I think it would be, if there is this sort of, if there is, if it's so,

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:21.040
if there is sort of this toggling back and forth between just sort of our minds being kind of empty,

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:31.040
and then taking action, if that's a reasonable metaphor or a paradigm for what we do when we get curious or fieldboard.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:39.040
I think one of the mechanisms that may stymie that would be thwarted wishes or that sort of goes back to the psychoanalytic model of it.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:47.040
If the person has an act, there's an act they have in mind, usually unconsciously, but sometimes, not always unconsciously,

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.040
and they can't act it sort of like Hamlet, they dither and they say, I'm bored.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.040
And I, well, you know, in so many words.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:02.040
And it could also lead to depression because of the lack of attaining goals and the loss that may come as a consequence.

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040
There are all sorts of ramifications.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.040
But I think that, where's the action?

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.040
Why is the action not taking place?

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:15.040
By the way, the thing about action may have to do with whether you're from the Eastern way of thinking or the Western way of thinking.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:28.040
A lot of these issues like mindfulness and how comfortable people are within their skins may be different in cultures where they're trying to reduce desire rather than just get them satisfied.

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:34.040
Well, but what's interesting about Eastern traditions, though, they're not, they don't say don't take action.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.040
They're saying don't have desires.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:40.040
And that's an important difference. So they actually do have a sense of action being important.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.040
Yeah.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:48.040
One of the things you started with was that boredom was the desire for desire.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:53.040
But there's also this rejection of the options on offer.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:59.040
Like for a child who's on board, will go out and swing or stay in and play with your cars.

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:04.040
Things that were engaging yesterday and will be engaging again tomorrow,

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:10.040
for some reason are failing to capture that attention at this particular time.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:20.040
And the physical pain of a hot stove will always be the same, whereas this attentional pain of boredom can vary.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.040
So I was just wondering what your thoughts on that were.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.040
Yeah.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:28.040
Can you just expand your last point there about the physical pain and the potential pain?

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:34.040
So a hot stove always gives you the signal that's something you should avoid.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:40.040
But a day in which you're not interested in the things that have been interesting and will be interesting again

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:44.040
are giving you this boredom signal, this attentional pain.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.040
Right.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:48.040
That doesn't happen every single time.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:54.040
Right. But I would say when the signal does happen, it's pushing you to find engagement either with what you were doing

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:58.040
that may have in the past engaged you or something else.

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:01.040
But your first point maybe speaks to this.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:04.040
I'm not sure come back to me if it doesn't.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:09.040
But indeed, the boredom is this desire for an actionable desire.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:14.040
And the flip side of that is to say what is is not okay.

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:15.040
Right.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:19.040
So when you're bored, there is a rejection of the present moment.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:23.040
And it's sort of saying, I won't have this.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:26.040
Right. I won't commit to this. I won't engage with this.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.040
I won't have this.

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:40.040
And the degree of sort of obstinents I guess can vary to some degree, you know, or is it driven by an oppositional stance

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:44.040
or is it driven by a stance that I can't connect with it, you know.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:51.040
But I very much resonate with your idea that boredom, we talked about it in the positive, a desire for a desire,

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040
but there is an inverse side of that as well.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.040
And that's very much part of the phenomenology.

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:00.040
And I wonder too whether this doesn't shade into what you were saying about boredom moving toward frustration

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:04.040
because there could be some sense of frustration that this was interesting to me yesterday.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.040
And now I can't get interested in what's going on here.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:12.040
Yeah. So I want to go into your comparison with pain.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:20.040
So, you know, there's a bit of a cognitive illusion here that if there is a stimulant that whatever we're,

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.040
the world is, the way like we open our eyes and things are.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.040
And that's reality. That's given.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:33.040
But I think we fail to appreciate that unless our brains make a decision to engage.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.040
And if we don't engage with that, things are not really.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:44.040
So even the simple decision that I made a decision to engage with this part of the world and to ignore what's behind me,

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:46.040
I think it's a bit the same thing.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:52.040
So just because you have that toy there today, it doesn't mean it's going to engage me in the same way.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:57.040
There's a very complex filter going on that determines my response to that toy.

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:03.040
Now if things are stimuli that are really strong, like a hot stove or if somebody hits you on the head,

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.040
you can engage with that.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:09.040
But that's a very small fraction of the information.

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.040
And that's a good survival.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.040
Right.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:20.040
Yes, I see your point when you say that boredom is also a rejection of the possibilities.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:30.040
As I understand your point, yes, I totally agree because sometimes boredom is the result of,

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:37.040
yeah, you simply are rejecting the possibilities that the environment is suffering you because

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:45.040
how to say I'm trying to find the world are preplanned.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:53.040
So you previously expect what are the possibilities you know in advance.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:35:00.040
So there is no novelty in the possibilities of the environment.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:08.040
Yeah, more or less all, this is the first point when you say boredom is a rejection of the possibilities.

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:14.040
Not even necessarily a rejection, but perhaps even a failure of the stimuli to capture your attention.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.040
Oh, yeah.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.040
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:21.040
You don't see the prospect of learning.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.040
You don't see the prospect of any new pattern.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.040
I think we're constantly looking for patterns in the brain.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.040
And if you don't see it coming, it's just not engaged.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:34.040
The choices themselves, the range of choice themselves can become hack need.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:38.040
You know, like, you know, these are the range of things I might do.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.040
And now I'm bored with that as well.

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.040
Exactly.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:50.040
There is the point is there are not possibilities in which you can be engaged, but you know all of them.

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:51.040
Right.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.040
So who they are going to.

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.040
Right.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.040
Thank you for the discussion.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:58.040
It's really, really great.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:03.040
It's taken me by surprise because I didn't think that boredom would be such an interesting and fun topic.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:08.040
I'm just going to read my notes because they turned into questions.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:23.040
And so it would be, is boredom a state of which we perhaps are also not comfortable being with our state of being or being with ourself?

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.040
Is it okay to be bored?

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:49.040
And should it as such be encouraged among especially children to just be until any sort of engagement comes naturally and not as a suggestion or guidance or pressure of another who has perhaps an already preconceived notion of what boredom is for them?

01:36:49.040 --> 01:37:07.040
And so can one allow their own experience to choose what they want to do and be and until that comes to be okay to be bored?

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:17.040
On your first comment, your first question, I mean, it's a little bit, I mean Kierkegaard talked about boredom throwing you back into yourself.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.040
Right.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:32.040
And so that when we can't have that engagement with the world, that intentional stance towards the world, that something falls apart and we're left with nothing but ourselves.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.040
And that's a very kind of adverse of sort of state.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.040
So I do think that that first part of what you said makes a lot of sense.

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:52.040
But I would suggest that we shouldn't be encouraging people to foster the state of boredom, as I said earlier, but we should be encouraging them to develop the capacity to be quiet, right?

01:37:52.040 --> 01:38:02.040
To develop the capacity to be understimulated, to develop the capacity for that constructive internal reflection that we spoke about earlier.

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:12.040
And I think that's not the same as being bored, right? That's being quiet and being with yourself.

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:18.040
And I do think that that is something that needs to be fostered.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:31.040
But I think just a small, I agree completely with what you're saying, but I think maybe a small nuance is that the idea that it might not be okay to be bored is maybe something that then creases that sense of anxiety that in fact goes kind of hand in hand.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:36.040
And I mean, the reality is, of course it's okay to be bored, and everyone is at some point.

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:38.040
And I agree.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.040
I'm allowed to promote boredom, but...

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.040
Exactly.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:46.040
You want to tell people to be bored, but it does happen, and there are things, very good things that could come out of it.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.040
If you're not so anxious about it.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:58.040
Someone here used the word magical earlier, I think you were referring to, I forget, you said something about being, that sense is being so magical, right?

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:12.040
I think that sort of existential challenge to be, just be, it's such a wonderful possibility that we don't teach that very well to people that this is a creative and very exciting for me to create myself in some way.

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.040
I mean, that's getting out there philosophically speaking, but I think you asked for it.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.040
I think it's wonderful.

01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.040
Getting people to really engage in that level is so important.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:29.040
And the challenges, this is a society in which the possibility of just being without distraction is becoming harder and harder.

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.040
But I want to ask you something.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.040
So you live in this society, right?

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.040
And you manage to enjoy being by yourself without distraction, right?

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.040
So to what extent do you think, clearly there are individual differences, right?

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:51.040
So some people would just always be able to talk by themselves, think about something, inquire something, research, do this or that, no matter how many cell phones they have.

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:56.040
But then other people, so what do you think, I mean, right?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:59.040
So is this part, nurture, part, nature?

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:10.040
I don't know what the question is, but so how would we structure an environment that, for example, that encourages the other?

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:16.040
I mean, look, you could say for me, people ask me, does the internet, does that induce boredom?

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:22.040
I'm like, no, just the opposite, it's more stuff to learn and find out, it's more easily available information.

01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:24.040
How can I possibly be bored?

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:25.040
I'm not sure about that.

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.040
Right?

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:29.040
Well, I understand that there are two responses, right?

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.040
But the question is, how do you nudge people, you know, one more one way, then?

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:37.040
It's not just the environment, so a reaction to it.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:42.040
Well, I mean, we know that there are a lot of individual differences in the propensity to be bored.

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.040
And that's a whole topic in its own right that we didn't touch on today.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:50.040
Like, what are the psychological characteristics that predispose someone to feel bored?

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:56.040
And in the psychology literature, there's actually more work that's been done on that on the state boredom, right?

01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:00.040
So there's state boredom, and then there's trait boredom or the propensity to be bored.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:08.040
But now I think the field is circling back and realizing that the way we had defined and measured trait boredom was quite problematic.

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:13.040
But there are some findings, and to the question about the clinical setting,

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:18.040
Alexa Thymia is highly correlated with boredom-proneness.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.040
So, you know, just to give one example, and there's many others that we could look at as well.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.040
You should define that for me.

01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:28.040
Oh, so Alexa Thymia refers to, I think it literally means no words for feelings.

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.040
Would that be the right word?

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.040
So someone who is high in Alexa Thymia would, if you ask them, how are you doing today?

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.040
They might say, oh, I have a tummy ache, right?

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.040
So they might somatatize, or they might just say, oh, I feel bad, but they couldn't say I'm disappointed or I'm upset.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:51.040
So they lack the capacity to label and reflect on their rich emotional kind of,

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.040
and I guess there's some debate on whether it's purely a lack of a label or lack of an experience or some combination of both.

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:05.040
But I think about emotions as compass points, right, that orient us in life toward moving away from things that are a problem or moving towards things that are value to us.

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:12.040
And so if we lack those compass points, if we are high in Alexa Thymia, it's more likely that we're going to then struggle with boredom.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:19.040
Very cool point that the insula cortex is close to the speech center in the brain.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.040
Hi.

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.040
I thank you for the discussion.

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:33.040
Just to the disclaimer, my father Gerald has been talking about this for weeks in preparation, which has been a bit boring.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:43.040
So I would like to thank the other conversants for giving their thoughts on it so I could put it all together with my father's thoughts for the past few weeks.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:51.040
But anyway, my father had an earlier comment about Murph being the opposite of boredom, and being a millennial.

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.040
It made me think about memes, because I say this both in jest and in seriousness,

01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:03.040
and just because my father's on a roundtable and to ask him a question about memes seems pretty appropriate.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:13.040
But the seriousness comes in the fact that I feel memes have become the vector of a lot of millennial humor and the humor for the generation after me, I think Generation Z.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:19.040
And it seems to be a cure in my eyes if Murph is the opposite of boredom.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:26.040
It's a cure of boredom, boredom in the nanosecond scale, as the other questioner mentioned, of how you feel before you reach for your phone.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:29.040
So how do you think about that statement of meme culture?

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:32.040
Is the millennials' attempt at curing boredom?

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:40.040
And do you think it's a good idea in this vein to do memes actually cure the sanosecond boredom,

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:48.040
or is it just distracting us from the reality that this thing exists and it's always going to exist, and that this isn't the best way to go about it?

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:51.040
Well, thank you, son, for reminding me of that comment I made earlier.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:58.040
I actually intended to follow up with that comment about Murph being the opposite in some sense,

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:02.040
and I don't mean it strictly speaking, but Murph being the opposite of boredom.

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:08.040
There's some ideas about the sort of development of a sense of taste going back to the 18th century,

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:15.040
where I think it was Dubois wrote a piece early on about aesthetics and the theory of aesthetics,

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:22.040
where he said that the playfulness of the mind, or the play of the mind is what allows people to find beauty in things,

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.040
or is a cause of identifying things as being beautiful.

01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:33.040
And it's an interesting way to look at an interesting paradigm, because playfulness is another version of curiosity,

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:42.040
where it's a natural stage of curiosity in, I think, in many animal species, I know for sure the mammalian species,

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:55.040
and the means come in, it really comes down to what's funny and what might engage you in a feeling of Murph.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:03.040
I think if it's just sort of a sensational and exciting and sensational, that it's not very helpful to stave off boredom,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:06.040
and it's a way of just getting like a shot of cocaine.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:09.040
Maybe not that good, but, you know.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:17.040
But if it engages you to think in a funny way, or in a playful way, even more important and funny,

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:24.040
if it engages you to engage in a playful way with things, then I think that's a wonderful remedy to boredom.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:32.040
I completely agree, and I guess I might add that creating clever means is a better antidote than observing them.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:34.040
Yeah, well, but, yeah.

01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:41.040
Yeah, actually, the playfulness links to what I was thinking about, which really has to do with infant and child development,

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:49.040
and what we've learned about the importance of mother-infant play, or caregiver-infant play from very early on,

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:54.040
in terms of regulating both emotional states and attentional states,

01:45:54.040 --> 01:46:02.040
and then as development proceeds to then get to a state where the child, you know, can tautle over and show mommy something,

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.040
or daddy and daddy says, wow, that's fantastic.

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:13.040
This little caterpillar is moving, and how important those shared interpersonal experiences are,

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:17.040
not only in epic regulation, which I think is a lot of the underlying stuff,

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:23.040
but in expanding capacity for both attention and curiosity, which, you know, certainly,

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:30.040
and trauma, where you see alexithymia in other states of deadness, variations of that,

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:36.040
and things we might call boredom, that we really see in the clinical situation all the time,

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:41.040
and I think that's why we focused on it with our seeing as a defense, and always wondering,

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.040
both what is happening now with my patient, that either my patient is saying they're bored or I'm feeling bored,

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.040
what's happening between the two of us and what's not being touched on,

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.040
as well as historically of what was the joint interpersonal joining experience

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:01.040
and shared experience of both curiosity and affect is really important in, I think,

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:06.040
in thinking about boredom and curiosity, which is clearly important.

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:12.040
There's a study that we need to do there, right, to see if there's sort of generational

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:21.040
boredom, if it's something that, you know, those developmental experiences increase the likelihood of it.

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:27.040
Okay, thank you.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:55.040
Thank you.
