WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I'm Ed Nurse-Shesian, Director of the Center.

00:03.000 --> 00:12.160
Welcome to this meeting on cancer and body and mind.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.480
Before I introduce the participants,

00:14.480 --> 00:19.760
I'd like to tell you a few things about future programming.

00:19.760 --> 00:24.760
On October 25th, we have span of infinity.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.200
On November 15th, complexity and emergence.

00:29.200 --> 00:34.440
On November 22nd, we are going to show the movie Particle Fever

00:34.440 --> 00:37.920
and after that, we are going to have a round table.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.960
And on December 6th, we are going to have a program

00:41.960 --> 00:45.680
called French Thureles Poetry, a sampler

00:45.680 --> 00:48.360
that Anne-Marie Levine has organized.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.400
And on December 13th, we will have

00:50.400 --> 00:54.320
search for immortality.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.600
Today's program came about during a conversation I had

01:00.600 --> 01:05.520
with Andrea Califano, where he was telling me

01:05.520 --> 01:08.440
that cancer is always in your body.

01:08.440 --> 01:11.000
And he can correct me if I'm saying it wrong,

01:11.000 --> 01:12.880
because we had a few glasses of wine.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.680
And I may not remember things, right?

01:15.680 --> 01:18.840
But essentially, that cancer is in your body

01:18.840 --> 01:20.080
and what makes the difference.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.840
Or one of the things that makes the difference

01:21.840 --> 01:23.960
is your immune system.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.120
And that one of the factors that affects the immune system

01:27.120 --> 01:28.360
is stress.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.760
And one of the things that can be stressful is being depressed.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.720
So that's what gave us the idea of discussing

01:37.720 --> 01:42.880
the latest findings on cancer, but then also

01:42.880 --> 01:47.680
talking about the role of the mind in some effects

01:47.680 --> 01:50.600
on the immune system.

01:50.600 --> 01:56.800
So today's participants are Andrea Califano, who

01:56.800 --> 01:59.960
has been here before, and who is the Clyde and Helen Woo

01:59.960 --> 02:03.800
Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology at Columbia

02:03.800 --> 02:07.000
in the departments of biochemistry and molecular

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
biophysics and of biomedical informatics.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.160
He is currently the founding director and chair

02:13.160 --> 02:16.840
of the Columbia Initiative for Systems Biology.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.960
He also serves as associate director

02:18.960 --> 02:23.400
of a bioinformatics in the Herbert Irving Comprehensive

02:23.400 --> 02:25.240
Cancer Center.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.680
I'm not going to read everything but just

02:29.680 --> 02:32.840
to give you an idea.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.960
The next to him is Selena Cenkeang,

02:35.960 --> 02:39.000
who is professor of pathology and professor of immunology

02:39.000 --> 02:41.960
and microbial pathogenesis at wild Cornell.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.000
Her focus is to convert conceptual breakthroughs,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.200
into novel cancer therapies.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.000
She pioneered the concept that controlling the cell

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
cycling cancer cells can reprogram them for a killing

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
by a partner agent.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
She has implemented this novel strategy

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
in several hypothesis driven clinical triers of combination

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
therapy in human cancers such as lymphoma.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Susan Lottgendorf is professor at the Department of Psychology,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Obstetrics and Gynecology and Geology and member

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
at the University of Iowa.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Her current work funded by the National Cancer Institute

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
examines how factors such as stress, depression,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
social support or link to biological processes

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
involved in endogenesis, inflammation,

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
and recurrence in ovarian cancer patients.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
Hans Gido Wendell is the principal investigator

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
at the Cancer Genetics Laboratory at Memorial Sloan Cathering.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
He works to identify new cancer therapies

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
based on the genetic origins of the disease.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
He comes from Germany,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
and he is a physician.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
He is a physician.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
He is a physician for the disease.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
He comes from Germany and trained in medicine in Arkan

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
and then was at Edinburgh and is currently

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
an associate member of the Sloan Cathering Institute.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
So that's it, and you can start.

04:20.000 --> 04:35.160
So, just going back to our discussion, I think it was prompted by the fact that over

04:35.160 --> 04:40.760
the last three, four years, there has been a tremendous transformation of the cancer

04:40.760 --> 04:47.320
field due to an increased success of immunotherapies based approaches.

04:47.320 --> 04:51.160
And it started a long time ago with some of the work that Rosenfeld has done.

04:51.160 --> 04:58.320
More recently, Carl June, many others have studied to really harness how we can remove

04:58.320 --> 05:04.560
the veil that hides the cancer from the immune system and therefore have success in some

05:04.560 --> 05:11.560
cases where, from a point of view of either surgery or conventional chemotherapy or even

05:11.560 --> 05:15.800
targeted therapy, there was really no hope left.

05:15.800 --> 05:22.040
And just a couple of weeks ago, a new drug called Pembro has been approved by the FDA

05:22.040 --> 05:25.320
on an accelerated path.

05:25.320 --> 05:33.040
And this drug essentially re-establishes immune function in the context of cancer and has

05:33.040 --> 05:39.480
been tremendously successful for using melanomas and now it's been also tested on gastric cancers

05:39.480 --> 05:45.320
that are positive for the ligand of this particular protein called PDL1.

05:45.320 --> 05:55.080
So based on these unexpected and maybe long expected but not yet delivered suddenly becoming

05:55.080 --> 06:01.760
available successes, we thought that maybe there was going to be an increasing focus on

06:01.760 --> 06:09.360
the immune system even in terms of how immunosuppression contributes in some ways to the development

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
and progression of cancer.

06:11.360 --> 06:17.800
And certainly there are now even concepts at the NCI that are focusing around the notion

06:17.800 --> 06:21.960
of stress and how stress can potentially be one of the triggers.

06:21.960 --> 06:27.280
And remember we were saying that we have cancer every day, what we mean is that we have, you

06:27.280 --> 06:34.600
know, so a billion cells in our body and the probability that one of those cells has mutations

06:34.600 --> 06:37.480
that would make it to more genetic are very high.

06:37.480 --> 06:42.800
And so something has to be taken care of that on a continuous basis and that's what our immune

06:42.800 --> 06:46.640
system does, basically immediately targets any kind of lesions.

06:46.640 --> 06:51.640
There are also other mechanisms that are built in the cell like senescence and scope apoptosis

06:51.640 --> 06:59.400
but the immune system does a great job of getting rid of initial sort of starts of these

06:59.400 --> 07:00.680
disease.

07:00.680 --> 07:07.080
So that was the context in which this discussion came out and I think it would be great to

07:07.080 --> 07:13.080
hear from Susan whether there have been more sort of the molecular level connection between

07:13.080 --> 07:16.720
stress and anxiety and cancer.

07:16.720 --> 07:30.120
Okay, so in the work that we do, we look at two areas related to cancer, cancer initiation

07:30.120 --> 07:31.760
and cancer progression.

07:31.760 --> 07:38.320
And initiation is the development of cancer and people who don't have cancer already.

07:38.320 --> 07:45.240
And progression is once people have cancer, does the question is does stress help cancer

07:45.240 --> 07:46.480
progress?

07:46.480 --> 07:56.040
So looking at the initiation side, there's, the evidence is really pretty equivocal.

07:56.040 --> 08:00.720
People think that stress can cause cancer, it's out there in the popular literature.

08:00.720 --> 08:06.880
I've had people come up to me in the clinic and say, my sister says I'm such a positive

08:06.880 --> 08:10.640
person, I don't understand why I've got cancer.

08:10.640 --> 08:20.320
And so the role of what stress can do is limited because it's interacting with biology.

08:20.320 --> 08:27.600
One of the things we know in the field of psychonuroimmunology is that there is a very,

08:27.600 --> 08:33.400
very well characterized relationship between stress and the immune system.

08:33.400 --> 08:40.800
And it seems to affect both the cellular immune system and the humeral immune system.

08:40.800 --> 08:47.880
A cute stress tends to stimulate the immune system and it's really chronic stress that

08:47.880 --> 08:50.680
we think about in the context of cancer.

08:50.680 --> 08:54.960
So what's chronic stress?

08:54.960 --> 09:03.600
People have looked at it in terms of chronic loneliness, caretaking, medical students studying

09:03.600 --> 09:05.160
for boards.

09:05.160 --> 09:11.080
Nobody's looked at people studying for, people preparing grants, but you probably get that.

09:11.080 --> 09:15.760
Well, unless you're doing grant after grant after grant.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.120
Today, hearing grant is chronic stress.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.560
Right, because it's one after the other.

09:22.560 --> 09:28.560
But chronic stress particularly where the person has a feeling of helplessness or this

09:28.560 --> 09:36.760
is going to go on and on can affect the immune system because on B cells, on T cells, on

09:36.760 --> 09:45.040
MK cells, on macrophages, there are beta adrenergic receptors, there are glucocorticoid receptors,

09:45.040 --> 09:51.520
and those basically change the functioning of those cells.

09:51.520 --> 10:02.880
So what we've seen in the context of cancer is people started looking in the area of do

10:02.880 --> 10:10.440
in people who have cancer is natural killer cell functioning depressed, is macrophage

10:10.440 --> 10:14.520
functioning changed, is T cell functioning changed.

10:14.520 --> 10:22.720
And basically, there's good evidence that in people with chronic stress and people with

10:22.720 --> 10:31.800
depression, in people who are lonely, that various aspects of cellular immune function

10:31.800 --> 10:37.000
is downregulated in people who have cancer.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.320
And that's where we started out in our research.

10:43.320 --> 10:48.840
And people had looked basically at peripheral blood and we asked the question, what about

10:48.840 --> 10:51.480
in the tumor itself?

10:51.480 --> 10:57.760
And we found that indeed not only in circulating blood but in the area of the tumor, there

10:57.760 --> 11:02.360
was depression of natural killer cell activity.

11:02.360 --> 11:10.960
Then we started looking more directly and saying, well, if there is an effect on host

11:10.960 --> 11:18.280
tumor cells, on immune cells which are supposed to be doing surveillance against tumor cells

11:18.280 --> 11:24.480
or attacking tumor cells, would we see direct effects of stress on tumor cells?

11:24.480 --> 11:31.200
And that started a line of research which I've been involved in with a colleague, Neil

11:31.200 --> 11:38.640
Sood, from MD Anderson and supported by the National Cancer Institute looking at direct

11:38.640 --> 11:41.080
effects on tumor cells.

11:41.080 --> 11:49.440
And so what we see is that in correlational studies and clinical studies that patients

11:49.440 --> 11:58.560
with either higher levels of loneliness or higher levels of tumor norepinephrine, which

11:58.560 --> 12:06.560
is a stress hormone, have higher rates of angiogenesis.

12:06.560 --> 12:12.480
They have, their tumor cells are more aggressive, they're more invasive, they're less likely

12:12.480 --> 12:15.520
to die when they're circulating through the body.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.120
So there seem to be all these relationships.

12:20.120 --> 12:31.640
And conversely with people who are more positive, who have a more, an outlook on life that is

12:31.640 --> 12:39.040
looking more for benefits rather than fear based, they tend to have a stronger immune

12:39.040 --> 12:43.200
system and less of these effects.

12:43.200 --> 12:50.480
So that's sort of the overall picture that we're seeing that stress or negative psychosocial

12:50.480 --> 13:00.920
functioning not only can make the tumor more aggressive but also depletes the body's resistance

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
against the tumor.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.800
Can I ask you a little bit because this is very interesting.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.680
You talk about a direct effect on the cancer cell but is it mediated by the immune system

13:08.680 --> 13:11.240
or do you think that it's actually immune system independent?

13:11.240 --> 13:16.480
So if you did this in a, in a nutmeg mouse, that's no immune system, would you still

13:16.480 --> 13:19.760
see an effect of stress directly on the tumor cells?

13:19.760 --> 13:20.760
You do.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.760
You do.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.760
Okay.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.840
And so I'll give you some thoughts on mediation.

13:26.840 --> 13:34.680
So if you're looking at how does stress affect tumor cells, you have direct effects through

13:34.680 --> 13:43.680
beta-atronergic receptors on tumor cells and through nerves that are innovating the tumor

13:43.680 --> 13:45.200
mass itself.

13:45.200 --> 13:54.080
You also have indirect effects, for example, through the macrophages so that stress can

13:54.080 --> 13:59.560
– so should we put cancer patients on beta blockers?

13:59.560 --> 14:05.000
Well there's been a lot of interest in that and there have been some pilot studies looking

14:05.000 --> 14:07.440
at that because – Does it make a difference?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.160
Does it make a difference?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.440
I'm not aware of the study.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.640
There have been both positive and negative findings.

14:14.640 --> 14:25.360
It seems to depend on the cancer and it seems to depend on the particular receptors on the

14:25.360 --> 14:26.200
cancer.

14:26.200 --> 14:30.480
But there have been some – there was a meta-analysis done recently and there have been

14:30.480 --> 14:38.400
some pretty successful studies of – and at this point most of the studies are retrospective.

14:38.400 --> 14:44.400
There hasn't been a really solid multi-center clinical trial looking at putting patients

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
on beta blockers.

14:45.400 --> 14:51.680
I think that in terms of stress, the two areas are probably quite important – one is cytokines.

14:51.680 --> 14:58.760
These are the small molecule and often stress – at the molecular level some of them are

14:58.760 --> 15:02.600
understood is induced inflammatory cytokines.

15:02.600 --> 15:08.800
And that has a huge consequence in terms of every cell in the immune system, how they

15:08.800 --> 15:13.960
receive the cytokine and how in turn generates cytokines.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.400
I think this is a loop that's extremely important.

15:17.400 --> 15:22.520
And one of the consequences about this loop is – there are two things.

15:22.520 --> 15:28.040
One of the sloop is increasing cell number by cell division.

15:28.040 --> 15:32.480
So you cannot have cancer unless the cell division is misregulated.

15:32.480 --> 15:41.160
You need to have – one of the basis for cancer is cells are not controlled as programmed

15:41.160 --> 15:42.160
and stopped dividing.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.760
They keep on dividing.

15:43.760 --> 15:44.960
That's one thing.

15:44.960 --> 15:50.160
The other is as if a train failed to get to the station.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.720
They stopped somewhere in the middle.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.640
And that's lack of differentiation.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.520
But even that we won't have cancer.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.640
The other part is the cells fail to die.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.600
So you need all these parts.

16:03.600 --> 16:09.080
And actually all these are very much affected by cytokines.

16:09.080 --> 16:16.800
Because actually in the immune system T cells, B cells, all these cells – the students

16:16.800 --> 16:19.800
talk about cells in the immune system.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.760
NK represents natural killer cells.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.160
B cells are the cells that make antibodies.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.280
And T cells are two kinds.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.360
One is the T cell that help B cells to make antibodies.

16:32.360 --> 16:37.080
The other is the kind of T cell that itself can kill cells.

16:37.080 --> 16:42.880
And the macrophage is the powerhouse of making inflammatory cytokines.

16:42.880 --> 16:49.840
So I think that is actually – and that's both systemic as well as in tumor.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.320
And a lot of tumor cells are not supposed to make these things, but because they become

16:54.320 --> 16:56.640
tumor cells, they themselves make them.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.640
I think that's the issue.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.640
I think that's the issue.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.640
There's probably more here though, right?

17:01.640 --> 17:07.200
At the moment we're sort of discussing how does your psychology affect your immune system?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.200
We all know that, right?

17:08.200 --> 17:10.080
You're stressed and you hope this flares up.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.120
And obviously there is a connection here.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.760
You can probably turn it around as well.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.320
You can say, well, people have different abilities to deal with stress, different abilities to

17:19.320 --> 17:23.760
deal with the stress of a cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment, cancer going to the hospital

17:23.760 --> 17:25.840
back and forth themselves.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.680
And that may affect – well, it may affect the outcome.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.440
It may affect the way they can handle it.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.520
I'm talking about something that I have no clue of because I'm not a psychiatrist.

17:35.520 --> 17:43.880
But I would imagine for patients who are diagnosed who have cancer, their own ability to deal

17:43.880 --> 17:50.600
with stress, you know, having friends, having their network, having whatever helps you to

17:50.600 --> 17:56.840
deal with all your own predisposition to deal with stress affects the way that the cancer

17:56.840 --> 17:57.920
in turn affects them.

17:57.920 --> 18:02.480
I don't know if that is measurable in outcome, in survival and so on.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.880
But it probably is a big factor for patients and a big difference.

18:06.880 --> 18:12.200
If you look in a hospital on any ward with 30, 40 patients, you're going to have a spectrum

18:12.200 --> 18:17.800
of people who respond to it by saying, well, you know, it is what it is and I'll deal

18:17.800 --> 18:21.000
with it and you'll have people who respond very differently.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.600
And, you know, so I think that we've now discussed the – these sort of how does your

18:27.600 --> 18:32.080
psychology affect your immune system and cytokines and macrophages.

18:32.080 --> 18:38.080
But the mind and cancer problem, you can probably turn it around and it's not that I have

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
anything.

18:39.080 --> 18:46.920
One of the things that turns out to be consistently really important in terms of coping is social

18:46.920 --> 18:48.360
support.

18:48.360 --> 18:53.840
And one of the things – and the kind of social support is also really important.

18:53.840 --> 18:59.360
So for example, in ovarian cancer patients, which is mostly what I study, we've seen

18:59.360 --> 19:05.440
that it's the kind of social support where people feel emotionally connected with people,

19:05.440 --> 19:10.560
where they feel like they can talk to somebody, there's somebody at their back as opposed

19:10.560 --> 19:16.360
to there's somebody that can bring them chicken soup, that they can borrow money from, etc.

19:16.360 --> 19:24.760
So it's this emotional connection that we see related to survival in ovarian cancer

19:24.760 --> 19:25.760
patients.

19:25.760 --> 19:33.520
We see it related to tumor norepinephrine and we see it related to actually the gene expression

19:33.520 --> 19:41.800
at the time of diagnosis that there are – there's really a different signature in people who

19:41.800 --> 19:47.360
have high social support versus low social support.

19:47.360 --> 19:54.200
So I'm not understanding that what you were talking about, you were talking more about

19:54.200 --> 20:01.200
patients, the stress coming from having the cancer, having the diagnosis.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.120
Resources and dealing with it, right?

20:03.120 --> 20:05.760
But after having the disease.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.760
Yes.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.760
Right.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.760
It's too different.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.680
That's what I'm talking about too.

20:10.680 --> 20:18.840
So nobody's then talking about or it's not relevant, the issue of social support, stress

20:18.840 --> 20:22.560
and so on prior to the diagnosis.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.960
I think that's where Susan was saying that the waters are much murkier because I think

20:26.960 --> 20:33.640
after you get cancer there's a clear function in the immune system and the question is whether

20:33.640 --> 20:38.760
because the number of cells, the cancer cell is huge once you have cancer is detectable,

20:38.760 --> 20:40.280
it's a huge number.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.600
Once you have – when you start – you essentially start to get cancer, the number of cells

20:44.600 --> 20:49.040
is small, the potentially even maybe a minimal function of the immune system is already sufficient

20:49.040 --> 20:50.200
to keep it in check.

20:50.200 --> 20:55.200
So I think that's maybe what – you know what I see, again, I'm also like Gito, I'm

20:55.200 --> 21:01.600
not a psychiatrist or psychologist, but I work in basic sciences and one thing that we see

21:01.600 --> 21:05.720
that is very interesting is that in tissues there's always this balance.

21:05.720 --> 21:13.640
And essentially you have processes that compete, typical processes that compete in tumors are

21:13.640 --> 21:17.920
something called apoptosis which is programmed cell death and proliferation.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.960
And literally you can in lymphoma for instance, you know, which is on a field that you have

21:22.960 --> 21:29.360
eminent experts here, it was long thought that there was a process for instance by abrogating

21:29.360 --> 21:34.720
the function of P53 that you would essentially block apoptosis.

21:34.720 --> 21:39.680
But actually in the LBC alpha, diffused laspis-helymphoma, there is a significant fair bit of apoptosis

21:39.680 --> 21:40.680
going on.

21:40.680 --> 21:44.280
It's just that the proliferation is higher than the apoptosis and the tumor grows.

21:44.280 --> 21:48.200
If you can bring down – either increase apoptosis a little bit or bring down proliferation,

21:48.200 --> 21:49.360
then the tumor shrinks.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.560
And so it's really a balance between two things.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.920
And one thing that we've observed and this came out from some research results that we

21:55.920 --> 22:00.400
have not even published yet is that cancer seems to be really divided in two groups.

22:00.400 --> 22:07.400
There's a group where proliferation pathways seem to have a really marked sort of signature

22:07.400 --> 22:11.400
and there's a group where immunosuppressive pathways seem to have a significant signature.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.080
And the ones that are immunosuppressive are much less proliferative.

22:14.080 --> 22:19.000
So for instance, neuroendocrine tumors, completely non-proliferation tumors, they can be indolent

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
for years but they're totally immunosuppressive.

22:22.000 --> 22:28.240
They have like, they eliminate, they mask themselves behind the veil of a shroud of secretness

22:28.240 --> 22:30.720
and the immune system can undertake them.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.560
And there's work by – or Weisman that I think has been really seminal in the area

22:34.560 --> 22:41.280
of specific receptors called CD47 that actually are called the don't eat me signal.

22:41.280 --> 22:46.640
Basically they're used by stem cell that still have an immature self image that would

22:46.640 --> 22:50.040
otherwise be attacked by the immune system to basically tell your own immune system don't

22:50.040 --> 22:54.440
eat me as I go and do, you know, generate the tissue that I need to go and generate.

22:54.440 --> 22:59.960
It turns out that the vast majority of tumors actually express the CD47 receptor and IRV

22:59.960 --> 23:03.400
has been having some pretty substantial success and it's now running some large clinical

23:03.400 --> 23:10.200
studies with inhibitors of the CD47 receptor just to see whether we can – so that's

23:10.200 --> 23:16.400
an example where it would be very difficult for your own immune system to play a role

23:16.400 --> 23:18.840
because it's really – there's nothing to attack.

23:18.840 --> 23:21.320
You know, the essentially the tumor is invisible.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.360
So it doesn't matter whether your immune system is suppressed or not.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.360
Just tumor is like thin air.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.840
But if the tumor becomes visible where you essentially for instance in proliferative tumors

23:31.840 --> 23:37.120
where you have less immunosuppression then it may be possible that what Susan was saying

23:37.120 --> 23:38.120
may play a big role.

23:38.120 --> 23:43.720
So in fact I think many people wonder what the nutrition plays a role in cancer and that's

23:43.720 --> 23:49.400
another aspect I think that of eating healthily and sort of, you know, so far the reasons

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
of the glucose metabolism.

23:51.400 --> 23:58.480
I think there's definitely a good reason is that one clearly recognized fact is the

23:58.480 --> 24:03.680
metabolism of a tumor cell is very different from a normal cell.

24:03.680 --> 24:11.320
And because the tumor cells you would think that they are more powerful but actually if

24:11.320 --> 24:15.400
you remove these tumor cells and take it out they die very quickly.

24:15.400 --> 24:20.320
They are much more dependent on certain type of metabolism.

24:20.320 --> 24:28.080
So one of the ways now thinking about attacking tumor and sparing a normal cell is actually

24:28.080 --> 24:30.760
attacking the cancer metabolism.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.280
We're not there yet but there's a direction.

24:33.280 --> 24:38.680
The reason I want to bring this up again is the fact that all the things that you've

24:38.680 --> 24:44.600
mentioned and you mentioned about a cell cycle because we study that at some point it's

24:44.600 --> 24:54.280
actually integrated at metabolism it's like a real stat because that's the central sort

24:54.280 --> 24:57.000
of business wheel of a cell.

24:57.000 --> 25:05.680
It gives you energy, it gives you resources to generate manganese so a mother cancer cell

25:05.680 --> 25:08.720
can divide into two daughters cell.

25:08.720 --> 25:13.120
Without this the cancer cell will die and this is a very important thing.

25:13.120 --> 25:21.360
And I think what is also important is the way that if unless a patient is not treated

25:21.360 --> 25:29.360
otherwise when patients treat it often times the dose is too high, the drug and that high

25:29.360 --> 25:32.480
dose itself induces stress.

25:32.480 --> 25:39.340
And I think that's the direction that we are actually designing clinical trial beginning

25:39.340 --> 25:47.480
to think about this because sometimes the consequence of those high dose is worse than

25:47.480 --> 25:49.080
the benefit of it.

25:49.080 --> 25:55.840
And one major thing is interfering with metabolism tremendously in a bad way and the other is

25:55.840 --> 25:57.760
induced stress.

25:57.760 --> 26:03.960
I think this is a very, I think this stress and immune system are not separable.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.760
These two things are almost integrated.

26:06.760 --> 26:12.800
Is there another reason actually that started to come out just now of why for instance using

26:12.800 --> 26:20.840
drugs in ways that sort of overwhelm maybe negative positive is that drugs essentially

26:20.840 --> 26:28.520
a pressure on the cancer system and as a pressure typical evolutionary system it promotes

26:28.520 --> 26:33.560
essentially survival of certain clones, essentially some cells that have specific characteristics

26:33.560 --> 26:36.160
and kills the ones that don't have those characteristics.

26:36.160 --> 26:40.480
Because the ones that have the survival characteristics are much worse cells than the ones that

26:40.480 --> 26:41.480
get killed.

26:41.480 --> 26:45.400
And so you're basically, you're creating an environment where the absolute worst cells

26:45.400 --> 26:53.760
that would then give you a very aggressive tumor are now given total empty space to survive

26:53.760 --> 26:54.760
and to proliferate.

26:54.760 --> 26:59.000
And so what happens very frequently for instance is that you see that these tumors are initially

26:59.000 --> 27:05.280
shrink significantly after you get a particular treatment but then the tumor that comes up

27:05.280 --> 27:09.760
after that becomes extremely aggressive and actually kills the patient very, very rapidly.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.760
So these are things that we're just starting to understand.

27:12.760 --> 27:22.360
In fact I think almost invariably anyone who unfortunately get diagnosed the initial treatment

27:22.360 --> 27:26.040
always work a little bit and sometimes work very well.

27:26.040 --> 27:34.360
The time that's very difficult and very challenging sometimes is hopeless is a relapse.

27:34.360 --> 27:41.760
So I think what we really have to understand is how the progression leads to that relapse

27:41.760 --> 27:47.080
and all these factors whether it's stress, whether it's nutrition, whether it's support

27:47.080 --> 27:50.480
because I think support is not only for cancer.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.320
Anyone who has childbirth would like to have support.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.320
All these factors are universal.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.320
They're not just for cancer alone.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.560
It's the entire well-being of the individual.

28:00.560 --> 28:07.400
And I think for cancer I think probably the most important thing is to really understand

28:07.400 --> 28:09.280
and everybody's different.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.160
I'm sure you know this too.

28:11.160 --> 28:16.480
We do genomic sequencing and you take the normal cell from a cancer patient and we do

28:16.480 --> 28:18.120
this all the time.

28:18.120 --> 28:21.480
And you ask how many mutations, you know, normal cells.

28:21.480 --> 28:25.560
I bet you will have a million and I have a million, you have over a million.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.120
But you're okay.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.880
And what is different is what's the difference between your two more cells and normal cells.

28:31.880 --> 28:40.080
So I think ultimately to really get very deeply, we sort of have to recognize the individual.

28:40.080 --> 28:45.080
Every person is different and to really understand that deeper in order to integrate all this

28:45.080 --> 28:47.240
information and get to it.

28:47.240 --> 28:53.800
Otherwise we're going around the circle because until today cancer in most cases is not curable

28:53.800 --> 28:56.040
because we're going around the circle.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.920
And I think it's pretty important.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.960
But we have the tools now, right?

28:59.960 --> 29:02.160
We have a lot of tools.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
Incredible tools.

29:03.160 --> 29:09.200
There's also a lot of promise because I would say five years ago we don't have all these

29:09.200 --> 29:10.880
targeted agents.

29:10.880 --> 29:16.200
We have no ability to deal with some more number of cancer cells.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.200
But I think we do.

29:17.200 --> 29:22.040
We have a lot of systems, biology, everything to help us deal with that.

29:22.040 --> 29:27.880
I think it's a very interesting point right now because I'm actually quite skeptical towards

29:27.880 --> 29:33.400
targeted agents that go after a specific oncogen simply because, you know, typical examples

29:33.400 --> 29:34.560
be rough, right?

29:34.560 --> 29:35.560
So every one of our...

29:35.560 --> 29:38.960
But the combination of therapies ultimately need it.

29:38.960 --> 29:39.960
Exactly.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.440
But also I think we need to hit...

29:42.440 --> 29:44.560
Right now we're concentrating on the oncogenes.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.960
I think we need to find very much like your work, we have to find the non-oncogenes that

29:48.960 --> 29:52.000
are the Achilles heel of the tumor.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.040
And for instance, a typical example you were mentioning about the fact that we have cells,

29:56.040 --> 29:58.440
normal cells that have ulcerous mutation.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.920
Well the most famous one is BRAF, which is a mutation in melanoma.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.920
It's basically over 50% of melatonin have these mutations in this gene.

30:05.920 --> 30:11.960
A very specific point of the BRAF protein.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.280
But all our nevi have BRAF mutation.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.280
But they're not tumors.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.080
They're just normal cells.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.160
So clearly it can be just BRAF alone.

30:20.160 --> 30:24.720
And so when you look at the tumor, the big problem is that every single cell of the tumor

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
is different.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.720
Why?

30:26.720 --> 30:31.240
Because the very first event that goes wrong in the tumor is called loss of a tumor suppressor,

30:31.240 --> 30:36.400
which means that your tumor starts accumulating mutations much faster than your normal cells.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.720
And when you do that, essentially every tumor cell accumulates different mutations.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.160
So I think one of the major difficulties, and when you talk about relapse being the major

30:44.160 --> 30:49.560
problem, is that what drugs do, they hit the part of the tumor they can't hit.

30:49.560 --> 30:54.280
And whatever is left out that doesn't respond to the drug emerges and no longer sensitive

30:54.280 --> 30:55.920
to the drug.

30:55.920 --> 31:00.040
So I think what we need to figure out, and we actually published a paper today's ago

31:00.040 --> 31:05.320
in Cell showing that there are these sort of bottlenecks in the regulatory system of

31:05.320 --> 31:09.520
the tumors where all these mutations that you could try to hit with individual drugs

31:09.520 --> 31:14.400
are actually all converging and they have to go through just a small number of proteins.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.640
And we think very strongly that those are the proteins you want to hit.

31:17.640 --> 31:22.880
For instance in prostate cancer, it doesn't matter which genes you have mutated.

31:22.880 --> 31:26.160
In order to have the aggressive form of prostate cancer that will actually kill the patient

31:26.160 --> 31:31.560
and become undergens independent and become metastatic, you have to have co-activation

31:31.560 --> 31:34.840
of two proteins, one called FOXM1 and one called CMPF.

31:34.840 --> 31:38.480
If you don't have the super-activated, you will not get the aggressive prostate cancer.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.240
If you have them activated, you will get aggressive prostate cancer.

31:41.240 --> 31:47.240
So instead of hitting the oncogen upstream, where of which many can be differently mutated

31:47.240 --> 31:51.120
in different cancer cells within the same tumor, if you hit those two proteins, you're

31:51.120 --> 31:52.760
going to be in a much better shape.

31:52.760 --> 31:56.360
I think these are concepts that are just starting to be developed and it will be a long time

31:56.360 --> 31:59.760
before we apply them to the plane.

31:59.760 --> 32:08.400
I think if every cancer is parallel in this type of understanding, then we can begin to

32:08.400 --> 32:10.720
elevate our total understanding.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.400
I think that's very necessary.

32:13.400 --> 32:20.240
Unfortunately, we do have much better tools than we did before.

32:20.240 --> 32:24.200
In the last five years, things really, really move.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.200
So that's the hope.

32:25.200 --> 32:28.520
I think we can say that.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.720
It's very exciting.

32:30.720 --> 32:37.640
But the part that I do feel is important is anyone who is really trying to understand

32:37.640 --> 32:42.920
the cancer do have to consider what a normal cell does.

32:42.920 --> 32:48.120
Otherwise, we don't have the differential between tumor and normal.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.040
I think that's very important.

32:50.040 --> 32:56.280
After all, at the end, we are wanting to preserve is a normal and not the cancer.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.280
So what do you think?

32:58.280 --> 33:00.280
What do I think?

33:00.280 --> 33:04.360
Yeah, so the topic here is, what's the topic?

33:04.360 --> 33:05.880
Mind and cancer, right?

33:05.880 --> 33:13.200
In my view of how cancer rises, it's a population of cells that sit in your bone marrow or wherever

33:13.200 --> 33:18.120
in your lung that escape all the normal control mechanisms.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.840
So cells that are in your bone marrow and that make blood cells that are tightly controlled

33:22.840 --> 33:25.920
by cytokines and factors in the environment.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.320
The metabolism is controlled.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.480
Everything is tightly regulated.

33:30.480 --> 33:35.800
And maybe your psychology even affects the ability to do things.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.480
The cells lose all of that control.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.840
They bypass it step by step.

33:40.840 --> 33:43.320
They become independent of growth factors.

33:43.320 --> 33:47.800
They survive self-stress that a normal cell can't survive.

33:47.800 --> 33:53.720
Their metabolism becomes completely disconnected from any outside stimulus or even the availability

33:53.720 --> 33:55.320
of nutrients.

33:55.320 --> 34:00.240
They become like yeast on a petri dish.

34:00.240 --> 34:06.360
And so I think an important point for me in the discussion here is to discuss how does

34:06.360 --> 34:09.040
the mind affect cancer and vice versa.

34:09.040 --> 34:15.600
Cancer are sort of population of cells that tries to escape from any outside influence.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.160
They become rogue.

34:17.160 --> 34:22.160
They become terrorists who say, you know, we are out of your reach.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.720
Don't talk to us.

34:23.720 --> 34:28.680
They escape the immune system by losing genes or proteins.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.960
The immune system may be able to recognize.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.960
They throw them away.

34:31.960 --> 34:40.520
So there's a very strong selection for losing any kind of control and becoming rogue cells.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.400
So they escape these control mechanisms.

34:44.400 --> 34:49.800
Physiological, immunological, maybe psychological.

34:49.800 --> 34:54.520
And with therapies, I think now our discussion is sort of going to the genes inside the cancer

34:54.520 --> 34:57.400
and how we may be able to target them.

34:57.400 --> 35:03.080
And I think that reflects the fact that these cancers use these mechanisms to become independent.

35:03.080 --> 35:11.720
And we have some tools to target and to try to restore some dependence on outside factors.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.720
Right.

35:12.720 --> 35:19.160
But last night you were saying something that you implied that you were more pessimistic

35:19.160 --> 35:22.800
about an outside treatment.

35:22.800 --> 35:31.360
No, you asked me a very pointed question whether we can eradicate cancer, which is sort of

35:31.360 --> 35:35.680
as a question like, can we overcome death?

35:35.680 --> 35:36.920
Right?

35:36.920 --> 35:42.400
I mean, in a way, that's one way you can understand a question.

35:42.400 --> 35:46.480
You can ask, can a given patient survive cancer?

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
And we have great drugs.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.920
Can we eradicate cancer?

35:48.920 --> 35:49.920
Can we?

35:49.920 --> 35:50.920
No.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.640
But why do you compare cancer to that?

35:53.640 --> 35:57.240
Why don't we be eradicated, for example, smallpox?

35:57.240 --> 36:04.800
So you immediately equate, we can't eradicate cancer because we can't eradicate death.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.960
Why do you make that connection?

36:08.960 --> 36:11.000
Cancer is part of our biology.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
It's built in.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.400
That's what I was asking you to elaborate.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.920
It's built into our biology.

36:18.920 --> 36:25.360
There is, we, just by breathing oxygen, you are going to accumulate mutations.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.680
Oxygen is very toxic, in fact.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.560
But you can't live without it.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
Right?

36:29.560 --> 36:31.160
Yeah, we need it.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.160
I think that we-

36:32.160 --> 36:35.880
So you accumulate these mutations and they have an advantage.

36:35.880 --> 36:42.520
Without accumulating mutations, we would still be single organisms somewhere in a little

36:42.520 --> 36:45.880
puddle of the coast of who knows where.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Right?

36:46.880 --> 36:48.560
We would not come off the trees.

36:48.560 --> 36:54.160
So evolution requires some versatility, some flexibility.

36:54.160 --> 36:58.640
There has to be a way that you can mutagenize genes, that you can change things in a germ

36:58.640 --> 37:03.480
line and by extension or zen somatic tissues and so on.

37:03.480 --> 37:09.440
So that versatility I think comes at a price.

37:09.440 --> 37:16.400
So whatever is the evolution of a species is also the evolution of cells.

37:16.400 --> 37:23.280
And cancer is evolution of cells, gone rogue, evolution of cells that decided we don't need

37:23.280 --> 37:24.280
the rest of you.

37:24.280 --> 37:34.360
I think following that point is that to have mutation accumulate, again, you need to

37:34.360 --> 37:36.160
mutate the cells to divide.

37:36.160 --> 37:40.000
Otherwise, you will not increase the population.

37:40.000 --> 37:48.640
And for cells in immune system, they are different from other cells in a way that they

37:48.640 --> 37:53.720
have this continuous ability to rearrange their DNA.

37:53.720 --> 37:58.360
And as a result, the frequency of making a mistake is a lot higher.

37:58.360 --> 38:03.760
So this obviously is the division and the selection.

38:03.760 --> 38:11.800
There is a parallel between selection for the fittest and the cancer, that's for sure.

38:11.800 --> 38:18.600
But I just want to point out that in terms of eradicating cancer, correct, we are not

38:18.600 --> 38:25.160
anywhere near eradicating all the cancers, but some cancers are cured compared with what

38:25.160 --> 38:27.440
it was 20 years ago.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.720
That is correct.

38:28.720 --> 38:32.640
So I think we have to look at different cancer in different ways.

38:32.640 --> 38:36.840
For example, pancreatic cancer is extremely challenging.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.320
But childhood leukemia, you can treat it.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.600
And the cure rate is very high.

38:42.600 --> 38:46.240
So I think we have to look at specific, we cannot draw a...

38:46.240 --> 38:48.960
I think your question of can we eradicate cancer?

38:48.960 --> 38:52.480
It would be translated into can we eradicate infection diseases?

38:52.480 --> 38:57.360
Not can we eradicate smallpox, because smallpox is just one type of infection disease.

38:57.360 --> 39:01.600
If you look at the stickular cancer, chorionic cancer, basically, you want to put it close

39:01.600 --> 39:03.400
to one under presentation on cure.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.420
So you have eradicated those, but it's still, it's just like saying, yes, smallpox, we have

39:07.420 --> 39:08.420
eradicated.

39:08.420 --> 39:15.560
Well, but the idea I think that I found very interesting in the way Gido was talking about

39:15.560 --> 39:23.280
it was that, as he said it again today, that unlike an infectious disease where there is

39:23.280 --> 39:28.960
an outside agent that causes the infection, that the problem with cancer is that it's

39:28.960 --> 39:32.480
essentially inherent in your biology.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.040
Even in designing therapies.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.880
I mean, Selena just talked about different therapies.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.840
Because we all start from a fertilized egg.

39:40.840 --> 39:41.840
This egg divides.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.840
No, I understand that.

39:42.840 --> 39:50.720
And in the process, every division gives a possibility to mutate.

39:50.720 --> 39:56.840
And the best cells survive, usually those not fit would be eliminated.

39:56.840 --> 40:01.880
But there would be times all of a sudden you have a mutation that has a survival advantage

40:01.880 --> 40:03.480
and those are the ones.

40:03.480 --> 40:10.880
And all some of the cancer, for example, one cancer called multiple myeloma, it's found

40:10.880 --> 40:12.200
in the bone.

40:12.200 --> 40:17.000
And often the average age of occurrence is very late.

40:17.000 --> 40:23.240
But now we understand that there is a period of time and it's called emgas.

40:23.240 --> 40:28.920
It means monoclonal agomopathy of undetermined significance.

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
Why?

40:29.920 --> 40:37.240
Because you could actually detect a tiny, tiny bit of something and that could take 20, 30

40:37.240 --> 40:39.600
years to develop.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.120
And that's an example.

40:41.120 --> 40:47.480
You have something already going wrong, very early on, but there's no general symptom.

40:47.480 --> 40:54.760
And I can imagine during the process, 20, 30 years, the nutrition, the stress, the mind,

40:54.760 --> 40:57.880
that everything would definitely influence its progression.

40:57.880 --> 41:02.000
So I'm going to take a walk from there and go back to something that you were asking

41:02.000 --> 41:06.480
about Ed when you were talking about cancer initiation.

41:06.480 --> 41:12.760
And what do we know about how stress affects cancer initiation?

41:12.760 --> 41:17.440
Because it takes place during that 20, 30 years or whatever.

41:17.440 --> 41:22.840
That's one of the reasons why it's so hard to study because you can get 10,000, 20,000

41:22.840 --> 41:28.120
people and a small group of them have gotten cancer.

41:28.120 --> 41:32.560
But one of the areas that people are starting to study, which you might be interested in

41:32.560 --> 41:37.480
as a psychoanalyst, is what we call early life adversity.

41:37.480 --> 41:46.760
Which is going back to how is a person initially set up when their physiological systems are

41:46.760 --> 41:51.120
very mutable in a way.

41:51.120 --> 41:59.040
And there's been a lot of work looking at when people have inadequate mothering, when

41:59.040 --> 42:02.640
they're neglected, when they're abused.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.200
The endocrine systems don't develop normally.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.720
The immune system doesn't develop normally.

42:08.720 --> 42:19.320
And so you get a sort of a vulnerability towards later insults.

42:19.320 --> 42:24.280
One of the things that people have started studying in the context of cancer is what

42:24.280 --> 42:28.880
happens when you have an early vulnerability like that.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.440
And then you get stress later in life.

42:31.440 --> 42:38.920
And there's a group at Ohio State that has looked at people with skin cancers and they've

42:38.920 --> 42:45.720
looked at the skin lesions of people with early life stress, with early, with no early

42:45.720 --> 42:49.800
life stress but later life stress and with both.

42:49.800 --> 42:56.960
And the lesions of the people who have had both, and so it's sort of like two psychological

42:56.960 --> 43:08.440
hits are where the most aggressive and showed in terms of the functioning of the immune

43:08.440 --> 43:12.880
cells show the most vulnerability in the immune cells.

43:12.880 --> 43:18.160
So that's sort of thinking about early life plus later life.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.240
What's happened along that transition?

43:21.240 --> 43:27.280
I think this goes back also to this notion that I mentioned before of an endogenous versus

43:27.280 --> 43:29.200
exogenous nature of cancer.

43:29.200 --> 43:33.440
Is the nature of cancer inside the cell or is it outside the cell?

43:33.440 --> 43:34.440
We know that it's both.

43:34.440 --> 43:38.920
In fact, I think the first discovery of oncogene has been viral oncogenes.

43:38.920 --> 43:44.280
That's where the Nobel Prize was awarded to the virus.

43:44.280 --> 43:49.440
The notion that you can actually transfer a gene from the outside environment into the

43:49.440 --> 43:53.720
cell turns out that viral oncogen is in fact something that's been integrated in your own

43:53.720 --> 43:55.840
cells, in your genome.

43:55.840 --> 44:01.680
But if you ask about something like smallpox or take HIV or something, none of the HIV

44:01.680 --> 44:04.960
proteins exist anywhere else in your cells.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.280
You can safely hit them.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.280
You can target them.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.280
You can block them.

44:08.280 --> 44:12.880
You can take a cocktail of inhibitors against every HIV enzyme you can find.

44:12.880 --> 44:17.520
It's not going to affect your own cells, at least if the drugs are as good as they should

44:17.520 --> 44:18.520
be.

44:18.520 --> 44:19.520
So the answer is different.

44:19.520 --> 44:23.320
I mean, all of us spend most of our time figuring out what's the difference between

44:23.320 --> 44:25.600
the cancer and the normal tissue.

44:25.600 --> 44:30.080
Is there anything that we can hit in a cancer that's not going to destroy your normal tissue?

44:30.080 --> 44:31.080
And that's just really hard.

44:31.080 --> 44:37.160
I mean, you end up with a few mutations and a few differences and a few concepts but compared

44:37.160 --> 44:38.160
to a smallpox.

44:38.160 --> 44:41.160
That's where the question is.

44:41.160 --> 44:47.480
So the environmental factor stresses one, but let's say cigarettes more.

44:47.480 --> 44:54.360
There are those things that are considered to, if not cause, certainly contribute to

44:54.360 --> 44:56.960
development of cancer.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.520
So smoking causes.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.520
Causes.

45:00.520 --> 45:01.520
Right.

45:01.520 --> 45:05.080
But smoking breaks the DNA inside your own cell.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.800
So it actually induces mutation.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.040
But the other signal, for instance, if you look at estrogen, estrogen does not induce

45:11.040 --> 45:12.240
mutations.

45:12.240 --> 45:15.680
But it's like putting fuel on the cell and inducing...

45:15.680 --> 45:19.280
For the two most saturated roles, faster and faster.

45:19.280 --> 45:23.240
So women who are exposed to estrogen for longer period of life are much more risk of breast

45:23.240 --> 45:25.160
cancer than women are not.

45:25.160 --> 45:27.200
And it's not because of mutations.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.200
It's because of...

45:28.200 --> 45:34.720
Again, going back to the fact that it's the controlling of how many divisions.

45:34.720 --> 45:42.400
And that is central integrating whether it's a signal coming from estrogen from your...

45:42.400 --> 45:48.440
And we all work on cancer, we all recognize the importance of location, location, location,

45:48.440 --> 45:49.800
the environment.

45:49.800 --> 45:52.380
Because environment gives you such...

45:52.380 --> 45:53.880
Give cancer cells such support.

45:53.880 --> 45:59.080
If you cut out the environment, there will be one way to remove the cells.

45:59.080 --> 46:05.920
And no matter which signal it comes, at the end of the day, it really centralize in three

46:05.920 --> 46:07.240
issues.

46:07.240 --> 46:13.200
One is how many cell times this tumor cell able to divide.

46:13.200 --> 46:20.640
And second is after division, would they normally die as they are supposed to, or they lose

46:20.640 --> 46:23.160
that control and keep on dividing?

46:23.160 --> 46:27.440
A third thing is they move migration.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.800
And that's the cause of metastasis.

46:29.800 --> 46:32.320
So it goes from one place to the other to the other.

46:32.320 --> 46:36.240
And these are really the three major components.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.720
We all recognize that, but it's very difficult.

46:38.720 --> 46:45.480
And if you say controlling that, how your well-being is definitely a very important control for

46:45.480 --> 46:46.480
that.

46:46.480 --> 46:47.480
No doubt.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.560
Whatever reason that leads to the well-being is a good thing.

46:50.560 --> 46:54.920
It's actually the environment, I think, is probably the number one reason why we can't

46:54.920 --> 46:57.480
cure cancer as much as we would like to.

46:57.480 --> 47:02.040
Because right now, the way pharmaceutical companies have gone, and fact scientists have gone at

47:02.040 --> 47:06.040
trying to cure cancer for a long time, is to screen compounds against cells that are

47:06.040 --> 47:08.960
taken out of the body and put in a petri dish.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.480
And they find a lot of compounds that kill those cells.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.960
Unfortunately, when those cells are in the body, they don't get killed.

47:14.960 --> 47:19.240
Or you have to achieve toxicity that kills normal cells at the same rate.

47:19.240 --> 47:23.680
So this is because, in fact, as you mean a pistol in some very seminal experiments,

47:23.680 --> 47:28.320
you know, a couple, about 20 years ago, where she showed that if you take a cell with the

47:28.320 --> 47:31.960
exact same mutation, and you put it in one part of the body, or in another part of the

47:31.960 --> 47:34.040
body, you generate cancer or not.

47:34.040 --> 47:39.440
And so it is completely dependent on the signals that the cell gets in addition to the endogenous

47:39.440 --> 47:41.880
sort of disruption of the DNA.

47:41.880 --> 47:53.400
And that's why most thinking is that cancer cells are tough, they overtake you, but in

47:53.400 --> 47:55.360
many ways they are also vulnerable.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.600
It depends on the environment.

47:57.600 --> 48:02.960
And when you talk about environment, there are multiple factors, you know.

48:02.960 --> 48:14.520
I think, wouldn't you say that someone who has a very kind of cheer for a personality,

48:14.520 --> 48:20.280
many times tend to be able to control a lot of things in life and healthier, too?

48:20.280 --> 48:26.920
I think this psychology is two ways, it's not one way, isn't it?

48:26.920 --> 48:29.240
Well, I'm related to that.

48:29.240 --> 48:35.760
Andrea asked me a very interesting question last night, which was, if will to, how you

48:35.760 --> 48:43.320
can measure will to live, and if will to live, because anecdotally physicians report that

48:43.320 --> 48:49.640
if patients with strong will to live may live longer.

48:49.640 --> 48:59.160
And I've been thinking about that because we have not found a gene signature, for example,

48:59.160 --> 49:01.760
of will to live, it would be very nice.

49:01.760 --> 49:12.320
There's actually somebody who has done gene signatures of happiness that has a sense

49:12.320 --> 49:18.400
of meaning to it versus a happiness of, I'm going to go out and drink tonight, and those

49:18.400 --> 49:24.600
look differently, and they look differently in terms of, for example, inflammatory profiles.

49:24.600 --> 49:30.520
And you know, inflammation being one of the things that adds fuel to the fire of cancer.

49:30.520 --> 49:38.160
Will to live would be very, very nice if we could characterize, and maybe that's something

49:38.160 --> 49:42.960
that you can do with your systemic looking at things.

49:42.960 --> 49:48.600
Maybe just to throw out completely as you talk about the route to live in the psychology,

49:48.600 --> 49:54.520
just an idea that, again, I know nothing about, but just a completely different track of thought

49:54.520 --> 49:56.160
here.

49:56.160 --> 49:58.120
Cancer cells affect you in a lot of ways.

49:58.120 --> 50:04.240
So, cancer patients lose weight because these cancers make hormones, and cancers change

50:04.240 --> 50:07.000
your physiology, right?

50:07.000 --> 50:13.920
I don't know if anyone is looking at how does a cancer cells, how do they affect your mood,

50:13.920 --> 50:14.920
your psychology?

50:14.920 --> 50:21.440
Do they have a direct, measurable biochemical influence on your mental state, on your will

50:21.440 --> 50:22.440
to live with me?

50:22.440 --> 50:32.280
There's actually a whole emerging area of research in that area because, and there's

50:32.280 --> 50:37.120
a number of people around the country who are working on that.

50:37.120 --> 50:42.240
If you think of cancer cells in addition to, you know, they want to grow, et cetera, they're

50:42.240 --> 50:45.720
also like inflammatory factories.

50:45.720 --> 50:51.960
And they're producing aisle six, they're producing aisle eight, an audience.

50:51.960 --> 50:52.960
A whole...

50:52.960 --> 50:56.600
Or does neuroendocrine cancer system make or do you have that hormone, right?

50:56.600 --> 50:57.600
I'm sure.

50:57.600 --> 51:04.320
What happens when those inflammatory cytokines go through the bloodstream, there is a well

51:04.320 --> 51:10.080
characterized syndrome that happens when inflammatory cytokines hit the brain.

51:10.080 --> 51:15.880
And if you think of how you feel when you have the flu, which is basically inflammation,

51:15.880 --> 51:23.080
you know, people don't want to eat, they lay down, they don't want to talk to people, this...

51:23.080 --> 51:30.600
It's hard to concentrate, this sort of lassitude, and it essentially mimics the vegetative symptoms

51:30.600 --> 51:38.360
of depression, this sort of fatigue and difficulty concentrating.

51:38.360 --> 51:49.120
And so there's an area of research looking at to what extent is the depression that is...

51:49.120 --> 51:55.680
That may be experienced by cancer patients, not only secondary to a person looking at

51:55.680 --> 52:01.760
themselves and saying, I have cancer, this is awful, but secondary to this physiologic,

52:01.760 --> 52:02.760
what's called sickness.

52:02.760 --> 52:08.200
For many cancers, I think that's a main complaint of treatment and of cancer is this feeling

52:08.200 --> 52:10.000
of depression and tiredness.

52:10.000 --> 52:16.480
Well, let's forget that, caccadesia, for instance, which is basically your loss of body mass and

52:16.480 --> 52:19.840
is one of the fundamental reasons why cancer patients die.

52:19.840 --> 52:24.080
So if you're depressed and you don't want to eat, that's the worst possible thing you

52:24.080 --> 52:25.640
can do to your body.

52:25.640 --> 52:31.920
So in some way, the immune system is one aspect of the connection with stress and depression.

52:31.920 --> 52:35.240
But the other one is more of the metabolic, you know, and just...

52:35.240 --> 52:36.240
Yeah.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.520
Your orgasm fed to the point that we can survive the disease.

52:39.520 --> 52:43.680
So is there any work on why some people don't get cancer?

52:43.680 --> 52:50.400
It's in our system and the cells are mutating all the time and it's an ongoing process.

52:50.400 --> 52:53.680
So why is it that some people get it and some people...

52:53.680 --> 52:55.560
Yeah, this is actually some really interesting study.

52:55.560 --> 53:01.600
Right now, if we send the several labs that are studying why some very heavy smokers don't

53:01.600 --> 53:10.920
get cancer and there are very likely some highly protective genes that help you by cancer.

53:10.920 --> 53:14.280
I can engineer a mouse in the lab that's not going to get cancer.

53:14.280 --> 53:15.280
You can work?

53:15.280 --> 53:19.120
I can engineer a mouse in the lab that will not get cancer.

53:19.120 --> 53:21.920
Put an extra copy of P10 or P53.

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
They will be perfectly...

53:22.920 --> 53:31.160
It's a major cancer of a tumor suppressor gene that's called P53.

53:31.160 --> 53:36.200
It's one of the major roadblocks that gets mutated in almost every cancer.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.040
We have two copies of it.

53:38.040 --> 53:44.760
If you make an animal with three copies, they're perfectly happy, they won't get cancer.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.960
Evolution didn't give us the third copy.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.280
Didn't think it was necessary.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.760
You gave the third copy to human.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.800
How are you going to do it?

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
It's a lot of things.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.600
Where would you do it?

53:56.600 --> 53:59.600
Well, how soon do you do it?

53:59.600 --> 54:01.200
Where do you do it in the zygote?

54:01.200 --> 54:02.200
Yeah.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
You engineer...

54:03.200 --> 54:04.200
Right, I mean, this whole...

54:04.200 --> 54:05.200
What do you mean?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.200
It's a collision.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.200
You have a big box here, right?

54:08.200 --> 54:10.080
Your immune system will not work actually.

54:10.080 --> 54:12.240
In a lab animal, you can do it.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.240
You can get a terminal center, you can do it.

54:15.240 --> 54:19.320
You said you didn't make a lab available and it will not get cancer.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.120
Yeah, it's published.

54:21.120 --> 54:22.120
The...

54:22.120 --> 54:23.120
But I think...

54:23.120 --> 54:24.120
The downside.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.120
The cancer...

54:25.120 --> 54:26.120
Oh, okay.

54:26.120 --> 54:30.720
It will not develop those cancer you have tested.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.920
There might be others we don't know yet.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.960
And also, P-53 does many, many things.

54:36.960 --> 54:40.440
I certainly would not want a third copy for myself.

54:40.440 --> 54:41.440
I wouldn't.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.640
I'm not advertising it, but I'm saying...

54:43.640 --> 54:51.280
People have made and they have engineered these mice and they are protected from cancer.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.680
There are people that have a third copy of P-53.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.640
I don't think so.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.280
I mean, there is the opposite.

54:57.280 --> 55:01.520
There are families that have mutated one of those genes.

55:01.520 --> 55:07.800
It's called leaf romaine syndrome and they are at very high risk of cancer.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.640
But there's another...

55:09.640 --> 55:14.160
They're two famous genes called tumor-suppressor gene.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.400
The other is called RB.

55:16.400 --> 55:21.960
And I was discovered when children have retinal blastoma, they...

55:21.960 --> 55:24.960
Every single one of them lose this gene.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.600
And now we know.

55:26.600 --> 55:33.040
The difference, I think, is different from P-53 in the sense that we have studied this

55:33.040 --> 55:35.640
for many years and followed the patient.

55:35.640 --> 55:42.520
And what we found was both genes at the beginning of the cancer, you lose one copy or perhaps

55:42.520 --> 55:50.040
have mutation and during relapse, the P-53 is always mutated or lost and not functioning.

55:50.040 --> 55:55.560
But RB somehow often is preserved at least one of the copy.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.320
There are times both copy loss.

55:58.320 --> 56:05.760
So that means that perhaps even that gene that is tumor-suppressor gene, that actually

56:05.760 --> 56:09.760
a cancer cell still needed to develop the cancer.

56:09.760 --> 56:13.040
So things are not completely black and white.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.240
It really depends on the context.

56:15.240 --> 56:20.960
So as you do more studies of people's genetic makeup, are you...

56:20.960 --> 56:26.840
Are you going to be able to detect what is causing some people to develop cancer and

56:26.840 --> 56:27.840
some people to...

56:27.840 --> 56:29.280
No, we don't.

56:29.280 --> 56:38.320
We now know at least in our study, in one case, we know exactly in one type of lymphoma, treated

56:38.320 --> 56:47.960
with a very recent accelerate FDA approved drug, what is causing the relapse that we know,

56:47.960 --> 56:53.760
as we follow the patient before treatment, after treatment, and until it's relapse and

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
ask what happened.

56:54.760 --> 56:56.400
Then we put...

56:56.400 --> 56:59.520
Take that gene away from the normal...

56:59.520 --> 57:05.920
Not the normal tumor cell and this tumor no longer respond to the drug and everything.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.440
So that can be done.

57:07.440 --> 57:14.200
As far as what differentiates initiation, I don't think anybody has an answer.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.320
No, but also I think you're asking a very important question because I think this is

57:17.320 --> 57:22.880
right now, in my opinion, a little bit the failure of the current way of thinking about

57:22.880 --> 57:24.120
cancer.

57:24.120 --> 57:27.120
If you're going database right now, there are thousands of cancer patients that have

57:27.120 --> 57:28.120
been sequenced.

57:28.120 --> 57:36.320
So we actually know the mutation that you have across 20, 25 types of cancer, the more.

57:36.320 --> 57:43.160
We know also, because of work that Burt Vogelstein did, but a couple of decades back, that cancer

57:43.160 --> 57:48.120
is not a single hit with very few exceptions, and even those are probably also not a single

57:48.120 --> 57:52.400
hit, but you know, you need six, seven, eight different mutations that accumulate before

57:52.400 --> 57:54.160
you actually get cancer.

57:54.160 --> 57:59.680
If you go into those databases and you look for the genes that we know today, there's

57:59.680 --> 58:04.160
only maybe 20 or 30 percent of the patients that have more than one mutation among those

58:04.160 --> 58:05.160
under genes.

58:05.160 --> 58:10.280
The remaining ones either have just one hit or they have nothing, which means that where

58:10.280 --> 58:12.840
are the six or seven other hits?

58:12.840 --> 58:16.960
They are mutations that are probably what we call private mutations, that is mutation

58:16.960 --> 58:17.960
in genes.

58:17.960 --> 58:23.480
There are somewhere upstream of the genes that induce cancer, but you can't find them because

58:23.480 --> 58:26.560
you don't find two patients that have the same exact pattern of mutation.

58:26.560 --> 58:32.800
So if you do a very simple math, you will find that there are more cancer genotypes,

58:32.800 --> 58:38.040
that is more possible ways in which you could get cancer, than there are cells on the planet.

58:38.040 --> 58:43.160
And so what we're seeing right now in patients is just a very, very small sample of all the

58:43.160 --> 58:47.080
possible ways in which you could get cancer, which means that you can't just use statistics

58:47.080 --> 58:51.640
to figure out how it works, because you're not going to be able to find enough patients

58:51.640 --> 58:56.480
that have that particular group of three mutations or four mutations that give you cancer with

58:56.480 --> 58:58.520
that particular response to a drug, for instance.

58:58.520 --> 59:01.920
And so the only way to do it, you know, we are at least, that's what we are advocating,

59:01.920 --> 59:03.720
is you have to understand how cancer works.

59:03.720 --> 59:13.840
That is how cancer literally works as a microprocessor that has had some pieces disconnected or rewired,

59:13.840 --> 59:16.760
and I have to figure out why it's working in the wrong way.

59:16.760 --> 59:20.080
I think that going after individual mutation is going to be a long way coming before you

59:20.080 --> 59:22.520
can get the full repertoire.

59:22.520 --> 59:23.520
Yeah.

59:23.520 --> 59:24.520
Very, very dynamic.

59:24.520 --> 59:30.080
Of course, there are cancers that are easier than others, and actually, the ematological

59:30.080 --> 59:34.400
malignancies are particularly good class of cancer to study because they tend to have

59:34.400 --> 59:40.960
fewer mutations than the other, but if you take a melanoma compared to a childhood leukemia,

59:40.960 --> 59:46.680
it's like having your DNA put through a blender in melanoma versus having your DNA with a couple

59:46.680 --> 59:47.880
hits here and there.

59:47.880 --> 59:53.560
And that is where we can understand sort of leukemia and we treat them much better than

59:53.560 --> 59:54.560
we can treat right now melanoma.

59:54.560 --> 01:00:03.040
Well, that part of the reason is that for the cancer in the blood, you are in a position

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:10.560
to define which state and its normal counterpart because you can take the cells.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:17.320
For other type of cancer, like ovarian, a breast, it's called solid tumor.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.400
You take the tumor, it's not every cell in that mass is a cancer cell.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.880
You have normal cells, you have everything, they talk to each other and it's very difficult

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.440
and can go that.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:35.440
But if you take leukemia, you could just take study pure leukemia cells.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:43.360
And then you also have, by the signature, you also know what the normal cell, that's

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.520
the normal counterpart and what the normal cell does.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.080
So that helps you understand something.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.880
But some of the things we learned in the blood cancer is applicable to solid but not everything.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.080
Yeah, not everything.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:03.200
Again, it gets to the point of location and environment because you're not the same.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:10.960
So you sequence genes of 50,000 people who have reached the age of 80 with no cancer and

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.120
compared it to people who have had cancer.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.840
You wouldn't be able to.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:25.360
It would be difficult because as I said that we take our, the normal cells we often get

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.160
from patients from the cheeks.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160
Wow, okay.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.080
And so you take mine, take Andreas, take Edo, take Susan, take yours.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.920
I bet our mutations are not the same, normal.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.800
So it's a very difficult one.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.160
And I do sometimes think about what you are saying, I mean they were, they are people

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.920
who lived to over 100 and they have no cancer.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.840
What if we look at them, their genes, what would happen?

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:58.200
It's very difficult because for instance, you know, people have actually done these studies

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:06.960
for what we call complex diseases like diabetes, obesity, you know, other major ones.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.240
And you know, even autism.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.680
And what they find is that when you look at each individual gene in isolation, you find

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.720
thousands of genes, each one with a tiny, tiny, tiny contribution.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.800
And so it is impossible to put together the actual pattern because if you have something

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.960
that says, oh, if you have this gene, it's not an alteration, but it's a germline variant.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.840
If you have this variant, you will live longer, but your ability to live longer is the probability

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.760
you live longer is 1.2% more than somebody who doesn't have it.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760
What do you do with that?

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.720
You know, it's just really not an actionable number.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.400
But that's the tail end of the curve, right?

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.920
So at the other end, you talk about GWAS studies basically, right?

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:55.760
At the other end of the spectrum, you do have things like braka, braka mutations and breast

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760
cancer.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760
You have it.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760
It has a consequence.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.840
You need a surgeon.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.520
I mean, you really need to have a discussion, right?

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.040
So there is this curve of things that are really important and it goes all the way down.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.320
And the more you look, the more you'll find things, of course, that are, you know, really

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.760
do we need to do something about this?

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.440
No, we're talking about two different things.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.400
So for risk of cancer, absolutely agree with you, you know, braka, one, braka, two, et cetera.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.480
What he's talking about is protective alleles.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.200
Protective alleles, I don't know if there's any protective alleles that has been discovered

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.360
so far with eye penetrant.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:34.800
And as I said, like in more complex diseases, so breaking the vase, it's easy fixing it a

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.640
lot harder and it's much more polygenic.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.000
So you need the contribution of many, many different genes.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.440
That's where you get into this situation where you may have the 100 patients that defeat

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.920
cancers, they may do it in 100 different ways.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.160
Well, it's just a flip side of the same question, right?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.000
If you can define the risk alleles, then the absence of the risk is the protection.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.120
Yeah, but protective alleles are much harder to find than the risk alleles.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.840
So you can't design that study.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.760
You cannot have a population of 100,000 people who will not get cancer.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.800
It's hard to design that study.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:12.200
It's easy to design the study where you say, yeah, I have 5,000 patients with breast cancer

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.240
and 5,000 patients who don't have it and I can compare them.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.040
We're actually going at that kind of question, but from a different sort of angle, I'm part

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:26.920
of a consortium development project that's looking at long-term ovarian cancer survivors.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:35.120
So these are stage three and four ovarian cancer patients who may have a predicted lifespan

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.920
of like three and four years.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:47.320
And these are people who have lived past 10 years and we're looking at their molecular,

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.000
we're looking at the tumors molecularly and we're also looking at their psychological

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.160
factors.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:05:00.680
And we're interviewing them about what do you think has led to your long-term survival

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:05.080
and we're also looking at what's mutated, what's not mutated, et cetera.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:12.240
So I don't have results for you yet, but that's a potential approach to look at who survives

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.200
that you wouldn't expect to.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:20.920
So you don't have to result from the gene part, but for the interview part, what have

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.320
you found?

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.920
We haven't looked at them yet.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.800
We're just collecting data on it.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.800
You're looking at their immune system?

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.040
No, we're looking at their tumors.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.200
We're not, at this point, we're not looking at their immune system.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:42.240
But also, I think that this kind of study has not been done, maybe in cancer with the

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.680
right control, but they've been done for instance in cardio myopathies and now the type of,

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.520
you know, in diabetes, they've looked at huge populations, 30,000 individuals, you know,

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.480
and that they're profiled using snip chips.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.760
And I think traditionally it's been much harder to find anything protective than to

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.120
find something that appears.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.280
The tears are alleles.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:07.240
They're few, but they're a little bit easier to find.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.520
Protective alleles, I think, is a much more complicated story.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.200
I think it's the same thing with stress.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.240
You can point at stress and you can say that that's bad, you know, psychologically.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.320
And what's the biology of stress?

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.000
But it's harder to define the biology of what's good.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
What's good.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.080
I wanted to point to another aspect of cancer in mind, which we haven't touched upon, which

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:38.640
I think it's very important, which is that to defeat cancer or you say, what was the

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.800
word that you used before?

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
Just to eradicate cancer.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:53.440
You need great scientific minds and I think that this is a major threat right now because

01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:01.320
right at a time where biologists has come, has been empowered by extraordinary tools,

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:07.320
both in terms of availability of small molecules, but also in terms of the ability to now literally

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.600
look at every single molecule aspect of a cell or image of a cell, we are seeing a dramatic

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.840
decrease in inflation on the ability to do science.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:24.600
And I think this has been a dramatic setback that I think should be brought out more often

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:31.320
and more forcefully to the public attention because we are close to make some real amazing

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.320
breakthroughs.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:40.080
Just to give you an example of what's happening, until three years ago or two years ago actually,

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:45.640
the number of approved, FDA approved cancer drugs had declined steadily over the years

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.760
and then the last two years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of therapeutic agents

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.760
that have been approved.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.600
That's an indication, in my opinion, that something is starting to work and it's starting to work

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.200
in a very major way.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.240
And I think this is to a large extent due to the fact that we now are empowered by the

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.560
tools of technology that we didn't have before.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:14.840
It is to me dramatic and overbearing that right at the time where you have these technologies

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:21.680
that can, and we have now figure out cancer a little bit as a mechanistic story that we

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.720
don't know, essentially we see a decrease in the number of students, postdocs and faculties

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.720
that we can actually put to work.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.720
And so the decrease in resources.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.720
Resourceism.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:38.360
And actually this is kind of sad because it's at the time we're embarrassed by too many

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:39.360
riches.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:46.360
We have the tool, we have the reagent, and we need the mind to integrate all this information

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.640
and that's we need resources.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.640
And it's very difficult.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:50.640
It's very difficult.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.640
It's very difficult.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:58.720
It's very kind of discouraging to the next generation because they see the future is

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.560
so kind of not promising.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.560
Well, there's a reason to...

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.320
Look, I told you yesterday when I teach my introductory class in Colombia, what I tell

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.880
my students is you should be, you should continue in this direction only if this is

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880
the only thing you can do.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.880
If there's any other thing you can do, go do it.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880
Don't do it.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880
I say the same thing.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880
I say the same thing.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:25.360
Because I think to do what you do is not a job, it's a passion.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:29.400
Unless you have it, you're not going to be able to contribute.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.600
So you have less people who are more passionate.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.400
I'll give you an example.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:41.840
The average lifespan of a postdoc today, before they could get six to seven, eight years.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.480
That's insane because those are the most productive year of a scientist right after their PhD.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.760
So it used to be that people were getting hired even out of the PhD.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:53.720
Yeah, we were at the time when we were postdoc.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:56.880
Three years later, you become assistant professor.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.320
Now two postdoc is standard.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.120
And that's six years.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
And it's struggling.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
And it's a very difficult position.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120
And it's really...

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.120
But that's the kind of funding in the sciences that we're using.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.120
Yes, it's the lack of regeneration of science.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120
We definitely are.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120
We definitely are.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:20.280
And that's very unfortunate because it is not an entertainment of your intellectual

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280
need.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.360
It's actually a time that things can really get integrated to really make a difference.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.640
So is it nice to have federal funding?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640
Is that an issue?

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640
Right.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:37.960
Well, it's a domino effect because the federal funding is the biggest funding agency.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:43.440
So the federal funding drops, then they are smaller foundations.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.640
Then it's a ripple effect.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.320
Then everybody goes to those foundations.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:53.520
And all of a sudden those foundations and also those foundations depend on donations.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.600
The donation is not as robust as it was before because I'm on a board.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.600
A couple of them.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.600
I know that.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.880
It's a very difficult time.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.880
Very difficult time.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.920
No, I agree.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.600
Money is always better than less money.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.760
There's another side to it.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:17.560
I think there's an interesting article in Lancet or something maybe last year or so about

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.080
waste in research.

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:26.040
I read it and I thought there's a truth to this.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.040
And part of it is the nature of it.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.640
You don't know where you're going.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:36.080
So of course you get lost and you take the wrong direction and it's easier when you have

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.000
a direct threat.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.200
It's probably less wasteful.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.560
So that's the nature of what we do.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560
Right?

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.160
I mean, it's not predictable.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160
So you don't think...

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.160
Yeah, I think it's...

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.600
There is also a lot of waste in the system which you look at.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.160
And you go to some of these meetings and you look at what's happening there.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.960
Yeah, I think it's a vicious cycle because I remember...

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:05.200
I remember when I was a graduate student in the postdoc, you have certain liberty to

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:11.000
exercise your creativity and you don't have to justify what you do tomorrow.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.120
But now the pressure is so high that everyone is under the pressure.

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.120
You need to produce.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120
You need to produce.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120
That's part of the reason that things become...

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:27.320
It makes people be very conservative in repeating things that we all know over and over.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320
And that's actually...

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.400
Taking tiny little steps.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.400
I think that's...

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:36.400
And often you just look at it and you think, really did we need to do that experiment again?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.880
It really is not...

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880
Or paradigm shifts.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880
Yeah, it's a...

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880
Well, it's risky.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.880
You will not get money from the NIH for something risky.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
Or in a...

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880
Paradigm shifting.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880
No, I mean...

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880
Yeah.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880
Yeah.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.800
Well, as we said yesterday, there are two types of experiments that you do for a

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:03.800
graph, the ones that you've already done and the ones that you will never do.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.800
Right?

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.800
All right.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800
We'll stop here and open up for a question.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.800
Can I ask a question?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.800
Please go to the microphone.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800
Okay.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Okay.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800
Okay.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800
Okay.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.800
Okay.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.800
Okay.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.800
Okay.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.800
Okay.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.800
Okay.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:20.800
Okay.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800
Okay.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Okay.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:23.800
Okay.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.800
Okay.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:37.820
I have two questions.

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:42.300
One of them is sort of science fiction and the other is a little more addressed to the

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.920
idea of cancer and the mind.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.960
The science fiction one arises from what you said about the P-53.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.680
Gene, why can't we have them?

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.680
Why?

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.160
Why can't the baby is born or when the woman is...

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.320
I mean, can you get...

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.840
That's a science fiction one.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.040
Can I buy one somewhere?

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.040
Seriously.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.240
I mean, is there any...

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
Okay.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:13.320
I think being a scientist, you get more and more humbled and modest every day because

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.720
we know so little about how nature designed us.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.840
So P-53 is a gene.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.960
If you lose it.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.840
If you consider a cell has to go around a clock to divide.

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:35.600
P-53 kind of the gatekeeper at two points and it cut a sense if the cell should go on

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600
or not go on.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.600
Okay.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600
This is a tumor surprise.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.560
But it does many other things as well.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.240
You can imagine if you have more than two copies, three copies, what if your cell just won't

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.240
be able to move?

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.240
You're in trouble.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.240
You probably would never...

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.240
There's one function actually.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.720
This is important which is the way you develop immunity, right?

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.200
Is because your cells, when they see the antigen in the virus...

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.200
They divide.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.280
No, they actually mutate their own DNA.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.280
Okay.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:09.640
And to do that, you have to suppress T-53 because otherwise the P-53 would kill the cell.

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.160
The moment it is the mutation.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.440
So basically, if you now have three copies of P-53, as soon as it's trying to develop

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.960
the signature for the virus, the cell dies.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:18.960
So you would have probably...

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.840
I'll make an inducible one.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:25.840
I'll put an inducible...

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
It's just what inducible.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.840
Okay.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.840
That's another...

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.600
You can make genes in such a way that they're not active and then you give a drug like tetracycline

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.520
and it switches the gene on.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.120
You can do this in animals and you would put a gene that kills cancer cells in there that

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.120
has cell activity.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.120
That sounds good.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.560
You activate it and you leave it on for 24 hours or 48 hours or two weeks.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560
Whatever you want.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.560
Yeah.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560
Gee, I don't know.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560
It's not that...

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560
It's not that...

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.440
That's science fiction but certainly it doesn't really apply to...

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.200
Well, so it doesn't apply to human medicine in the broad sense.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.080
It does, maybe with some exceptions.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.320
So some exceptions, for example, are stem cell therapies.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.080
Like we can make stem cells from scratch and we can make tissues from these stem cells.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.560
And for example, if you're a diabetic, we can make from those stem cells insulin producing

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560
cells.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.880
There's a risk that these cells at some point give rise to a cancer.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:27.160
Now while we make these cells, we can put genes like that in there.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.480
We can engineer these cells to have such a fail-safe mechanism that we can then switch

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.480
on.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480
Right?

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480
So that's something that you can...

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480
In that setting...

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.240
I do have diabetes, so I'll talk to you afterward.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.480
The second question is a little more serious and less science fiction, which is I've come

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.120
to a lot of these and the NYPSI.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.800
I've never before and I could be wrong.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:59.000
I don't know about a meeting like this about the sort of mind and the disease.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.960
Diabetes is a good example.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:07.640
I don't know if you all have ever had a meeting about diabetes and the mind or malaria and

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.120
the mind or anything.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.400
So why does cancer get one of these meetings?

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:23.080
What is it about the illness that generates this sort of psychological interest, whereas

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.080
others don't?

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.520
Or as far as I know, at least not on East 82nd Street.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.520
Thank you.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.520
That Susan has to answer this.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:37.960
I should say that there are plenty of people doing research on stress and diabetes, stress

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.120
and cardiovascular disease, stress and you name the disease.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:47.320
So maybe this is just the first and a long line of programs.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:52.520
This was serendipitous because it came out of a dinner table conversation that I had

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.040
with Ed about the immune system increased role in fighting cancer.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.360
So we decided to kind of bring this up.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.560
Maybe one of a series.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:04.280
That there is, right.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.880
Well, it's more life-threatening than the more life-threatening.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.880
No, I don't think so.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.880
I don't think that's true.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.840
But patients react differently if you tell them you have cancer.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.320
You have two years to live.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.920
Or you tell them you have emphysema.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.000
You have two years to live.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.200
There is a different psychological connotation to cancer than to equally deadly diseases

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200
that are not cancer.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:31.480
Well, when I was in medical student, your comment reminds me one of our professors said, whatever

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.520
you do, don't say to a patient, yes, cancer.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:39.320
Because that's bad.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.320
I think it's true.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320
I think it's true.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
That's the reaction most people have.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:47.320
The disease comes with a different type of...

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.120
First of all, an observation and then a question.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:56.200
The observation is, as you may have noticed, science this week has the cover story of humanized

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.760
mice.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:03.400
So they can't psychoanalyse the mice yet, but almost everything else is going to be possible

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.320
to do with these mice.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:14.000
When I started medical school 64 years ago, they were curing cancer every day.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Just as we do today.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.680
Of course, the surgeons can cure cancer now.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.680
They cured cancer then.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:26.320
If it was found at a certain stage and could be surgically removed, you were good.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.640
And the thing that always surprised me was that, for instance, you could have a lung cancer

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.240
removed.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:39.520
And my impression was, well, if this was a four-pack, a year, a day smoker, the cancer

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.880
will recur and the rest of the remaining lung.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.760
Interestingly enough, many of these survivors do not develop a second cancer in the same

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.040
bed that they develop their first one.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:20:01.560
Now the question is, and Atul Gawande was here this week talking to us about being mortal.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:07.960
And I know you're not clinicians, but I'm sure you come across friends and people who

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:16.400
ask you, in this complex era, when metastatic disease is not the death sentence that it

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:24.320
was 64 years ago, in this complex environment, when the times this week had an article about

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:31.160
the patients who are the rare responders, a clinical trial that has a 15% response

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.680
rate, we used to say, well, that's placebo, whatever.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:42.240
Now we look at the people who are in that 15%, and we see that they are different than the

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.120
people in the 85% who don't respond.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.640
From the clinical point of view, from the, you said, we're not there yet.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.600
And that's certainly true.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.680
Incidentally, about the RO1 grants, the average RO1 recipient now is aged 50.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.040
20 years ago, they were aged 38.

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:05.920
That's the most depressing thing I'm going to say.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:06.920
Yes.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.920
You do seven-year postdocs.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.200
That's the result.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:17.400
What do you say to a patient now who comes in and says, and incidentally Gawande was, at

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:23.640
Harvard now, they are beginning to teach medical students and residents how to sit down with

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:30.000
the patient and really discuss with the patient where he is and what he wants to do about

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.240
it, or she.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.640
What do you say to people in this turbulent era when different cancers are being addressed

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:46.320
in different ways in terms of getting their care because they need it this year?

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:53.800
So we just opened up a Columbia protocol for treating 260 patients in a completely different

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:54.800
way.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.800
These are going to be across six different rare tumors.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.280
And we're going to treat each one of them individually, but not based on their genetics

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:06.360
because we know that many of these tumors actually have no genetic lesions that are directly

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.560
tractable.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:12.080
But really by understanding their vulnerability, what are the entry point?

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:17.480
We use very sophisticated computational models, in fact, an entire basement, one of the largest

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.360
supercomputers in the United States just dedicated to solving this problem and then basically

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.320
going to a model of the patients that's going to be put in a mouse and just testing what

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.520
the conclusions from that model are.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.280
We already have some very exciting results that are coming from this type of approach.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.080
So I think that this is not to say that in the future we're going to treat each patient

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:43.080
on an individual basis, but I think what we're discovering with the exceptional responder

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.960
initiative, where we're discovering with this kind of N of one studies, what we're discovering

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.320
with this new initiative called basket studies where instead of studying one drug for one

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.480
tumor you study an entire repertoire of drugs, each one with its own biomarker.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.000
What we're discovering is that we need to first deal with tumor heterogeneity and we're

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.760
going to understand what makes tumors different.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.680
Once you have the key to be able to interpret the data, then you'll be able to just collect

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.240
all the different ways in which you treat a subset of tumors in the same way.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:19.040
In the past, we used to think of a tumor, say bladder cancer, fundamentally different

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040
from breast cancer.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.160
Today, if you actually put together side by side in terms of the actual vulnerabilities,

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.000
what are their Achilles heels?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:32.240
The basal subtype of breast cancer, the basal time of the bladder cancer and the lumenal

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:38.840
of the two are actually much more similar than a basal breast and a lumenal breast.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:43.360
I think we're starting to look at cancer very much from a molecular perspective and

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.840
even though we may learn just there was only a small number of responders when you go across

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:57.120
all the tumors, that ends up being a pretty large number.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.480
I've actually been walking around with a source of stress for 10 years now and I'm

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.560
not been given a good answer and I hope you can help me.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.680
My son who's now 12, his lymphatic system didn't form properly and he developed tumors

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.120
but they were not cancerous tumors.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.360
At age one, he had a brain CAT scan.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.560
At age two, he had a chest and neck CAT scan.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:27.360
Again at age six, he had another chest and neck CAT scan and I am really worried about

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.240
the effects of the radiation.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.680
He's had probably a dozen x-rays in the chest up until now.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.200
He's 12 and he's athletic.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.880
I worry about him getting hurt, needing more x-rays.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:43.560
One of the tumors was not able to be removed from the center of his neck so there's a

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.080
possibility that could grow in the future and he would need another CAT scan.

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:50.840
So I've been walking around very nervous and paranoid.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.360
Is it my paranoia that I have nothing to worry about or is there something proactive that

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.240
can be done before?

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:59.160
He turns 20 and then, God forbid, something happens.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:06.200
You're like, oh, you have cancer because I feel like he's had quite a bit of radiation.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.000
Is there anything that could be done ahead of time?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Could be checked.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.400
You worry about the adverse effect of radiation.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.400
Yes.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:22.320
Well, there is some concerns about that but is it proven that all these normal, I mean

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.520
not normal, these routine scans?

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:30.000
I think the radiation of an x-ray at the moment is the same as a flight across the Atlantic.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Right.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.440
So many of us fly back and forth across the Atlantic.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:37.320
Yeah, I think it's about the scan.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.320
So even though he was...

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:48.040
I think the advantages of having a scan to have early detection of the lesion far outweighs

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.720
the potential negative effects.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.280
So I think that right now you're doing absolutely the right thing.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:59.640
And even if something should happen, you should not feel it's your responsibility because

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:01.160
you're doing the right thing.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.520
Well, that's why I'm stressed.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.640
I don't want to just wait and think, what was there a blood test or a non-reige radiation

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.520
body skin that could have been done?

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.520
You know, because I've been told different things.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:19.160
But I think that Andrea just pointed out the fact that the advantage outweigh the concern.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:25.040
Because you want to follow whatever that might be developing and I'm pretty sure it's reassuring

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.480
if you see nothing is developing, right?

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.200
Well, that's what I'm saying.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.600
The doctors just say, well, if something hurts, bring them in.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.280
But isn't it too late once you feel something and something hurts?

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:41.160
You know the underlying condition, is there been a genetic testing for what your son has?

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.000
Yes, he has cystic eye gromas, cavernous lymphin jumas.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.720
There were tumors inside of his body.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.120
Did he find the actual genetics of that?

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.120
No, I didn't.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.120
That's it.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.760
So maybe that's one thing.

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:59.160
There are several institutions right now and the NIH that look at diagnosing at the genetic

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.480
level some of these very rare diseases.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.960
And in some cases, first of all, that lets you know exactly what it is.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.520
And so you can deal with it better.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.600
But also in some cases you may even find that there are potential approaches that could

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.520
be taken to either prevent or delay or so.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.720
I think this is something where you may want to consider one of these sort of, you know,

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.160
we know at Columbia we just recruited for instance David Goldstein who's going to head

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.080
our institute for genomics.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:37.440
And he's done some terrific studies at Duke, but at their institutes in Oman, Sinai, many

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.720
other places in the country do these kinds of studies.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:46.520
And I think Wendy Chong will also look specifically at children with rare planetary genetic disease.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.520
Okay.

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.520
All right.

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.520
Well, thanks.

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:54.960
You know, you point out the difference between science and clinical medical care.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.960
Because in science it's perfectly all right to say, I don't know.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.960
We haven't done those experiments.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.960
We haven't studied it.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.560
In clinical medicine when a patient comes in and looks at you, you can't just say,

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560
I don't know.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:11.560
That's right.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.560
That's what I went into science.

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.560
That's right.

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.560
No, nothing.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560
You have to be able to find that.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.560
You're saying, I don't know.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.560
But I know how we can proceed.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560
That's right.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.560
And that's what you've heard.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.360
In other words, you have to accept the fact that there's still an awful lot we don't know.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.400
But you also have to recognize that there are people who are interested in pursuing this

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:43.800
and who will keep pursuing it, because otherwise you will die by Google.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800
Any other questions?

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800
No?

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.800
Okay.

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800
Thank you.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:29:06.800
Thank you.
