00:00.000 --> 00:11.720
Hi, good afternoon everyone.

00:11.720 --> 00:20.720
Welcome back to the Helix Center and our conference on coding and the new human phenotype.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.640
This is the fifth of four round tables.

00:23.640 --> 00:31.000
In the previous four, I've been fantastic and I welcome our audience out there to check out

00:31.000 --> 00:36.840
those four round tables that are available on YouTube.

00:36.840 --> 00:46.080
This afternoon we are excited about our topic, which is the universe is the universe a metaverse.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.280
We're going to hear more about that and what that could possibly mean because maybe the

00:49.280 --> 00:51.120
title is a bit opaque.

00:51.120 --> 00:56.840
That's not, but I want to tell you something about our participants before we proceed.

00:56.840 --> 01:03.840
Elias Dachwur actually helped conceive some of this idea of the entire conference on coding.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.480
I want to thank him for that.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.160
He's taking part today as one of the participants.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.240
He's an associate professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.240
He's been researching novel treatments for addiction for over a decade and the support

01:19.240 --> 01:24.400
of several grants and national institutes of health.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.720
A special focus of his research has been evaluating sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions for cocaine

01:30.720 --> 01:35.800
use disorders in both laboratory and clinical settings as well as investigating ketamine

01:35.800 --> 01:42.240
infusions as an adjunct to mindfulness based treatment, mind body practices, motivational

01:42.240 --> 01:49.080
interviewing and other behavioral frameworks for alcohol, cannabis and OB use disorders.

01:49.080 --> 01:54.560
He has a more general interest in the impact of contemplative and non-ordinary experiences

01:54.560 --> 02:01.640
and of the interventions that might occasion and cultivation well-being.

02:01.640 --> 02:07.600
Mr. Fufus is a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who specializes

02:07.600 --> 02:12.240
in quantum information theory and quantum foundations.

02:12.240 --> 02:19.240
He is an author or co-author of over 160 scholarly pieces, one of which unconditional quantum

02:19.240 --> 02:26.000
teleportation with H.J. Kimball's experimental route was voted a, quote, top ten breakthrough

02:26.000 --> 02:31.920
of 1998, unquote, by the editors of science.

02:31.920 --> 02:36.640
He is a winner of the International Quantum Communication Award and a fellow of the American

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
Physical Society.

02:37.640 --> 02:43.640
He is most widely known for the development of the quantum interpretation known as Cubism

02:43.640 --> 02:51.120
or quantum theory is not seen as a direct representation of what is in the universe,

02:51.120 --> 02:56.560
but rather an aid to decision making in the universe where nature is events of a kind

02:56.560 --> 03:01.520
of ultimate autonomy or creativity.

03:01.520 --> 03:07.080
Emily Atlam is a post-doctorate associate at the Rodman Institute for Philosophy of Science

03:07.080 --> 03:09.760
at the University of Western Ontario.

03:09.760 --> 03:15.400
She received her Ph.D. in no divisic quantum information from the University of Cambridge.

03:15.400 --> 03:20.280
Prior to that, she completed the Perimeter Scholars International Program in theoretical

03:20.280 --> 03:24.920
physics and she did her undergraduate degree in physics and philosophy at the University

03:24.920 --> 03:26.760
of Oxford.

03:26.760 --> 03:32.040
She works on the foundations of quantum mechanics and related issues in the philosophy of science

03:32.040 --> 03:36.720
and is particularly interested in approaches to physics which go beyond the time of evolution

03:36.720 --> 03:43.000
paradigm encompassing a range of possibilities like temporal non-locality, retro-closality

03:43.000 --> 03:47.160
and all at once laws.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.480
So, Esther James Jim Gates Jr. is a theoretical physicist.

03:51.480 --> 03:59.240
He is a university of Maryland University Systems Regents Professor, the John S. Professor

03:59.240 --> 04:02.400
of Physics and a College Park Professor Emeritus.

04:02.400 --> 04:07.880
He currently holds the Clark Leadership Chair in Science and Serves as a professor of physics

04:07.880 --> 04:13.960
with the physics department as well as affiliate professor of public policy in the School of

04:13.960 --> 04:18.200
Public Policy at the University of Maryland College of Park, Maryland.

04:35.560 --> 04:42.200
He is known for his work on supersymmetry, supergravity and super strength theory.

04:42.200 --> 04:47.160
David Chalmers is University Professor of Philosophy and Neuroscience and co-director

04:47.160 --> 04:52.520
of his Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness at New York University.

04:52.520 --> 04:59.440
He is author of the Conscious Mind Constructing the World and Reality, Virtual World in the

04:59.440 --> 05:03.440
Problems of Philosophy which was just released this year.

05:03.440 --> 05:10.640
He co-founded the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness and Phil papers Foundation.

05:10.640 --> 05:16.840
He has given the John Locke Lecture and has been awarded the John DeCote, the Code of

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
Reprise.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.000
He is known for formulating the quote unquote, heart-public consciousness which inspired

05:23.000 --> 05:29.320
Tom Stocker to play the heart problem and for the idea of the extended mind which says

05:29.320 --> 05:34.320
that the tools we use can become parts of our minds.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.320
One minute.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.320
Let me take this.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.920
They know attention that may not mind the curtain.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.720
Okay everyone.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.720
Welcome.

05:45.720 --> 05:51.560
This is really a very exciting topic for us to leave into and I hope we will make a

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
leave.

05:52.560 --> 05:59.600
So does anyone want to start off with a general sort of formulation of what it might mean

05:59.600 --> 06:03.200
for the universe to be a metaverse?

06:03.200 --> 06:07.640
Well I'm willing to start.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.000
First of all I would say it doesn't mean what most people think.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.360
At least from my perspective.

06:14.360 --> 06:17.960
My own research has led me to do in this period.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.120
It's quite astounding.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.320
I started from a position of total skepticism.

06:23.320 --> 06:29.000
Having read about John Wheeler's It From Bit which is the information leads to the existence

06:29.000 --> 06:31.840
of that universe that we live in.

06:31.840 --> 06:37.040
And I remember quite when I was young, first reading it thinking what an insane idea.

06:37.040 --> 06:43.400
So 15 or 20 years ago in my own research I found mathematical evidence of error correcting

06:43.400 --> 06:49.640
codes and what may be the fundamental laws of our universe if ideas relate to string theory

06:49.640 --> 06:51.440
are correct.

06:51.440 --> 06:56.600
And so at that point I concluded that if you think about this stuff long enough you too

06:56.600 --> 06:58.640
can actually become crazy.

06:58.640 --> 07:09.040
Coldly better than an idea of this notion that information is an elemental aspect of

07:09.040 --> 07:10.040
the universe.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
Is that true?

07:11.040 --> 07:13.640
Is that a good way to put it?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.800
I don't know.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.400
I'm a disciple of John Wheeler's that you just mentioned.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.720
I did some undergraduate work with him.

07:23.720 --> 07:29.680
And his thinking went through various stages.

07:29.680 --> 07:37.320
He started, I think when it was finally realized that black holes were inevitable, Wheeler

07:37.320 --> 07:45.320
started worrying that somehow every law of physics could ultimately be transcended.

07:45.320 --> 07:50.260
So for instance it used to be believed that baryon number was a fixed quantity in the

07:50.260 --> 07:55.080
universe but she threw the baryons into black hole and the number of baryons decreases.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.720
So what was once considered law of physics was transcended by black holes.

08:00.720 --> 08:08.600
And so he went through this phase of thinking well this is transcended, that is transcended

08:08.600 --> 08:17.240
and he was left with a position where he would say there is laws but the only law is that

08:17.240 --> 08:21.680
there is no law because they're always ultimately transcended.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.320
So law without law was one of his slogans.

08:26.320 --> 08:33.520
And after that he started thinking well if the universe isn't made of particles, fields

08:33.520 --> 08:40.240
or even geometry because geometry can become singular what must it be made of and that's

08:40.240 --> 08:47.280
where he somehow landed on the idea that it was information.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.600
And so I took that as my starting point but then ultimately I sort of worked away from

08:52.600 --> 09:01.480
that because it apologized information in a way that I thought was unhealthy thinking.

09:01.480 --> 09:06.840
So what we needed to understand instead was that the universe is the universe and then

09:06.840 --> 09:13.360
there are thinking beings in this universe and they use information and they use information

09:13.360 --> 09:18.320
in certain ways because the universe is a certain way but the information itself is

09:18.320 --> 09:21.800
not part of the stuff of the universe.

09:21.800 --> 09:27.000
So one can transcend one's mentor.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.920
Yeah I also tend to be quite skeptical about it from the hypothesis because I think it

09:32.920 --> 09:37.080
fails to distinguish between what is in the world and the information that we receive

09:37.080 --> 09:38.080
about the world.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.520
Obviously we formulate physics on the basis of information that we have received and thus

09:42.520 --> 09:47.200
it's quite natural that the physics we thus formulate exhibits various information theoretic

09:47.200 --> 09:51.880
properties because it's the result of certain epistemic constraints subject that agents

09:51.880 --> 09:53.600
like us are subject to.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.200
Our physics is going to reflect those kinds of constraints.

09:56.200 --> 09:59.920
It's going to reflect the kinds of information we can obtain but that doesn't mean that the

09:59.920 --> 10:01.480
physics is about information.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.440
It just means the physics is formulated on the basis of information and thus it will

10:05.440 --> 10:10.600
naturally have information theoretic features.

10:10.600 --> 10:14.920
Now our topic is the universe a metaverse.

10:14.920 --> 10:20.400
I think the metaverse actually has features that go beyond the simple it from bit idea.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.720
It may have something in common.

10:21.720 --> 10:28.440
I mean the metaverse standardly stands for a virtual world that we create.

10:28.440 --> 10:33.560
I mean Neil Stevenson introduced the term in his science fiction novel Snow Crash back

10:33.560 --> 10:39.280
in 1992 where the metaverse was basically a virtual reality environment that people would

10:39.280 --> 10:47.240
go into with headsets and the like and interact with other people and live a at least a partly

10:47.240 --> 10:48.240
digital life.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.880
Now of course the tech corporations have appropriated this idea and are using it, you

10:52.880 --> 10:59.240
know, meta is now using it as a label for the ecosystem of virtual worlds that they would

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
like to build.

11:00.240 --> 11:09.400
So when I hear is the universe a metaverse I hear is our universe a virtual world inside

11:09.400 --> 11:16.680
someone else's universe in the same way that the metaverse would be a digital world, a

11:16.680 --> 11:18.800
virtual world inside our universe.

11:18.800 --> 11:23.280
I mean that would have elements of the it from bit idea in it because if our universe

11:23.280 --> 11:30.640
is a virtual world inside someone else's universe and presumably we're running on someone else's

11:30.640 --> 11:34.360
computers and there's going to be a level of a level of bits there but I think it's

11:34.360 --> 11:39.560
that idea that we're in a virtual world because we're beyond the it from bit idea.

11:39.560 --> 11:46.280
The it from bit idea can be understood as saying there's a digital processes in the

11:46.280 --> 11:50.880
constitution of our worlds maybe there's even a digital physics it's a interesting speculation

11:50.880 --> 11:56.080
maybe true maybe false but it's a universe a metaverse it's like it from bit on steroids

11:56.080 --> 12:04.520
there's bits and there's bits that we are grounded within a vast universe beyond it.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.880
How could it have been very appealing let's say to Wheeler and there's also what they

12:08.880 --> 12:16.440
would and Fred can also bring about this in years back that so since we have most of the

12:16.440 --> 12:21.320
skeptics here it seems about that idea of it from bit that's great that's that seems

12:21.320 --> 12:24.640
like nice to have that sort of consensus but I like the idea.

12:24.640 --> 12:29.200
I can't even put it in a world like it was two and two.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.200
Okay.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.840
Well Jim I'm not interested in us sort of fleshing out just for the just to be fair and honest

12:34.840 --> 12:39.920
with the idea what is it because I think the general audience may have appreciated what

12:39.920 --> 12:44.080
is that even mean to say the universe is made up of information that seems like if you say

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
it's made up of atoms you go.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.800
There's quite a distinct so you brought up at Fred Kim and Fred Kim thought that the

12:50.800 --> 12:58.480
world was a program running on something the last time I heard him speak was the other

12:58.480 --> 13:07.320
the universe is a program running on the other what's the other at well no answer so that

13:07.320 --> 13:11.280
I never found a productive line of thought.

13:11.280 --> 13:17.200
Wheeler on the other hand didn't think that the universe was a program running on anything

13:17.200 --> 13:22.720
so when he was saying it from bit he would even say that the only thing that's going

13:22.720 --> 13:27.680
on in the universe is higgledy higgledy which was the first time I'd ever heard the term

13:27.680 --> 13:30.360
and I'd look it up not for the English dictionary.

13:30.360 --> 13:36.680
You know that the universe is just sort of bubbling out of chaos but the stuff that's

13:36.680 --> 13:42.680
bubbling up is information in Wheeler's mind so they're very different world views.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
So the.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.000
Well remember there's no ether right I mean for a long time I've seen we couldn't do any

13:47.000 --> 13:49.680
physics without there being an ether.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
Yeah.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.680
People said oh there is.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.680
But we still have these waves.

13:55.680 --> 14:01.200
I mean so can you is it is it fair to be critical of him for not being able to come up with

14:01.200 --> 14:02.760
what is I kind of.

14:02.760 --> 14:03.760
Oh you've been Fred.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.760
Yeah.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.760
Yeah.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.200
Is it fair to be critical for somebody who says I can't tell you what the media.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.200
I can't tell you what the universe is but it's running on the other.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.520
You know the other hand you might say they didn't mind of God and how is this more productive.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.880
But that would be my one.

14:18.880 --> 14:23.520
The idea goes way beyond Fred can though I mean Conrad Zusse who one of the inventors

14:23.520 --> 14:29.320
of the computer back in 1943 he were reams manuscript some the idea that physics might

14:29.320 --> 14:34.720
be might be digital and that's what I take to be the core idea of it from bits just that

14:34.720 --> 14:39.760
they're a level of physics which is somehow digital if for example as Stephen Wolfram is

14:39.760 --> 14:45.480
sometimes slow maybe our universe is a cellular automaton running off like a game of life

14:45.480 --> 14:48.800
bits interacted with bits at the bottom level that would be digital physics.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.520
I mean it's probably true but it's not a crazy idea.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.040
It's a perfectly sensible idea that physics could be digital.

14:56.040 --> 15:00.960
Can I even push it back one step further.

15:00.960 --> 15:06.960
So as I said when I in my own work found evidence for error correcting codes possibly in the

15:06.960 --> 15:13.880
standard sorts of laws that out in Einstein and Maxwell which is where we business make

15:13.880 --> 15:20.120
out living I had a hard time getting it published that we were finding error correcting codes

15:20.120 --> 15:24.680
in this thing called supersymmetry which is an extension we've not seen in the laboratory

15:24.680 --> 15:31.080
but it extends mathematically other position that starts with Maxwell and Einstein.

15:31.080 --> 15:37.000
And so when I wrestle with this one of the things that occurred to me is that it's not

15:37.000 --> 15:43.400
just about the digital part because you can all in my mind you can go all the way back

15:43.400 --> 15:49.920
to play those allegory of the cave and ask the questions where do we fit in that story

15:49.920 --> 15:57.680
because I'm sure you're all familiar this is a famous parable about these individuals

15:57.680 --> 16:03.280
trapped in a cave that can only see shadows on a wall and they perceive those shadows

16:03.280 --> 16:08.000
and the shadows come from outside the cave and they perceive those shadows as being reality

16:08.000 --> 16:13.320
but when exposed to actual reality they don't know how to interpret and readily what they're

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
encountering.

16:14.320 --> 16:24.320
And in some sense to me it's really odd that this several millennium year old idea has

16:24.320 --> 16:30.080
been partially realized in where physics has taken us a couple of thousand years later

16:30.080 --> 16:36.080
to me this is a very odd development but one of the things I would caution a group like

16:36.080 --> 16:42.720
this discussing these ideas is not to forget what Einstein said about Galileo.

16:42.720 --> 16:49.400
Einstein called Galileo the father of physics because and this is Einstein's word he drummed

16:49.400 --> 16:56.960
it into our heads that the way we know about reality is by measuring and observing reality

16:56.960 --> 17:05.960
and that if you have a proposition that leads to no measurable outcome it exceeds the definition

17:05.960 --> 17:06.960
of science.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.680
Well sort of like this idea that's a metaphysics you're doubly a metaphysics but it's in the

17:12.680 --> 17:17.880
interesting that you mention these error correcting codes and I think well if a consequence of

17:17.880 --> 17:24.080
your view of the university model of the universe includes error correcting codes that you're

17:24.080 --> 17:26.800
citing and say well that's a consequence.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.000
So you say more about that?

17:29.000 --> 17:35.600
Is there a way to test that or is there other implications of that idea that might be relevant

17:35.600 --> 17:39.440
to theoretical physics today?

17:39.440 --> 17:43.600
But I have a few minutes to think about that and you can ask about other participants

17:43.600 --> 17:46.520
the way I need to think about that for a second.

17:46.520 --> 17:52.080
What is reminding us is this space time interval of special relativity that most folks out

17:52.080 --> 17:56.680
there have read a lot about relativity may not appreciate if there's this geometry at

17:56.680 --> 18:02.360
the space time invariant that's a pretty cool mathematical finding and that does confirm

18:02.360 --> 18:06.960
a lot of what happens in special relativity most folks don't realize that that geometry

18:06.960 --> 18:11.120
is built into space life.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.000
Yeah I was going to say that I think Plato is came as a good example of the sense in

18:15.000 --> 18:19.200
which some caution is required in making these kinds of claims because like the observers

18:19.200 --> 18:25.440
in Plato's came we are presumably quite limited our ability to observe things and we are observing

18:25.440 --> 18:29.840
sort of reflections on a wall rather than whatever is causing them and when we speak

18:29.840 --> 18:34.440
out for an distinction between properties of that are sort of properties of the observations

18:34.440 --> 18:38.520
in virtue of the way in which we are situated at our limitations versus properties that

18:38.520 --> 18:42.160
are properties of the world and my concern is that there were these discussions about

18:42.160 --> 18:46.280
it from bit what's going on is that we are mistaking properties of our observations like

18:46.280 --> 18:51.640
the existence of certain sort of epistemological limitations or inter-fee balance and so on.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.480
We are mistaking those things for properties of reality and we need to sort of keep in

18:55.480 --> 19:00.920
mind that the epistemological limitations that apply to our observations are necessarily

19:00.920 --> 19:07.960
properties and the observations are ultimately being caused by.

19:07.960 --> 19:12.040
An original criticism of quantum mechanics.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.200
Yes that is one criticism.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.320
Yeah I think it applies outside quantum mechanics as well as not limited to that particular domain.

19:19.320 --> 19:24.760
You challenged me a few seconds ago so I am prepared now to respond.

19:24.760 --> 19:32.080
So when I was part of a collaboration three mathematicians, three physicists and we came

19:32.080 --> 19:39.120
up on this very strange discovery for a few years afterwards I would get the question

19:39.120 --> 19:45.280
what does this mean and that's kind of what you just asked me and this has led me personally

19:45.280 --> 19:52.520
to ask the strangest question in my career which is if the laws of physics involve error

19:52.520 --> 19:58.520
correcting codes and as soon as someone tells me they see a super partner in some laboratory

19:58.520 --> 20:01.240
I can make that assertion.

20:01.240 --> 20:07.440
If that occurs the question is how in the world did the laws of physics get to error

20:07.440 --> 20:11.960
correction and to answer that question the only way I know how to answer that is to look

20:11.960 --> 20:16.320
at the nature herself as a model and there is only one part of nature that I know where

20:16.320 --> 20:22.960
error correction is discussed is genetics and in genetics the proposition is the error

20:22.960 --> 20:28.080
correcting codes are put there by the forces of evolution and so the question translated

20:28.080 --> 20:33.800
to what I have seen is what does it mean for evolution to act on the mathematical laws

20:33.800 --> 20:35.760
of the universe?

20:35.760 --> 20:40.160
I can state the question I have no idea what the answer would be.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.160
That's nice.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
Thank you.

20:43.160 --> 20:47.320
I am glad to talk about that.

20:47.320 --> 20:55.160
There is an old tradition or there is a tradition maybe it doesn't exist so much anymore thinking

20:55.160 --> 20:59.840
that the laws of nature might evolve and I mean we were talking about Wheeler earlier

20:59.840 --> 21:05.600
Wheeler thinking that laws can be transcended ultimately there aren't laws but there was

21:05.600 --> 21:13.880
an American philosopher named Charles Sanders Purse who believed that the laws of nature

21:13.880 --> 21:18.000
could evolve and that laws of nature were habits.

21:18.000 --> 21:29.160
I mean there is even like a lovely story of Purse's explanation for gravity was that

21:29.160 --> 21:36.160
in primordial universe things were going around some things flew out and some things

21:36.160 --> 21:41.000
formed the habit of going around each other and that was the origin of gravity.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.160
It was a natural selection effect.

21:44.160 --> 21:50.440
So this group of philosophers William James, Charles Sanders Purse, John Dewey they were

21:50.440 --> 21:54.440
known as American pragmatists and they were perfectly willing to believe that the laws

21:54.440 --> 21:57.560
of nature could evolve.

21:57.560 --> 22:03.840
And there is a nice I mean I am just telling you historical things.

22:03.840 --> 22:11.200
There is the great mathematical physicist Henri Poincare his brother-in-law in Neil

22:11.200 --> 22:19.120
Boutro believed that the laws of nature could evolve and Poincare wrote a nice essay about

22:19.120 --> 22:21.800
what could it mean for the laws of nature to evolve.

22:21.800 --> 22:26.840
How would you have some kind of empirical evidence that the laws are evolving and he

22:26.840 --> 22:34.760
said presently if you see that your theory gives rise to a singularity that this must

22:34.760 --> 22:39.800
be a statement that the theory itself is telling you I can't go forever.

22:39.800 --> 22:45.800
So I thought that was very nice.

22:45.800 --> 22:51.960
You could ask yourself about the metaverse and say and some people do they hear about

22:51.960 --> 22:54.960
it they say that's a crazy idea.

22:54.960 --> 23:01.640
And then you as a prominent philosopher have written a whole book about it which means

23:01.640 --> 23:04.560
to some degree you take it seriously.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.440
So why isn't it a ridiculous idea?

23:08.440 --> 23:13.120
Why is it something to actually think about it?

23:13.120 --> 23:15.520
The metaverse is not a ridiculous idea.

23:15.520 --> 23:20.480
The metaverse is actually something that people are trying to create right now in the tech

23:20.480 --> 23:22.920
corporations and elsewhere we have.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.440
But then there's a hypothesis.

23:25.440 --> 23:31.320
I distinguish the metaverse which is about the virtual worlds that we create from say

23:31.320 --> 23:41.120
the simulation hypothesis the hypothesis that we're living inside a metaverse or a simulation.

23:41.120 --> 23:46.800
And that's of course an odd idea in science fiction you get it in the matrix.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.440
You also find versions of it.

23:48.440 --> 23:54.280
The video's cave is not too far from a version of it, René Descartes talking about the hypothesis

23:54.280 --> 23:59.320
that maybe all this could be a dream, all this could be produced by sensations produced

23:59.320 --> 24:00.320
by an evil demon.

24:00.320 --> 24:06.040
Yeah the idea that all this is a computer simulation is a successor to that idea.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.040
Why take it seriously?

24:07.040 --> 24:14.360
Well one reason to take it seriously is just the idea that there may be many metaverses,

24:14.360 --> 24:22.640
many simulations created in the history of the universe, maybe actually many more virtual

24:22.640 --> 24:26.240
universes than non-virtual universes.

24:26.240 --> 24:32.080
Maybe even many more non-virtual people, many more virtual people than non-virtual people.

24:32.080 --> 24:37.960
I'm assuming because I'm assuming those virtual people are actually conscious and having conscious

24:37.960 --> 24:47.200
experiences like ours then you say statistically what are the odds that I'm one of the lucky

24:47.200 --> 24:49.840
ones at ground zero, unsibulated.

24:49.840 --> 24:56.120
I think Postam is actually given the statistical argument that we should take this hypothesis

24:56.120 --> 25:01.000
very seriously and the fact that we're now actually creating these universes, I mean we

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
don't yet have simulated universes anything like depth and detail of the physical world

25:06.000 --> 25:11.400
but no one would be surprised if in say a century we were getting pretty close to that.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.920
The fact that technology is going there gives us all maybe all the more reason for us to

25:14.920 --> 25:17.360
take this seriously as a realistic possibility.

25:17.360 --> 25:21.640
So I don't advocate the idea, I don't come out and say yes we are definitely in a simulation

25:21.640 --> 25:27.920
but I take it to grand metaphysical speculation about our universe that we should take seriously.

25:27.920 --> 25:32.040
It's an interestingly, you know it's continuous with the infra-bit idea that there's a level

25:32.040 --> 25:37.640
of digitality underneath our reality but of course it goes way beyond it.

25:37.640 --> 25:43.600
Sometimes I talk about the it from bit from it idea, the other bits underneath the it's

25:43.600 --> 25:47.720
the apples and particles are made of a level of bits but underneath that level of bits

25:47.720 --> 25:53.440
there may be so much more such as for example the world in which the simulation takes place.

25:53.440 --> 26:01.880
So I think about the simulation hypothesis as a version of the it from bit from it idea.

26:01.880 --> 26:07.320
Earlier I spoke about the simulation hypothesis, the hypothesis is exceeding the bounds of

26:07.320 --> 26:14.120
physics at least as I understand it and when I speak to the public in general because I've

26:14.120 --> 26:20.680
been many times asked about this I just point out to people that if you take the simulation

26:20.680 --> 26:29.200
hypothesis seriously then ghosts are possible because if we're programs running on some

26:29.200 --> 26:35.560
underlying structure when that program is terminated as long as the underlying structure

26:35.560 --> 26:42.960
is not damaged you can be initiate that program that's a ghost and in my universe I don't

26:42.960 --> 26:44.960
understand how ghosts can exist.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
Are you guys making backups?

26:46.960 --> 26:53.000
Yeah I have been saying about the simulation hypothesis for the similar reason.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.120
At least when there are scientific contexts I think there are certain kinds of hypotheses

26:57.120 --> 27:01.000
that we just have to pre-mufface you rule out because they prevent us from using empirical

27:01.000 --> 27:06.280
evidence in the usual sorts of ways to confirm scientific theories and I think that things

27:06.280 --> 27:11.760
like the simulated hypothesis this as well as related things like the ever-entert rotation

27:11.760 --> 27:16.000
various things which significantly interfere with the relationship we pursue ourselves

27:16.000 --> 27:19.800
to have with our evidence for our theories just need to be ruled out at the beginning

27:19.800 --> 27:24.840
if we want to do any science which just you know those things could be true but we have

27:24.840 --> 27:27.480
to pursue their long trip we're going to do simple science.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.040
I just want to say some of us here are not scientists for philosophy.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.040
Yeah.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
It would be fine philosophical hypothesis.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
Yes.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
I'm happy with that.

27:35.040 --> 27:40.520
The law of the hypothesis but certainly within the point of view is trying to decide

27:40.520 --> 27:42.520
to think things on the hypothesis.

27:42.520 --> 27:47.400
I think it's funny because I think even in Descartes case you know people might argue

27:47.400 --> 27:53.920
that whereas he made a way out of this conundrum could it be that the entire our experiences

27:53.920 --> 27:55.840
and generated by a demon etc.

27:55.840 --> 28:00.960
You know he made his way out by I think therefore I am and then the gods perfect and that's

28:00.960 --> 28:03.160
how I got out of that trap.

28:03.160 --> 28:08.160
But you could argue and I accept this that the implausibility of that first.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.160
Anyway that's the way I think it.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.960
The dad really did a lot of the heavy lifting in moving away from that.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.200
Some people think there could be evidence for versions of the simulation hypothesis maybe

28:19.200 --> 28:24.720
not for the perfect indistinguishable simulation but maybe say it's an imperfect simulation

28:24.720 --> 28:25.720
with glitches.

28:25.720 --> 28:30.160
Jim's colleague Zorri Devoudi and others had a paper talking about what would it look

28:30.160 --> 28:35.000
like if we were in an approximate simulation that kind of cut some corners on the equation

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
and some potential evidence there or if there are glitches like in the black hat that crosses

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
your path.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.480
There's evidence potential evidence for the imperfect simulation hypothesis so that makes

28:46.480 --> 28:50.880
it at least maybe continuous with size but once it becomes the perfect simulation that

28:50.880 --> 28:55.960
Descartes was talking about when indistinguishable from physical reality I guess at that point

28:55.960 --> 28:58.880
it becomes philosophy because there's no experiment you can do.

28:58.880 --> 29:03.040
Well yeah from a scientific point of view it's the problem not so much that there never

29:03.040 --> 29:07.200
could possibly be any evidence but more that there aren't really sort of meaningful steps

29:07.200 --> 29:10.640
that we can take to go out and see evidence.

29:10.640 --> 29:16.000
We have to just wait for some glitches to show up or put you know people outside the matrix

29:16.000 --> 29:20.160
to decide to take us out and tell us the tricks you know that those would certainly count

29:20.160 --> 29:23.480
as evidence for that hypothesis were they to occur but it's not much we can do to bring

29:23.480 --> 29:26.000
about those things happening as play to things like this.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.320
We can run our computers really hard and really fight us to try and strain them to the max

29:30.320 --> 29:33.560
to if we burn out those computers and the silly little pieces.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.160
Cool the whole thing to a halt.

29:35.160 --> 29:39.160
People have suggested serious research programs like that but I don't know how serious.

29:39.160 --> 29:44.520
I think I have to point that these kinds of hypotheses also have the consequence that

29:44.520 --> 29:48.880
they're looking back at empirical evidence to do things like try to confirm a theory like

29:48.880 --> 29:53.880
quantum mechanics is kind of pointless because the simulation people can make our empirical

29:53.880 --> 29:58.000
evidence do whatever they like and so there's no mismocation reading anything at all into

29:58.000 --> 30:03.080
one's empirical evidence if one believes that this is a viable possibility so at least

30:03.080 --> 30:08.240
within that kind of domain those possibilities need to be set aside I think.

30:08.240 --> 30:16.200
My colleague Dr. Traumriss points out something that many times try to convey to people that

30:16.200 --> 30:23.640
if you believe in the perfect simulation then the programmers in that simulation fit exactly

30:23.640 --> 30:28.240
the traditional definition of God's.

30:28.240 --> 30:34.080
And so one gets outside of the realm of science very quickly if you believe in that perfect

30:34.080 --> 30:39.080
simulation.

30:39.080 --> 30:46.080
As a great illustration in my book reality class of God creating the universe.

30:46.080 --> 30:52.080
She's a teenage girl and the next universe up looking at her computer and all the galaxies

30:52.080 --> 30:56.080
and nebulas come from there so it may not be a traditional girl.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.080
Could be creative, could be all powerful, could be all knowing about our universe.

31:01.080 --> 31:07.080
A reasonable point back about the ghost idea that you cite Jim is that whatever simulation

31:07.080 --> 31:11.080
assuming we live in a simulation process.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.080
Whenever one we live in there's going to be some rules and regulations about the way

31:14.080 --> 31:18.080
whether they're going to be standard ways we're accustomed to the world.

31:18.080 --> 31:25.080
And so no we don't have ghosts in our world and while whereas it would be possible we're

31:25.080 --> 31:30.080
at a computer program that ghosts in the world that these computer programmers that's called

31:30.080 --> 31:33.080
the best of all possible worlds of political life that's right.

31:33.080 --> 31:36.080
So they figured out that we're not going to have repeats in this world.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.080
So we don't, that's one of the reasons we're not accustomed to.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.080
We don't rapids that speak either.

31:42.080 --> 31:47.080
Yes but one of the things I, you know, all of us thought about quantum mechanics and yes

31:47.080 --> 31:50.080
this is sarcastic and there's probability that you have you.

31:50.080 --> 31:57.080
But I have a hard time thinking about science where arbitraryness is totally arbitrary.

31:57.080 --> 32:02.080
And again the perfect simulation hypothesis that teenage girl might one day wake up

32:02.080 --> 32:09.080
in this side to change her mind and allow in a thousand years for me to show up again.

32:09.080 --> 32:14.080
Now that might have some attraction to be personally but I don't think that's how

32:14.080 --> 32:17.080
I see no evidence laid for this way.

32:17.080 --> 32:21.080
In my life that science is like that, that our universe works like that.

32:21.080 --> 32:29.080
But I wonder if there's any pragmatic value in holding this I think silly belief because

32:29.080 --> 32:32.080
it's not something you can invalidate.

32:32.080 --> 32:38.080
But it might be that it gives some comfort to the believers.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.080
You know just as one finds comfort in religion.

32:41.080 --> 32:48.080
Do you find comfort in the idea that you're some young ladies toy?

32:48.080 --> 32:57.080
Maybe there's an afterlife here.

32:57.080 --> 33:00.080
I think most people find this horrifying the idea.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.080
At least initially they think oh my god we're under matrix.

33:03.080 --> 33:07.080
The simulation. None of it's real. My life is an illusion.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.080
I don't think that's the wrong reaction.

33:09.080 --> 33:14.080
But yeah I mean it could turn out that we're in a simulation and if so life goes on.

33:14.080 --> 33:18.080
I'm still real. I'm still having this conversation with you.

33:18.080 --> 33:22.080
I've still got relationships. I still have community.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.080
Those are the things that bring meaning to your life.

33:25.080 --> 33:29.080
I don't find the hypothesis as horrifying as some people find it.

33:29.080 --> 33:32.080
I wouldn't say I find it especially comforting.

33:32.080 --> 33:36.080
It doesn't mean that we're all somehow at the mercy of this simulator as we are with a god.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.080
I've got to hope that this simulator is benign.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.080
Surely if you were some presented with good evidence that's what true.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.080
This would affect the decision making processes in some ways.

33:47.080 --> 33:51.080
For me it would significantly reduce my faith that the laws of nature are going to continue working

33:51.080 --> 33:55.080
and the way I expect. I would probably stop predicting things in quite the way I usually do

33:55.080 --> 33:58.080
because the simulator could change their mind at any time.

33:58.080 --> 34:05.080
Whereas if I don't believe in a simulation I tend to assume the laws of nature are going to continue to hold them roughly the same way.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.080
We could consider the system wondering.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.080
From the point of it was doing philosophy I'd say.

34:10.080 --> 34:15.080
We could consider it a very pregnant form of a law of thought experiment.

34:15.080 --> 34:20.080
We just talked about some other philosophers play the whole thing hard.

34:20.080 --> 34:23.080
It's a way to stimulate our thinking about what we think is the ultimate.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.080
What does existence like ultimately?

34:26.080 --> 34:34.080
To me that is in fact the value of a scientist discussing the nature of reality with philosophers.

34:34.080 --> 34:41.080
In particular physics used to be natural philosophy before Newton came along and turned it into physics.

34:41.080 --> 34:47.080
Physics in particular bears a very close relationship with philosophy.

34:47.080 --> 34:52.080
I think of the simulation idea although I find it unacceptable in the framework of

34:52.080 --> 34:55.080
as I understand the way our universe works and physics works.

34:55.080 --> 35:00.080
I find it as a tempting driver to make me think more deeply about that.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.080
I think that's the value as a sort of a hard-course scientist.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.080
That's the value that I see in this discussion.

35:07.080 --> 35:12.080
It forces me to think more deeply and to try to find the errors in my thinking.

35:12.080 --> 35:18.080
I think there's possibly an intermediate hypothesis which I find a bit more scientific.

35:18.080 --> 35:29.080
Rather than supposing that there's a higher consciousness creating a simulation it's the idea that maybe the underlying reality is kind of very different from the way we experience it.

35:29.080 --> 35:35.080
Our reality is in some sense that simulation running on some very different kind of hardware.

35:35.080 --> 35:41.080
There have been various suggestions that maybe the world has less dimensions than it does and that kind of thing.

35:41.080 --> 35:47.080
In a sense in that kind of picture there is something about our experience which is sort of simulated or illusory.

35:47.080 --> 35:52.080
I think that kind of possibility seems a bit more within the realm of science.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.080
Maybe the simulation speculation.

35:55.080 --> 36:00.080
I mean there are ways, I totally agree, there are ways that elements of this could be true without a full-scale simulation.

36:00.080 --> 36:03.080
We could dial it all the way back to the it from bit idea.

36:03.080 --> 36:08.080
Okay well maybe there's just a level of bits here generating our reality.

36:08.080 --> 36:12.080
Maybe there's something underneath the bits where we don't know.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.080
Well that is maybe it's not a simulation but maybe it's something else that's unknowable.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.080
Some people speculate that that might be consciousness.

36:19.080 --> 36:23.080
Maybe the universe could be made of consciousness underneath the bits.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.080
I call that bit from bit from consciousness.

36:27.080 --> 36:33.080
If you look at that further, the idea that for example space could be emergent from something more fundamental than space.

36:33.080 --> 36:39.080
Underneath the space this is an idea that's increasingly taken seriously in physical theories.

36:39.080 --> 36:48.080
I think it kind of squares in quite interesting ways with the bit from bit idea or the simulation idea that the space we actually experience is somehow emergent.

36:48.080 --> 36:58.080
I think about all these ground, they started as a national metaphysical ground, metaphysical hypotheses, but some of them could end up turning into science.

36:58.080 --> 37:11.080
We cycle around this, this comes up a lot and it's come up in our other talks this weekend where something like the term information which has seemed to be two phases.

37:11.080 --> 37:18.080
One is what there is and is what we know about what there is.

37:18.080 --> 37:21.080
That's a constant challenge for us.

37:21.080 --> 37:28.080
I mentioned the original struggles and still for many people ongoing struggles with how to interpret quantum mechanics.

37:28.080 --> 37:44.080
The interest in information also I am standing on is that it also arose after Stephen Hawking made the suggestion about how entropy might be related to black hole formation and it's possible.

37:44.080 --> 37:49.080
The evaporation of black holes and that fits into this holographic theory I think.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.080
Also, am I right? I'm pretty sure.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.080
That's connected.

37:52.080 --> 38:02.080
I'm wondering about that, going back to what are the bits and why do these keep coming up and what to say about consciousness and what to say about the universe?

38:02.080 --> 38:11.080
I have been thinking about entropy bounds a lot recently in my recent research and the question I keep coming back to is precisely this question.

38:11.080 --> 38:18.080
Are these entropy bounds a feature of reality itself or are there a feature of our ability to get information about reality?

38:18.080 --> 38:30.080
What the entropy bounds are supposed to say essentially is that within some region of space-time, roughly speaking, the information contained in that region is proportional to the surface area around the volume.

38:30.080 --> 38:36.080
A lot of people want to interpret that as an ontological statement about what's out there in the world.

38:36.080 --> 38:46.080
But if you think space-time is discretized, there's a sense in which it's a natural kind of epistemic constraint that we should only be able to get information out of a region in proportion to its surface area.

38:46.080 --> 38:54.080
So, arguably, that looks a bit like the kind of thing that's an epistemic restriction on our ability to learn things about the world rather than what's really there.

38:54.080 --> 39:06.080
So, it's an interesting question, I think, how we should distinguish between what features of our observations reflect what is really there and which features just reflect our limited perspective on us.

39:06.080 --> 39:14.080
Can I take this as an avenue to talk about not just about information, but about mathematics in general.

39:14.080 --> 39:19.080
It's often, when often comes across the state with that mathematics, it's that language of the universe.

39:19.080 --> 39:29.080
And that's something that I can't quite accept. And I've said in other venues that it's the only human language that allows us to comprehend the universe at a very intimate level.

39:29.080 --> 39:33.080
And it has several hundred years of proving that.

39:33.080 --> 39:38.080
But that doesn't mean that nature herself uses that language.

39:38.080 --> 39:46.080
So, this emphasis on the distinction between what there is and our perception of what there is.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.080
This is a very important thing to keep in mind, I believe.

39:49.080 --> 39:55.080
I think this is crucial when it comes to information, because this word gets used in so many different ways.

39:55.080 --> 40:01.080
I mean, there's information in the sense of something we know, some facts that we have.

40:01.080 --> 40:05.080
And then I call this semantic information, I'm going to see a bit of a lot of different information.

40:05.080 --> 40:09.080
I know where the helix center is, it's on 82nd Street.

40:09.080 --> 40:14.080
Okay, that's information. That's something a person has or knows.

40:14.080 --> 40:18.080
Then this information has bits, which is zeros or ones, and so on.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.080
These mathematical entities, these things that might be out there in the universe.

40:21.080 --> 40:24.080
That's not necessarily tied to anything anyone knows.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.080
It's just tied to what's out there.

40:26.080 --> 40:32.080
In my book, I call this structural information to distinguish from semantic information.

40:32.080 --> 40:38.080
I guess confusing, causing contemporary databases, computer science, the web, these two things go together.

40:38.080 --> 40:43.080
People use zeros and ones, the bits to code, facts, things we know.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
I think we've just really got to separate these things.

40:45.080 --> 40:50.080
It's a shame. We've got the same words, these two, incredibly important, but totally different concepts.

40:50.080 --> 40:55.080
There's bits, there's facts, and these are really thoroughly different from each other.

40:55.080 --> 41:01.080
Yeah, also sometimes when people say information, what they mean is number of degrees of freedom or something like that,

41:01.080 --> 41:06.080
which again is not the same as bits or structure or semantic information necessarily.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.080
So it would be nice to distinguish those things better.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.080
I can't, as a kind of structural information.

41:11.080 --> 41:16.080
It just seems the name just be two. You know, you can put the bits two ways, there's three ways, there's tricks.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.080
Maybe there's even continuous information for degrees of freedom.

41:19.080 --> 41:27.080
When degree of freedom, you could have many bits, but they could be required to be correlated in certain ways.

41:27.080 --> 41:32.080
The number of effective degrees of freedom could be much smaller than the number of bits in your system.

41:32.080 --> 41:39.080
I want to go back to this Jim's notion about the self-correcting codes and whether or not it's a reflection.

41:39.080 --> 41:46.080
And of course, you didn't mean to suggest it is survival of fittest, strictly speaking.

41:46.080 --> 41:51.080
In other words, not biological evolution, which would be evolution, would be some other sort of evolution.

41:51.080 --> 41:59.080
Of course, there have been a lot of mathematical models applied to how there are self-correcting features of the biological systems.

41:59.080 --> 42:06.080
And they usually do once again, go back to theories about entropy and dissipation of energy use, etc.

42:06.080 --> 42:18.080
And, you know, I'm wondering whether that's a way to get a handle on, in some way, like, well, what would it imply if the universe goes through?

42:18.080 --> 42:27.080
I'm imagining the self-correcting change would be something moving away from what you think, and the way the entropy normally would be functioning.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.080
Right?

42:28.080 --> 42:36.080
So, my comment was within the very tight bounds of looking at this thing called supersymmetry.

42:36.080 --> 42:41.080
The mathematical supersymmetry, that's what I've said my entire adult like looking at.

42:41.080 --> 42:54.080
And in those confines, this idea about error correction, there's only one, I have an intuitive way which I would never submit as a scientific paper.

42:54.080 --> 43:02.080
And that is that it's my intuitive feel that if there were something like this kind of evolution that we're talking,

43:02.080 --> 43:07.080
that would drive the presence of these error-correcting codes into the mathematical laws,

43:07.080 --> 43:13.080
that it has something to do with exactly this point about the university evolving.

43:13.080 --> 43:23.080
Because the genetics, right, and genetics, the argument is that error-correcting codes are there because if you have two genomes, one with error-correcting codes and one without,

43:23.080 --> 43:28.080
the genome with the error-correcting code is more efficient at producing progeny,

43:28.080 --> 43:31.080
because the one without produces progeny that don't survive.

43:31.080 --> 43:36.080
And so, something like that, you know, if you try to map that over to this picture,

43:36.080 --> 43:41.080
then you get the idea that, you know, that this kind of evolution that you wrote up,

43:41.080 --> 43:46.080
a quantity talking about the universe of love, that it's maybe literally possible,

43:46.080 --> 43:55.080
and that that would be perhaps why we could see this remnant of a set of error-correcting codes showing up in the laws of physics.

43:55.080 --> 44:08.080
I found that very attractive picture. Going back to Charles Perce, the universe kind of gets into a habit.

44:08.080 --> 44:14.080
It got into a habit of expanding. It got into a habit of having gravitational forces,

44:14.080 --> 44:23.080
because perhaps the genome has made this a good fit for things.

44:23.080 --> 44:29.080
At least for some amount of time. But of course, there's always random variations.

44:29.080 --> 44:35.080
Let's say there is higgly, higgly, deeply in the universe. Things do change.

44:35.080 --> 44:43.080
And when things change, the laws that are the most adapted to it, you know, hang around,

44:43.080 --> 44:48.080
and the ones that aren't so well adapted to it disappear. That's kind of cute.

44:48.080 --> 44:54.080
Going back to this other thing that Jim said about mathematics is the only language.

44:54.080 --> 45:01.080
It just reminded me of a philosopher I can never remember the name of,

45:01.080 --> 45:07.080
but I read about that philosopher in some essay by Richard Warti. I can't remember.

45:07.080 --> 45:14.080
Richard Warti's name. And Warti attributed to this philosopher phrase, or the slogan,

45:14.080 --> 45:23.080
that the world is not sentence shaped. So, you know, you can write all you want about the world.

45:23.080 --> 45:27.080
The world itself goes beyond anything that you can write about it.

45:27.080 --> 45:33.080
I think it's Derrida. I think it was Derrida. It sounds like something you'd say too, right?

45:33.080 --> 45:37.080
I've been accused of being a doctor, I've lost it.

45:37.080 --> 45:40.080
By people like him.

45:40.080 --> 45:45.080
I was trying to share, well, I think he tried to, you know, whatever,

45:45.080 --> 45:50.080
write some sort of background or substance, his way of looking at Derrida's work.

45:50.080 --> 45:54.080
It was Victor Shine who said in the tractage, the world is everything that is the case.

45:54.080 --> 45:59.080
This was like the world is a world of facts, and too many people that suggested a linguistic picture.

45:59.080 --> 46:03.080
But then it changed a lot. He did it, totally changed a lot.

46:03.080 --> 46:07.080
It's not a popular view anymore, I think, that the world is sentence shaped.

46:07.080 --> 46:14.080
I was recently listening to a lecture by Nikal Gromov who was talking about evolution.

46:14.080 --> 46:20.080
And one of the million things he seems to have his fingers on is really incredible.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.080
And he said, you know, evolution is actually very stupid.

46:23.080 --> 46:26.080
You know, he just survived, died, whatever.

46:26.080 --> 46:33.080
But a lot of the models we use in creating computer models are, we often think they're brilliant.

46:33.080 --> 46:38.080
They do incredible brilliant things. And in some instances they solve problems that we use

46:38.080 --> 46:43.080
biological entities can't solve. It's much faster, for example, it's there.

46:43.080 --> 46:52.080
So one challenge to the idea that we're in a simulation is that things move along very slowly.

46:52.080 --> 46:58.080
They don't change suddenly with sharp ankles or, you know, and again, maybe that's because that's what we're used to.

46:58.080 --> 47:03.080
They change as fast or as slowly as we're accustomed to, and that's normal for us.

47:03.080 --> 47:08.080
But, you know, all of us are distorted. If the laws of causality suddenly changed,

47:08.080 --> 47:16.080
or there was some other kind of, you know, whatever, those sorts of changes would be possible for a simulation.

47:16.080 --> 47:18.080
I guess that's what I'm saying.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.080
Is that?

47:19.080 --> 47:23.080
I think the simulation might be setting up the simulation, like, why don't simulations,

47:23.080 --> 47:26.080
one in the time, overnight, test out the different levels.

47:26.080 --> 47:33.080
And then I hold back to, like, a million different simulations just vary the parameters in the laws of physics and so on.

47:33.080 --> 47:37.080
Let them, each of them run out. They have to come back in the morning, check out the stats.

47:37.080 --> 47:41.080
And then, and then I'll update, that's how the laws of physics evolve, by the way.

47:41.080 --> 47:46.080
It's like, okay, well, these ones produce interesting results, so let's focus in on those.

47:46.080 --> 47:52.080
But, yeah, no reason why they need to be paying so much attention to every individual simulation that, like, the laws are going to change.

47:52.080 --> 47:59.080
But I mean, what grounds do we have for drawing any inferences about what methodology the simulators, if they exist, are adopting?

47:59.080 --> 48:04.080
You know, we don't seem to have any sort of starting point to imagine what their purpose might be or what they're trying to achieve.

48:04.080 --> 48:09.080
So I don't necessarily see that we have good grounds in that scenario to suppose that they won't suddenly interfere,

48:09.080 --> 48:15.080
because we just have no possible understanding of what on earth they might be able to or what they're trying to do.

48:15.080 --> 48:20.080
It's true. God moves in mysterious ways, so does the simulators.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.080
I'd probably have to know the character.

48:22.080 --> 48:26.080
So maybe you can assume that kind of like us, and then you'll get one from the other.

48:26.080 --> 48:33.080
I mean, I just don't see how we have any way to narrow down the space of possibilities, if we allow that kind of possibility to start with.

48:33.080 --> 48:36.080
That's not a symbol like us.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.080
That's not a symbol like us.

48:38.080 --> 48:43.080
Right, well, we couldn't do that either. We couldn't assume that they're any, and assume they're anything like us, or if they are.

48:43.080 --> 48:47.080
Just kind of the crane from 26th time, and they'll opt for the secret.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.080
Right, exactly.

48:49.080 --> 48:56.080
Chris, as I asked earlier, whether is it possible we will find some sort of comfort in this?

48:56.080 --> 49:00.080
I don't know of the answer that either. Maybe they do. Maybe some people do.

49:00.080 --> 49:03.080
Others don't. Maybe partially. We all do.

49:03.080 --> 49:06.080
But we do know people find entertainment in it.

49:06.080 --> 49:13.080
But I know at least one instance where I think some comfort, evidence of comfort, was exhibited.

49:13.080 --> 49:22.080
So in 2008, as I said, I, in a group of mathematicians and physicists, found this very weird result.

49:22.080 --> 49:30.080
It took us three years to get the papers published, by the way, because we couldn't convince our colleagues that we had done our math correctly.

49:30.080 --> 49:38.080
But after a popular article appeared on this work in 2010 in the British Journal of Physics World,

49:38.080 --> 49:45.080
there was an online comment by a young man of deep religious faith.

49:45.080 --> 49:56.080
And he took comfort in this idea of simulation, because it matched his conception of a benevolent God at work in the universe.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
So some people would have taken comfort from it.

49:58.080 --> 50:03.080
You know, there's a cute story about Einstein. It may be apocryphal.

50:03.080 --> 50:11.080
Or it may not. You know, Einstein is known as the sort of arch-determinist.

50:11.080 --> 50:16.080
The universe is just happening.

50:16.080 --> 50:24.080
And that we really, we, as people, don't play an active role in the universe.

50:24.080 --> 50:43.080
It's a kind of fatalist. Anyway, the cute story is that if you trace his personal letters from the times when he was having affairs on his wife,

50:43.080 --> 50:48.080
that he would take a very fatalistic stance in personal letters.

50:48.080 --> 50:56.080
And then at times when he was on the street in narrow, he would not use that rhetoric so very much.

50:56.080 --> 51:02.080
So it looks like Einstein could find his own comfort in the idea of a fatalistic human affairs.

51:02.080 --> 51:08.080
Yeah, I had no choice. I had no choice but to have this affair.

51:08.080 --> 51:21.080
I think there are these studies that when people read articles about there being no free will, they're a little more likely to cheat, I think.

51:21.080 --> 51:26.080
That's a trouble made me do it.

51:26.080 --> 51:39.080
I was wondering when I would go back to the idea of information that was too faced, quality to it.

51:39.080 --> 51:47.080
I wondered, you know, Kant wrote a lot about how we apply a certain intuition when we look at the universe and see some things reflected back like space-time and mathematical facts.

51:47.080 --> 51:55.080
I'm wondering, because I understand, David, you've written some more about the extended mind, which is another sort of iteration of that approach.

51:55.080 --> 52:03.080
What can you logically derive from the fact that we are playing a role in how we see the universe?

52:03.080 --> 52:05.080
Do you want to say something about extended mind?

52:05.080 --> 52:11.080
Well, the extended mind is partly the idea that the tools we use become parts of our mind.

52:11.080 --> 52:15.080
So this is something we've all gotten so familiar with.

52:15.080 --> 52:22.080
So familiar with smartphones, the smartphone and store phone numbers probably taken over from my memory,

52:22.080 --> 52:26.080
it navigates for me, it does planning for me.

52:26.080 --> 52:29.080
And so one of us, we live these increasingly digital lives.

52:29.080 --> 52:34.080
So much of our minds is now extending out into these digital environments.

52:34.080 --> 52:41.080
In this new era, actually, it's the Metavos, where we're going to be pretty sure we're going to be wearing augmented reality glasses.

52:41.080 --> 52:44.080
It'll recognize people for us.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.080
We're going to have to remember everyone's names.

52:46.080 --> 52:49.080
That's going to be useful.

52:49.080 --> 52:53.080
And yeah, it's so much of the computing it's going to take.

52:53.080 --> 52:59.080
So then the algorithm between us and our environment is going to gradually become porous.

52:59.080 --> 53:05.080
And whether or not the physical universe is a universe of bits, our mind can at least some considerable extent

53:05.080 --> 53:11.080
a mind of bits, partly constituted by these computer processes in our environment.

53:11.080 --> 53:15.080
And then the mind in turn, of course, helps construct our sense of the world.

53:15.080 --> 53:24.080
That was the big idea for Kant, that so much of our ideas about reality come from, you know, in a constraint

53:24.080 --> 53:28.080
from the way our mind is built to interpret the world.

53:28.080 --> 53:35.080
But the way our mind is interpreting the world is actually constantly changing and evolving as our brain is changing a whole.

53:35.080 --> 53:49.080
And let me just say I really appreciate your making the distinction between a partial simulation, let me call it that way,

53:49.080 --> 53:55.080
and then the total simulation, because the partial one feels a little bit more comfortable to a physical scientist like myself,

53:55.080 --> 54:01.080
because I need to, as our colleague here said, I need to have the idea that I can falsify.

54:01.080 --> 54:08.080
And I write this as a great definition, one of the great definitions in science is that it's about things that we can falsify,

54:08.080 --> 54:13.080
that we don't actually prove things correct. What we do is falsify our belief systems.

54:13.080 --> 54:20.080
And as long as you'll give me that partial simulation, I'm comfortable doing that.

54:20.080 --> 54:24.080
However, there's another aspect to the metaverse that you keep coming back to that.

54:24.080 --> 54:37.080
I've been thinking about for a while, which is the universe, obviously, as we take these external instrumentalities and let them grow.

54:37.080 --> 54:41.080
And of course, there's this thing that you know about called the Internet of Things out there.

54:41.080 --> 54:42.080
Called the web.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.080
The Internet of Things.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.080
The Internet of Things is out there.

54:45.080 --> 54:49.080
It's all these smart devices that are embedded in things.

54:49.080 --> 54:54.080
They have already become co-evolving because of us.

54:54.080 --> 55:02.080
One can imagine that they will somehow internalize an evolutionary development of their own, that we no longer control.

55:02.080 --> 55:05.080
And of course, that's a frightening idea, perhaps.

55:05.080 --> 55:16.080
But when you start talking about things coming our mind going into things, you have to also, then of course, ask a question about those things getting their own mind.

55:16.080 --> 55:22.080
Not to mention all these AI systems, these language models, I think you guys were talking about here this morning,

55:22.080 --> 55:27.080
that have basically trained that on text, produced by us, all of the Internet.

55:27.080 --> 55:36.080
So they start from a basis of us and that they are internalizing elements of us, which they then project into their own mode.

55:36.080 --> 55:42.080
As these language models are going to be increasingly systems we're interacting with, that transient building of the world,

55:42.080 --> 55:44.080
started with us, extends to them.

55:44.080 --> 55:48.080
And of course, there's already the AIs that do art.

55:48.080 --> 55:53.080
We've been following these recent discussions of AIs that produce art.

55:53.080 --> 55:59.080
And I have to tell you, there's this one particular incident that I think we've already read about.

55:59.080 --> 56:04.080
Human artists in the competition, it turns out that a piece of AI won the competition.

56:04.080 --> 56:08.080
I don't know how many of you have actually looked at that image that lives through the winter?

56:08.080 --> 56:09.080
I actually love it.

56:09.080 --> 56:17.080
I mean, it elicits an emotional response from me, and I find that extraordinary.

56:17.080 --> 56:26.080
So the simulation hypothesis in this issue of the AI are in a way, on to this.

56:26.080 --> 56:39.080
In the simulation hypothesis, some other program or control network or creating the world theory.

56:39.080 --> 56:47.080
In the AI hypothesis is the computers and programs we create are going to be control.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.080
Because these three ways.

56:49.080 --> 56:51.080
Yeah, maybe both at once, right?

56:51.080 --> 56:56.080
Maybe this is a simulation actually put together by AIs in the next decade.

56:56.080 --> 57:04.080
And it's absolutely trivial to generate a simulation that we universe like this, because they have so much processing power.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
But I think they're right.

57:05.080 --> 57:09.080
They tend to be different ideas.

57:09.080 --> 57:14.080
Because if we are actually creatures of a simulation, especially if we're in a pure simulation,

57:14.080 --> 57:17.080
there's a sense in which we are already AIs.

57:17.080 --> 57:23.080
We are ourselves simulated creatures, in which case we say, took something in AI and spoke to a bird.

57:23.080 --> 57:26.080
David, have you met my friend Mario? And if you know him?

57:26.080 --> 57:30.080
Playing an AI hypothesis.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.080
His universe is the original metaverse.

57:33.080 --> 57:37.080
He's a very agreeable guy. He'll do whatever you ask.

57:37.080 --> 57:40.080
He seems happy.

57:40.080 --> 57:45.080
Have you seen three guides about video game character?

57:45.080 --> 57:48.080
And basically a non-player character in the video game, all the humans come in.

57:48.080 --> 57:53.080
He's like, hey, we, non-player characters, we deserve rights too.

57:53.080 --> 57:55.080
And this is real for us.

57:55.080 --> 57:58.080
Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

57:58.080 --> 58:09.080
The idea that we may evolve along with the development of these technologies is something I think has already happened.

58:09.080 --> 58:16.080
And we don't realize it because it's something that's been in the background.

58:16.080 --> 58:22.080
We talked about this in one of our earlier round tables, namely that our brains have not evolved, apparently,

58:22.080 --> 58:28.080
or are involved enough to account for the incorporation of sort of reading and writing centers in the brain.

58:28.080 --> 58:34.080
The brains of earlier humans before there was a writing system were essentially the same brains.

58:34.080 --> 58:40.080
But now we seem to have these modules of, maybe we should have a block about this too.

58:40.080 --> 58:49.080
They're the sort of nodules rather in our brain that are devoted to writing, reading, and sometimes one and not the other.

58:49.080 --> 58:54.080
So there are cases where we've adapted to these technologies.

58:54.080 --> 58:56.080
It's a technology.

58:56.080 --> 58:59.080
So the brain is kind of an all-purpose flower.

58:59.080 --> 59:04.080
It's waiting to be baked in any way that we might...

59:04.080 --> 59:08.080
The world may not be sent and shaped, but the brain is sent and shaped.

59:08.080 --> 59:13.080
Some little bits of it are sent and shaped, but things have to deal with language.

59:13.080 --> 59:16.080
It's what do you think?

59:16.080 --> 59:28.080
Well, I have to confess the tedium of discussing what the universe really is, is getting to me.

59:28.080 --> 59:35.080
Because I think we began with talking about what it might be.

59:35.080 --> 59:48.080
We have dubious access to our categories of understanding or the constraints, the autonomy with which the universe or nature, as you call it,

59:48.080 --> 59:59.080
unfolds, that puts us in a very difficult position, as far as being able to make any kind of knowledge claim about it.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:06.080
And I think the technological fetishism that has infected this conversation,

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.080
aiming to, my simulations have to be somehow technologically mediated, or the simulation devices.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:21.080
Well, at the same time, conceding that our brains are simulating things all the time by virtue of how we process information.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:28.080
We should also consider that we may be in types of simulation that have nothing to do with technology,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:40.080
that have to do more with our myths, the way we organize our understanding of one another, our acculturation.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.080
That also creates a bubble of reality, so to speak, a metaphor.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:01:05.080
That isn't it for bit or technological, but very cultural centered in the challenges of being ignorant, human, manipulated by power structures.

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:11.080
Those simulations are also important to consider.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:19.080
The mind's construction of reality is itself a kind of simulation mind.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:25.080
So much in the mind is constructed, because back to your point about calm.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.080
In a little way, it's not exactly the same idea.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:35.080
The thought itself is a simulation based on a computer.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.080
Our experience of reality is actually an interaction between the mind and between the mind.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:50.080
The world that our minds these days are so bombarded with so many different things.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:59.080
We try to construct things in a certain way, and technology is part of it, but by no means the only part of that.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.080
That's a quite different sense in which we could all be said to be living in a simulation,

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.080
but we're all living to some degree in a world which is constructed by our minds.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:18.080
And our minds, talking about psychedelics, can feel and see things under the influence of them completely differently,

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:27.080
so that the person feels totally different things about the world themselves, reality, than without them.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:36.080
So there are layers of what actually our mind and our perceptions and our reality really is.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:43.080
I think drugs in general can do that, in art, in conversation.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:52.080
Speaking of hallucinogen specifically, they have much like information to faces,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:03:05.080
and there's the way that they can conjure up cathedrals in the mind of new visions, new experiences,

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:14.080
and can be pleasing for a moment, can be potentially for some people entrapping psychosis.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:25.080
But they can also move in a very different direction, and dismantle the constraints of understanding of information processing

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:34.080
that allow us to organize the world to, you know, there's a notion in neuroscience of prediction coding,

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:37.080
and constantly throwing hypotheses out to the world.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:48.080
Our model of the world representing a best fit scenario, like an error correction, so to speak.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:57.080
But the errors aren't really with anything real, it's to just ensure a kind of coherent map.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080
So they can dismantle that.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:07.080
And the map that we've constructed for better or worse is torn apart, and there's an experience of something else,

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:13.080
maybe the other bad information.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:25.080
But there's a sense of something deeply unknowable, and that, speaking with David about this earlier,

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:37.080
the enough ability that often is described in psychedelic experience has also been correlated with much of the improvement

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.080
associated with them in clinical settings.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:48.080
So the other is opportunity, perhaps, to relate to what is, but in a way that isn't discursive,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:56.080
that isn't information-based, that is more primordial and relational, can represent for people who are struggling

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:06.080
with ossified modes of cognition, opportunity for making the way through the world in a manner that is perhaps less knowing,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.080
but at the same time, fear.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:17.080
Can I respond to the less of sentences?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:27.080
As I've been sitting here listening to this discussion, this strikes me as a typical discussion of one of the two minds,

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:32.080
because at least as I've experienced life, there's kind of two versions of me.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080
Here's the rational version.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:42.080
It's the one that basically does the science and asks the questions about the world and navigates my living, continuing to live safely.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:52.080
But I'm also very conscious that there's this thing that used to be called the subconscious, and at least in my career as a scientist,

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:58.080
I've actually seen these two things meet, and they meet on the axis of creativity and innovation,

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.080
because we do these new innovative ideas come from.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:12.080
And I point to, for example, the mathematician Ramanujan, who accomplished extraordinary things in number theory,

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:22.080
and if you ask him where they came from, he would tell you they came from dreams, and that is not the purview of the conscious mind.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:31.080
I was asking a few moments ago about, well, does it give people comfort to think about this topic, the idea of a metaverse?

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:36.080
And I said, well, I know at least it's entertaining, and it's interesting to consider, based on what you're saying,

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:42.080
and I also saw some people start using drugs to change their consciousness for entertainment.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.080
I mean, we actually call them recreational drugs, right?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.080
So that's one of their possible usages.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:07:00.080
I really was interested in hearing what people thought about, well, what is it about thinking there's another level of being that we don't have direct access to?

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.080
Why do people find that so appealing? I think that's a really important topic.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:17.080
I think for me, I mean, as a physicist, like Floss though, it's an important thing to remember, because I think if one assumes that the link between what is observed and what is there

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:23.080
is too direct that is liable to lead into a whole of confusion and misunderstanding about what the physics is really telling us.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:31.080
And so I think that as physicists and the scientists, one should not sort of lose sight of the fact that we don't see everything, we don't know everything,

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:42.080
and we need to be careful to ever say to distinguish between what facts are about our mode of access and what facts are about the world itself

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:50.080
and how to not sort of allow those two kinds of categories to get mixed up and cause mistakes.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:08:01.080
We do live in a, I like the importance of the unconscious, this kind of brings back that we do in fact live in a simulation quite regularly, you know, every night.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:19.080
We dream and we enter into a simulation of our own making, a furthermore simulation which is not generated consciously, it's generated by our minds, but almost entirely unconsciously, and then we interact with that simulation

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:32.080
and it's very often extremely real and extremely meaningful to us, that gets us out the power of minds, you've got to get the minds power to construct the world, but also the minds power directly construct the world, unconsciously,

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:43.080
and that's really an extraordinary creative power, and of course it's doing that every moment in our ordinary, in our ordinary, weaning life as well in our perception of reality, it's just so obvious to us.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:09:03.080
I like the idea of extending our thoughts to, I called it earlier, like a sort of an thought experiment, which may be one way of looking at the idea of there being a simulation going on, because there were, because of these mysteries, you know, like some folks like to spend a lot of time thinking about that,

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:20.080
and what are the consequences of my thinking along these lines, can I, can I come up with something thoughtful, creative, might actually move physics forward, but even if it doesn't, it's a way for me to think about the world, and it's, so it's an accurate creativity too, and occasionally something that comes a bit so we know

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:36.080
that I think it's thought experiments through history, I guess was one of the first to really say, I'm doing a thought experiment here, watch out, no, and no, this is creative, let me think about what it's like to sit on the light beam,

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:53.080
and that's a wonderful way for science to proceed, and it's not what do you call normal science, that's the creative part of science. So I'm really pleased that some people are willing to go at it and go at it and go at it, I think it's wonderful for all the rest of us.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:10:21.080
I think the question that's been haunting me is whether it is possible to know, so we've been talking about the very illuminating findings in physics, for example, that get us, I think, closer to the nature of how things might be, but

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:49.080
if we take very seriously, Kant's recognition that what we perceive and understand are invariably molded by things that may have nothing to do with the nature of things, that it may be an entirely human endeavor, understanding

01:10:49.080 --> 01:11:05.080
of which nature has really very little to say. What position are we in? Can we make any real claims about what the world is indeed?

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:34.080
I'm inclined to think we can't. I'm inclined to think that one can't, but I'm an American pragmatist, that's why I've heard some of the genuinely, that we do what works, or we try our best to do things, and I'm inclined to think that the laws of physics capture more about

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:45.080
our limitations, and going back to the evolution, how can the laws of physics possibly evolve?

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:58.080
One game you can play is to say, well, the laws of physics, in fact, are just an expression or a codification of all my various limitations, or us as a species.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:09.080
We can't help but fall. We can get around that, we can have a parachute, or a flying machine, we ultimately can get around some of these things.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:27.080
Well, we can't even get past the problem constraints we like. Maybe that's an expression of our present day limitation, but we are evolving species, and our limitations may be different in the future.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:36.080
Less limitations. So maybe the law of, you know, the speed of light as a constant is something that can be broken.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:56.080
If you just take a different point of view that the laws of physics are capturing how best to proceed the world, given what we've got right now, and that's not a knowledge plane, that's just a statement of more about us.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:15.080
Practical. I think that the connoisseur just made points to something that I try to keep in my mind, and that I try to tell people about science, that when a scientist makes a claim about some kind of ultimate statement, you should take that with an extraordinarily large grain of salt.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:34.080
Because we, in many parts of human thinking, there's this notion of the truth. I like to tell people, when you're a scientist, you will change your belief in the truth at the drop of a fact.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:54.080
So the word true for scientists generally is not what most people call the truth. And therefore, I think that we need to be very, very humble when we make proclamations that we know.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:01.080
We know subject to our limitations, and that's why I come back to this.

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:18.080
I definitely have a lot of sympathy for the view that the laws of nature may have a lot more to do with our limitations than we realize. But at the same time, I'm skeptical that that can be the whole story, because the very notion of a limitation presupposes the existence of some kind of like

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:33.080
rigidity that there are things we can and can't do, and those remain sort of consistent over time. And it doesn't really make sense to me that there could be such limitations if there's not some kind of background schema of laws or reality from which those limitations arise.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:47.080
So although I do think it's very important to recognize that the exact form of the laws we come up with probably have a lot to do with our own epistemic limitations, I don't think that means we should, we should suppose that there is no reality or there are no sort of background laws at all.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:15:04.080
I just think we need to be perhaps a lot more careful than we currently tend to be to try to sort of tease apart the threads of our science which are about our limitations and the threads which are about one of the sort of modal rigidity is which from which those limitations arise.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:17.080
Yeah, I think there is a world, there's a world outside of a question, and we can find out things about it on the world, you know, if you look at the world, you look away, you look back, it's still there, it fights back.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:27.080
The question is, you know, what can you know about it? We seem to be at least most something ever say, mathematics from science, we can know something about something of its structure.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:42.080
And so can we actually know its ultimate nature? I don't know, I mean, this kind of comes up and I keep out simulation and so on, there's, I'm the mathematics, I'm the big bits, there's so many different ways the world could be, could be consciousness.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.080
It could be another universe, it could be pure information, it could be pure bits.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:16:05.080
I guess I'm actually inclined, I think we occasionally get the little glimpses of the ultimate nature of reality, not least through our own consciousness, and maybe that's actually a glimpse of ultimate reality, and who's to say that they can't be special moments of awareness, whether through meditation or psychedelics, and so on,

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:25.080
that give you some clearer awareness of that ultimate nature of reality. I mean, it could be possible to know some tiny elements of this, but you know, as much as they sit in each eye, the galaxy, space is big, reality is big, it's bigger than us, we can't expect to know all of it.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:42.080
I think it's a sort of a mistake to want to answer the question, what is reality ultimately made out of? I think that's not the kind of question science really gives us access to, but at the same time I am optimistic that science does continue increasing our understanding of things,

01:16:42.080 --> 01:17:00.080
and there have been developments throughout the course of science that have, while not telling us what the world is made out of, at least giving us a better understanding of what that is structurally and sort of moving from our way of thinking things that we thought were different and absolute that we realised we're not so.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:09.080
So I think that we can certainly learn things about ultimate reality without necessarily learning what it's made out of or what the sort of fundamental stuff is.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:20.080
I'm still wrestling with something you said very casually, that there is a world outside of us. What do you mean? What would it be in my world outside of this?

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.080
There's a world outside of my consciousness, at least that is producing my consciousness.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:41.080
There's a bird, for example, the tree in the court, you look around and you come back, the tree is still there. The next day wasn't in my consciousness, where was it? So there's something, well, back for example God had the idea of the tree in the court.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:18:02.080
The next thing that I'm actually doing is that there's a bunch of matter out there. There's even the idea that it could just be another part of my mind or a cosmic mind that I'm all part of that's out there and it's responsible for my experiences of the tree, but at least there has to be something outside my consciousness to explain all these regularities, all these things that my consciousness discovers.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:13.080
It's also, I think, about intersubjectivity as well, the fact that we presumably are all conscious and we're all having experiences and we presume those experiences are related to each other in certain regular ways.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:26.080
The world outside is whatever it is that gives rise to the sit-on-related experiences and produces these relationships between our experiences that are kind of systematizable and relates to us to each other in ways that we can make sense of.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:41.080
And one of the follow-up and something Emily just said and also what you said earlier, Jim, that when you're doing science, you get this idea of truth that's different from the one you might have come into with as a naive, non-science, or just a young person, right?

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:56.080
That things like, well, what really is there in the universe and I think some of us, I think all of us probably agree, well, I don't know, that's sort of a woolly question and we don't take that seriously, although we do look like we're earnestly pursuing it in some strange way.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:13.080
I think there's one of the interesting responses to your comment earlier, Elias, was that about the nature being something that we're applying models of understanding that are not in nature, they're part of us, but yes, they are in nature because we're part of nature.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:22.080
I mean, to a degree, you can say something about that and maybe that's one way out of this, part of partial way out of the conundrum.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.080
I think it's interesting that we do always want to pursue things like, well, what really is there?

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:32.080
I think that's a human nature to ask that question and it may be a slightly childish question, I don't know.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:38.080
I think maybe it is, but it's still something that fascinates us all and maybe why we're thinking about the metaverse.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:53.080
So we have to stop now because I think I imagine there are going to be some questions from the audience and so if anyone has any, would they come up to the microphone?

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.080
Thank you very much for that fascinating panel.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:04.080
My question is about it from bits from it and artificial general intentions.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:15.080
You might become here with a concept, it's basically not narrow AI, but AI that will be a singularity and could be the metaverse.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:29.080
And then the point is that the it underneath is us and you said before that the it underneath must be God because it produces something without mistakes.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:35.080
Are we God and if we take that even further the metaverse will come to happen.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.080
I'm curious about the reaction.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.080
I missed the clip at the end, if we're God, then we just have fun.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.080
Each is basically all the collect intentions of all programmers.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080
Yeah.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:21:06.080
And they produce that illusion and we are living in because it's that the artificial general intelligence, which is basically the metaverse has basically the singularity that's based in the end station of AI.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.080
So this is saying AGI, this is the view on what AGI has already happened.

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:18.080
And the metaverse program was actually produced by an artificial general and how AGI is produced by us.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:24.080
So we are, or that the universe or the group of all programmers.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:30.080
If the simulation hypothesis is correct, we are already artificial intelligence, somewhere general intelligence.

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.080
So we'd be AGI is already inside a simulation.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.080
But I guess the thought is exactly the same could happen again.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:46.080
Once we create artificial general intelligence, which could happen within 10, 20, 30 years on current,

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:56.080
given the pace of current developments, it will then be in a position to create the metaverse and the full-scale virtual world far better than we are.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:03.080
So AGI is a possible route to the creation of metaverses of simulated universes.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.080
And we will be God.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:06.080
We hope you got four those universes.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.080
Absolutely.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.080
Yeah. We have to use that power responsibly.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
And not interested.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.080
The one we got.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:23.080
Yes.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.080
Thanks for this panel.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.080
I'm always excited to go to a panel where the question begins with, is the universe, whatever.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080
It's always going to be fun.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.080
I had the benefit of being able to sort of check on a few things that were discussed during the panel,

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:43.080
the first of which was Rorty. Rorty is, of course, famous for claiming that truth is sentence shaped.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:50.080
And I looked it up the idea that the world divides itself into sentence shaped chunks that we call facts,

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.080
is Rorty's critique of analytical philosophy.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.080
Which I think is interesting because it's an epistemological question.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:05.080
And as I was listening to this conversation, it seems to me that meta has come to me almost exclusively simulation or simulator.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:09.080
Whereas, meta can actually be used in a couple of different ways.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.080
One is, of course, to say that it's a simulation.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:17.080
And I think this question immediately becomes tedious because even if it is, it's still the same universe.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.080
Right? A simulation is always exactly equal to itself.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:27.080
So the way that you would test, you would always, how many layers of simulations of simulations would it go back?

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:28.080
It's an interesting question.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:37.080
But in terms of it not being so much ontological but epistemological, meta can also be used to be like the thing about the thing.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.080
So, a metacognition is thinking about thinking, metalinguistics is language about language.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:48.080
And this brings me back to John Wheeler, who was very interested in the idea that the universe is observing itself.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:55.080
So, is there a way in which the meta universe or the metaverse is the universe that observes itself?

01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:04.080
And this, to me, takes us back to the hard question of consciousness, which is to say is our consciousness of the universe already a metaverse?

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.080
Because it's the universe observing itself.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:25.080
I like that. I like that. And I don't know how to respond.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:31.080
I think a minute and do Jim's strategy of think about it for three minutes.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.080
And then maybe I can have a brilliant answer.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.080
I like the idea that meta, meta x is x about x.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.080
Metacognition is cognition about cognition. Metatheria is theory about a theory.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:49.080
By those lights, metaverse, I thought it's a verse about a verse.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.080
The first is a cross-thinking about the universe.

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.080
The term universe is the one crossing.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.080
So, the metaverse would be the thing that crosses itself.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.080
So, we're back to the self-replicit.

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.080
It means to the side of it.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.080
Maybe short meta universe.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.080
This is a universe about a universe.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.080
Another image that John Wheeler used.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.080
I mean, he's famous for having drawn a view for the universe with an eye ball on him.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.080
Oh, there's a lovely little spot in his.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.080
He always carried a big notebook around it.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.080
I take notes all the time. And in the margin, he sketches this.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:39.080
And he says, I'll have to explain the story of how this came to me two days ago.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:44.080
And then if you look at the notebooks, you can't find the story.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.080
We'll never know.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.080
But there was another image that he used.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.080
He wondered whether the universe was a self-excited circuit.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:01.080
And I don't know if that has something to do with what you're talking about.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:10.080
But he was thinking of it as somehow coming back on it's an ouroboros or something for a long time

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.080
and self-excitation.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.080
I actually think longer.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.080
Three more minutes.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.080
He only took two minutes, by the way.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:28.080
I cannot possibly come up with a good answer to that query.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.080
But I would offer this as a thought.

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:37.080
So I'm 71 years old. I've been studying a piece of mathematical physics since I was in my 20s.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:43.080
It's the same piece of mathematical physics that worries me now that were in my late 20s.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.080
And I've thought about the universe this entire 40, 40, 50 years of life.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:55.080
And to me, as we delve in these kinds of domains between philosophy and physics

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.080
and recognize the relationship between these two fields temporarily,

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:04.080
the honest thing I know about the universe goes,

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.080
apparently the evidence suggests it was started about 14 billion years ago.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.080
And this thing we call the Big Bang.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:16.080
It had this period where it blew up from something much, much smaller than Adam to this thing we live in.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.080
It underwent transformations in space and time, stars turned on galaxies formed.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:26.080
To me, the honest thing about the universe is that in this entire time frame,

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.080
it apparently only produces one copy of each of us.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:34.080
To me, this is extraordinarily mysterious.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.080
And so in trying to answer the questions about the metaphors,

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.080
what I have about Adam driven to is, in some sense,

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:49.080
why do I as an individual come to be in whatever this structure is?

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:56.080
To me, that's the deepest question that I know that I'll never have an answer to.

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.080
I think, yes, the idea that we are, that's another way of saying what I was actually trying to bring up,

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.080
distant for the end, and we are part of nature too.

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.080
So in that sense, yes, we are looking back on nature with our natural selves.

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:15.080
Any other questions?

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:23.080
There's a neuroscientist in Modafolina who talks about imagination as the physics of the mind.

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:27.080
And I find that so beautiful because it's about trying to grasp reality,

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.080
but also know about all the probabilities.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.080
I'd be so upset if we really understood everything about the universe,

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.080
because then what would we do with our imaginations?

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:45.080
And I just wonder how you experience the difference between your speculations and just the play of imagination.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:53.080
I'm willing to respond to that one as opposed to the hard question.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:29:00.080
So one of the things that, again, when I talk to the public about how science works,

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:04.080
starts with the statement that Einstein made, he said,

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:09.080
imagination is more important than knowledge. Many people have heard this statement,

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:13.080
but there's a sentence or two after that which, unless you read them,

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:22.080
this statement can't be mysterious. And it goes because knowledge encompasses all that we now know about the world,

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.080
but imagination encompasses all that we will ever know about the world.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:34.080
And so for me, one of the great joys of being a scientist is to understand that

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.080
my scientific knowledge grows, the rational part that we've talked about as physicists,

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:48.080
grows, but the driving force of that is imagination at the boundaries where we don't know things.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:56.080
It's imagination that's driving the growth of that, but subject to the hard test of nature.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:06.080
That's how we grow in knowledge. So without the imagination, that process stops.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:17.080
And imagination is deeply, deeply non-rational. It comes from the parts of me that I prefer one piece of music to another code.

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:24.080
There's nothing rational about that, but that's what's driving my rational growth as of being understanding this universe.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:28.080
And imagination may not only exist at the boundaries of comprehension,

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:35.080
it may be implicated in comprehension itself and how we understand things, the theories we formulate, what we construct.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:46.080
But it's that play all the time. I see theories have like fossilized imagination as something that's kind of got stuck in.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:56.080
This is an interplay between imagination and rationality, because one imagines world possibilities and one applies rationality to them to ask does this make sense?

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:03.080
How can this all fit together and one pairs down the possibilities that one has imagined to arrive at something which is a sort of viable theory?

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:09.080
So the two components come together to produce them as original, but also makes sense.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.080
Can't tell we imagine something else.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.080
And imagination is both, as you say, more than what we know now about the world.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:22.080
Maybe it's even more than we will ever know about the world, because imagination is not just about this world.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.080
Physics tells us about this world.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:30.080
Imagination tells us about the vast space of possible worlds that we can explore.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:35.080
There's so much to know about that space of possible worlds that goes beyond this world.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:39.080
Even if today, everything we've said is nonsense about this world.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:45.080
And we've still described the possible world, which a number of possible worlds are making that work.

01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.080
It's a way to solve it.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.080
Which I've recovered a million times.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:32:02.080
I want to pick up on what Dr. Gates said that in Jacques Hademard's book where he interviewed scientists, Einstein also said every idea came to him as an image, not as a theory.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:09.080
And it was only his desire to relate and communicate that forced him to put it into theorems.

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:17.080
I think that's so beautiful because it's about what you've all been trying to do today in terms of trying to relate to us.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.080
And tell us what you think you know and what you know you don't know. So I'm very grateful.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.080
Well, that's great.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.080
Well, I think it's a wonderful point at which we can stop.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:34.080
I hoped that it would turn out the way it did, but this did exceed my imagination. It was a wonderful, wonderful.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.080
And I'm glad there's that extra little bit of extra surplus left over.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.080
So thank you again, everyone. I hope everyone here enjoyed themselves as well.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:58.080
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:17.080
Thank you.
