WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
My current as well is something. My voltage is about the safety.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
The voltage is less because the average is less.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
It sucks. Yeah, no, he's saying the whole puncher is bad.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
He's saying that us people down here have...

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
No, too few. You're right. You're right. I need more holes.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
We're going to start. We normally have about 50 people in the audience,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
but since this is our first live meeting,

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
I think we haven't been able yet to publicize it enough so that the people who usually come are here.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
The idea for... I'm the director of the Center at Nursassian.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
The idea for these...

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Between the way also separates our second decade,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
and something in 2012, and then we accepted

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
to have five programs together. It was a pay because

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
it didn't have anything live for the Nurs

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
and the other Nurs and something that we sent to the center.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
We came to us by more than one of our friends.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
And...

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Elias Dockwarch. And then that coding

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
was an important subject and had many angles to it,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
and maybe we should have round tables on that. And Jerry Horowitz,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
who is the associate director of the Center, then took this and developed

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
amazingly five round tables.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And so today, this morning, we have the first of those,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
and then we have four more, two more this afternoon, and two

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
tomorrow. I want to thank all the participants

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
who volunteered to come here and have a conversation,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
and I leave it to Jerry to introduce everybody, and who we take on from this.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
Thank you, Ed. It's a real pleasure to be back here live

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
at the Helix Center.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Let me take a moment to introduce our

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
esteemed panelists today. I'll try to make this quick,

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
but it's certainly interesting to thought,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
maybe I can introduce the idea behind this talk, which I think is a little bit

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
unusual. So the theme of the conference is

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
overcoding.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I thought, when did the interesting start off?

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
What did we all come to the idea of what codes are,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
and what coding might be? I find that,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
and this I'm sure is true, a lot of ideas

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
are sort of being concretized now. That means one thing,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
which is sort of programming and coding, but codes have a long history,

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
and what their meaning is, I think, is fascinating.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So we'll take that up. So first,

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
Jorgi Bzaki identified a hierarchical

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
organization of brain oscillations and proposed how these rhythms

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
support a brain syntax, a physiological basis of cognitive

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
operations. His work changed how we think about information

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
encoding in the healthy and diseased brain, such as epilepsy and

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
psychiatric disease. Several laboratories worldwide

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
have adopted his framework and provided supporting evidence for the two stage

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
model of memory in both experimental animals and human subjects.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Bzaki is a big professor of neuroscience at

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
NYU. He is among the top 0.1% most cited

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
neuroscientist, member of the National Academy of Sciences,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
USA, member of the academia,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
European, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Michael Novichak is a curator and professor of paleontology

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
at the American Museum of Natural History and senior advisor

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
to the museum's president. From 1994 to

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
2021, he served as the museum's senior vice president

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
on Provost of Science. Awarded a doctoral degree

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Novichak studies concern

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
patterns of evolution and relationships among extinct

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
and extant organisms. His interests have range from the fossil

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
record to data on DNA sequences.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
He has led a participation, I'm sorry, he has led or participated

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
in paleontological expeditions in the North American

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Rocky Mountain region, Baja California, the Andes Mountains

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
of Chile, the Yemen Arab Republic, Argentina,

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Sahara, and Africa, Morocco, and the Gobi Deserts of Mongolia.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Karen B. Stern is a professor of history at Brooklyn College

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
of the City University of New York. Her research is deeply interdisciplinary.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
She studied classics with honors at Dartmouth College, her name,

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
her MA and PhD in religious studies from Brown University,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
and has excavated and conducted field research

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
in different areas of the Mediterranean, including Jordan, Greece,

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Tunisia, Morocco, and Israel. Several grants,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
fellowships and residencies from the National Endowment of the Humanities,

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Council of the American Overseas Research Center, and the Getty Villa

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
have supported her research which deeply deploys

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
methods from the fields of archaeology, anthropology,

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
epigraphy, history, and religion, and religion to investigate

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
the daily lives and mature culture of Jews and Christians

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
in antiquity who inhabited areas around the Mediterranean

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
through Arabia and Mesopotamia.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
David Salter is a professor of psychiatry, neurology,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
pharmacology, and at the School of the Arts

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
He received a PhD in biology from Columbia University.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
The lab has published over 250 studies on synaptic function,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Emory, UC Irvine, Irvine, and the Vatican.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Mark Vandemir Koop, oh sorry, Mark Vandemirup

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
is a historian of the ancient near East and

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Egypt from the beginning of writing to the age of Alexander of Macedon.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Besides teaching at Columbia University, he has taught at the University

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
of Oxford and at Yale University. He directs Columbia Center

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
for the Ancient Mediterranean. He has published numerous books and

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
articles on various aspects of the

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
ancient near Eastern history, Egyptian history, and world history

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
with interest ranging from socioeconomic and

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
political history to intellectual history. He has written extensively on historical

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
methodology as it applies to his field of study.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
In these writings, he aims both to present the materials of these fascinating

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
ancient cultures to a broader audience and to explore new paths of research.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
Okay. I think we're done.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
So, thank you very much.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
So, I guess I'd like to get started with my

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
premise of the talk, which is

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
if one of you or several of you want to discuss your ideas

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
of what coding and decoding means very

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
generally. Because each of you has a certain area of expertise

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
that goes into specific examples of decoding or coding.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I'd like us to start with hieroglyphs, the Rosetta Stone

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
anniversary stuff like that. So, that sounds good to me.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Actually, the ancient

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
languages and scripts that I may deal with are not the hieroglyphic ones from

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Egypt, but those from the Near Eastern, especially the first

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
system of writing every invented in world history, the Kine Forum

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
writing system. And there we see in

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
the right 30000 BCE, the invention of a writing system

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
that's quite different from what we currently use, the

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
alphabetic writing system, but a system that mixes together

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
science, multiple signs that indicate words for parts of

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
words. One of my things that I'm very interested in

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
is actually what that did to the people's

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
perception of the universe in which they lived. Because

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
in the way the conceit of the writing system,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
the way they conceived of the elements of the writing system,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
it was not in order to reproduce speech, but it was

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
in order to reproduce reality and

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
reality expressed in writing.

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
And because it's very different from the way we perceive writing

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
or alphabetic script, where let's say each character has

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
one particular value or has only a value within the

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
context of the other characters, but it's always

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
the say a letter B, as always something to do with the

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
maybe all impronunciation in speech, each character has

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
multiple values, values that can sound entirely different

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
from one another, but also that can have

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
different meanings altogether. And what you see happening

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
in this Knif form script is actually that

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
they play around with a written form of

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
anything, a name, or sentence, or something like that,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
and they reinterpret it using various

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
meanings of the various elements. Obviously this is not the case

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
for basic writings, but this is when you talk about scholarly

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
text, ritual text, that type of thing.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
So you can take actually a particular sequence of signs

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
and give them one meaning, and actually if you

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
give each of these signs a different, you know, different play around

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
with it, you can actually come up with exactly the opposite.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
So you get this, but seems to be, to us, extremely

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
confusing, but actually the depth there is a coherent system

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
that enables you to interpret things, and then

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
get an understanding of anything in the

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
universe through its written form.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
Well, would you say that there's more of an emphasis?

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
It's slightly less abstract in more material,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
let's say the material nature of the image

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
of these... No, it's actually nothing.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
So it's a very visual system of writing.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
The basic, and the most difficult thing to understand is that

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
actually each element within this system has multiple values,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
and if you, obviously there's an apparent

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
and immediate understanding when you read something,

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
but if you really want to discover the full truth,

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
the full value of something that is expressed in writing,

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
you have to consider these other options.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And so you can take a particular name

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and you can then interpret that name.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
I mean, when I said you can interpret it entirely in the opposite

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
that's, that it does happen, but that's perhaps too extreme.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
But you can actually see in the name of an individual,

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
let's say, of a God, you can find within that God's name

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
all aspects of the powers that God has

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
in the universe if you read that name properly.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
How did you feel

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
decoded, you can inform? How much a decoded?

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
Yeah, how did you understand what these various meanings

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
that each of these can ask? Well, sometimes they give us this information,

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
I mean, we have, I mean, they have scholarly material where they

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
it's not back upon their own writings and give

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
interpretations of their own writings. There's a long

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
textual tradition that goes on some 3000 years.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
And so we benefit from the fact that, especially in the

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
late appearance of this history, there are people who looking at

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
texts that have been produced in the past and who

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
make commentaries on these texts. And so there,

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
within these commentaries, we can see how they could take

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
certain passages and look at these passages and

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
give them various interpretations. So you're saying that there's

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
an unbroken tradition in Mesopotamia, which is very different

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
than the broken tradition in Egypt.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Well, no, this doesn't go into the modern era actually, the

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
interesting thing. So this system, you have to rediscover how to

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
rediscover it in the 19th century of the common

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
area it was rediscovered. And it wasn't, I mean, it was

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
already an accomplishment that said to be able to read its

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
kind of form text because it wasn't as easy as with Egyptian hieroglyphs where you have the

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Rosetta Stone, which gave you an ability to

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
understand this hieroglyphic science. But it was accomplished

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
that once we, you know, people were able to read this

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
text also, they became able to, scholars became able to read more

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
complicated text and figured out that they

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
themselves indicated sometimes, well, although you have

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
this particular passage, that passage actually can

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
have multiple meanings, or we can explain the meanings that that

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
passage has, by looking at how it is written out, not

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
by how it is pronounced.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
So, let's start with the basics.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
Coding is an agreement between the sender and the receiver.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
It requires a cipher. Without the cipher,

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
there is nothing. So information is not out there,

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
it's not in the sender, it's not in the receiver, it's a relationship.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
The information should be packaged and anybody who learns the

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
Morse code knows that packaging is very important because the stop

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
science, or you compute the language, or you can, in human languages,

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
you have to have methods to say, this is the

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
beginning, this is the end of the message, and this is the asset

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
which we call cipher. Without a cipher, you can never

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
break the code. Shampaleon,

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Shampaleon could decode

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
the hieroglyphs because he was given

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
the cipher, the Rosetta store, and that grounded

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
an unknown language to two known languages that he spoke, he spoke like

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
ten languages, he was equipped with the

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
way to discover things, all my credit is for him, but without

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Rosetta Storne, he would have no clue. Let's see another example, he wanted

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
to have examples. Alan Turing is well known, he is

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
the core, the core breaker, in fact he didn't break the code. He couldn't.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
The core, that is the cipher, was given to him

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
by the Polish intelligence service in 1939

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
by the Polish post office because they already had an enigma machine.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Actually, he got two enigma machines. The enigma machines

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
contain the key elements

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
of which you have to reiterate, reiterate, reiterate,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
the same method for Shampaleon, and many other

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
breakers used. Now, in the brain,

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
we usually read every single cognitive

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
science paper that the brain covers information. This is

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
nonsense because there is no information out there.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
Information is always a relationship between what's out there

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
and what is inside here. So, actually, without humans,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
I challenge you and say, there is no information.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
We make things out there and

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
keep it as information because we know and we create

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
the ciphers. Now, this is very general. You get the fantastic

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
particular examples. I'm interested in this

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
possibility though that this modern understanding of decoding,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
let's say where there's a key.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
The key, yeah, thank you.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
The definition of coding then gets to be, well,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
if you know the code, you know how to proceed to try

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
to unpack a certain sort of information.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
Decipher. Right. But we, I think

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
now have this idea that it's a way to be able to know how to speak the words

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
to just say them out loud. But I think earlier on,

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
it wasn't just simply a matter of turning it into an oral

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
format. Right. Does that fair to say that that wasn't exclusively

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
what it was about? That's exactly what you need to call.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
So, when I let, like to send a message, I can do it various ways. Anyways, can do it.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
By the way, you know, our obsession with about the human mind is just a very narrow

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
kind of an approach because

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
when you generate an artifact, it is a

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
message to somebody else. And the advantage of an artifact that it will survive you

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
and it can be given to many, many. So, it's a one to many communication

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
and forever. And it's very easy to identify human artifacts

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
where you go in the desert or anywhere you find anything

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
you say, this is natural or this is a human mind. Because we are sensitive

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
to those things that are required, the human mind's, and it's

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
ability to construct it. So, that kind of message

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
is what was, I'm sending messages

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
all the time with my eyes and my gestures and so on. Land beach

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
was an extraordinary human invention.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And of course, when land beach occurred, then

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
some of these guys around the table, including me, were very valuable

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
because they are the people who were the ones who accumulated all that knowledge

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
and carried the information. But when writing was invented,

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
that was huge. And then books were invented, that was huge.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
And so on. But it's basically an externalization of brain function

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
is sending messages to very signals.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
There is something that irritates me a lot. There are a lot of people

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
in my field to study. So, the origins of writing

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
and it seemed to, it would say it actually explicitly

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
it was not a big deal. Because as you're saying, there's a system

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
of communication pre-written or even in parallel

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
with writing a system of communication through visual images

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
etc or through objects and so on. And they're saying, well

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
writing is just a similar thing parallel and it doesn't really

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
affect the brain to, to, beyond

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
that's what you've been saying. In my opinion, it seems that

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
the invention of writing had a very radical impact on the

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
functioning of the human brain. And that it made the human brain

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
function differently. But I'm not, of course, I'm not like you are

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
specialist in this, that it made the human brain function differently.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
And what about people that don't read? Yeah, thank you. Please.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
No, just because I, I walk the materials that I work on from

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
antiquity are not necessarily sort of look at texts but I also look at

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
images because in antiquity as well as in modernity, not everybody

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
could read them right. So the fact that you have these

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
amazing, uniform texts, whether they're just like receipts of

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
things or more extended ones, it still requires specialization

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
to be able to, to be able to carve those

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
figures in those particular ways and to have that vast information

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
at hand and to be able to read it and process it. But sure,

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
we're not ever aware that simultaneous could do that. So for those who were able to engage

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
in the very specialized elite activities of the

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
production of these texts, surely it changed how they thought

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
and it sort of had a ripple effect on how society is organized.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
But for many people who couldn't engage in those things, right, it took

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
until literacy, however broadly we describe it, becomes more widespread.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
I think it, it probably, it's true. I mean

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
the way bring function might have developed would be different in accordance with

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
the relationship to those systems, by imagine. There are actually experiments

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
in India that are more illiterate

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
than needed and the people who were enrolled

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
in a two year school, they were monitored with fMRI

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
and they showed changes all over the brain almost. It's hard to point, you know,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
this is not a verne kind, it broke areas everywhere. But the remarkable

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
thing, I think this is what we have to realize that our

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
communication or cypher system is based on a generative

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
grammar. That is of course part of the, this, this vocal language, but

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
one was written, the key thing is that

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
how humans figured out in all cultures, 20 to

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
35 elements, letters, to describe

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
the entire knowledge of humankind. That's an extraordinary

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
achievement and of course it was not designed, I remember no smart people,

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
just the general smart people, and they devolved.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
And that's something that you can call human emotion

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
because no other species achieved.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
I think what your saying is very provocative. But I'm thinking

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
that if Homer couldn't read and write and Muhammad

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
famously could not read or write, do you think their brains are working differently?

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah. I do think so. You think,

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Muhammad who essentially wrote

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
or Homer that wrote all this wonderful material

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
that survives for thousands of years. He loved to be here. But he didn't, right? Yeah, but he didn't.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
Me too. But he didn't, and it was all sung, right?

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
And the Quran rhymes, and no wonder people, remember it.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
But still, I mean, it became written, but it wasn't

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
written by them. Christ didn't

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
write his stuff down. And yet, so you're saying that there was this

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
big transition in a way from

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
Muhammad to whatever, I forgot the

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
name of the person that described that started writing the Quran down.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
They would have two different kinds of brains.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Okay, all right. You're focusing, I mean, unfortunate.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
You're focusing too much on the alphabetic writing system.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
And there, this is the issue of the relationship between

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
oral and the written. And the purpose of the alphabet is to represent

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
the oral. Therefore Socrates thought that writing

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
was actually a bad thing because it took you

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
one step further back from truth. Okay. But

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
I'm saying, or arguing, is that

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
the kiniform right is system and a hierarchical right is system for that matter.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
They're not alphabetic. And so in the kiniform, which I know very well,

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
it's not, the intention is not to render speech.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
The intention is to render something

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
reality in writing. Yes, you can make a connection

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
to speech, but actually perhaps initially it was not even connected

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
to speech. Initially, it may be just, I mean, the earliest

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
text we have, there is no clear connection to speech.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
It is not a rendering of speech. It is rendering of reality

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
in a written form. That then

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
adjusts itself that when it comes to people who, with different

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
languages, who use this script to start including more and more

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
connections. Well, then I think what you're saying is the big jump isn't to writing.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
I mean, I know, I mean, well, facetious, but it's not to writing.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
It's to doing a form of writing that does reflect speech because the reason

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
we remember the Iliad or the Quran or

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
whatever is because they weren't done in written

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
speech with rhyme and meter so that people could retain it.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
So, otherwise they would have forgotten. I want to kind of get back to this idea

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
that at the origins of spoken oratory,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
but then I think especially writing,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
there was a little bit of a, it meant something to people who were not

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
good at oratory for starts. They thought these folks who could

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
do this, they were performers, they were special.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
And certainly once writing began, those who were illiterate

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
formed this gigantic sort of penumbra around the illiterate,

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
the literate folks, they saw a lot of these texts as being magical

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
but even though they couldn't penetrate it, they realized it was magical. It was something

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
magical about because there were experts who could derive things from it. So,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
it's wrong to think that it didn't have any impact at all on the illiterate.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
It was this group that was carried along with that.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
I want to say one other thing before I forget it about the brain function and that is

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
there are these interesting neurological conditions like

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Alexia where people cannot read from stroke and other sort of

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
brain knows a graphia where they cannot write. They often go together. They always go together.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
We know their brains are the same as brains of people before

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
there was writing primarily. Something happened

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
there was some transformation in their brain but it's the same brain and it's an interesting

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
sort of mystery. For me, the

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
perhaps fundamental distinction early languages and clearly writings is that

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
the speech is storytelling. It's mostly about what we call

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
episodic memory or episodic information. That is, I'm part of the

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
agent who is communicating. Whereas the

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
early Cunay for writings were very abstract. They were all about semantics.

27:40.000 --> 27:46.000
The semantics is of starting with counting

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
the number of bushels, the number of bags of

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
wheat and the number of sheep and so on. This is how the numbers

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
emerged as an abstracting because it was a practical

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
reflection of the activity of the humans who said

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
I counted sheep. Now, two years ago I was counting

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
doing something and the way I counted one, two, three, this is how the decimal system

28:08.000 --> 28:14.000
was did I, and things like that. Then all of a sudden it occurred to the person

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
that in Cunay forms, early Cunay forms, the

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
ten bags of wheat has different ten

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
than the ten sheep because they specifically referred to the

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
referred thing. Later on, somebody said, maybe ten is

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
something I can use in counting anything. That was

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
an explicit semantic information. Later on

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
when the landages became more complicated or complicated but

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
more useful, then the storytelling came back also in

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
written languages.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
One has narrative text relatively soon. It's relative

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
to the first, you know, written, you're talking about administrative

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
text and indeed they're the primary, they're the first things found

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
but we have narrative texts. Okay, 600 years later

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
admittedly, it's a long time on this. The one thing that

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
is very important in this, so indeed the administrative

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
documents are the primary documents found in the earliest writing

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
and this to me is very important. Alongside, there are lists of

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
words, lexical texts, or dictionaries

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
but they are actually in my reading of them, their study

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
of the written word. So it sees it

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
as it's not just making, well, what type of

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
sign, cuneiform signs do we have that we can use in administrative text

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
which actually takes, because they're visual signs and it takes

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
it and it plays around with them and come up with nonsensical

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
signs. You know, somehow they see that

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
there is an ability to create something, a reality

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
that is not connected to physical reality and that's purely

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
a written reality. Michael, what do you think?

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Well, I am. My interest come way before

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
language, I should say, and the work but I'm very

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
familiar with the need and the concept is

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
cipher. On one hand, I've been working for years, trying

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
to what we call reconstruct the tree of life and the tree of life

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
is an evolutionary pattern that now is

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
an extraordinary time, at least in the last decade

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
and a half, that DNA sequences and the genetic

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
code is part of that evidence to reconstruct the tree. But DNA

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
has certain limitations. 99% of all life that ever

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
existed on this planet is extinct. And so

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
for those fossils, except with some very few, and my

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
friend Sponté Pablo, just won the Nobel Prize, his

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
work, you know, except for those exceptional

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
circumstances where the code has actually been recovered in

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
human fossils or things that are mammoth

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
skin and so forth, things that are very quite young, that

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
fossil record is really, really out of the

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
scope for DNA. So we have to rely on what actually

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
happen, the fossils that we find, and that

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
as Darwin recognizes, is an incredibly inconsistent

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
and spotty record. But you mentioned cipher and I think

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
what we have are cipher,

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
what happens in the advance of recovering this history

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
is the discovery of a cipher. So, and indeed

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
almost, it's almost a platitude you see occasionally

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
where someone will proclaim, oh I have this early hominid

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
fossil, it's the Rosetta Stone for human evolution, you know?

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
Everything is a Rosetta. But the reality is there are

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
ciphers, once in a while a fossil is an extraordinary cipher.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
For example, Archaeopteryx, their earliest bird,

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
shows the definitive characters of both dinosaurs and birds.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
And it's only in the last five or six, well

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
the last decade that we've come to recognize that

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
birds are not only related to dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs, they're just

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
a branch of dinosaurs. In fact, they're a branch of theropods

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
that are related to Tyrannosaurus, an overrafter, and a lot of things

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
that we've collected in the Gobi. So, you know, that's our cipher.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
It was a combination of characters which was recognized by Richard

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Owen in the early 20th century. He said, hey look, this thing

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
has some dinosaur-like characters. You didn't go much farther than that

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
than a John Ostermet Yale went a little further and then

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
people like Jacques Cotea and Mark, my colleague, really

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
you know, expanded on that. And so

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
it's, I think, we're always searching for ciphers, you know,

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
in the fossil record. And there aren't too many.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
You know, it's a very rare event. That's why

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
there's so much attention paid to it. I think speaking for

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
the audience, can you say a little bit more about why birds are dinosaurs? That's really

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
pretty intriguing. Well, the

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
skeletal structure of a, if you, as

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
Richard Owen observed, if you strip that arkyoptic skeleton

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
of, you know, it's preserved in this incredible

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
way in the gerolimestone with impressions of feathers. And if you

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
strip that off this

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
animal, it looks like a small theropod dinosaur.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
And it's hip structure, the orientation of the

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
pubis, the lower limb and the

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
very, very characteristic of a subgroup of dinosaurs, the

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
peripod dinosaurs, with the long claws and the extended

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
digits on the foot, and

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
a whole variety of other characters. So, and

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
of course, we discovered in 1993

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
with this very incredibly rich sight in the Gobion, and away

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
this sight, which we named Uka-To-God, the whole sight is a

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
cipher because it's preserved

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
hundreds of skeletons of dinosaurs, little mammals and lizards.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
And compared to what we have

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
and what we found in Mongolia, in

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
North America, a lot of those animals, especially the smaller ones,

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
are represented only by isolated teeth and jaws.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
We knew nothing about what they look like as whole animals.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
We called those fossil spare parts because, you know, you have to

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
put everything together. Well, we discovered that

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
these overrafters were nesting.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
We discovered the first nesting dinosaurs, and they were on a clutch of eggs,

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
and the eggs were always in an architectural

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
arrangement. And these dinosaurs

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
were capable, just like birds, of parental

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
care of their nests. So, there was once in

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
place, there was a window open to dinosaur behavior that

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
we never expected to find, once again, that kind of

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
and once again reinforcing the relationship between these

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
dinosaurs and living birds.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Just to amplify this point, how important this to have

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
a key or a cipher, the

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
ciphers lead to game-changing ways,

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
and the framework through which we see the world. As an example,

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
our effects on the philosopher introduced

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
a term called Alan Vitale. Nobody knows the young people

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
I'm talking about. Alan Vitale was the most

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
critical thing in the two centuries ago, because

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
it was impossible to explain

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
or conceive how from a seed you can make a tree

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
or a woman sperm you can make a human.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
That must be a driving saw. Alan Vitale is a

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
drive of life. And it led

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
nowhere. All of a sudden DNA came around, it was a game changer.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Nobody talks about Alan Vitale anymore. Everything is explained, because

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
we shifted to a different framework from where things are

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
explained in a self-explanatory manner. Well, precisely, Darwin had

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
his theory of natural selection as solid,

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
but his mechanism for it is completely wrong, because he didn't have

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
that cipher. But I want to make a point about ciphers, because the

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
cipher you referred to earlier, Jorgi, about

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
the Rosetta Stone, was an explicit like this equals this,

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
that equals that. There has been the

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
ciphering that's going on here, clearly there's no key. There's no explicit

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
key in what you're doing in paleontology.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
There are other methods that people have that try to make some sense

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
of decoding what is going on. So there's frequency,

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
the chronology, things of that nature. And also, am I wrong

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
about this, so linear B also was decoded

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
without an explicit key. Yeah, it is the code in the right.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
The frequency of the appearance of certain units, elements

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
in the language, is used as a kind of a way to build up a key.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
How often in the information being imparted

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
does what we think which would be, the letter E appears much more

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
than other letters, the letter Z, not very much, except in your name.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
And mine is this part of it because everything

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
in nature is log normally distributed. The edges are the right end of this

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
q distribution. Exactly. No, but those sort of frequency

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
analyses and chronologies do help to build up

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
a sort of a key which doesn't necessarily, well, which is the best we can do.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
But in order to do so, don't you need to have an understanding

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
of the general structure because indeed the letter E is

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
more common than the letter Z within the structure

38:36.000 --> 38:42.000
of language. And those are the three words that are frequently used,

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
but not really changing or changing much slower

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
over the time of humankind. So they give you a language

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
when you are looking for common words in

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Finoyuri for example, then we have a bunch of words

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
that are very basic and frequently used over centuries

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
such as blood, fingers and so on. And the rare

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
words are changing meaning a lot. Many Greek words

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
are used today in a totally different connotation, like

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
empathy. Everybody knows what empathy is. The real use in Greek is called

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
disgust. So all these

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
transformations happen because of the way how we

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
use language in everyday life. And these numbers or the

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
frequency distributions are very important tools to dig out

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
what are the common and what are the unique elements of changing

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
language. Also I think you need a context for interpreting

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
the key to recognize that key. So just thinking

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
back, forgive me about the fossil record,

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
there had to be, someone had to present

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
the idea that these things took place

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
over enormous amounts of time and that was a huge controversy. There was

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
an evidence directly for the age. We didn't have radiometric

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
dating or anything like that. There was basically

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
a concept of time with

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
being in this enormous expanse. And it

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
was rejected by most intellectuals of the time

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
until it finally took hold. So you needed some kind of

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
context to interpret even those

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
fossils, those cypress people were finding fossils during that time.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
And thinking that maybe they were

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
casualties that didn't make it on the arc. So

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
you had to have some kind of context for interpreting the cypress

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
in the beginning and then first place.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I appreciate to imagine it as a type of patterning

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
to the types of materials that I work on

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
and the way that I work on them. There is no cipher because I'm

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
approaching it from sort of a cultural angle. So some of these

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
things resemble letters and some of these things resemble pictures. This really

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
just paying attention to the precise spatial context and sort of

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
broader practical context. And looking at patterns in the distribution that

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
enabled us to sort of create some sort of framework but interpreting them

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
because otherwise there is no interpretation. It's not, you know, they're not

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
words to represent something necessarily. What are those texts that you're referring to?

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
A lot of my research is on graffiti in Aramaic

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
or Greek in Syria and

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
the antiquity or the Middle East. And ways in which, I mean

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
to sort of park them back to us. You described it these

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
ways that people produce artifacts. We just don't know necessarily what

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
they're trying to communicate sometime except the patterns

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
and their distribution can be helpful. If they're graffiti and burial caves or

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
in places of prayer or worship or something like that. But

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
these are humans who might not have been able to

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
write a record of how many sheep or how many, well maybe

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
if it was a very limited vocabulary they could, but they're trying to express something.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
I mean they're trying to commemorate a moment, an idea

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
and it's sort of trying to get a sense of what, why they're creating this sort of

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
artifact of presence or ideation or something.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
How do you know you are writing? I don't. So because that's the, without

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
the cipher you have a consensus approach.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
That was a wonderful expression of burning man that I often use.

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
That reality or the truth is what we all dream about together.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
That's a wonderful expression except it's useless

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
because everything that we would like to define

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
has to be grounded one way or another. I have to communicate that

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
grounding to other cultures because other, no, your classic

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
or any classification can happen only from a point of view

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
from a classifier's point of view. Now we have, it can be classified in millions

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
where it's, you know, you have a beard, you have short hairs and so on.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
That's really nice. So that kind of

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
classification is useful and then somebody comes in a different

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
framework and said, for sure. But then

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
you could say, well Ben what do we do? Do we just need to laugh?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I absolutely, I think that's why it's important to

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
create a sort of record your own framework of interpretation.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
As long as we know that we are in a temporary

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
particular mindset, then it's, then it's okay.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
This shouldn't bring us to time because you just

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
mentioned that people don't have, didn't have the concept of

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
very long time because human perception and

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
animals perception is based on this cute rule that

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
10,000 years for me is the same as the million years.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
There is no way I can.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
When I was a boy, as a kid, I was

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
obsessed by this issue. I just didn't understand

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
how you could understand time. And my parents took me to the

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
Grand Canyon. And I said, oh wow, I think I finally

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
got it because this is this immense place.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
And it starts the bottom of the canyon. It's pre-cambrian

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
rockets, goes back billions of years. And then it goes to the top.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
And then I realized the youngest rocks in the canyon were 200

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
billion years old. The stuff at the top. So there was even more.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
I just, I can't wrap my head around that. And I still think,

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
even though we can date those rocks and even though we can

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
recover these lost communities and so forth from

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
eons ago, I still think

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
we don't quite perceive what that means.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
We don't know what that means.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
As a young boy, was somebody like humans

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
200,000 years ago. We had a vague concept

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
of space and time which meant that we are, nobody is in this universe.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Just tiny little things. And there is this huge thing.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Science approached it, well,

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
space and time became scientific concepts as

45:30.000 --> 45:34.000
editing us when we started measuring them. So space was

45:34.000 --> 45:38.000
replaced with distance, time was replaced with duration,

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
and then we came to an agreement with measuring instruments

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
such as the rod and clocks. Without such externalization of brain function and

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
a universal agreement on things, space and time

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
is nothing. If you continue discussion, I will explain you that there is no space

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
at no time. But, and indeed, once you

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
started to look at those stratifications, those are concrete.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Those could be looked at. And then you look at the physical

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
process, or not you, but geologists have said, the evolution

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
of this is this long, according to

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
biometric, then you have an agreement. Well, while

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
you know, looked at those rocks, and then

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
it went down to a beach or a river,

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
and it's, well, wait, I can see in these rocks these pebbles

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
are streaming out. I can see these things forming. Now,

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
let's see how long that takes. And it went out in the beach and nothing happened.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
You could sit there for a month. And then you saw a little bit of sand

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
being deposited on a sandbag.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
And so he said, hey, this takes a huge amount of time

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
to create what you see here in this rock record. Yeah, I want to

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
go back to something Karen just said earlier, you challenged a little bit,

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
and I'm just going to talk a little bit about how do you know,

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
how could you confirm what you're seeing when you look at these

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
archaeological things, and you said, well, it's true.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
A consensus gets built. And you tell your story,

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
your account, the best you can, and then you wait to hear what sort of other

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
colleagues and experts in the field think, and you slowly build it up. Okay, to me, that's what

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
language is also to, isn't language a consent, or we think

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
language itself forms as some sort of social thing. Everyone agrees

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
that we're going to use the word red, whatever the original

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
wrote, whatever the original red was, that we all kind of get into

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
this consensus. And interestingly, that seems to give the

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
semantics to meaning, right? So you can say, well,

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
what you're doing right now seems to be a little

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
in co-ed maybe, at worst. I don't think it is, but you know,

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
it may be it'll come closer and closer as consensus, and it might go down the wrong path.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
The consensus may be this in a long direction, and that's

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
just what you're dealing with. But I think there's something lost in that, because

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
the next topic I'm interested in talking about is, well,

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
is there anything lost in changing to the thinking of things being

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
all a coed? Like, do you miss something? Because it's

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
reductionistic to a degree, right? You know? You only miss tons of things, because

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
again, we are human and landmen

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
chauvinistic. But we can look at the same problems with a different direction.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
So semantics or explicit knowledge can be derived in

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
all animals one particular way, which is my own experience.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
So one, I have one experience, I have another experience, another experience.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
And from those interactions or intersections of those experiences,

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
something becomes explicit. That is

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
the events are stripped off from this

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
spatial temporal conditions, and it may become

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
explicit. When I've seen a first dog in my life, I said, it's an

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
episode, it's an experience. I see another dog and another dog, and then I created

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
the explicit knowledge of darkness,

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
and I know what it is. Now, this is fantastic.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
Humans with landage have another way

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
of producing semantics, which is, ticks are given to you

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
by an authoring, such as your parents, such as your teachers, and so on.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
They said, this is a USB. This is an iPhone.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
And I can use it because I was told about the utility

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
of that thing, and it goes along for a long time, and I

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
have no reason to go into it, even though I don't know what's in USB. I don't even know what

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
USB stands for. I just know what this is. So humans

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
can give, there's a little

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
funnel here, and then pouring a lot of knowledge into the

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
head of a newborn, a child, because we can

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
do, and people who cannot generate episodes in their lives that are people

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
without people can pull systems, they still

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
can get around because they have this enormous freely

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
given semantic information. The catch is this,

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
because it's not your experience. You don't go through the verification

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
process. You don't ground those things. And then I start believing that

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
I'm a good Democrat because this is my framework.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Or I'm a good Republican because this is my framework, and I never

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
questioned my framework because that was given to me. I never questioned those words

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
that were given to my teacher, my priest, or if I have one, or

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
or authoricists. So that's an interesting

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
thing, and that's why I say that when we

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
split things to

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
it's, or carve nature by its

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
joints, and we are trying to go, this is the only time when you have to think about that

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
seriously. Where everyday violence is not a big deal. You know, culture is not a big deal when we are

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
classifying this and that, but when we are going to the roots of things,

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
then this is the key to think about, and this is the

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
key to think about it. Absolutely. It needed the approach for space and time as well.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
I'm going to go back with this issue of language because

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
we have to get to exact term that he uses, but now I'm Trump's

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
case, idea of other linguistics is totally different from what you're saying.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
It's not something that is taught to us, language is not taught to us, but

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
language is somewhat inherent into the human being

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
as a species. I'm afraid I can't. I mean, I hope

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
I'm not talking about something that is totally

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
alien to you. I thought you all thought you'd say. No, no, you just brought up a can of worms.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
It's going to go way longer than two hours.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
I should have not. Yeah, not a lot. I mean, happy to get into that, but

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
maybe briefly. Really briefly? I mean,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
for me personally, in my own work, I sort of dismiss all of that.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
There are all forms of animal communication

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
that have nothing to do with those roles.

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
And then it becomes, for me, very, very arbitrary

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
about what we call language friendly. I mean,

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
the Consul Batcha Cup studies, have you ever read these things?

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
These are fantastic. This is a spell he just retired, but

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
anyway, he studies prairie dog communities in

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
Arizona, and the different communities have different

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
communities. To us, they just sound, they're 100 milliseconds, right?

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
And so to us, they all sound the same. But if you simply record them

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
and slow them down, you find out that they have

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
different meanings. One of them will mean

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
the coyotes coming from that direction. He even

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
did experiments with graduate students wearing different color

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
t-shirts, and they were able to assign

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
a call to each of the colors that the graduate students used to.

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
And they were able to distinguish one of the graduate students in a different

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
way, even if she was shorter than all the other ones.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Those useful graduate students. Yeah, yeah. And then he would do things like

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
shoot a rifle. He'd shoot a rifle off on the side, and then they would develop a new

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
vocabulary for that. So, yeah, no, it's fantastic. It's great work.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
Is it language? But in this case, wait, isn't

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
that analysis based on looking at

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
a stimulus and then the frequency of the response?

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
Like, it's a little bit of a syntactical analysis, because you're talking about the

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
formal aspects of those sounds. And that's exactly what we do when you

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
try to decode a script that we don't know, right?

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
I don't think it's inconsistent with, I'm not a Chomsky fan either, but I happen to think

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
that's not inconsistent. You could say, well Chomsky would say, yes, but in humans,

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
the way language forms, the formal aspects, syntactical

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
aspects, have a certain form, and we can rely on that to do an analysis

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
of the difference. So he would exclude that as a language,

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
and I just frankly stay out there. Yeah, yeah.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
And use the word language, like when you're referring to

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
prairie dogs or dolphin. He would use the language. Well, I would use communication,

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
mostly because I don't want to get down that road of defining

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
languages, because to me, okay, this is what I really think.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
I think that a lot of academics like to use

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
languages a way to differentiate our species

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
from all other species. Right. And so I just don't want it.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
I don't want to have to do it for them. I think it's a waste. For me personally, it's a waste of time.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
I don't think anybody has that. There are very few landmages

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
that landmages completely human. Yeah, but no M does.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
He still says it now. No, you're he still says it now.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
I know, but then he has a lot of followers

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
in different departments. It's like you were saying

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
some, the what

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Vita, it's like if we were still arguing about

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
getting the homunculus from the semen into the

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
egg. I mean, it's just something I want to put aside.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
I agree this as a prominent person, but I think any linguist would agree that

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
communication is a better, perhaps more general word and

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
I can communicate with my dogs by cats and

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
there's no question that we communicate or they communicate with each other.

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
Do they have syntactic arrows? Yes, they have.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
Do they have the same land with Gs? And we know that birds have also

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
some of the most complicated things like questions.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
The French dogs communicate differently than American dogs.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Different language? So, let's say interesting

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
thing that brings me back to my

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
my,

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
my, what says it funnel that

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
we put a lot of stuff into our brains is because, interestingly, there is a

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
big

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
key for humans or big discrepancy between

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
knowledge of humankind and the

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
individuals share. My share of human Christ knowledge is extremely ridiculous.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
And it's getting worse and worse and worse obviously every day.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
Now dogs, they are not going to be

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
very good today. Now dogs, from anywhere

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
they have pretty much the same knowledge of

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
the kind, anyway, in the world. Do they have

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
cultural differences?

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
There might be localities. Are there

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
cultural inheritances in animals? Yes, there are. There are no monkey groups

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
in Okinawa. These are rizous monkeys. They wash potatoes.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
And once that, that tradition is

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
gone, then perhaps it's gone forever.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
There are many cultures that, like the

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Tasmanian cultures, like the Icelandic

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
cultures and Greenland, that cultures, they all disappeared because

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
the people who had the knowledge died and

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
then they couldn't make new canoes. They didn't make arrows

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
and things like that, all of a sudden, that civilization

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
just disappeared because of the lack of this knowledge.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
I have to tell this story, mostly because it's amusing, and I want to

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
move away from having this roundtable devolve into a talk about animal consciousness

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
which we love to do here at Helix but we're good at.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
The story which may be a good segue is, there was a study about

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
cats looking into whether cats understood their names.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
I think this is just a wonderful story.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
As opposed to other words, they might hear. So they do an MRI of the cat

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
and they call the cat's name. And sure enough, the researchers found, yes,

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
cats can distinguish their name from other words, spoken to them.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
They just don't care. Yeah, that's right.

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
So, it's really funny, but it does say something about

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
what then do you do?

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
It's really, the cat's decoded tabby.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
It's decoded it. Some part of his brain, anyway, seems to evidence

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
that it's been decoded. But then what does the cat do with that code?

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
Is that creates a meaning for the cat, right?

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
No, I love that story because they really don't give a damn and it's very interesting to me

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
to be around people that are trying to decode, for instance,

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
the SETI group, which you probably read about this, trying to decode

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
the whale song by doing deep learning and the fellow running

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
that says, well, we just need more data. That's all we need. And it's

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
nonsense, frankly. I mean, God bless them for doing that and I'm glad somebody

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
else is doing it. But Roger

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
Payne, the fellow who discovered whale song, he tried to

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
you know, he's done over 50 years

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
of following the whales and interacting with them as well as we can.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
And he was trying to imagine what the conversation would be and the conversation would essentially be,

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
okay, where's the food now?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And I'm tired of smelt.

59:38.000 --> 59:42.000
Give me octopus. I'm tired of smelt. And that's the kind of,

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
and this also reminded me of

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
conversations with Oprah Chernofsky, who you probably know is a bird scientist.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
And he says, you know, he spent his life around these

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
songbirds and he says, you know, they really think

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
we are very slow. I mean, we can't possibly catch them,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
and we're very stupid. And the stuff that we worry about is just

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
nonsense. And I think that's right. I think we're going to put a little bit...

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
He's absolutely right. And you're right with yourself. In our field,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
COVID-19 neuroscience, neuroscience, we made this mistake all the time because of our inheritance.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That is, we are giving the world

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
to the brain. We are recording from the brain something, such as firing

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
or fMRI singles, and then we find a relationship.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And we think we are decoding the brain, and you

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
have only been New York Times. The fact is that their message

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
is message only for outside observers, because only the

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
outside observer has the luxury of seeing the outside world and what's happening in the brain.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Neurons in the brain have no clue. They don't know if there is

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
anything outside. The only thing they have is the activity there.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So what comes into the world, there has to be grounded. It has to be

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
connected to something that something has.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000
You have to have a second dominion. The only thing that's available for the

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
brain, that is for us as humans, also is through our

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
actions and our verification of things.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Others, those are... Our things are verified independently.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Everything is just a consensus.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That doesn't really help us at all.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
So, you know, when it comes to

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
communication, so brains work some... We use a lot of imagination,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
but that has to be looked at. And I can give you many, many examples that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
we have tons and tons of misunderstanding. Once you start recording from the brain

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
and you ask whether those patterns that we thought were

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
going to be authentic, these things, actually means something to the brain.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
If you don't have that grounding knowledge,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
you know nothing. Well, a good way to think about that would be, in this

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
goes, returns to Shannon's discussions about information.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
You know, and he made a very strong effort to say, look, this is

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
not information in the sense of like knowledge. It's not meaning.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
It's just how you get the code. There's a code for the information,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
right? And it's just imagine

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
a signal comes across a wire or the airwaves and it's the word

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
dog, right? Okay, dog. Now, that's wonderful.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I heard it. It's the word dog. Now, why is it then, then, if I

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
want, I can go to the library or I can think of myself. I can write an essay

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
on dogs about all of my experiences and thoughts about dogs. I can

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
write a poem. I can make a song. I can write a song about dogs, right?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And so, and those individual expressions of mine will be,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I hope, rich and elaborate. And it goes well beyond just the

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
single word dog that the information came along, but it doesn't have the

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
full richness of dogness for me, right?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And I think that's an important... But it doesn't. It's just a few. Yeah.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Because you represent... Right, but the code

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
only provides a key to triggering that sort of,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
you're saying there's a context into which these codes

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
find themselves and then the rest has to do with the way the

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
humans respond to it. That's why I was saying earlier, if a

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
illiterate looks at writing, especially I think back

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
in the ancient times, it would have a very strong

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
meaning to them, although it was not the explicit meaning that the code

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
seemed to be trying to convey, right?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So, back to the notion of the cipher, you know, to my mind,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I think what ciphers are, they are

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
the means of falsifying consensus.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
And there's so many classic examples of that. I mean, plate tectonics,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
everybody thought continents didn't move. And even though

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
there was a concept for moving continents,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
it wasn't really... It didn't really falsify consensus until

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
as examples of real science brought up here,

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
paleomagnetic reversals,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
patterns on the ocean floor showed

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
actually that the ocean seafloor was spreading and these continents

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
moved. So that happened almost a century

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
after the concept of continental drift.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So the cipher, the key was

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
paleomagnetics and it falsified

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
what most scientists believed at the time. And the Russians still,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
some of the Russians still believe that continents still move, but

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
it's an exceptional community.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
There are these paradigm shifts, okay?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And we should, I mean, I think we shouldn't be too arrogant

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
into believing that now we have found that. So, it was a

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
century or next year, you will find some, you know,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
some other revelation that will create

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
a different type of idea. I'm in a field with violent arguments

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
about this because I keep encountering and

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.000
in combat with, say, genomics people

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
who say, now we have the true tree. We know exactly

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
what was related to what. And I'm in a

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
school or a group of people who say, we don't. We may never

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
have the true tree. I'd be very much like in technology.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
She were describing. Have you read

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Integral Tree? No. This is exactly about

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
the darkest tree and today's different branching and how you

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
classified all ocean in different ways. It's an extraordinary

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
good, you know, time vessel, this thing.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's still very good. I think one of the reasons

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I was interested in coding is I feel, in many ways,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
we were in this sort of paradigm of computers being the answer to everything

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
we're going to apply, a computer model to understand every

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
phenomenon we come across. And I thought, well, I'm interested in coding

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and I think it's not all a bad thing, but I feel there's some

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
a little overreach. Well, isn't it because

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000
in medicine, it's everything's genetic.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Oh, I wouldn't say that. But there's a lot that's genetic.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yeah, but then you see I have identical twins, which are except for

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
T cell receptors and antibodies are genetically

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
identical and they're obviously not identical. So now I wouldn't say that.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And some of them develop, we have ones with plenty cases of somebody develops a disease

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and the identical twin never develops it. This is the biggest problem we have

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
in neuroscience that we've got inbred that is identical

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
twins and these are 50 to 100 generations.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Yeah, so embarrassing that you take 10 animals and

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
two of them are outliers all the time. Yeah, yeah, still.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So yeah, I would say, okay, maybe sometimes people

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
pretend that everything's genetic. But it is a paradigm.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It's a powerful paradigm. Well, the discovery was so exciting.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
People are dead or you can identify

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
genes. Oh, absolutely. I mean, there are plenty of

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
you if you have the Tysock's gene, if you have sickle

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
cell, you might develop the disease at different ages, but

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
eventually you will develop the diseases. But there are plenty of others where

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
you will never have. But like in paleontology

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
that's the thing too now. Are you talking about

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
genome? So we're all looking at these

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
particular questions with a new lens that is say that

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
we think enable us to create these

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
genealogical trees and things like that. That might

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
mean, in my understanding, the whole issue of

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
human evolution has radically changed in whatever. The 80s

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
or something like that? Yeah, well, and now, but there's still

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
a lot of arguments even with all this new genetic information,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
genomic information. There's still a lot of arguments

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
about the mobility of

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
homo sapiens and the relationship to homo erectus

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and whether or not there was one exit from Africa or

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
25 exits or it's not a field that I'm really

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
deeply involved in. But even with the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
arrival, and in the areas where I work, I work primarily in

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
evolution. And there's still some big

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
uncertainties and controversies in that area even with all

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
this genomic information. Some of it's working

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
extraordinarily unbelievably well. And as you can tell, I'm skeptical, but still

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the fact that you're saliva can find your second cousin

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
in other countries is pretty astonishing. And the fact that Google

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Translate is doing so well, even though it kind of cheated in some ways in the way

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
but it's working immensely well, right? You just said

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
probably everybody's using it. I wanted to ask the neuroscientists

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
here just say a few words about how you go about

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
to the degree the word decoding applies to what you're doing. How do you go about it?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Because you don't necessarily have a key.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
So we do have a key. At least I'd like to let me have a

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
few. And the interesting thing you said, you're interested in mammalian evolution, so am I,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
but from a different aspect of you. Part of the most fascinating thing, but

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
the brain for me is that in every

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
memo what remains constant

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
over the evolution time is timing.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
That is the brain reasons you might heard about alpha, beta,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
gamma oscillations and delta and so on. These are

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
not only individual ones, but they form a hierarchical system

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
in such a way that slow oscillations are

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
modulating the amplitude of the faster ones and the phase

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
of the faster one modulate the amplitude of the even faster ones.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So it's like the tie

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
is changing and then upon the changes the

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
amplitude of the

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000
beta is changing. Now this is good because

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
when you ask how come that you scale up a

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:49.000
system 50,000 fold from the small brain to the

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
size of the brain of a wave,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what is the rule of this evolutionly scaling? What should remain

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
constant and what remains constant is timing through

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
this oscillation because they are preserved. It would take

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
the turn 30 seconds. Why is that? Because this is

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
what they call the neural syntax. This is the

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
time packages which allow that you said

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
information if you want those piking activity from one area

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
of the brain to another area of the brain because the other area of the brain is already

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
given the cipher which is the time window. If you don't have

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
that framework, this neural syntax, then brain areas

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
cannot communicate with each other. We cannot communicate with each other. The reason why you

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
understand me is because even though I have an

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
accent and I have made so many mistakes is because I have a

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
particular tempo which is about 4 Hertz which is

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
characteristic of every single human language which is also not only the

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
utterances but also the perception. And the reason for that is because both the utterances

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
as well as the perception of these events are based on

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
brain rhythms. So again we have to go inside

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
and train in order to have the grounding and that's the grounding for me

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
the grounding of the origin of language and classification

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
and cipher. How much of this

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
formal appreciation of these constant

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
relationships? How much of it is

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
a purely sort of mathematical

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
1 over F distribution? How much is it divergent

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
that? Does that help you? Because

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
if it's very generic, it's very simple.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It's not only generic, but you already know the content

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
of these patterns. And if something is short

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
it means that in a system which has

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
constraints on the speed of communication, the brain is a very

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
slow system. You know the conduction velocities of the

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
neurons is on the order of 0.2 to

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
several meters per second. Very, very slow. So given

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
that if you have a short amount of time available it means that only your

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
immediate partners can be involved. That is

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
short means small number of neurons. More time

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
means larger number of neurons. And then the

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
cool goal of this communication is that whatever happens locally can be

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
broadcasted globally as well as the global brain

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
state. You know what the activity

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
pattern in the brain is constraints how local communication or local

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
cipher can be generated.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
If you take away the cipher, if you take away the

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
voltage, if you take away all of these brain latins, the end of the day

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
is that every single psychiatric disease is

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
associated with one or other type of timing problems.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's difficult to differentiate diseases from

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
each other because those are all arbitrary. But it's very

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
easy to look at the brain even

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
at a depressed patient with its depressed state or non-depressed state

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
that is very different. So the timing, the communication

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
is absolutely matters and that's what I'm

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
pushing for that we have a sittactical system.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I'm thinking as a very general level this idea of extracting

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
some understanding of meaning from either brain activity or

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
artifact assumes a certain sort of background

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
either it could be in the various mathematical descriptions of it. It could be noise.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
It could be a 1 over F frequency. These are background

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
mathematically defined substrate

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
and we think we find meaning when

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
something diverges from that, something you give a stimulus is no longer

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
it doesn't have that baseline anymore.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
That's a way of building a key. Isn't that in a way when you

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
don't have the literal, you set it up so you're right

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
but then there is a deviation. This is when many brain structures kick

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
in and it happens to what's called phase receptor

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
and all of a sudden the timing changes

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
and that timing change is detected elsewhere. If that is not detected

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
as happens in schizophrenia and then other diseases that's a big problem.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Okay, great. Wow.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Time went fast. All right. I guess the question is do we have

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
any folks want to ask questions of our panel?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Thank you.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Thank you all so much.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Sorry everyone is sitting down

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
so I'm going to sit down too. Hi everyone thank you that was really

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
fascinating. My name is Celia Emery. I'm a museum architect

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
and my concern relates to I guess

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
for the politics of coding, the psychology of coding

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
and where agency fits in. So in museum design we have

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
two aspects of time space. One of them is the path

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
of the visitor in the spaces of the institution

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
and people enter into a building with a pre-existing idea of how they're going to use it

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
because they're adults, they're free agents and they've already learned how to use buildings.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So on museum institutions

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
set up what that time space

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
experience is going to be and yet there's a conflict, there's a schism

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
within any use of any building which is that we as

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
individual agents want to be able to act in our own way we want to be able

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
to affirm. So your reference to the graffiti was so interesting I'm about to go to

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Alula to visit the Hegra tombs and there's a lot of graffiti

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
we'll talk. But apparently it was

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
speculated that that graffiti was just journeyers writing down

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
that they had arrived, in other words I am here, Joe was here

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
and in fact that isn't, that is what much of the graffiti is. So that

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
kind of need for us to kind of the ego to kind of exist

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
somewhere and market somehow within a coding

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
system. So the other schism that we have is that

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
in a museum you have a relationship between a

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
person and that artifact which was created in a different point of time. So it's in a different

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
space, it's in a different time. So how do we, so there's two different aspects of this, I'm going to

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
get to this point. In epigraphic and cuneiform

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
the who was control, my question for the group is really

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
who has the control of these forms of ideology?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Who is creating, who is benefiting from the

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
cuneiform methods, why? And who was

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
benefiting from written language and why? How come that

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
didn't continue to exist? And then how do we as individual agents

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
kind of fit in? Like aren't we, are we just obeying

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
the ideological precepts that have been handed down to us?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Or do we have any agency within coding?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Sorry, can we do so long?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Well let me start with the specific question of who benefited

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
from cuneiform. You can have a very materialistic

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
interpretation and that's the usual interpretation. It's a

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
way of dealing with a more complex system of especially

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
economic interaction, therefore you need some type of record keeping

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
that goes beyond time and space

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
that can travel from one

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
place to another place or is kept

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
for a specific period of time.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
To take it to this greater

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
level of, you know, when the

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
writing system, what the writing system has a meaning beyond

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
a purely practical writing system. Well, I wouldn't call it an

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
ideology, it's a philosophy, it's an approach to reality.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's an attempt at understanding

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
reality that yes, is shared by an intellectual elite just

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
as today philosophical discourse is shared by

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
intellectual elite but it frames a cultural

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
you know, it creates a cultural setting

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
that yes, the entire civilization

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
if you can use that term, you know, is part of even

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
a lot of the majority of people are not

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
consciously aware of the elements of this.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I'd just like to say that, you know, one of the

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
roles I have at the museum and I still have is I have oversight of exhibition.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
So I really understand what you're saying about what the visitor

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
how does the visitor engage or how does the museum engage

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
with the visitor and the question you have and who has agency there

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and there's always so the trend in recent

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
years of course has been interactivity, interactivity,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
interactivity and they're generally many of them are experiments that fail

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
because you make assumptions about what visitors

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
really want and the problem is that's based on you

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
European, you're not the visitor, you know,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
and it's fascinating just to think about

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
what's happening in a museum, what happens when a

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
visitor encounters an artifact or a fossil or

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
a piece of tapestry or whatever in that sense.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Well I think there are just many interesting

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
questions that you raise and I'm very jealous of your

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
that's true. I hope you'll open the university case.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
But that said, I think it seems you're a

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
dependent in terms of proof benefits because it has to do with how

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
communication works in individual societies and today

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
in a global society working literally in code benefits

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
very different people than at least

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
geographically. It's sort of a more

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
sense of something much more diffuse than when you're talking about individual

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
ancient societies or medieval societies where certain practitioners

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
were sort of deputized of being the record keepers and they could derive

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
status from their roles as such or

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
proximity to different ranges of literacy would allow people to sort of

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
pen themselves accordingly in that order of status

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
or esteem. And to go back to a point that you made earlier,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I mean this is why we literally have tons of

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
whether we call them magical texts or texts of ritual power

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
a lot of times they're total gibberish. At least

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
us they seem to be and they don't seem to accord with any particular script

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
that we know of because it seemed like it

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
resembled writing to people who couldn't write they wouldn't know the difference.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And so there's a power to that and sometimes it was just something esoteric

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
deliberately esoteric but I think the ways in which we relate

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
to sort of dominant types of communication allows us to sort of

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
fit into broader constructs of status, cultural

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
economic and otherwise. But I think it's really sort of culture dependent

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I think when we talk about antiquity again it's very different from

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
today when we talk about code and coding and who's benefiting from their

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
ability to be able to work with certain languages on computers

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
it's you know many more people than 20 years ago

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
but who are those people right and how do they use that information

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
it's something that I can't possibly triangulate

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
that others might but I think it's definitely indicative

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
it's a symptom of something that's shifting in our global society that I

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
can't interpret but because it's something

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
sort of different it'll be interesting to see work.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
The key phrase you have is relate.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I think that's the most important thing in the museum and I'm looking for

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
creations that allow me to go to a place and I lose

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
my sense of time. All of a sudden I can devote

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
my entire mind to what's going on there. Once I do that

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I all of a sudden have

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
first point of view rather than a third person, first person point of view

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
rather than the third person point of view of everything.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Now you ask about the agency that I become an agent

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
because somehow you transform me and I will be

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
part of the participants of those events even though I had

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
no knowledge about that if continents go together.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
But I use my imagination, I use my existing knowledge, I use my existing belief

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
systems to relate myself to that situation.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Now the agency is not human

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
every animal has the desire

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
and everything to learn these boundaries

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
we know that we have boundaries and that's the

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
essence of even a mobile or every single creature that

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
knows that it has boundaries and relates into everything else.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
That relatedness is the super important thing. If I go to a

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
museum where I have to interact, this is what kids when they

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
go to New Jersey, the science museum I see, it's the same thing as a physics class.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Plus maybe they can do more freely and the teacher is not watching.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This is a fascinating thing because yes we are always saying

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
the museum is important, it was important to reopen

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
after COVID because this is a place, this is it gives people a sense of place

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
but what's really interesting is for a lot of people this is their place

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
this is there and increasingly

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and there might be a dichotomy in society maybe that will break down

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
as people die and younger and younger people come up but

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
you can see it in a daughter

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
or somebody close to you that you know intimately

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
what their reality is compared to

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
what you're trying to do with visitors coming to a museum.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So two examples that work for me very well, of course it requires

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
the relatedness, the Japanese shinto goddess.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
It's simple but you lose the sense of the time immediately

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
because you are just looking at the rock. The other one is an extreme

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
other thing that Selena also knows about, you know, a marine abramovich

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
when she was sitting in the over there

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
there was nothing there except a pair of eyes and you were

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
looking to see yourself in those eyes and all of a sudden

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
you had a means of saying you can discover yourself

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
if your museums spaces can create that

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
thing that discover yourself you leave the museum with a better feeling

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
or recreation then there's the look.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
The institution is really because the organization has telling you what's in the

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.000
information. Exactly, they want to convey information. I don't need information, I have enough.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
My own personal experience which is

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
taken for what is worth I'm not a I have nothing to do with PCMs except as a

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
museum goer but you know a lot of what makes science interesting

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
are controversies and challenges within a paradigm

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
and the challenges within a paradigm can be small

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and they can be in the verge of some cataclysmic change

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
and that's really I think interesting to people

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I would think it's interesting to people. I think it's a mistake to use the word controversy

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
for a devol. I would stay away from that word because I think it makes people think

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
well there are experts and you're already distance from it. There are experts

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
and the word controversy personally for myself sort of is off putting

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
it makes it seem like this is a little bit good to be beyond me. I think it's really

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
useful to say here that just lay out the different ideas

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
side by side and don't refer to it as being some raging

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
controversy among experts.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I just want to express appreciation for

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
everyone who does this work and it partly relates to fun.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
I found and this is also relating to what you asked before is there a difference

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
to humans between something that's a million years ago or 10,000 years ago

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
and I find that with my students anything that happened

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
before the year 2012

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
is ancient history. The time is completely compressed

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
and obviously my students are not as they're not working in the same capacity

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
if you were to look with graduate students in your field or

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
you with yours or you with yours because they're already very much aware

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
of the stretch of time. But to me

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
the ways that museums have the capacity to jar

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
people from the present reality and to

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
force them to confront chronology and

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
time whether it's I feel like it's activist work

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
these days and the power of losing yourself in those places

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
being jarred from your phone. It's different when you're talking

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
about academics or researchers or specialists in the

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
general public. I think it's one of the only places where

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
we can remind people that there's a world beyond themselves

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
chronologically, culturally and beyond the human

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
realm too and I think it's that is what I feel like is increasingly

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
lost in the world of coding and it's just such

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
important work. So anyway you can make people uncomfortable enough

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
to be present in their spaces and learn is a contribution

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
to everybody. Do you take your

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
students in the field? Do you notice the difference? Absolutely

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I am so extraordinary now.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I teach in a history department so not all my

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
students expect to specialize in anything that relates to

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
antiquity but I tell them that I think the tradition

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
about museums is that you know it's from European tradition

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
these are places to appreciate art and being able to appreciate it in a particular

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
way. It's a status thing, it's an appreciation thing

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
so I tell them these are libraries

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
they're like visual libraries in a way not like not that that's such a

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
great advertisement for them either but rather than being something flat

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
and two dimensional it's something you get to enter and immerse yourself into

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and when it's really effective I remember because I teach

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
in Brooklyn, I teach in Flatbush and some of my students have never been to

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
the Met and I remember the first time when I started teaching Maron I

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
brought a class in the Met and I remember the student who looked up the

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
grand staircase and he just was like well you know

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
because it's just a different environment, a different world

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and when you don't approach it as art but you know objects that are

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
artifacts that can teach us about different places in times that these

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
you know that they can investigate it's totally transformative and it's something that a lot of

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
people take for granted in lots of different places but

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I think it's again like a form of activism

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
to remind people they're not the center of the universe and their phones are not the center of the universe

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
but the world is not flat so

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
sorry that's the thank you.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Is there another question?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
As I hear everyone talking about decoding it seems to me that there's a little bit of

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
sort of an incompatibility of some fundamental

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
assumptions that especially as I hear this coming out in the debate about consensus

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
so it seems to me that there are kind of two different approaches here

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
to what decoding actually is so

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I've kind of like set out a number of binaries here trying to make sense of this for myself

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
seems on the one hand there's a sort of approach to denotation and on the other

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
an approach to connotation as it pertains to decoding meaning.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
You know you could say that there's a kind of idea here of

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
this context or I guess thinking about

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
what you were saying about the brain in a sense that there's a synchrony

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
you called that synchrony a key but I don't think that that's a key to meaning that's just a

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
condition of possibility for interpretation of meaning.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So I guess I'm wondering in this discussion of coding one

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
whether you all would agree that there are two different approaches

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
to thinking about what meaning is and whether that's a

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
disciplinary problem or something else.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
You ask an easy question please.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
you said synchrony is not exactly the same

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
as brain waves but nevertheless I didn't make a claim

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and nobody does that we can decide for the content

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
that say it's a you know grandma has a large

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
way of defining things but one of them

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
is you could call it the phonetics of that and

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
that's without content so that's what brain it was about.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Now the meaning is the essential thing of everything unless

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
my students show me that that relationship between

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
what the experiment that proposed to the brain and the responses there

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
has a message for the rest of the brain or to the animal

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
that's not there is no meaning. So meaning has to be

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
generated only through utility at least this is what the view

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
in evolution as well as in the animal world

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
is that if particular thing comes with a plus or minus

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
in the life of the animal that generates meaning. So

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
many ways the way how today's neuroscience is studied

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
we think that it's a like slate and then you just shovel

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
information into this your brain and so on and you can

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
with which means that the complexity of the brain whatever

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
we do is growing as you learn more and more and more

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
and that's exactly what happens in an AI system and it collapses

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
very soon because there are so much stuff interfering with each

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
other. Another way of thinking about this is that

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
brain comes already with an equipped

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
dictionary. Every single thing that exists in your future life

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
is already there and the parents that

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
we thought were generated in over in fact they

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
pre-exist. So what happens is that out of this realm of

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
possibilities you experience something that goes in

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
one way or another positive or negative and that pattern that was present

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
at the time when that experience happened becomes

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
meaningful. It will have a utility for now or the future of the organism

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
this is how we generate meaning. Now the linguist

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
or a human person who thinks about may have another way of

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
phrasing it but I think that would be just rephrasing the same kind of thing.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I'm going to drive you guys both of you crazy. I mean to me I'm not sure what meaning

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000
means here but there are I mean

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
if it means something as simple as you know

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000
when I talk about brain rhythms I mean if I if you stimulate

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
a synaptic input to a muscle

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
fiber that muscle fiber will twitch and if you do it over here

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
there's a couple of extra steps

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
but no this muscle will twitch and if you

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
go over here this muscle will twitch and if you just go

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:47.000
a few you know bottom millimeter on the

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
other side you will hear something or you will feel something

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000
and in a particular part of your body. Is that meaning? Because if it is then it's

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
based in okay so rise it not meaning

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
because it has no relation to experience

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
but what if what

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
it's remapping?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
So I'm going to press you on that it can change

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
so we can we can remap

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000
this to hear instead of there and this happens

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:27.000
all the time when people have strokes for instance.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Now is it meaning?

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I would say it would be meaningful in the context

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000
that we understand how

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
I think we have to finish up. I always want both of you but

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
here it becomes so there are things that are not there but when you have a stroke

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
it becomes a meaning so when you touch your nose

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
with your toe

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
it feels it has a meaning for you because it feels at the same

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
now that meaning is acquired through experience

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and because you feel at the same time I can show you that anybody can show you that

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
it's not at the same time it's a much longer time to go from here

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
or from my nose but that for me as a utility I don't care about the mechanism

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I just know it's at the same time so that's a meaning for

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
me because I can use that information

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
anything that I can use utility determines meaning

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
That's a really unsatisfying discussion right

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
yeah that meaning is the most

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.000
difficult thing. Yeah we have to move on right it's interesting it's an interesting question.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So I've learned so much this morning and I'm very grateful

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.000
and it has led to many different questions but I'm just going to bring it down to one.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I wonder what happens in terms of when emotion enters

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
what happens to how people approach things and I'm thinking

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000
now at the Morgan Museum right now there's an exhibit

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000
on Erduana I'm sure you've already seen it you've probably been talking

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
to Sydney Bactog about it or

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
but it goes from agriculture being discussed in terms

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
of bushels which you were mentioning versus

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000
handling of harvest through this highly

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
emotive charged poem by this priestess about plow my

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
fields plow my fields as an erotic

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000
situation so I'd love to know what happens in terms of

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
the evolution of mind that brings that in

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
or the world where we are a man in his bassel in Egypt

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
you know where that's a whole other very highly

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
emotive interaction.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
So are you asking within the context I mean

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
the fact that it becomes something that it's

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
written down? No that you

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
can approach the harvest through the number of bushels

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
or you can approach the harvest as a kind of analogy of becoming

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
together of sky and earth, male and female what happens

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
what's happened in the mind that opens it

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
up to that kind of approach. Well, metaphorical

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
language I don't know if that's, I assume it predates

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
writing, metaphorical language where we

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
connect something physical let's say

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
that's physical in one area of life and metaphorically

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
we connect it to another area of life I would imagine

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000
that that pre-dates the origins

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
of writing one of the great things about poems like

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
the American Epics is rich, it is with metaphorical

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
language and what I find interesting about metaphorical

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
language you mentioned in the Ishidwana poem is

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
or metaphor or metaphors are contained within a

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
cultural structure in order to make sense so

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
abundance of fields makes sense in a particular type of society

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
actually I discussed metaphorical language with my students

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
only a couple of days ago living in New York City they have no connection

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
at all to the metaphors that are being used in ancient

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
poetry because they're mostly rural metaphors and so

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:35.000
but I do that I think is yeah there is a system there

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
of clothing as well you have to understand

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
you have to understand the cipher you have to understand the system

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
if I compare something to an

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
object, an entity, a natural phenomenon that none

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
of you have ever experienced you're not going to understand my metaphor

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
but just also in terms of

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
image making or expression and emotion I think that's more what I'm

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
wondering about especially now with all the talk about emotion and cognition

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
and what the interaction is between them and I just thought

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.000
how do you express emotions?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
How do you render emotion

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
orally or in a written form?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
You can only do so I think by using

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
comparison, I mean love is a feeling of

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
whatever fire etc etc.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I think we're also going to have the opportunity to reflect on some of this issue in her

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000
fiction, fiction, meta-fiction talk later today because I think

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
really for me the answer and response in part to what you were asking is that

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
there's a dialectic that goes back and forth between metaphorical

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
poetic sort of meaning, phenomenological meaning and then

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
the way it gets encoded and then the codes create the opportunity for more

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
engagement with meaning because the codes themselves can have meaning

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
so I think it's a

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
very interesting dialectic did you ever know? Oh sorry

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Hi, please. Hi. This last question

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.000
sort of prompts me to rise.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.000
I have this thought I've been developing for a long time and it seems to

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.000
coordinate with a lot of the different themes that we've had this morning

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Prior to the development of language

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
there was a great deal of intelligence in

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
early humans they survived and

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
so the way. The thought

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:51.000
just to make it very general is that

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
the evolutionary pressure which leads eventually to the most powerful

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
evolutionary movement which is the development of culture

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
really requires the development of language because we have to

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
express to larger groups over time

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
over generational time

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
the development of language seems to be

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
a cognitive way of thinking which is

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
pairs of opposites which is as you say positive

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
or negative and so on. The metaphorical thinking

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
is not it's more analog

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
the earliest need

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000
for language I want to suggest or I think

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
is the communication of what we would call mythic

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:47.000
kinds of ideas it is what forms a

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
group it's what gives self-identity

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
to the group and the evolutionary pressure is in the direction

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
of groups that are more tightly bound more coherent

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
those are the successful ones.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
So how does that happen? Evolutionarily

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
the thought that I have and I don't have your expertise to know

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
whether it makes sense to you which is why I guess I am saying this

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000
is that we develop a

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
the brain develops a sensitivity to certain

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
kinds of narrative that we think of as mythic

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000
we recognize mythic ideas mythic

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
narrative in a different way it's not about the content

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:39.000
there is something that we feel is mythic which would

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000
require a physiological development

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
evolutionarily based in the brain

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000
and so we end up with two kinds of minds a cognitive

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
which is all linguistics are cognitive

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
and the same intelligence that we had before we

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
developed language and those two different minds

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000
are not being commensurate they cannot communicate with each other

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
you can't be thinking about metaphor in a cognitive

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
way and understand the power

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
and if you try to translate it into cognitive

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
forms you lose the power

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
and so we have these two different minds

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000
just as a further development of that is the notion

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
that that which can communicate

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
is myth mythic stories mythic

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
ways of thinking is what gives us

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
a sense of wholeness where we can see the world

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
with the two incommentral intelligences

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:57.000
anyone?

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.980
We were talking downstairs over coffee before a little bit about

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:04.980
people have written books that are very similar to what you're saying

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:08.980
and I guess you had Peter Pessick here with the polyphonic minds idea so

01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:12.980
you might want to check out his book he kind of thinks the way that you do

01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:16.980
and we were also talking about the bicameral mind which is very

01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:20.980
out of fashion but you know that book?

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:24.980
Yeah so it's very similar to what exactly

01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:28.980
it's very very similar to what you're bringing up. Now I'm very skeptical

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:32.980
of both of them and I'm friendly with Peter

01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:36.980
but still I'm very skeptical I think they take a lot of

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:40.980
impressionist to kind of stuff and try to come up with the whole theory but and just like I'm being a

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:44.980
little skeptical of what you said but that doesn't mean you don't have a lot of depth there and that there's a lot to examine

01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:48.980
so we were talking about kind of the variation

01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:52.980
of what you were saying just before we started the meeting this morning.

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:56.980
I take these two sides that you're describing as being

01:46:56.980 --> 01:47:00.980
a non-incomensurate or at least they may be different but they're different ways

01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:04.980
of looking at the same thing where they're on a developmental

01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:08.980
historically on a developmental course and I think I mean the person

01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:12.980
that comes to mind for me is Ernst Kasier who wrote a lot about

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:16.980
mythic way of looking at the world and has it became more

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:20.980
rationalizing scientific not to say that's always better

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:24.980
which is what people sometimes lament but that it's

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:28.980
a further development of mythic thinking.

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:32.980
I think you're saying there are two parts of the mind one of them is more modern

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:36.980
and it can't exactly coexist simultaneously with the other part.

01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:40.980
I think we have them both at the same time.

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.980
Our problem today is our inability to see them both at the same time

01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.980
to experience them both at the same time.

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:52.980
Myth functions by just it doesn't describe

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.980
it is a place from which you can experience

01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:00.980
both ways of experiencing the world or seeing the world

01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:04.980
and responding to it at the same time and gives us a sense of

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:08.980
home. Myth becomes religion at a certain point.

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:12.980
To me, myth plus politics equals religion.

01:48:12.980 --> 01:48:16.980
I really had hoped in fact that's a very we have to finish and that's an interesting

01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:20.980
end note because no it really was my hope that that this would be

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:24.980
just sort of two-sided this decoding and demeaning

01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:28.980
connotation and denotation is something I was hoping we would be able

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.980
to bring out here and I think we did a really pretty good job.

01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:36.980
I thank you all for your contributions.

01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:40.980
Thank you.

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:44.980
Can I make a little correction?

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:48.980
So I kept wondering

01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:52.980
if we could have this conversation two-thousand years ago

01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.980
and many of the things that we discussed here were discussed two-thousand years ago

01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:00.980
in the exact same way and your answer about myth and so on

01:49:00.980 --> 01:49:04.980
was unanswered the same way.

01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:08.980
So now it's impossible but I think if you

01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:12.980
look at the grounding that is how you can make

01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:16.980
a judgment

01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.980
that there are two brains as you said, emotional and cognitive brains

01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:24.980
and this has been going on in humankind for a long time

01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:28.980
before DSM-5, DSM-4 actually had two axes

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.980
and one set of psychiatrists that with the cognitive problems that

01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:36.980
have been with the emotional problems, now we know

01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:40.980
there is no part of the brain that would be dedicated to emotions.

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:44.980
We know also there is no such a thing as fear center

01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:48.980
because negative and positive is the luck, context,

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:52.980
the stomach, the heart, wherever something bad is called it next to it

01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.980
or just to it is the good. This is how the relationships

01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:00.980
are formed and that is just to show

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:04.980
there is no part in the brain that you can look at. MRI is

01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:08.980
just like we can distinguish and separate cognition from emotion.

01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.980
They evolve together. They are never separate.

01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:16.980
They have the beliefs that we can separate them and those beliefs

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:20.980
can persevere and no amount of introspection can help.

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:24.980
That's why I throw it back. But if you look into the brain

01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:28.980
the debate will become simpler.

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:32.980
There are times where you have an emotion and you have no cognition

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.980
onto you actually. Absolutely.

01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:40.980
How do you have a condition without a motion?

01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:44.980
No. Okay. So if I can't have a reaction to something

01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:48.980
just through emotions, yes you can.

01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:52.980
So that I call adaptive behavior and you can call it
