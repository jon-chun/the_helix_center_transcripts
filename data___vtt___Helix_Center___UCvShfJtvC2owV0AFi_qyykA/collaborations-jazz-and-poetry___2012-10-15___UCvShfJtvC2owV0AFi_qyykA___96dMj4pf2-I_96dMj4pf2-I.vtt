00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
Welcome to this first of the poetry and music series.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.000
I'm Ed Nursecien, director of the center.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
David Pollens, who is in charge of the poetry program

00:20.000 --> 00:23.120
for the Helix Center will introduce today's program.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.400
And maybe he'll tell you something

00:24.400 --> 00:25.700
about what else he has planned.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.000
I don't know.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.860
He hasn't given me his copy of his comments.

00:33.860 --> 00:37.000
As I said yesterday, we are having a benefit

00:37.000 --> 00:38.120
at the end of the month.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.320
But those of you who can't come, any donation of any size

00:41.320 --> 00:42.560
is welcome.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.000
So with that, David.

00:46.000 --> 00:46.500
Thanks.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.120
Thanks, Ed.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.480
Well, as Ed mentioned, this is the first of our poetry events

00:51.480 --> 00:53.160
at Helix.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.600
And I'm David Pollens.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.160
And we have a committee of people who have been helping

00:57.160 --> 00:58.880
and providing suggestions.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.000
I'll mention their names.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.640
Heather Dubna, Rachel Haddis, Anne Rieleveen, and Polly

01:04.640 --> 01:06.320
Rosenweg are all in the poetry committee.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.840
And are all helping to organize the events.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.640
We're hoping to have three, possibly four more events

01:13.640 --> 01:17.280
between now and the summer.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.640
The next thing that'll be coming up in the winter

01:19.640 --> 01:22.720
is going to be a roundtable on classical Urdu poetry

01:22.720 --> 01:24.960
and Galib.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.240
And then a little bit later on in the spring,

01:27.240 --> 01:30.240
we're going to have a roundtable on ancient Mayan poetry

01:30.240 --> 01:32.440
in the Popul vote.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.160
And there are some other roundtables in the works.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.280
And we'll let you know about them as they develop.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.520
So we have two very special artists,

01:39.520 --> 01:42.320
and with us today, Sean Singer, who

01:42.320 --> 01:45.200
won the Yell Younger Poets Prize and the Norma Farber Award

01:45.200 --> 01:49.520
from the Poetry Society of America for a first book of poems.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.000
And Lewis Porter, a wonderful, wonderful jazz

01:52.000 --> 01:55.400
musician and preeminent jazz musicologist.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.800
Did you bring CDs with you today?

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
Or?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
No?

01:58.800 --> 02:01.000
I have certain that car.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.480
OK, well, the Coltrane Biographies.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.320
I can go.

02:04.320 --> 02:04.960
I can go get it.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.400
OK, the Coltrane Biography is on sale outside.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.160
And so is Sean Singer's book of poems.

02:10.160 --> 02:14.600
So if you're interested, please, please buy them.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.920
So I'll segue poetically to their collaboration today.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.320
I wonder if they'll help us to answer a question posed

02:23.320 --> 02:27.000
by Sean in his poem inside the Keith Jarrett Trio.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.320
He asks, how does a hollow bone in your head

02:31.320 --> 02:36.280
trace clear purple wavelets from waves of pain?

02:36.280 --> 02:38.840
So we're going to go for about an hour and 15 minutes.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.800
And we'll stop, and we'll have participation, questions,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.360
comments from the audience.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.040
Thank you very much.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.160
OK, thanks for coming.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.920
Nice to see you.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.920
Shall we just start?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.760
The old record rolled out of the hot machine,

03:01.760 --> 03:05.360
the scully automated lathe covered in oil.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.120
Rigged to the metal ends, dying of spin, metal on black,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.040
back to back thimbleweights, diamond

03:11.040 --> 03:14.680
and rinse to a new shine, lunge and pull into circles,

03:14.680 --> 03:18.400
100 grooves to the centimeter, calling it vinyl midnight candle,

03:18.400 --> 03:20.880
drops onto the place with the push of the night

03:20.880 --> 03:25.040
gift-figous turping needle, a bell-crank lead plant resting

03:25.040 --> 03:27.520
in a red scissor over the lumps of steel,

03:27.520 --> 03:30.840
then rising with rustle smoke, jazz dust,

03:30.840 --> 03:33.040
rumbly with the blues, the old rumor

03:33.040 --> 03:37.920
monger taking us to the juke, the bambara word that is wicked.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.920
Douncing resin polymer, lost to the racy's stuff.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.720
Baby, she got a phonograph.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.680
Won't say alone some word.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.160
Would evil have I done?

03:48.160 --> 03:50.640
Would evil as the poor girl heard?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.640
Louderford.

03:52.640 --> 04:17.680
OK.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.880
OK.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.080
That's fine.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
I should yell.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
Nice to yell.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
OK.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
OK.

04:26.080 --> 04:51.080
OK.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.080
Photo of Coltrane, 1963.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.880
Otherworldly and outreaching, a pernastis of noise with the serious

04:58.880 --> 05:01.080
clint of anestimal worry on his face.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.080
O Coltrane, what will rank for your pious gleaming and trillion

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
euphonia?

05:06.080 --> 05:11.080
So capable, swift with no trace, no trace of stillness.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.080
The blur of the gray, gray, and gree-gree flows

05:14.080 --> 05:18.080
onward to the black bell of the saxophone, with cylinder of joy,

05:18.080 --> 05:22.080
and in purple sea of heaven, ebbing into hell.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.080
OK.

05:24.080 --> 05:29.080
I'll try to do that.

05:29.080 --> 05:37.080
It's a small place here.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
OK.

05:38.080 --> 05:43.080
You can maybe even not be able to find the view.

05:43.080 --> 05:52.080
I should use the natural value of the piano.

05:52.080 --> 05:57.080
That would be very good.

05:57.080 --> 06:02.080
Oh, you don't want to hit it?

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
Yeah.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
I said, Janie.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.080
Can you put your picture for every being I know?

06:07.080 --> 06:10.080
It's a piece of light.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.080
OK.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.080
Sound check before the next poem.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.080
You need to see this clearer?

06:19.080 --> 06:20.080
OK.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.080
I'll do it with me.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
OK.

06:24.080 --> 06:34.080
Billie later.

06:34.080 --> 06:40.080
Boons etch themselves above and below, drink sober lungfuls of hush.

06:40.080 --> 06:45.080
Blood soap and well, the threadbare noises of an amber tube and a bird.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.080
Welcome to the district of snow loneliness.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
My list.

06:49.080 --> 06:54.080
A towel for redness, taboos for my dolls, spasms of a man,

06:54.080 --> 06:59.080
something emerges from a cord, a pigeon egg, a snow-silent, resilient secret,

06:59.080 --> 07:02.080
holding its hand toward you, holding its pink spotlight,

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
finding a Roosevelt dime.

07:04.080 --> 07:12.080
I wake up to a new sun, a clear and tender quiet in each bone.

07:12.080 --> 07:16.080
Billie blew his momma's chinaberry tree, angry since the big being card,

07:16.080 --> 07:19.080
and not in the early black, back of the club so thick with smoke,

07:19.080 --> 07:21.080
and lady up front blowing blues till my hair hurts,

07:21.080 --> 07:24.080
spurts of shying some tiny trouble you know.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.080
In the black fracture of night, she's back,

07:26.080 --> 07:28.080
hopped on cutie killer, diller faced like a brown egg,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.080
begging the black like Jack the bear.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.080
Their lady baby, color of a chocolate dress,

07:32.080 --> 07:35.080
juicy Lucy the Shazam, do a bank bang outflose,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.080
as she called yes.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.080
I had too many husbands.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.080
Last one beat me black and blue,

07:43.080 --> 07:45.080
and he was out the door, he said,

07:45.080 --> 07:47.080
baby better me than you.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.080
I got good in trunk, I couldn't even see.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.080
No matter how much money I make, I've never been free.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.080
He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.080
I know by that there's another mule kicking in my stall.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.080
If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea,

08:03.080 --> 08:06.080
stay out of my valley and let my mountain be.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.080
Let me be your rag doll until you're trying to come.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.080
If you beat me, ragged, I've got to beat you some.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.080
If he walks out the door, he won't be gone long.

08:17.080 --> 08:35.080
I'll be up on the stage in my needle of song.

08:35.080 --> 08:58.080
I'll be up on the stage in my song.

08:58.080 --> 09:27.080
I'll be up on the stage in my song.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.080
Scott Joplin.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.080
Son of a slave, your birthday is no more exact than a petal.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.080
Sunflower, you have no need to worry.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.080
Your piano rolls have played in middle and upper class homes.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.080
Maple leaf, across the plains, where is gold, we worry.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.080
Neither improvise nor play blues, but compose.

09:49.080 --> 09:53.080
Chrysanthemum, our ways of living differ, like worry.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.080
The weaponized and visible boundaries of America keep you.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.080
Eugenia, there is a reason to worry.

10:00.080 --> 10:04.080
You were composing, but not recording, only rolls with holes.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.080
Lily Queen, others have been pieces of worry.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.080
The reason you asked and the reason I don't have the answer is the same.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.080
Heliotrope, let's just not worry.

10:15.080 --> 10:20.080
Sifliss with his attendant dementia, paranoia, paralysis, pineapple,

10:20.080 --> 10:24.080
your leaves each fear and heave toward worry.

12:20.080 --> 12:33.080
From bone magic, the exeigencies of an interval, Igor Stravinsky.

12:33.080 --> 12:39.080
Ory's gooey nasty bone style with its slurs, gloss and muskrette does

12:39.080 --> 12:43.080
reveals a muskrette in Aquatic Rodin and its fur all Louisiana

12:43.080 --> 12:47.080
industry before worry relocated to Los Angeles.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.080
Thoreau described their nests not as things, but as dwellings, the border of

12:51.080 --> 12:53.080
Habitat and town.

12:53.080 --> 12:58.080
The theme beneath the soly on dropping shocks, with corn shocks and their outside

12:58.080 --> 13:00.080
maze used for toilet paper.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.080
Lil' Hardin's feelings were avenged during their divorce, dropping them on

13:04.080 --> 13:06.080
Louis' head.

13:06.080 --> 13:11.080
The raw umbrella, a bone facing backwards on a horse-drawn cart when the

13:11.080 --> 13:13.080
sun sets there is not to do.

13:13.080 --> 13:18.080
I saw you with your sweet man last night and I know you wasn't true.

13:43.080 --> 13:52.080
Just for you, low powdered color through a straw.

13:52.080 --> 13:56.080
From the cave's vantage, feel the trestles and palms.

13:56.080 --> 14:00.080
Be the flash lab, see a ball slow above the plate.

14:00.080 --> 14:04.080
Be the flesh lab too, the cream of your neck, the portion near the ear.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.080
Use your stylus, have no direct hand contact.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.080
Recall that utopia literally means not a place.

14:12.080 --> 14:17.080
Punishment, right, I will not write this poem a thousand times in a wall.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.080
Then hinge that wall or singe it.

14:20.080 --> 14:26.080
I think of Maxine sometimes, her inky bob, Ramones tea and negative definitions.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.080
We would ride her blue Toyota behind the dunes.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.080
Clear cell cancer killed her years ago.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.080
She would take my hand in the mid-grade mall and we saw our liquid happiness

14:37.080 --> 14:44.080
rising through bodies.

16:07.080 --> 16:28.080
Mountainous black garden.

16:28.080 --> 16:35.080
What good is intelligence if you cannot discover a useful melancholy?

16:35.080 --> 16:38.080
Reading grapefruit, pray and fake grief.

16:38.080 --> 16:44.080
Put on floret african and her arm drapes onto steel fibers along nerves.

16:44.080 --> 16:48.080
Her love fills the zinc bottle of its own body.

16:48.080 --> 16:55.080
Peel me a woody base, wick the piano away from the sweet peak of Duke's pumade.

16:55.080 --> 16:59.080
Black can be quiet and contain the whole thing.

16:59.080 --> 17:16.080
What is a part, what is a part and not hard and hard and not a part?

17:16.080 --> 17:21.080
Welding Irvine, 1943 to 2002.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.080
Please forgive the long silence.

17:24.080 --> 17:29.080
In my gut, which is the blue flame of the stovetop, the broken lands of fear

17:29.080 --> 17:34.080
quakes my liver and my name means not celebration and critique, but concealment

17:34.080 --> 17:38.080
with the dogon called Obea.

17:38.080 --> 17:44.080
And so I take myself into myself, that long ribbon folded inside the cowry shell.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
I'm a massive animal.

17:46.080 --> 17:51.080
The torsion in the muscles of my neck serve up the image of a malcontented demon.

17:51.080 --> 17:56.080
And I suck my own grave through my sinuous mantle groove.

20:52.080 --> 20:59.080
First, tar's vinegar warmth euphoria nodding off, followed by automat cheeseburgers in vanilla milkshake.

20:59.080 --> 21:05.080
The only black kid in the school picture far away swim look in the thread of his eye.

21:05.080 --> 21:10.080
Japanese love cool struttin, white legs, black A-line fifth avenue.

21:10.080 --> 21:17.080
As demons douse metallic nodules, a stylus pins, cold porter and a Pullman quarter.

21:17.080 --> 21:22.080
What seems like a right hand with blue tabula is actually sunny Clark,

21:22.080 --> 21:26.080
waking up from his vomit when he sees what he's leaving behind.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.080
Only the right cord is perfect labor.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.080
Everything with sunny Clark is weakness.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.080
He's a city and a forest in folded quill.

21:35.080 --> 21:49.080
Tranquilize with the black lung and tar black the most aristocratic color of all.

22:05.080 --> 22:24.080
Ten burns.

22:24.080 --> 22:37.080
There's no such thing as bot music but there's such a thing as progress, Coleman Hawkins.

22:37.080 --> 22:46.080
Although jazzes sepia acetates and lacquers have dipped the black into silver nitrate and are faded little faders, they inflate like lungs.

22:46.080 --> 22:55.080
The pink lung with its tortoise shell shellac appears to bulge and its inseam exhales purity and inhales spoonfuls of tempo.

22:55.080 --> 22:59.080
Purity and jazz sir is thwarted and unutilized.

22:59.080 --> 23:04.080
Two hundred years of minstrel snapping their red suspenders corrode and oxidize the air.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.080
Mr. Tambo, what kind of a girl was she?

23:07.080 --> 23:13.080
Zip, she was highly polished, yes indeed, her father was a varnish maker.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.080
You see that rubber pork chop became something.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.080
It's supposed to be funny, by the way.

23:19.080 --> 23:27.080
Bishay shimmy shawable from its mold has been heated and mounted face to face with a hinge so that the machine opens up facing you.

23:27.080 --> 23:33.080
It is not lighter or inter-metso frozen like trout beneath the flux and ratamacuing of ice.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.080
It is not alpine.

23:35.080 --> 23:42.080
Aing and schlaff and olf der lauer, oben east der alte ritter.

23:42.080 --> 23:49.080
Through the cracked photos breaking into creosote, superlatives doused the monoliths, virtuoso, genius.

23:49.080 --> 23:53.080
But there is a siphoning off of licking pink jam from the knife.

23:53.080 --> 24:00.080
Negativities, the integrated bands, for example, of alcoholics, benzedrin, heads, and junkies,

24:00.080 --> 24:05.080
or the deranged catastrophe of buddy-bold and feeding his hand to a ceiling fan,

24:05.080 --> 24:11.080
or the wicks saturated with amphetamines, or buddy-rich telling the trumpet section of fuck faces

24:11.080 --> 24:14.080
and plink them every seven bars like a neutered werewolf.

24:14.080 --> 24:20.080
When Coleman Hawkins stood half nude like a mango and Friedlander's photo, 1956,

24:20.080 --> 24:25.080
with his curved man-breast sweating from it may not be true, he appears modern.

24:25.080 --> 24:29.080
He is not a man-cane nostalgic item logistical.

24:29.080 --> 24:34.080
He, lung of air-rate, propulsive tub, urgently pumping 9ths,

24:34.080 --> 24:38.080
is the living demonic fuse ripping through a blanket of vanilla radio.

24:38.080 --> 24:42.080
Racial animus and tractable sources, faded scriptures,

24:42.080 --> 24:46.080
the pinstripes of the story-ville mudheads, midwives, and the peach tin types

24:46.080 --> 24:49.080
fitted into ladies' brooches are not jazz.

24:49.080 --> 24:54.080
This strategy does not puff the uvula's blowpipe or bring an axe to the vanguard.

24:54.080 --> 24:59.080
Rather, it's shuffle-bucks, pantomimes, and dab slop with a hanky.

24:59.080 --> 25:04.080
Meanwhile, as the onyx rattlesnake of the century slid by 1960,

25:04.080 --> 25:06.080
the year the fedora went up the flu,

25:06.080 --> 25:09.080
jazz, too, opened like a fire in a woman's ceremony.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.080
It did not end.

25:11.080 --> 25:16.080
Euler had yet to drag the black river into rivulets of need.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.080
Unkempt skinny dips, red vinyl seats of the southern buses,

25:19.080 --> 25:24.080
and the vinegar cloud of the tree's harpsichords were made too of a jazz.

25:24.080 --> 25:28.080
As the bus ate the road's tape measure, the ballrooms closed,

25:28.080 --> 25:34.080
the hickory house sewed 52nd street into a fly-trap enmeshed with liquid static.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.080
The green river you ignore is realized by the black river,

25:37.080 --> 25:40.080
growing wings beneath the shoulder blades of the hatchling.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.080
Coleman Hawkins, who morphs with allular quills into a hawk.

25:44.080 --> 25:48.080
Dark, pitagile marks on underwings, present on all ages and races,

25:48.080 --> 25:52.080
conjured shadows beyond the last section of the long film.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.080
You're afraid of listening to this lady?

25:54.080 --> 25:58.080
He, too, with parade-flowed head, eyes like flashing Lindyhoppers,

25:58.080 --> 26:02.080
lunging with the lumpy fabric of the past, pushing a gauge,

26:02.080 --> 26:10.080
a deuce of blips, blood stream lushes of vipers more righteous than scumpthein codification.

26:10.080 --> 26:14.080
In closing, sir, the reed was always remoisted while you were in the booth,

26:14.080 --> 26:19.080
cutting the montage sequence, but the pink sequence of Bessie Smith quenched

26:19.080 --> 26:23.080
with yielding limelight to disappear to dust like eighth notes.

26:23.080 --> 26:33.080
My buttony jacks and the tongue spits out the disc's rainbow.

29:23.080 --> 29:41.080
Empowered cadaver at Lewis Porter.

29:41.080 --> 29:47.080
Absolutely.

29:47.080 --> 29:52.080
He who travels learns, Rome a proder.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.080
Django means I awake.

29:54.080 --> 30:00.080
This verdon wheels its wood spokes through scrollwork indigos,

30:00.080 --> 30:05.080
and a transparent red stove glows by the blanket when a horse clops to the center of the moon,

30:05.080 --> 30:09.080
where Belgium is born, the Manusch, the Mecc King Jones.

30:09.080 --> 30:15.080
To wake up in a caravan with a plower viola, canvas-covered hatch means to exist.

30:15.080 --> 30:20.080
But if we exist at the frontier robbing chickens perhaps, flirting with the viola,

30:20.080 --> 30:25.080
violet, or draca grape and sloshing around in purple liquid.

30:25.080 --> 30:30.080
A hedgehog has barbed arter-chokes skin and hides under its anointed bush.

30:30.080 --> 30:34.080
Stuff him with rosemary time and wild garlic over a roasting pit through the clay,

30:34.080 --> 30:37.080
with lacho robin and a savory liver.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.080
To awake to see the window and the horse-drawn air,

30:40.080 --> 30:44.080
to awake to the dark muzet and the purple vaults.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.080
A hedgehog winds his piston by the chimney,

30:47.080 --> 30:52.080
and gripelli and Reinhardt screaming fragrant honey under the sky's purple canvas.

30:52.080 --> 30:55.080
The sound gets to be part of your body.

30:55.080 --> 30:59.080
Lester Young sleeping with his horns when Billy wasn't there.

30:59.080 --> 31:04.080
Black faucet, black suede, Django Reinhardt, the guitar superman.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.080
His black moustaches sip the milk foam.

31:08.080 --> 31:12.080
No one listening to him turn a girl into a puddle has ever complained.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.080
Look to the side and he'll be there.

33:42.080 --> 33:47.080
Disassembled parts of the base clarinet.

33:47.080 --> 33:55.080
One.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.080
Aerophone, over-blow.

33:58.080 --> 34:03.080
Grenadilla, cylindrical boar, sassafrass, Contra-based, orange tiger roar.

34:03.080 --> 34:07.080
Harry, Carney, half-hole, Bitch's brew, resin, cousin,

34:07.080 --> 34:11.080
Mary, Eric, Dolphy, grapefruit stew, Rosen.

34:11.080 --> 34:15.080
Neither a dry sound or the white rice paper mask,

34:15.080 --> 34:19.080
but swallowing the moon, the notes drink like grapes.

34:19.080 --> 34:24.080
The Newark photographer says that when he was a kid, there were 12 or 13 movie theaters downtown.

34:24.080 --> 34:30.080
Now only a tiny porn theater, a spits distance from the museum shows octaves of skin.

34:30.080 --> 34:34.080
Part of the lip stretches behind the knee, smooth as a mercury reissue,

34:34.080 --> 34:39.080
and the precipice glistening like a roll glaze has been pushed up and down across

34:39.080 --> 34:42.080
the surface of the surface.

34:42.080 --> 34:47.080
The dough gone where purple fringes and their pearl millets

34:47.080 --> 34:52.080
sing vessels of donkeys bearing caratatives.

34:52.080 --> 34:58.080
Like the sandstone, bendigara, all rectilinear with masks secured by the teeth.

34:58.080 --> 35:01.080
Four flutes roll off their center.

35:01.080 --> 35:05.080
The cakes filling plastered, not a sigh exactly longer,

35:05.080 --> 35:09.080
but a piece of barbecued peaches.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.080
White and red altars catch clouds.

35:12.080 --> 35:16.080
As that with Braxton means, I shook hands with elven Jones

35:16.080 --> 35:21.080
and with Lawrence D. Butch Morris, the cavernous filaments of the downtown room

35:21.080 --> 35:24.080
like a limb soaking in a barrel.

35:24.080 --> 35:28.080
An article said, the amount of female granaries is an indication

35:28.080 --> 35:31.080
for the amount of women living in Guinea.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.080
As nougat-like pomade yelled, the girl can't help it.

35:35.080 --> 35:39.080
Coltrane likewise said whatever he'd say about Eric Dolfi would be understatement.

35:39.080 --> 35:45.080
Newerks dry rot and magnesium flares show litter and the bare branches of a maple.

35:45.080 --> 35:50.080
Some looters return with armfuls of candy, coolade, and water guns.

35:50.080 --> 35:56.080
The late photo of Saravon shows black triangles arranged like Batman villainous.

35:56.080 --> 36:01.080
Years ago, her carefree loafers and red Parisian mime stripes swung easy.

36:01.080 --> 36:05.080
The liner notes reveal that she could have succeeded in the classical field.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.080
Wayne Shorter would say, what's happening?

36:08.080 --> 36:12.080
And she'd say Newark, and that was enough because you know what Newark does to people.

36:12.080 --> 36:16.080
Mel Torme reports that she kind of got huffy when he said operatic,

36:16.080 --> 36:19.080
and then she said, do you mean jazz isn't legit?

36:19.080 --> 36:22.080
You might say that powders are being crushed in the mortar

36:22.080 --> 36:27.080
like some of the purple splay like limbs, the embracing limbs.

36:27.080 --> 36:32.080
For a while, poetry did not interest me with its flailing, corruption, boredom,

36:32.080 --> 36:35.080
obsequiousness, and general green color.

36:35.080 --> 36:39.080
It was a cloak used for taunting by everyone, assholes all.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.080
Flaubert thought the same thing about the bourgeoisie.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.080
Nothing is ever the same as they said it was.

36:44.080 --> 36:48.080
Blue lights of her hair vertical, the gray pearls of her neck,

36:48.080 --> 36:53.080
and the purple lights of her hair were very colorful to the place, better or worse,

36:53.080 --> 36:55.080
where eyes penetrate.

36:55.080 --> 37:02.080
Bear forks, glitter, swan glasses hiding among the bushes, sort of feeling your way.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.080
Arbus said the hand is the cutting edge of the mind.

37:05.080 --> 37:10.080
Flawed animals, meat, and buns and slaw, she sort of lifted up her hips

37:10.080 --> 37:15.080
so the rims of the bones were elevated, a sort of hand clasp of braided chestnut.

37:15.080 --> 37:19.080
Rather than non-vocal to the bone, she pulled his shoulders forward hovering.

37:19.080 --> 37:25.080
During rehearsal, the wordless word was loosely creased, where the lowest part of the hip is hooked to the curve.

37:25.080 --> 37:29.080
Roland Kirk's no tonic press has a double meaning.

37:29.080 --> 37:34.080
The first note in the scale in the double gin Lester Young was drinking without quinine water.

37:34.080 --> 37:39.080
Circumference of lemon like the brim of the hat, blooming into focus in the film.

37:39.080 --> 37:43.080
I gather dry kindling on the snowy mountain slope.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.080
White where the branches gather in my hand.

37:46.080 --> 37:53.080
Wood has dropped its pieces with trees along the way, where the couple walks the trail inside the creamy sand.

37:53.080 --> 38:00.080
The bassist said the action on the bass was high, vertically so, so that the elastic boom made for instant decay.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.080
Threadgill says tubas can control the decay and attack.

38:03.080 --> 38:07.080
Tubas blend with everything, whereas the bass doesn't blend.

38:07.080 --> 38:11.080
Brass will cut through anything, you have to wait on the bass.

38:11.080 --> 38:15.080
A tuba player, he says, can shut it down because it's wind.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.080
The bass player said during a long jam, he never gets a break.

38:18.080 --> 38:25.080
The glass of Pepsi has water already dripping down the side of the glass, from the ice skating in the armful of warm air.

38:25.080 --> 38:33.080
A woman bends to pat a multi-stripe cat, liquid gray, who prances between the aisles, listless and revolting with mystery.

38:33.080 --> 38:38.080
She loves the horrendous creature, whose eyes glow, yellow like a vial of pernow.

38:38.080 --> 38:44.080
Its tail upright plucking an e-minor because the story has become more complicated than when we left the house.

38:44.080 --> 38:51.080
Miles played in Tokyo and then Berlin, former scorched sectors, alighted in the terror-bot scopes.

38:51.080 --> 38:59.080
In Tokyo, in March 9, 1945, we, Americans, burned to death 100,000 people in a single night.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.080
Men, women and children.

39:01.080 --> 39:07.080
On July 14, 1964, Sam Rivers channeled T-bone Walker, among the velvet echoes,

39:07.080 --> 39:10.080
a cosine Anken hall.

39:10.080 --> 39:15.080
The dogan say that we should remember, God has no external ears.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.080
She cuffs her hands.

39:17.080 --> 39:22.080
Babies are like waterflowers who do cool leaves from the tubs of their eyes.

39:22.080 --> 39:25.080
Our ways of living differ.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.080
Two.

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
Think of swaggers on off switch.

39:31.080 --> 39:37.080
Weldon Irvine said many of the young rappers got disconnected from a tradition of protest

39:37.080 --> 39:40.080
and decided to rap about mayhem in order to get paid.

39:40.080 --> 39:47.080
You can tell the political orientation of the bus driver by whether he says Lenox Avenue or Malcolm X Boulevard when he announces the stop.

39:47.080 --> 39:52.080
The large blue and white wheels slapped the painted curb covered with slush.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.080
November 80.

39:54.080 --> 39:57.080
I walked to school not knowing how to play with.

39:57.080 --> 40:02.080
I decided not unlike John Gilmour at Birdland 1956 to play Contra.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.080
We play against everything in the blaze of a hearth.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.080
We got the concept.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.080
We got the concept.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.080
We got conceptual.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.080
I'm on East 80th Street.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.080
The whir of pigeons have delicate lavender pockets around their eyes.

40:16.080 --> 40:22.080
They ground themselves in the spring of city dust as a pillowy aplomb among the air's granules.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.080
Of a city in its puzzle pieces, many tongue embraceable.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.080
Two men are dancing in a bar.

40:28.080 --> 40:33.080
It's 1130 according to the wall's cold aged Genesee Beer clock.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.080
They're dressed in 1980 styles.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.080
Valor and floppy existential caps.

40:38.080 --> 40:43.080
The shadows of the men's bodies are cast on the jukebox behind and their joy.

40:43.080 --> 40:46.080
What do you know about the forgotten ones?

40:46.080 --> 40:52.080
Try to understand the beautiful bodies, peeling pain and upturned peaches from a Marxist perspective.

40:52.080 --> 40:54.080
Why this city?

40:54.080 --> 40:57.080
Dactritus, denitations and detonations?

40:57.080 --> 41:00.080
Why the snail shell, uncomfortable water?

41:00.080 --> 41:04.080
The caramel tone of Saravon and the air is punctuated by wings.

41:04.080 --> 41:08.080
Instead of limbs, wings slice through at 80 degrees,

41:08.080 --> 41:12.080
assaulting through the sky's catapult, salted in polychrome.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.080
I'd like to be away from 1980 for a while and see its chemical pinks

41:16.080 --> 41:21.080
stripping from the unfeeling dinosaur eye of the iridescent pigeons.

41:21.080 --> 41:24.080
Another time from above or below.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.080
I will not take my father's footsteps.

41:26.080 --> 41:30.080
A miner's helmet with its bulb pierced with a tack and driftwood.

41:30.080 --> 41:34.080
Around a wall, the light bounces on a mirror with its white cotton.

41:34.080 --> 41:37.080
You are encased in the city's steel tub.

41:37.080 --> 41:43.080
Washboards scrap, empty grape drink bottle, frail, fall, literal, burnished.

41:43.080 --> 41:56.080
Do you feel the calm chewing the marrow from the gains the city has made?

41:56.080 --> 41:59.080
A half city moves along the mouth of a canal.

41:59.080 --> 42:04.080
You are living inside its corridors, breathing the air shaft smell of a fish bone.

42:04.080 --> 42:08.080
Your limbs reach across the threshold down the hallway of metal doors.

42:08.080 --> 42:14.080
It is that multi-hued avenue that comes at the park's edge after a mollusks snowdrift away from the window.

42:14.080 --> 42:19.080
Model jams coated in conceivable rust, the pigeons' peppery throats,

42:19.080 --> 42:25.080
blushed like the sorcerers bending the tab rings of their cans and all echoes.

42:25.080 --> 42:30.080
It is not only pushers and gathering places, storefront churches, crates of apples.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.080
We should not be east of the park, but no one knows we're here.

42:33.080 --> 42:38.080
If it is the paradise or the omni, swaying along the velvet curtain of the sky.

42:38.080 --> 42:43.080
Beyond the rooftops, I see the families create a father's day picnic out of a card table,

42:43.080 --> 42:49.080
boombox, a ginger ale, boxes of chicken, a dominoes game, clamped to a dude's lecture.

42:49.080 --> 42:54.080
I would run from the 125th Street Station down the sustained line of the sidewalk

42:54.080 --> 42:58.080
and wait for the elevator that stops to raise its pulley and flywheel

42:58.080 --> 43:02.080
and drop my trapezoid body and raise to the apartment to caress your hair

43:02.080 --> 43:05.080
or to let up or simply hold on.

43:05.080 --> 43:10.080
It is a familiar curvature, the places of valley, the cathedrals east.

43:10.080 --> 43:15.080
The same streets reach out in the same places to open the same mirrored lobbies.

43:15.080 --> 43:20.080
We arrive at the place where the wife relaxes and folds her legs on the floor in conjecture

43:20.080 --> 43:22.080
at all the sidewalks traversed.

43:22.080 --> 43:26.080
She has me, a partner who knows that her memories are bubbles,

43:26.080 --> 43:31.080
that we see a far-fetched capital lift and break through tenements and wish like a creed

43:31.080 --> 43:35.080
we would travel along rifts and octaves to hear the doorbells and bird coos

43:35.080 --> 43:41.080
or feel the extraordinary orange of the Florida sun, a woman clutching an orange pill bottle,

43:41.080 --> 43:47.080
and we go along the snake like name-six and the keratin hooves of the city can always relieve us.

43:47.080 --> 43:53.080
We have people sitting around understanding the bubbles gloss anywhere the fragile numb inheritances.

43:53.080 --> 43:58.080
Answer the launching terrors, her axes and closet doors she remembers.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.080
We will burst them all along.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.080
A calm despair is the essence of wisdom.

46:02.080 --> 46:06.080
This string, she's moved over an air current.

46:06.080 --> 46:13.080
Now they rewind a latex balloon in Newark like a vacated building, the place rebricked for chump dimes,

46:13.080 --> 46:16.080
its thrennities slicing hammer.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.080
These strings preach at a husting.

46:18.080 --> 46:24.080
Pluck your needs from their housings, dive with your funnel to the back of the land in deep

46:24.080 --> 46:27.080
and fracture the unbodied air.

46:27.080 --> 46:33.080
This is about thick blood for a ghost in hues of sickle shaped jets.

46:33.080 --> 46:40.080
Listening to Cat Edmondson with R, Portis head in the car with N, but this quartet brings them back

46:40.080 --> 46:58.080
when the tenor's potato mash-er explodes above the trench.

47:11.080 --> 47:14.080
The clarinet.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.080
All the klezmer bands used it when they eased themselves down from dark.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.080
Down, down, down, down.

47:22.080 --> 47:26.080
Prospero broke his black staff and Van Glorious light beamed out.

47:26.080 --> 47:32.080
The fairy light, slave light, shallow mow blue, music foot flatted the New Englander barn.

47:32.080 --> 47:37.080
Moon thin and rumbled bass, yeses and linets and sounded out vanilla sugar.

47:37.080 --> 47:43.080
Quavers of cholera turas made tint and abulation and eler ganda was the valve trombone and guitar,

47:43.080 --> 47:48.080
hush hush in the background and got cool quiet and wake the blues.

47:48.080 --> 48:11.080
Listen, listen and the light come through.

50:18.080 --> 50:43.080
The sweet obsession bleeds from Singer.

50:43.080 --> 50:46.080
Singer is dead today and in the ground forever.

50:46.080 --> 50:52.080
How astonishing his blue vapor is seeping, not consuming itself outward from his honey and body.

50:52.080 --> 50:57.080
He is buried in fine linen in the old style and his saxophone is engraved as a tiger lily.

50:57.080 --> 51:04.080
There was love in him. His love was not a wild stag nor fragrant oils nor hills of cinnamon.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.080
It was a light through the ocean, cool and content.

51:07.080 --> 51:11.080
He handed this poem to me and was born, sifting up to the surface.

51:11.080 --> 51:16.080
All the passions of my organs are soft doorways, the garden turns inside out.

51:16.080 --> 51:20.080
One dreams white as a sky, one black and crowded as trees.

51:20.080 --> 51:24.080
Each with a door, a rude odor, a reed.

51:24.080 --> 51:29.080
Remember him, darkest eyes playing like hell in the mountains, love like that blue,

51:29.080 --> 51:32.080
making up in depth for what it lacked in brightness.

51:32.080 --> 51:36.080
We will not speak of love with him again.

51:36.080 --> 51:57.540
Coming by a

52:36.080 --> 52:38.080
You

53:06.080 --> 53:08.080
You

53:36.080 --> 53:38.080
You

53:48.080 --> 53:50.080
Elintonia

53:50.080 --> 53:54.080
In the lamp caught fire after he put a blue cashmere sweater over it

53:54.080 --> 53:57.080
Settled as a Nance Obligado on Filmy Violin

53:57.080 --> 53:59.080
Two brown curves and puss on

53:59.080 --> 54:03.080
Perfling's ease sound out of the stank of violin parts

54:03.080 --> 54:08.080
Belly, waist, chinrest, ribs, sound hole, peg box, tailpiece, rounded shoulder

54:08.080 --> 54:12.080
Ellington was an expert on them all

54:12.080 --> 54:17.080
Belly's straight round would wake up, composed for four hours, would wake Duke

54:17.080 --> 54:22.080
Blood count or a ballad for very tired and very sad lotus eaters, for example

54:22.080 --> 54:27.080
And he'd bring his golden torso up and finish off the rest of the composition

54:27.080 --> 54:32.080
In the morning after composing all night, Duke would open the closet full of blue cashmere sweaters

54:32.080 --> 54:34.080
Orkshrews playing the next morning

54:34.080 --> 54:38.080
Plucky, plug ugly, pudselana, porous and perfect blues

54:38.080 --> 54:44.080
Daffton, Dilea, Boulians, Diabutsu, Eir, Damsel, Fish, Ectogenesis

54:44.080 --> 54:49.080
Darden, Ells, Edge, Darksamite, Demonax, Ellipse, Desirus, Empire

54:49.080 --> 54:53.080
Dobelio, Hippis, Dove, Talis, Ballyar

54:53.080 --> 54:57.080
Salieri, Ease, Drop, Mozart, Playing a word sex game

54:57.080 --> 55:05.080
Just then the creamy squeezing oboe, Exalted unbolted, Kima, Philo, Omblada, Plum, Beautiful music, the color of blonde night

55:05.080 --> 55:11.080
Red plum jam on Pumpernickel, a Puerto Rican hermaphrodite, putting on pink lip gloss

55:11.080 --> 55:18.080
Wednesday night, Ellington, who could fulfill the slightest discolored saxophrage leaf, easing between two rocks

55:18.080 --> 55:22.080
Heard through a catnap and half dozen chewed pencil tips

55:22.080 --> 55:25.080
The baby green sweet pea, Billy exhale

55:25.080 --> 55:33.080
Blue through blue duke, Dims passed on to accept that place which comes to each of us alone

55:55.080 --> 56:05.080
Blue through blue, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ballyar

56:25.080 --> 56:35.080
Blue through blue, Ellington, Pumpernickel, Ballyar

56:55.080 --> 56:57.080
So

57:25.080 --> 57:27.080
You

57:55.080 --> 57:57.080
You

58:25.080 --> 58:27.080
You

58:55.080 --> 58:57.080
You

58:57.080 --> 58:59.080
You

58:59.080 --> 59:01.080
You

59:20.080 --> 59:22.080
Thank you very much

59:22.080 --> 59:24.080
Thank you

59:27.080 --> 59:29.080
Thank you

59:33.080 --> 59:39.080
I'm in the remaining time I'd be happy to address any questions you have or we would if there are any

59:39.080 --> 59:56.080
Well, it's a work of fiction so it's a character but similar to the writer but sometimes

59:56.080 --> 01:00:03.080
Not a tribute per se but sometimes in literature rather than

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:13.080
Confront unstable or unsavory or unpleasant topics you could do it through a character or a mask or some type of device to

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:20.080
Increase the psychic distance between the writer and the subject matter

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:27.080
So this character can be killed off he can do things that I wouldn't do

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:36.080
And also the double play on the meaning of the word singer was just a useful device so that's what that was

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.080
It's like Woody Allen they always ask him that is that based on your

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.080
Albie Singer from

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:47.080
But I mean even more recent films like his film from the 80s and 90s they always say that based on your life

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.080
You could say that it's just based on somebody who happens to go out with younger women

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.080
One of them happens to be a student of his or maybe a step door or something

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.080
But you could say it's a little like me but it's not really

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080
Yeah

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.080
Please use the microphone if you want to ask a question or comment so we can get you out of hand

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.080
One other question

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080
Ragi?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080
Yes?

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.080
I just want to say that I enjoy the music and poetry done together

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.080
But this is a question for the cast

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.080
Is the music original composition?

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.080
I'm just trying to hear if there were any other things to pick up from other songs

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.080
Which I didn't hear

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.080
But I don't know what all the compositions were you're on?

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.080
I made up all of them just now except for a few things

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.080
This one is kind of like a New Orleans blues

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.080
So even though I made it up it's within a very set format

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.080
And this was body and soul

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.080
And this is really based on all of me but I didn't really play it much

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.080
It really goes

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.080
Let's go

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.080
I'm not too old for me

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.080
Can't you see

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.080
But I didn't really play that

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:20.080
So it was all improvised but for those three I used so long forms that I'm familiar with

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.080
The rest I just made up and people sometimes tell me they say

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:27.080
Some of those were pretty good you should try and remember them and use them again

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.080
Maybe I'll listen back and see

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.080
You have a few other questions

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:40.080
I mean I do a lot of composing in fact I've done everything from short jazz tunes to symphony orchestra works

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.080
So I do a lot of composing it depends whether if I think it was good enough to save

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.080
Then I'll work on it and write it down

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.080
Rob you had a question?

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.080
Yeah, other questions for this kind of collaboration of a poet and a penis like this

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:56.080
Working together reciting and then

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.080
Whether it's jazz poetry collaborations since at least the 20s

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.080
Langston Hughes, Hart Crane, Kenneth Rexroth, Kenneth Patchin

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.080
Carowack and so on and so forth

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:18.080
But the two of us have done this a few times at various places

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.080
Cornelius Street once and I think at Rutgers once

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.080
So there's a precedent

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:25.080
This is more and more of it

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.080
My friend Vijay Arya who's a lately very successful jazz pianist

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.080
He used to do a lot of that in the 90s

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.080
He doesn't do that much anymore I don't think he's got a lot of gigs with his own band now

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.080
But the first time I saw him he was playing with a Mary Baraka

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.080
Exactly

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.080
But I will say this the thing about the earlier days

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.080
Through the 50s a lot of times what the jazz musicians did with the poets

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.080
It just played tunes that they had already rehearsed

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.080
So it's only more recently that you see people doing what we are doing

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.080
Where I'm just kind of listening and trying to see what will go with that

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:06.080
Some of the older collaborations are really just preset tunes that they just

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.080
Say okay here's a tune that we already play

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.080
So that might go well with this poem of yours

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.080
So to actually improvise at all is not that common maybe

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:21.080
I like the conversation

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:27.080
The problem was that it was frustrating not to go over words

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:34.080
So it was something about the balance between the piano and the recitation

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.080
Yeah that's why I kept asking you if we had it

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.080
Well it's an imperfect system

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.080
We could still work on that

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.080
You have to scream more when you're reading your poems

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:51.080
I would suggest something that you might want to prove of

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:59.080
And that is reading the poems before having the accomplished improvisation

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.080
You mean read it once and then once with the piano

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.080
So I think of that idea

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.080
Some of them don't want to hear the poem twice

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.080
How many people would like that idea of hearing the poem twice?

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080
Some people would like that

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.080
How many people are too busy?

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.080
Life is too short they don't need to hear it twice

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.080
Come on, you're busy right? I understand

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.080
Another option might be to put the piano further away from the poet

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.080
And then you know the spotlight on you and your solvents

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.080
I had a really hard time hearing it

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.080
In addition to the logistics of the thing

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:43.080
They're very clearly dense complex things that I've written

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.080
So even if I read it twice I don't know

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.080
It might improve it a little but I don't know how much that would do

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.080
His poems are very erudite, they reflect a lot of knowledge

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.080
And a lot of knowledge of the history of poetry

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:57.080
So there is a lot of detail in them

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:03.080
It's not like poetry slam where you can understand it

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.080
The minute you hear it

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080
I have a question for each of you though

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.080
That wasn't a question

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.080
In terms of when you play the piano

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.080
Are you improvising as you go along

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.080
Or have you already read the poems prior to

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.080
Is this the first time you're hearing the poems?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
It's a good question

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:27.080
We actually talked about that because

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.080
You know I have the book

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.080
Which won all the prizes

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.080
And I have a chapbook that other thing of yours

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.080
So I have some of his poems

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.080
I've read them and enjoy them

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.080
I feel like I know something about poetry

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.080
I know something about the way poetry is structured and all this

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.080
But we actually talked about whether I should have the poems in front of me

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.080
Because I certainly don't know any of the poems

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080
Well enough time I would know them by heart

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080
You know so

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.080
And we decided that could actually be distracting for me

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.080
So we decided not to do it that way

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.080
And essentially I'm hearing the poems for the first time

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.080
Because you know I've read them once or twice

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.080
But it's not like I really know them

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.080
And a question from Mr. Sinner

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.080
I read in your bio your process of creating your poetry

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.080
I read about your own history

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.080
I read about your own history

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.080
But she says the question

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.080
I read in your bio the process of your writing

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
So you write down little snippets of observations

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.080
For a period of time and then it comes to you

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.080
With that process, how many poems do you generate per year?

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080
What would you say?

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:34.080
Well the past several years not as much as I've been writing

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080
Dissertation and doing under things

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.080
But ideally I would write as much as possible

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.080
But in my opinion there are too many already

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:50.080
Too many poems? Yeah, or too many of your poems?

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080
Well in general but I'd rather just be open to it

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.080
And then have it come when it comes

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.080
But theoretically this has not existed

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.080
But I would write every day

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.080
But in reality I try to just do it

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.080
And then I try to do it

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.080
But in reality I try to just do it

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.080
As much as possible

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.080
I think maybe built into her question

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.080
Is the question is that a slow process?

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.080
Yeah, it takes years sometimes for a single poem

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080
I'll work on it and you'll come back to it

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080
I wanted to make a comment about the difficulty

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.080
Understanding some of the words as you were reading

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.080
I read your book of poems twice

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.080
And enjoyed the poems

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080
And found myself enjoying the poems in a different way

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.080
Hearing them presented in this format

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:46.080
And I felt that missing out on some of the words

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.080
That you can get when you're reading

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.080
And there's silence around you

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.080
This was a different experience

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.080
In which in the fence getting all the words wasn't that important

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.080
And the sound of your voice was a kind of a music

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.080
And it was more notes than semantic units

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:06.080
I think if you...

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.080
This verdict is still out on what I'm about to say

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.080
It's my opinion

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:14.080
But I think if you've missed the rhythm in a poem

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080
You've missed the whole ship

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080
I mean the sound is

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.080
The pleasure for the ear is really what I'm there for

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080
A lot of the times

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080
So I like that

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080
But I mean not in all cases

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.080
In all times I guess

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.080
I can't I just don't want to see the thoughts

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.080
And the fun is just because you're doing the poem

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.080
And you're about giving the non-inspirational audience

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.080
So that's one

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.080
I have a better idea

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.080
Everyone in the audience has to

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.080
Has to buy the poems

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080
Yeah

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.080
Good one, huh? What do you think? Good?

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:50.080
I think the...

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.080
You know, one of my CDs

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080
And then you play together when you get home

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.080
What the hell? Don't even stay for the performance

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.080
That's it, I'm going home

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.080
I mean ideally these would require multiple readings

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.080
Or whatever

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080
We do

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080
A kind of version of that

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080
I have a two-part question

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080
And I was wondering

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080
The structure of jazz

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.080
As opposed to the context

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.080
You know of the poetry

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
And I don't know much about the structure of jazz

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.080
Could you just give us a little

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080
Bit

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080
An inter-dramaticism there

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080
But I know classical music but I don't know

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.080
The structure

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.080
And does it go necessarily with the rhythm

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.080
Of the poetry

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:34.080
And then the context of subject

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.080
I'm going to ask that a little bit differently

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.080
From the way you asked it

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.080
Because

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.080
First of all, in terms of structure

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.080
The thing about jazz is that

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.080
You're improvising over a structure

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080
The structures you're improvising over

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.080
Not so different from classical music structures

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080
So we'll talk about the first theme

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.080
The second theme

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.080
But we're improvising really on the harm

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.080
And use of those themes

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080
Jazz we always say

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080
Goldberg variations

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Are closer to jazz

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.080
Than most forms in classical music

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.080
Because he takes a harmony

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.080
And does 32 amazing

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.080
Different ways of playing over that harmony

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.080
So that's kind of what we do

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.080
But I also do free improvisation

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.080
Because I am a composer also

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.080
And I'm well versed in classical music

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.080
So one thing I did, I don't quite remember what it was

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.080
But it was kind of a debussy kind of thing

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:28.080
And I remember something like...

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.080
Music

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.080
Music

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.080
Music

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.080
Music

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080
Debussy, you know, I'm thinking about Debussy

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.080
You know, Debussy was

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.080
A lot of composers will say he's the inventor

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.080
Of modern music, you know

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.080
And he composed of even Stavinsky

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.080
So Debussy was like a god to him

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080
And I don't know if you know this

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.080
But Stavinsky showed the right of spring piano version

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.080
That he was using, not the orchestral

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.080
But Stavinsky was playing it on the piano to accompany the dancers

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080
And he showed it to Debussy

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080
And Debussy's site read it

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.080
He said, oh, this is rather good

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.080
And Stavinsky was looking at him

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.080
You can read that at site, you know

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.080
It was a whole new kind of music

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.080
But so it doesn't really...

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.080
Because the whole idea of Debussy

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.080
Is to get a sound that you like

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.080
And he would use something that I sometimes call them

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.080
Cluster chords. This one happens to be a diminished chord

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080
This one happens to be a dominant chord

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.080
But it's...

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.080
This is not jazz

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.080
You understand? So you can't make that comparison

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.080
My point is when I do that

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.080
I'm not doing the jazz thing

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.080
I'm not taking a set harmony and improvising over it

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.080
I'm improvising the whole thing including the harmony

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.080
In the style that

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.080
It happened to be a little like Debussy

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:50.080
It was me, but it happened to be inspired by Debussy

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.080
It's like composition, but spontaneous

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.080
Not everybody can do that

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.080
I mean, I happen to be

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080
A very familiar classical music

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080
And I like doing that kind of thing

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.080
So that's different, that's not a jazz thing

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.080
I think with the poems also, I want to try to create

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.080
It's artificial to some extent

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.080
But I create a situation that seems like it was inevitable

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:12.080
But also somehow spontaneous

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.080
The context

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.080
Well, there's a way that it sounds

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.080
The way the lines are broken, etc

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.080
The subject, the context

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080
Do you address that?

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.080
I try to, but I just want to say something about that

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.080
Which is that most poets, not only poets

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.080
But almost anybody who accompany

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.080
Whether it's a pipe work with dancers

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.080
You do things for film sometimes

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.080
Don't like it if you try to catch every nuance

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.080
Because then, could you read it?

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080
When it's thunder and he plays it

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.080
You don't want that

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.080
They don't like it if you go and try to emulate it

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.080
He says, then I heard the blues

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:56.080
And then I heard some thunder

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.080
But then it started to rain

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.080
It sounds funny afterwards

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.080
It's like a desire of thunder

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080
There's a skeleton

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.080
Yeah, it sounds silly

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.080
And by the way, in the film business

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.080
They used to call that Mickey Mouse thing

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.080
They maybe they still do

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080
Because the idea is that in cartoons

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080
You do that, but you wouldn't do that in a serious thing

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:18.080
So we have talked about that

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080
Yeah, that's what I'm getting at

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.080
So we have talked about that

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
And so what I try to do

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.080
It's a little hard since I'm not so familiar with this poetry

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.080
And some of them are things I hadn't read before

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080
But certainly the ones I read before

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.080
As soon as I heard the beginning

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080
I kind of had a sense, okay, is this a dark mood?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080
Is it a light mood? Is it a blue?

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.080
I just mentioned the blues

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.080
You know, this kind of thing

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.080
So in that sense, I try to do the overall mood of it

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080
But not try to catch every little nuance

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.080
And I was trying to play very softly behind them too

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080
With the soft pedal on here

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080
I have two comments

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.080
One is to combine

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.080
And you said make a CD

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.080
And you should combine it and make the poetry CD

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.080
So we could take it with us

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080
Good idea

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080
And the second part was

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.080
It's now for you

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080
2%

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.080
The other part was, like other people mentioning, your words

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.080
Hard to pick up sometimes

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.080
And then you went into a kind of a

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.080
Philip Glass melodic piece

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.080
That tripped me out and I went to an altered state

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:24.080
I saw you altered

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.080
I noticed you altered when I played

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080
I did it

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.080
Yes

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.080
Yes

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.080
Something like that

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.080
And then I was able to hear the words a lot clearer

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.080
Since I went into an altered state

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.080
And then you could hear it better?

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080
Yeah, yeah

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.080
I dropped out and dropped in

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.080
So what's the problem folks?

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.080
Just alter

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.080
Come on

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080
That's right

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080
Well play more altered music

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.080
Is that so hard?

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080
Come on

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080
Yeah

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080
You're only trying to

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.080
Just having out about the experience

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.080
What's the problem?

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.080
Hang on

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.080
Come on

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.080
Wait

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080
Let's see

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.080
Somebody's happy that you saw an information about me

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.080
I don't think so

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.080
It's on the website I think, right?

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.080
David?

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:17.080
Well there's a description on the announcement of Dr. Zacharounds and Papa Caves

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:19.080
Yeah, and my site is easy to remember

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.080
LewisPorter.com

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080
Do you have a site?

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080
No

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080
No

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.080
These two famous to have a site

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080
Well, and

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:31.080
I also found myself drifting a lot in and out

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:36.080
And sometimes it felt like the reading was competing

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.080
With the music

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.080
And sometimes I stopped listening to the words

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.080
But then I'd come back and

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.080
I'm not sure what to say

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:56.080
I think it would be interesting to study what people hear

01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.080
You know how much I would do that

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.080
And that's not the question

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.080
It's an interesting process

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.080
Listening to both things

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.080
And sometimes

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.080
You know, I wonder why people

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.080
Either go into altered states or trip out into reverie

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.080
What in the music, what in the poetry, what in their collaboration

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080
I don't know, but just

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.080
I'm myself thinking of all these things

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.080
It was very pleasurable

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.080
All the time

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.080
Whatever, not understanding what I say about feeling that they were

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.080
In some instances competing for my attention

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.080
You know, I went in good places, I always came back

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:43.080
I never felt like, gee, I missed something, I don't know, I'm sure I did

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080
I missed a lot of the poetry

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.080
I don't necessarily feel that the language or the words

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.080
Sort of takes supremacy

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.080
I think there's a deliberate interaction and a kind of

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:56.080
As you described, it was better, but give and take

01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.080
Where you might hear that more certain moments

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.080
Or whatever

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.080
Yeah, and I think also, you know, maybe

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080
When we're really successful

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.080
You'll hear both at the same time, but that certainly would be different from person to person

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.080
And another thing is that

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.080
But I am also doing certain specific things

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.080
Like you might notice, I don't do any of my fast stuff while he's reading

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:20.080
So certain rules, I just have certain rules for myself

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.080
Nothing really fast while he's reading some of those things

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.080
But my idea is slow is probably most people's idea fast

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.080
So I do play a lot of fast notes

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080
What do you think is that a role to date?

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.080
Would be another way to do it like a couple of the verses

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.080
Well, I did that with a band called the John L. Eric Kelso

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.080
Quirt had its own YouTube

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.080
Oh yeah, I have a quirt, they're like, they play

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.080
I don't know what you call it, Dixie Land kind of style of music

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.080
But that's how we did it, that

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:57.080
Oh yeah, but I mean, I think he means like, line by line almost

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:00.080
Well, yeah, with that, I don't remember exactly what happened

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080
Not necessarily

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.080
I think I read and they played and we kind of did it that way

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:09.080
Well, you know, again, it was my experience, which I didn't completely anticipate

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.080
That you felt more like a duet as if it were two instruments

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.080
And one of the instruments was a vocal chord vibrating

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:26.080
And the sense of the poem wasn't important, as important in this context

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.080
As it would be in a different kind of context

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:36.080
Okay, also it's important to know that poems really should not or can't be paraphrased

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.080
I mean, you've got to sort of experience the whole poem to get the poem

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:46.080
And say, what was it about, the time I journeyed over to Ithaca and well, you know, it doesn't make any sense

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.080
You don't get it that way

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.080
Well, that's a good point, because the whole point is the words that you're using

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.080
It's like I always say Dickens is such an amazing writer of fiction

01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:10.080
You can read the plot summary, if that's all the work to it, then there would be no point to write the novel, you know?

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:16.080
The writers spoke about working over the manuscript a great many times and changing things

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:24.080
But the pianist speaks about doing the improvisation right on the spot and not necessarily being able to repeat it

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:30.080
Now that's two very different views of how to perform this work

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:37.080
Now, would you be willing to write it out, to write out the music and keep changing it

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:44.080
Under different circumstances, or is this what's unique about this presentation

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.080
That you have a poem, let's say, that's been worked over many times

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:52.080
But a piece of music that hasn't been worked over many times

01:20:52.080 --> 01:21:01.080
Well, I mean, in that example, I think you're approaching sort of songwriting with musical accompaniment

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:13.080
I mean, like Cole Porter, for example, that we know his compositions, love for sale, or whatever it was

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:19.080
You know, every time, but like summertime, another example, I read there's 25,000 different versions of it

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080
Recorded versions of it

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.080
Recorded versions of it, and each one is different, but they're all summertime

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.080
So that's how that would work

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.080
And also, I mean, a lot of these poems, I wrote them maybe 10 or 15 years ago

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:38.080
So I have no clue what my mind was like at that moment, I don't know anymore

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:44.080
But occasionally, when I'm reading, I kind of take something out or change it or

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:46.080
Just to amuse myself

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.080
Yeah, well, that's good, if you amuse yourself

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:54.080
But I would also say that that's a different thing, since I do compose

01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:01.080
We could certainly collaborate, I would say I'm going to write a setting of one of your pieces, either with a written out piano

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:09.080
Or a strinkled set, which could be great, hey, you might like that

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.080
On the other side, there are people who improvise poetry

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.080
But you can't improvise the same way that I couldn't write, I couldn't improvise

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.080
What do you want?

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.080
Some of my orchestral music

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.080
You couldn't improvise some poems that are very erudite

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:26.080
There's a certain kind of poem that you can improvise, which tends to be more on one level, it's not a multi-level poem

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.080
You're having the middle of it, some kind of a reference to something that T.S. Eliot did

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.080
They tend to be more one-level poems and more direct and easy to understand

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.080
But there is such a thing as improvising poems

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.080
Also, when you're hearing it, you're really missing a major component, which is the lines

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.080
Poems versus written in lines

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:48.080
There are prose poems, which is kind of a stupid name, but

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:52.080
That a lot of the information is contained in that

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.080
Where the line is broken and for reasons, and so on and so forth

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:08.080
Just one comment, generally in poetry, relatively modern poetry, anyway, there's a feeling of spontaneity

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.080
One feels as though the words were happening by themselves

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:18.080
Jazz is sort of similar in that improvised jazz has that feeling of being spontaneous

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:27.080
Even if organized, it's spontaneous, so I think the collaboration is very much equal in the sense that

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:36.080
You have two medias that are associated with spontaneity and therefore create their own sort of spontaneous interaction as they happen

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:44.080
So I'm sort of not in favor of overworking and over-preparing because that would certainly kill the goose

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:50.080
That's a point to that, that makes sense

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.080
I guess our time is up?

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080
No, thanks

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080
Thank you

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.080
Thank you

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.080
Thank you

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.080
Thank you

01:23:59.080 --> 01:23:59.080
Thank you

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.080
Thank you

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:00.080
Thank you

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080
Thank you

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080
Thank you

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.080
We have folks there, if anyone, medias, and if you have any questions, please let me know

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.080
Thank you
