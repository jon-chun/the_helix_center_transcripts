WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm Ed Nurse-Shesian Director of the Hill Excentation.

00:04.000 --> 00:11.000
Before I introduce the participants, I'd like to say a few things about upcoming programs.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
We're going to have a weekend on around December 1st, 2nd, 3rd,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
devoted to the relationship between science and art.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
So we will have scientists, artists working together

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
and we will also discuss what is called STEAM education.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
So that's in December.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Prior to that, some of the round tables we are working on are illusion of knowledge,

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
sleep and memory, some round table on emotions,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
mind hours and others, and a few other things that we are working on.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.000
And we will put it up on our website and send you emails about it as we haven't planned.

01:05.000 --> 01:12.000
Today's round table, complexity and emergence to visions of cosmic order from particles to people

01:12.000 --> 01:23.000
was proposed to us by Tyler Volk, who is a professor of biology and environmental sciences at NYU.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
The other participants next to Tyler is William Grassi.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
He is an interdisciplinary scholar, academic entrepreneur and social activist and author.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Next to him is Tim Modlin, who's been here a couple of times before,

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
who is a professor of philosophy at NYU.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Next to him is David Grinspoon, astrobiologist senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute.

01:53.000 --> 02:03.000
And on the other side, it's Ilya Tampkin, professor of biology at NOVA and research associate at NM&H.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Thank you.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
Well, we're supposed to each say a few words about our interests.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Do we get over here, maybe? David?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Sure.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
So, as was mentioned, I'm an astrobiologist.

02:26.000 --> 02:37.000
Astrobiology is inherently a multidisciplinary endeavor, as the name implies, astronomy and biology.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
And now many other disciplines as well, trying to understand really the potential of the universe to produce life

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
and what environments that may occur in and how we might search for it.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
And my own entree into that is as a planetary scientist, I actually do climate modeling of other planets

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
using similar tools to what we use to try to model the future climate on Earth.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
And part of that is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
It's connected in interesting ways with astrobiology.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
And recently, I've just completed a book that's been about a four-year project,

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
which is looking at the Anthropocene epoch, which is the name that some geologists and now other people have proposed

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
for our current time of Earth history, which is characterized by humans as a geological force.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Looking at that through the lens of astrobiology, in other words, for someone who thinks about planetary transitions

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
and the relationship between life and planets, what does this moment in Earth history

03:53.000 --> 04:03.000
when this species, this arguably new kind of phenomena on the planet, has become a major factor in planetary evolution?

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
So that's what I've been focusing on recently, and it dovetails in interesting ways with this,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
or the whole story of cosmic evolution.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
What is happening on this planet now and what do human beings really represent as a factor in planetary evolution?

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
That's my entree to this subject.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Okay, Shriya, we go around forever.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So I'm sort of on a different...

04:31.000 --> 04:40.000
My specialty is foundations of physics, so I mostly have been looking at trying to understand fundamental physical theories.

04:40.000 --> 04:51.000
So the connection, I guess, to this particular topic would be in the connection between the base level physical laws

04:51.000 --> 05:00.000
and emergent laws in the sense of patterns, fairly predictable patterns that appear at higher levels

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
that are predictable without knowing all the details of the micro-physics.

05:06.000 --> 05:14.000
So far as I have much to contribute, it's just to appreciate what a mystery it is, why that should even happen.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
There's no particular reason why law-governed micro-physics should give rise to any interesting macro-physical structures

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
that have both complexity and predictability.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
So we take it for granted because we live in a world like that, but we don't appreciate how curious it is that we do live in such a world.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
So maybe I can contribute something there.

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
So I got interested in the subject 30 years ago, writing an dissertation in a religion department

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
on what it would mean to treat the modern scientific cosmology as a mythopoetic creation story.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
And I sort of fell into this rabbit hole at that point.

05:58.000 --> 06:07.000
So I'd sort of been doing what we called then the Epic of Evolution or the new cosmology, what people today often call big history.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So I'm involved in the exegesis of big history. What does it mean?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
And how do we interpret it?

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
So I'm sort of play with lots of different interpretations at different levels.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
And of course part of that is to figure out the big questions.

06:24.000 --> 06:38.000
But also I'm really interested in big history as a kind of pedagogical endeavor because we've learned so much about the universe in the last 50 years

06:38.000 --> 06:50.000
and about ourselves and in origin and our psychology and of course all that has also fueled a tremendous change in the way we live, the anthropocene as you mentioned.

06:50.000 --> 07:01.000
So for me putting it all together both as a sort of metaphysical question but also as a pedagogical endeavor is what's inspired my work over the years.

07:01.000 --> 07:18.000
So I most of my bread and butter work has involved the global carbon cycle and climate over the years, energy systems, but the work in the global carbon cycle took me from the macro planet down into molecular levels

07:18.000 --> 07:31.000
and I also had a strong interest in patterns, Tim referred to patterns, patterns of different scales and how one scale can influence another scale

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
and how sometimes similar patterns can reappear such as binary systems or certain shapes such as spheres.

07:40.000 --> 07:53.000
And I was, this began because Ed invited me to a panel in April which I could not go to but I said I have this new book called Quarks to Culture

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
and Ed said that would seem like a good topic for panel on complexity and emergence in May so let's set that up.

08:03.000 --> 08:18.000
And what I, this, this, and you have the handout in case some things get referred to that everybody could talk to because I think tonight physics is going to come up and biology is going to come up and culture is going to come up

08:18.000 --> 08:30.000
and these figures are from, figures are from my book and what the basic idea was that you go down in the body into cells and into molecules

08:30.000 --> 08:43.000
one can be going down back in time in terms of the origin of the types of these things so the cell had to come into existence before you can have a multicellular body such as an animal

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
and a molecule has to come into existence before you can have a cell that's made of molecules.

08:48.000 --> 08:59.000
Now not the cells of our body, not the molecules of our body but as a type of system there had to be a buildup from something small to large

08:59.000 --> 09:09.000
or there was a buildup, it doesn't have to be but science has not discovered this, a buildup from small to large and I said, oh I wonder if one could count

09:09.000 --> 09:22.000
I wonder if one could use the idea of merge of combination into new systems from small things, one could use that sequentially as a number of steps

09:22.000 --> 09:35.000
and distinguish fundamental levels of who we are and not just up to our body but then we are part of a social system too so I was just wondering can one do that

09:35.000 --> 09:51.000
and then that led me into these 12 levels that I talk about that each have, the next question beat each must have had something special that came into existence or emerged

09:51.000 --> 10:04.000
in order for the next level to happen that could not have happened at a prior level so there must have been something about the molecule that was different from what the atom was

10:04.000 --> 10:13.000
that the molecules required to form a cell, a living cell, that the atoms by themselves could not have directly gone there

10:13.000 --> 10:28.000
and the same with the fundamental particles of the standard model of physics, there was some paper in science years ago that somebody said, you don't model bulldozers with quarks, that there's these intervening levels

10:28.000 --> 10:48.000
that's been well known that there's been, the physicists talk about the onion, the layers of the onion and the biologists have had their major transitions of evolution and what I was merely doing was saying, oh one could actually see them as part of a way to do big history in terms of certain levels

10:48.000 --> 11:07.000
and it relates to things like emergence but that's the topic of the panel so I'll just leave it at that. I'm an evolutionary biologist and primarily interested in the general mechanisms that lead to the formation of the patterns we see reflected in the history of life

11:07.000 --> 11:25.000
it is clear that evolutionary processes occur at multiple levels of biological organization from molecular to all the way to ecosystem, because of systemic levels and the patterns that observe in nature, they are the outcomes of the synergistic effect of different events that occur at all these different levels

11:25.000 --> 11:40.000
So to me prior to even attempting to address the question of how these processes result in the patterns that we observe and describe as evolutionary biologists, we need to be very clear about the ontology of the structure of the organic world

11:40.000 --> 12:08.000
and it's not a surprise that by itself the level structure has been long recognized, every single textbook in biology begins with the description of the hierarchy of the living world starting with molecules leading to the formation of subcellular structures that then make cells, so this makes up tissues and so on

12:08.000 --> 12:21.000
until you get to the organisms, organisms make up populations that interact with each other in an economic way in the context of ecosystems, communities and so on up to the all encompassing biosphere

12:21.000 --> 12:38.000
However, if you look very carefully at this stereotypical structure that everybody is familiar with, you begin to recognize that this hierarchy of scale where you simply order biological entities in the order of the smallest of the largest

12:38.000 --> 12:58.000
It's probably a sufficient way to maybe describe different types of biological entities, but it doesn't provide an explanatory power to explain the processes because at the same level, there are entities that cannot be encompassed in a single uniform hierarchy

12:58.000 --> 13:12.000
Evolutionary biologists like myself who try to look more seriously at these questions recognize that there are two types of biological individuals that fundamentally differ in their nature, some of which we refer to as systems

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
where the relationship between entities that comprise the system is based on the energy and matter of relationships

13:20.000 --> 13:33.000
An example of that would be, for instance, a cell where different organelles interact with one another in some kind of economic way to make the largest system, or they're basically part of the whole system

13:33.000 --> 13:49.000
On the other side of the spectrum, there is a system of information transfer which recognizes the replicating entities where the relationships of them or the mode of incorporating into the larger entities is not the energy and matter relationship

13:49.000 --> 14:02.000
But the matter of inclusion based on the ancestry is a geological entity which I better describe not as systems but as historical teenagers

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
And the evolution occurs as the interplay of between these two separate, however overlapping hierarchies

14:10.000 --> 14:21.000
So an example of that would be, so within even our bodies, there is this duality of interactor and replicator systems, so our bodies composed of two fundamentally different units is a soma and the germline

14:21.000 --> 14:30.000
The whole purpose of the germline, or our cells responsible for reproduction, is only to transmit the information from one generation to the next

14:30.000 --> 14:43.000
One can be perfectly happy organism, leaving any offspring behind, so it would be perfectly functioning as a system in the economic way without ever reproducing

14:43.000 --> 14:52.000
So it's just the second aspect of our nature as well as any other biological system at every level to be able to replicate in a proliferated way

14:52.000 --> 15:03.000
So the processes like selection of sorting can take place where the evolution results from, so to me this is the most fundamental question within evolutionary biologists

15:03.000 --> 15:14.000
To see how you can understand the processes that impact the hierarchal systems at one level, so the so-called ecological, sometimes economic, hierarchy of life

15:14.000 --> 15:28.000
And how it reflects, in a synergistic effect, at the different levels in the historical or geological hierarchy that we perceive as what we described in systematics and taxonomy

15:28.000 --> 15:37.000
as a tree of life and the patterns that are being of that tree that are shaped throughout the history of life

15:37.000 --> 15:48.000
One of the problems we're going to have talking about complexity, let alone an emergence is that we're dealing with all these different scientific disciplines

15:48.000 --> 16:04.000
and there's no numeric measurement of complexity, it's not just the size of something, it's how diverse it is perhaps, or I'll focus later perhaps on how much energy it consumes

16:04.000 --> 16:15.000
How much energy flows through the system, but I think it's really important, a lot of people don't understand, I don't know, be curious what you, I talk about the great matrix, we're talking about hierarchies or scales

16:15.000 --> 16:27.000
And we do have some interesting scales, we have a scale of time, chronology, we have a scale of size, we have measurable scales of free energy flow through a system

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
And one of the electromagnetic spectrum is an amazing scale, which is very important in our level of reality

16:35.000 --> 16:46.000
And a sound is a different type of scale, interestingly humans have a much broader many orders of magnitude auditory capacity

16:46.000 --> 17:00.000
And we actually perceive visual light, it's very small range, and I think then we can go to inductive scales, or let's say there's a scale of information and ingenuity

17:00.000 --> 17:11.000
Or there's a scale of sentience and consciousness, or of course the scale that we're talking about is emergence of complexity

17:11.000 --> 17:21.000
Those are maybe there are others, I don't know, but those are kind of ways of orienting us to all phenomena that science describes

17:21.000 --> 17:35.000
So we have, I think some interesting, it's not just anything goes, there's a lot of restrictions about what science can understand or feel

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I call it the great matrix

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
By that you mean the system composed of all these different scales?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
No, I think everything can be, everything can be, everything can be.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
The great matrix.

17:47.000 --> 17:56.000
Oh, the great matrix, time, space, energy, electromagnetism, sound, and those.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
So would you, but some of those seem like subsets of others?

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
They are, for sure, electromagnetism is a form of energy, for sure, so is sound

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
So some might be more primary.

18:09.000 --> 18:17.000
And we live in this amazing little thermodynamic eddy, eddy in the universe where complexity runs uphill

18:17.000 --> 18:25.000
And so we have this, you know, if it weren't for that thermodynamic eddy

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
Where the Goldilocks conditions were just right, we wouldn't be here talking about it

18:31.000 --> 18:40.000
And so how do you see that? So the thermodynamics run uphill, meaning you can have local reduction in entropy and increase complexity

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
As long as there's a global increase in entropy, and

18:44.000 --> 18:50.000
Anytime energy flows through matter, it creates order, creates information

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
And so that's what the weather is, right? It's a way of dissipating energy.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
That's what a hurricane is, or a tornado.

18:58.000 --> 19:07.000
When it passes through solid matter, it can also have memory, and it can also compute, and can make, reproduce itself

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
And so the weather, the gas molecules, as soon as the energy flows stops, they just dissipate

19:14.000 --> 19:24.000
But, you know, life has achieved this internal telos to, you know, survive, reproduce, and create life more abundant and extravagant

19:24.000 --> 19:34.000
So, for me, the fundamental physics of the universe is that as long as there's energy flowing through matter

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
We have a possibility of increasing complexity

19:38.000 --> 19:46.000
So that's key, the possibility of increasing complexity, but it might not be an inevitability

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
Absolutely not, and it says nothing about how that complexity is going to evolve or what it's going to be, but the possibilities

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
So that's kind of fundamental level, and most people don't get it, it's very counterintuitive

20:00.000 --> 20:08.000
But Eric Chason at Harvard and Tufts, astronomers, it's really interesting, sort of back to the envelope calculations

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
About how much energy flows through a system, let me just put it out there really quickly

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
Like the Sun as a unit, of course, it's really big, and it's really put on an enormous amount of energy

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
But a photosynthesizing microorganism is about 500 times the energy density flow of the Sun

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
When you normalize for the mass and the time frame

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
A mammalian body is about 10,000 times the energy density flow of the Sun

20:36.000 --> 20:41.000
Our brains are about 75,000 times the energy density flow of the Sun

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
And by the way, our brains only work on about 20, 25 watts of energy

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
So our body is working about 100 watts of energy

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And if you take all the energy that we use outside of our bodies

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
As a result of first fire mastery, then agriculture, then fossil fuels

21:00.000 --> 21:09.000
Where millions of times, the people in this room, are consuming energy millions of times that of the Sun

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
So it's very counter, again, when normalized for the mass of the system

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
So energy is part of the story of complexity

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
And most people focus on the information side of it, it's informationally driven

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
But you don't get the information without the energy flowing through matter

21:26.000 --> 21:32.000
So that's a sort of fundamental physics point that Tim might want to say more about that

21:32.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah, I'm not sure, let me try and make a point about information in terms of entropy

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
And then maybe I can ask you because I'm not quite sure what you have in mind by energy flow

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
So one way to see the complexity, this is an example, I guess of Sean Carroll's, but it makes the point

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
Complexity is a really hard concept to get a good grip on

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
People often try and equate it with a concept that you have a better grip on like entropy or something like that

22:06.000 --> 22:15.000
But if you think about the, there's a standard example of increase of entropy where you take coffee and cream

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
And start them out where the cream is just on top of the coffee

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
And then you wait and it slowly diffuses and, or you stir it, right?

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
Which would be introducing energy and, but even if you don't introduce any energy and it will slowly diffuse

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
If you stir it, it goes through a phase where you have this tremendous complexity

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
You have the tendrils of cream that have interesting shapes that are intermixed with the coffee

22:42.000 --> 22:50.000
But then as time goes on, it eventually becomes bland again, right? It just becomes a mocha brown uniform mix

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
That's the maximal entropy state, right? It's not the maximal complexity state

22:56.000 --> 23:02.000
So you started from a very uncomplex system and you go through a sort of complexity maximum

23:02.000 --> 23:07.000
And then it tails off as time goes on into again a very uncomplex system

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
All the time entropy is going up

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
So the conditions for there even to be complexity or how you quantify it or what you mean by it

23:16.000 --> 23:26.000
I think are very difficult. I'm not sure why you would need energy flow to get complexity

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
I mean, I'm not sure what you think of the connection there between energy flow and complex, and increasing complexity

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
What the one thing about biology, so I, so

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
And I'm not, and there's things I'm not comfortable about with the information

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I mean, I understand, you know, that's a whole discussion

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
I tend to take a very almost architectural approach, but one thing about the origin of life is that now

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
And I'd be curious, the transition from physics and chemistry to the two

23:57.000 --> 24:09.000
Once you have living cells, the way I see it, you now have systems that require the import of matter and energy into them

24:09.000 --> 24:15.000
And export of waste, which you do not have with an atom, you do not have with a molecule

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
They can be relatively static structures

24:19.000 --> 24:30.000
And so to have life you do need a field of either molecules that contain chemical energy in the environment

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Or radiative energy with photosynthesis

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
And so it does have to flow, that does have to flow

24:37.000 --> 24:43.000
That was something, of course you understand, I know you know that, but that was something what you were asking, then what that transition meant

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
Because once you have a system that requires inputs of matter and energy and exports waste

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
It seems to me then, then biological evolution almost follows logically from that

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
Because since these creatures are replicating themselves, they can't just grow forever, they split and they form two cells

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
Now they're in competition inherently, because if one is importing a nutrient

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
That's depleting the nutrient in the environment

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
So there's depletion of the energy from the environment if we talk about matter containing energy

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
But living things also need matter as matter, they need the carbon atom to structure other molecules

25:26.000 --> 25:32.000
So it's not just energy, they actually need certain kinds of material building blocks

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
And once you have something that needs imports and exports, you get biological evolution

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Because now there's the depletion in the environment from the nutrient import

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
And there's putting out toxins as waste, because the waste these creatures are getting rid of it

25:47.000 --> 25:56.000
So they are causing detrimental changes to the environment setting up a competitive so to speak field

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
You can also have cooperation in there among organisms, of course, which is important for the evolution of the eukaryotic cell

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
But it sets up this field

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
Now, so I do have this overriding question

26:07.000 --> 26:18.000
That's in a way a different kind of dynamics that have been born from the physical chemical dynamics

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
Now it's not just coming out of the sky coming down, but it seems like it's a fun...

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
It seems like it's different enough that biological evolution is different enough for us to really think about what that means

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
And now you can have a combination of biological structures

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
I think another important concept here is homeostasis

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Because it's not just enough to have those energy flows

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
And as you say, the flows of matter that maintain them

26:52.000 --> 27:01.000
I think Eric Chesson's observation that energy density seems to conform to this sort of hierarchy

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
It seems to be a characteristic of this hierarchy

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
It's very interesting, the hierarchy that you've kind of named in your introductory statement

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Does seem to carry with it this also hierarchy of energy density

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
But I don't think Eric has answered the question of why that necessarily needs to be

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
It's sort of an observation

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
When you name this hierarchy that Tyra has very well described

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
And then you look at the characteristics of these different entities

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
One thing you can observe is this energy flow density is really markedly increased at every higher level

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
It's exponentially increasing at every higher level

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
But it's also a characteristic, some of that energy, some of what it needs to do

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
Some of the point of that is to create a homeostasis so that the flows of matter and energy

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
That allow that structure can persist

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
A disequilibria's homeostasis

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
Yes, so it's not a causal, it's not a causal factor

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
It's a necessary energy flowing through gas

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Spontaneously creates or complexity

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
I'm going to try to make one step back because we have discussed so many concepts

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
And the relationship between which is not always clear

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
We started with notion of complexity, right?

28:26.000 --> 28:32.000
So we wanted to maybe get back to that a little bit, discuss it in a little bit greater detail

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
Wouldn't be, let's just try to simplify things a little bit

28:36.000 --> 28:43.000
So let's pretend that we're just looking at a system at one particular comparing two systems at the same organizational level

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
So it's made from comparable parts

28:45.000 --> 28:53.000
So we have a very good mathematical language to describe structures in the form of dynamic networks

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
That interact with one another, where different parts interact with one another in some non-trivial way

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
We have, we can describe the topology, the strength of the relationships

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
We define as modularity, the overall topology

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
And by doing that we can compare to a system in terms of, in some numerical ways of assessing complexity at that level

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
The difficulty comes in when you start looking at hierarchical systems

29:16.000 --> 29:26.000
Where an element of a system is in itself a complex system of a different level

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
Then, you would argue that the system is more complex, the more hierarchical levels you have

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Because what you yet, I think overall

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
And you could just clarify it, when you say hierarchical, do you mean nested?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I mean nested composition

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
But there are sometimes people use hierarchical to mean like a tree structure

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Yes, or not hierarchy of control

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
No, I meant specifically, physically nested

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
Nested, you can think in like a Dan Meche sense, because I know Meche talks about one way of one form of complexity

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
Is numbers of layers of nestedness

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
And I saw that he has a paper in your new book, for example

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
But that's what you're talking about when you say hierarchical

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Specifically about one particular type of hierarchy when you have nestedness

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Because I think that's a different in scale, something you referred to

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Early on regarding that scale is important

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Scale is important because the discontinuity in that scale

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
That's what creates the discreetness of levels

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
This way we can talk about the levels as ontologically sound real thing

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
Rather than just pure our conception of something being a little small or something being a little larger

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
Because I think nobody would argue that when two individuals interact

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It would, like two humans would interact

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
It would be correct to say that cells of one interact with an individual person of another

30:43.000 --> 30:48.000
Because these are not comparable entities with regard to this scale

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
Because the rates of processes at different levels are completely different

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So that's why when we look at the dynamic system

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
It can be only composed of the elements of the same hierarchical level

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
Because they are, if you engage in the energy and matter relationship

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
It can be only among entities that are within the same structure

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, I'm totally into that, where then these entities at these different scales

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
They have certain kinds of relationships that they're capable of

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
So we are capable of using light and sound, of using remote sensing

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
Which cells, biological cells, they can be responsive to light

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
But they're not actually, as far as we know, communicating through, like say, a linguistic modulation on light and sound

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
So the way I see it is that it's not only the birth, what's key is not only the birth of these new scales of size

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
These entities or systems have new kinds of abilities to relate

31:48.000 --> 31:54.000
And I think what you're saying is that they tend to relate to entities on that same level

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
Yes, and you tell our effort with your approach of different agnices levels

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
These are the fundamentals jumps in this level of organization

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Something that is sometimes referred to as major transitions

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Major transitions in the bio-biologist, yeah

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
So it's not about how the system once it's already emerged, how it starts working with this having multiple levels structure

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
But you're focusing to be on the emergence of these levels in the first place

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
Right, so it's a different story

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Obviously you have to have these levels emerging first

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
Because now we're looking at, we're faced with the already existing system of these levels

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But have must have emerged sometimes through history

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
But it's a different question of how these levels have appeared in the first place

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
I'm just not sure I understand

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
I understand the notion of level, I can make sense of the notion of levels

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
I don't see why you would think that only things at the same level interact

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
So suppose I'm a biologist and I'm looking at, I don't know, otters

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
And otters are able, I think, to pick up rocks or somebody is able to pick up rocks and smash

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
So the rock is at a really low level of complexity, right?

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
But it interacts with this biological organism, it's important

33:09.000 --> 33:16.000
So it would be a nice world if, as it were, the levels just sort of thin themselves out and only interact

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
But there's all kinds of inter-level interactions

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
This is a really important one, it's really important

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
It's really important for particles and atoms interact with mutations

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But it's a different kind of interaction

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
Maybe there's a certain kind of constructive or engagement that only happens at the same level

33:31.000 --> 33:39.000
Obviously, we get hit by high energy protons and it can damage ourselves

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
But that's different from communicating with another organism

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Maybe otters pick up the rock to maintain its homeostasis

33:45.000 --> 33:51.000
I don't think of rock and otter at a different level

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
In terms of their roles, maybe complex, different composition, yes, at a different level

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
But I'm not putting them at different levels because of their complexity

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
At the same level of interactions, they belong to the same level

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Because at the same time, they fly as an organism, it's a level of an organism

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
It will interact with a human, because human is an organism

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
They're at the same level of an organism

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
But obviously, you can argue that the fly may be more simpler than a human

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
That doesn't make them, but it would be a role

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
So I would take them as multicellular or...

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Yes, that's the level of multicellularity

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
But it would be wrong to say that an otter interacts with an ecosystem

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
An ecosystem that's a level that's encompassed not in all of the otter deals with

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
So otter would interact with other abiotic and biotic elements in its own environment

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
But not with the ecosystem, such as...

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Or the fact that a human being is a multicellular organism

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
But now we know with the microbiome that we're not only interacting with unicellular organisms

34:52.000 --> 35:01.000
But that, in fact, our nature is integrally composed of unicellular organisms

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
Which are themselves, integrally composed of things at smaller levels

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
So it gets complicated, doesn't it?

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
That's where it's complicated with the question of what leads to the origin of levels

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Because if you look at a human organs composed of multiple cells

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
If you try to look at an individual cell as an independent organism

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Which it is not because it usually does not live under natural conditions

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Devode of being part of a body

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
It would not be, but in the early origin of multicellularity

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
That was the mode of emergence of that multiolegrinism level

35:40.000 --> 35:45.000
The problem, you can talk more about this, that the emergence of multicellular deacet

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
It has to be a fundamental step where there was this next level emerged

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
But I think with regard to interaction with humans, with its microbiome

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
We are at the same level as this organism

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
They're organisms, they're multi-cell, maybe a multicellular and unicellular organs

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
They still can't interact, they can eat each other

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
It's, well, maybe not multicellular, unicellular organs will eat multicellular ones

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
But it's an organismal level

36:11.000 --> 36:18.000
Complexity and level are not necessarily can be equated

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
I think you can only compare the complexity of entities that are at the same level

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
If you can compare between levels, then what do you mean by compare?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
What do you mean by compare?

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
When you said you can only compare two entities at the same level

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
What do you mean by, what do you do?

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
You don't use parco-physics to do economics

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
Oh, okay

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
You need to have the discourse, I mean, you have the discourse to figure out the scientific relationships

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
But I think it's important to note that the adjacent levels often do have things to say for each other

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
And there's a difference between complicated and complex

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
So the example I like to use is that cars are a really complicated thing

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
But we sort of know how to build it and how all the pieces work together

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
And we're at a traffic jam on the morning commute where everybody's driving along

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
And a little variations in somebody's speed starts replicating and all of a sudden it stops, goes stop, go

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's a complex phenomena

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
And complexity is a whole science of its own

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
And all the most interesting things in the universe are complex adaptive systems

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
Where there are lots of different interacting parts

37:31.000 --> 37:37.000
And some freedom or possibility of things happening differently

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
So complexity as a term of science is really different than complicated

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
And a lot of what science is is trying to make things that look complex turn into complicated problems

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
But now there's a whole bunch of phenomena that we study

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
Some of them are very simple like flocks of birds which some can be described mathematically

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
Some not that are complex and I think that's an important

38:06.000 --> 38:13.000
But what he described as a relationship between the complexity of a car structure and the traffic

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
Which cannot be decomposed and explained in terms of the car parts

38:18.000 --> 38:25.000
That's the exact example of comparison between different levels

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
I mean in some way the traffic jam is simpler because it can be mathematically

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
Mathematically sized by little units and people write equations for it and do modeling of it

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
Where a car, yes it can be understood but to me the multiple levels of a car

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Of course the car jam is made of cars, so that's why it's a...

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Yeah, but I think what you just said is going to be much more true in ten years

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
About traffic jams when there are no more...

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
When there are human drivers are no longer a part of the equation

38:56.000 --> 39:04.000
Whereas now there's a complex neurological sensory reactive component to that

39:04.000 --> 39:11.000
It's interesting to note that soon there will be traffic jams that are probably just as complex for different reasons

39:11.000 --> 39:15.000
So here's to me, so we haven't gotten into culture yet

39:15.000 --> 39:22.000
I'd be really curious about how you think about this idea, how you all think about it from different angles

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And particularly from a general principle

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
So lots of people for years have been talking about cultural evolution

39:28.000 --> 39:34.000
Which is like biological evolution, not by having a genome and not by having a phenotype, genotype

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
But by having properties of propagation, variation and selection

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
So the automobile manufacturer can make more cars

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
That's propagating, they're not self propagating yet

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
But then they put out variants

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
Scientific theories can do the same thing, put out variants

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
And then it's selected in a field either in one's mind or in society

39:59.000 --> 40:03.000
Now there's certain pushback against that from some of the social scientists

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
No, no, no, you don't want to make the comparison to rigid

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
But there's really sort of a tidal wave of literature happening

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
In this culture evolution studies

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
Simply saying that there's been a way I would put it

40:23.000 --> 40:32.000
A rediscovery of these triple processes of propagation, variation and selection of pattern

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
That occurred at the beginning of the origin of life at the prokaryotic cell

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
And occurred again at some point in human evolution

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
I'll take it to be definitely by the time of sex tools

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
And probably we think language

40:46.000 --> 40:52.000
And I think there's also a similarity between the amino acids, 20 amino acids

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Being able to build a complexity of proteins, almost an infinite complexity of proteins

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
And human phonemes, a few units of speech

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
Being able to build almost an infinite number of words

41:03.000 --> 41:09.000
I think there's kind of a parallel between this sort of element

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
Going to complex, being within the cell

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
As the genetic and amino acid system

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
And simple elements being complex in the human language system

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
Corresponding to the beginning of a propagation variation, selection process in biology

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
With a propagation, selection process in culture

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
So I'm curious as if there's been a rediscovery

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
As these levels of organization have built up

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
If suddenly the prokaryotic cell, which is using biological evolution

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
So is the eukaryotic cell, so is the multicellular organism

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And so is the animal social group

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
And then with the anthropologist called the metagroups

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Where groups can be not visible to each other on different sides of the mountain

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
But they're still linked in a culture

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
If that began a propagation variation and selection process again

42:04.000 --> 42:09.000
That means there was a rediscovery of the similar pattern

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
Kind of a principle

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
So there's a difference between biological evolution and cultural evolution

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
And that's because we learn

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
And we pass on what we learn more or less to the next generation

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
And that becomes an exponentially growing process

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
So individually, we're not all that smart

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
We have a person by limitation, if you will, about how much we can know

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
And how much we can knowledge and know how we can contain

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
But you put us together in this quote unquote superorganism

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And we're just...

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
We're on this exponential...

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
Don't run as individuals down too much

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Well not you

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm not saying that before... I mean I do want to mark a difference here

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Because I think the analogy...

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
The wonderful thing about the theory of evolution

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
The original biological theory of evolution wasn't just that it was replicators with variation and selection

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
But that it was random variation

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
That you didn't need a tealological, you didn't need a purpose, you didn't need an aim or a design

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
And this could all just be happening randomly

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Now hopefully once you get people involved

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
They're honestly not the chefs really aren't just randomly throwing stuff in

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
And seeing what happens, they come to have some understanding of what they're aiming at

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And you get intentional behavior

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
They might come back to the restaurant

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Which is gonna make the whole thing much more efficient you hope

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And much faster and much more powerful

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So I would be a little leery of...

43:48.000 --> 43:53.000
It seems to be, but leery of stretching the analogy too much

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
But I would like to say it's more than an analogy, it's some deep level

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
It's the rediscovery of some of these triple principles

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
But how they're manifesting, because even the chef can't determine whether those people are gonna like

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
Yes, use the term intentional behavior

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
And I think that's an important term as far as this difference you're trying to describe

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But then we can also ask

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
What do we really mean by that?

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
And where does intentional behavior come from?

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
And one idea, and I don't think anybody really knows

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
But one idea I've heard about that

44:29.000 --> 44:34.000
And this is above my pay grade, but some of you guys might know more about this

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
But for how the mind works and how ideas emerge

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
And how intention, whatever that is, comes out of this

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
Is that there is some sort of potential, sort of Darwinian type process

44:48.000 --> 44:53.000
Or at least process that's sort of analogous to that going on inside the brain

44:53.000 --> 44:59.000
Where different associations and ideas are kind of competing and emerging

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
From some sort of a process

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
And so it may be that some of these qualities that you're describing

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
As the sort of universal pattern emerging, our pattern emergence are going on

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
And contributing to this, but that it's really going on as far as idea formation

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
And indeed the formation of intentionality, however that works inside our brains

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
Well most of my brain was pretty empty when I was born

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
And of course it went through a prolonged period of childhood

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
Dependency grew three times from, right?

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
That's about how big the brain grows in childhood

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
And so everything that fills our brains is largely, including our language

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
It's largely acquired through the social and environmental network

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And so for me the brain is a really interesting thing

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
But it does nothing without oppositional sums and environment

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
And a social environment in particular

45:54.000 --> 46:05.000
So to me, the real miracles, how does this stuff, how does the environment imprint itself into our brains?

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
And how do we, how do we, so you could talk about all kinds of different emergence

46:10.000 --> 46:18.000
There's evolutionary emergence, there's developmental emergence from a single cell to an adult body

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
Or there's functional emergence, like all the cells are working at the same time

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
So it's the physics, right? What is it, like 40 trillion cells in our body?

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
Half of them, as many bacteria

46:33.000 --> 46:37.000
And then you could even talk about intelligence emergence

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
That can happen to an individual, it can happen to a species

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
And I think we...

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Can it happen to a planet?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Can it happen to a planet?

46:43.000 --> 46:54.000
Well, you know, so that's the question, that's the Tejhardian, Pierre Tejhard de Chardin, the Jesuit priest, one of the patron saints of religion and science

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
To continue with, to go back to David and talk about it, and do what you said is that

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
Yes, we're born with these baby brains

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
And we suck up a lot from the environment

47:07.000 --> 47:13.000
And one of the things we pull up is the ability to be intentional

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
Or at least use that language to people, oh, I thought that through

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
And I now decide this, that's in a way a propagation variation in selection

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, there's a...

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Let me again make a kind of analogy here in terms of even...

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
It's certainly true that you speed things up by, as it were, virtual processes in the brain

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
That make selections out of different...

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
I'm deciding what to do, and I think about five different possibilities

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
And I try and project out what will happen and make my choice on the basis of that

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
And those are only the ones you're consciously aware of, which is...

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Right, but you do need a...

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
I think you...

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Right, you need a distinction, and think about chess playing computers, right?

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
So originally, really the chess playing computers were sort of blind variation

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
And they just did massive searches of all possible move sequences,

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
Which because of combinatorial explosion, they could... had a horizon

48:05.000 --> 48:12.000
But in some sense, in some sense they considered hundreds of millions of possible sequences of moves

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
And if you ask an expert chess player, he'll say, I considered four

48:17.000 --> 48:23.000
You know, I looked at the board and I said, maybe it's this one, maybe it's this one, maybe it's that one

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
And then they focus down, right?

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
It's a different... it's really a different...

48:27.000 --> 48:32.000
And we think they could not have it, and even unconsciously we think they could not have done hundreds of millions

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
That's right, because they don't know the unconscious question

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
That's right, so you know, it's... I mean...

48:37.000 --> 48:48.000
That ability to... it's true there's a kind of variation there, at least they're looking at a variety of possibilities and selecting among them

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
But there's also a lot of interesting things going on that they can look at such a small variety of...

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
Things and apply their cognitive resources to them

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
But also to be really true to biology, the variation is also really not...

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Also from biology we know it's not entirely a random

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
Also we know that some parts of the genome can mutate more readily than others

49:10.000 --> 49:18.000
It's predictable, we know that some mutations are filtrated to the level of phenotype, not also through some random manifestation

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
But there are some constraints by the organism level, so it's not also entirely random

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
But I think in general the metaphor of relating cultural evolution to biological evolution

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
I think it's both a useful analogy and there is some truth to it in a very general sense

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
Because if we define evolution and it's simply even just basically there in terms...

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
You know, Darwin didn't use the word evolution at first, he just used descent with modification

49:45.000 --> 49:53.000
Which simply in modern language we can translate it as a fate of information

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
So in that sense evolution can occur in any system whether information transfers from one generation to the next

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
As long as you have some sort of replicating system

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
So human culture, it adds to it, just adds to the new mechanism of information, transparent modification

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Which is through our culture

50:09.000 --> 50:14.000
And because that method is quite radically different, you can transfer information only to the next generation

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
But kind of laterally, almost like bacteria do with their lateral gene transfer

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
You can recover lost information from the past and there are old sorts of ways

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
How can fresh can be transferred in ways that are not found in biological systems

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
It certainly lends to some novelty and intentionality as part of it as well

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
Some creative intent of individuals, so we should not discount those as well

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
But at a higher level of maybe higher social structures within the human society

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
There is some element of maybe not necessarily selection because I don't want to draw analogy to like

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Fitness in biological systems, I think it would be too

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Maybe too untrue

50:50.000 --> 50:58.000
But there is some sort of sorting, you have variance and they are being by some either random function or maybe not

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
They are being sorted and distributed where some persist some do not

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
In that sense it does hold

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
But would you say there is some kind of fitness maybe about a bottle or everything that we design

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
You are uncomfortable with using the word fitness

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
I am a little bit uncomfortable because you want to keep it to biology

51:16.000 --> 51:22.000
Because if you are thinking of a very specific meaning, you use the ability to replicate itself more

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
Maybe having a better form in saying an element of human design shape

51:28.000 --> 51:35.000
It might not necessarily translate into high rate of its reproduction

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Right, but some...

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Like in terms of manufacturers

51:39.000 --> 51:48.000
Right, so the better way of having the typewriter in terms of ergonomics was not the way the typewriter worked

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
I just don't know what I said, I can be generalised, maybe it is true

51:52.000 --> 51:58.000
I am actually one of the few people in the world who uses a Dvorak simplified keyboard

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
Which was designed in the 1930s by an efficiency expert

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
Based on the frequency of the letters and the two and three letter combinations

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
To minimise finger motion

52:10.000 --> 52:16.000
But we are all locked into the QWERTY keyboard which was designed to make us type slowly

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Because the machines would jam

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
And C-Mingigal has a lovely essay about this, in evolution

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
It doesn't have to be optimal, it just has to work and then it gets fixed and stuck

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
And so every time we look at your computer, you should think

52:33.000 --> 52:38.000
My god, this is an icon of how brilliant we are and how stupid we are

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
Because the keyboard is literally pretty stupid

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
In biology, they talk about the... not optimising but satisfying

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
So anyway, that's...

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
And this is probably very true to human culture as well

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
Something that might persist for reasons other than being the best serving the needs

52:58.000 --> 53:04.000
So for instance, some years ago I embarked on a project trying to apply biological methods

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
Maybe very naively trying to reconstruct the phylogeny kind of evolutionary tree of musical instruments

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
We discovered very unusual and interesting patterns that we had to do with looking at coordinates

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
From the late 19th century and up to the middle of the 20th century

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
And it turned out that some of the trumpet related musical instruments

53:23.000 --> 53:30.000
And it turns out that some of the trans that we found had to do not specifically with a better design of vowels

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
And the way horn is structured overall

53:33.000 --> 53:39.000
But there were some purely economic reasons for developing the industry in some ways

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
Because some people patented certain ways of making it

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Preventing other people from doing it, there were other social forces

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
Had nothing to do with optimising a particular item

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
Obviously humanly designed in a very creative way

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
Item that was very consciously designed, but it could only develop in certain ways

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Because higher level social structures like patent agencies

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
And maybe some individual players, some jazz players that used some of these instruments

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
They preferred something more artistic

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
And they designed purely for aesthetic and historical reasons

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
They didn't really care about maybe a better playability in some ways

54:17.000 --> 54:25.000
So there are many more, I think, aspects to human ways of variations being sorted in human culture

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
That's why I didn't want to define it as a specific fitness function

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Because fitness applies only to one thing

54:32.000 --> 54:42.000
This is an interesting thing to bring into it

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
But when you start talking about fitness

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
It's very easy to say when you're talking about Darwinian evolution

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
And even neo-Darwinian evolution

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
What the sort of goal is, you don't really need a goal

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
It's just those entities that do a better job of propagating themselves

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
But when we get to cultural evolution

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Then you do have to start saying, well, what is the goal?

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
What do we want? It's not necessarily true that the goal is for each of us to have as many offspring as we want

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
In fact, we're starting to realize that there's a whole other level of planetary fitness

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
In which that's actually bad

55:17.000 --> 55:23.000
So you can't help but start to say, okay, so what really is the goal?

55:23.000 --> 55:28.000
But when you get to aesthetics, it's very interesting because you could say, well, this is something that

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Isn't really a part of biological evolution

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
Except it is because you get into sexual selection

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
And you get these ridiculous structures that are among the most useless

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
And the most beautiful parts of nature

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Which have this whole other goal

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
But it's still the same goal, but it's attracting a mate

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
Not anything that's more useful for

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
And they agree with you, especially when they mentioned earlier that it all comes down there

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
So just the way human brain functions too, which I also don't have as much expertise to speculate about

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
But, Linus Frost has one interesting comment

56:03.000 --> 56:09.000
When critiquing the purely biological transfer of the notions of evolution to the culture

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
But the X doesn't reproduce, doesn't make another X

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
So it happens to in the mind of its creator, conceiving the idea of it

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
And what happens to these ideas, how they manifested in the objects

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
So you can't necessarily even look at those coordinates and say, well, that's how they evolve

56:25.000 --> 56:33.000
Now they just maybe imperfect reflection of the processes that occur in the human brain

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
And the evolution at that level

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
So I think just looking at the cultural artifacts as such

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
As divorced from the workings of the human mind

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't think it's a very legitimate pursuit in that way to view cultural evolution like that

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
It's certainly just looking at organismal features

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
Can allow you to reconstruct phylogeny, maybe in quite a precise way

56:57.000 --> 57:04.000
But it's not telling you the mechanism of how evolution further occurred through speciation variation

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
So in that way, you can also tell something about the way human culture works

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
By looking at some patterns of similarities between artifacts and different aspects of human culture

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
But do you really understand that you really need to look at the function of the mind?

57:18.000 --> 57:24.000
I've been doing a lot of reading and research right now for a book I'm writing

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
On how this applies to finance and economics and investing

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
And one of the things that we all have these hunter-gatherer brains

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
And we live in this incredibly advanced civilization

57:38.000 --> 57:48.000
But we're still on the psychological level, we have a lot in common with humans 10, 20, 30,000 years ago

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
100,000 years ago

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
And so our thinking is fast and slow, we're predictably irrational

57:55.000 --> 58:01.000
And we're driven by all kinds of variable hormones in our body

58:01.000 --> 58:11.000
And so there's another question, how did a complex global scientific civilization

58:11.000 --> 58:21.000
Possibly emerge from such stupid primates, some of whom are president of the United States recently?

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
Well, I wonder, do you really think that we live in an incredibly advanced civilization?

58:26.000 --> 58:32.000
I think we have the potential to form one, but I would say that as a basic prerequisite

58:32.000 --> 58:39.000
To define an advanced civilization you would have to have the ability to imagine that

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
You're sort of a part of a sustainable civilization, and I'm not sure we're actually there yet

58:45.000 --> 58:52.000
I mean, there's the normative moral side of it, and then there's just the fact of it

58:52.000 --> 58:59.000
And I'm just talking about the fact that our world is so different than when people lived in 100 years ago or 1000 years ago

58:59.000 --> 59:15.000
I agree with that, but I also think that it's possible that, I mean, trying to describe Manhattan to say one of the 100 gatherers who lived at a pinnacle point

59:15.000 --> 59:23.000
One of the most important things that we have to do is to imagine that we have a 100,000 years ago

59:23.000 --> 59:30.000
Which may have been among the first homo sapiens sapiens in southern tip of Africa would be very difficult

59:30.000 --> 59:38.000
Humans have an amazing ability, capacity for reinvention, they were probably genetically pretty similar to us

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
But maybe that's more stuffed now, yeah, but maybe that difficulty of them imagining our world is as difficult as it is for us to imagine what an advanced civilization would be like

59:44.000 --> 59:51.000
So, yeah, do you think that how long before we get there, I'd like to know?

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
Well, I want to see it, so when I hear you talk about speaking up and fasting

59:57.000 --> 01:00:03.000
When I hear you talk about these levels, Adam's simple cells complex of...

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
One question that I can't help but wondering is, okay, what's next? The next level

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I read something recently actually when I was just starting to write my book that I just finished by Isaac Asimov written in the 70s

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Just a little short essay where he talked about this hierarchy of atoms to molecules to viruses to full-blown cells to multi-cellular

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And then he talks about the multi-organismic and there's some examples of sort of full-blown superorganisms like insect colonies and so forth

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And then he talked about we humans, we have leanings towards that superorganism

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We have some identity with the tribe, with the group, but we're not quite there, we're still

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:56.000
And to me that was really powerful, like I thought, and I say the beginning of my life, yeah, well in a certain way we're stuck between the individual and the superorganism

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:05.000
In a way, that's one way of encapsulating our predicament here as human beings trying to have a sustainable society because there are ways in which we need to function as a superorganism

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But we're not inherently good at that

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So I found that powerful because it's just one way of trying to place our current cultural difficulties in the context of what we're talking about here

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Where do we fit, and what's next in that? I'm really scared of that analogy

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I don't want to be part of a superorganism

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Cells, unicellular organisms were looking out for themselves, and in multi-cellular organisms the individual cells are easily expendable

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000
They can be sacrificed quite regularly for the good of the... and I don't want to live in that in a society that's going to throw a bunch of us away

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I don't think that's going to be progress, right? There's going to be progress when every person, nobody lives in poverty

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
When people have the resources are more or less spread much more equally than they are

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And everybody has dignity and everybody has access to decent things

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
That doesn't look like a superorganism to me

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It looks like a rationally designed system, right?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And again, rationality, it's kind of important when rationality gets in the game

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
It's rationality just isn't in the game of evolution, and we're aiming for something else

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
We're aiming for something we've thought through and that has moral principles underneath it and so on

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Well, maybe, I mean, we're getting... I don't want to argue about semantics here, what we mean by superorganism

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'd certainly agree with what you just described as important goals

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It's an interesting question, are the bacteria within us...

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
They're... they're... they're organelles within us that are pretty much the same as bacteria

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.000
But have found some way to live in harmony and organism that we identify as ourselves

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Are they unhappy? Do they know that they're not bacteria?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And maybe the secret sauce to go from organism to healthy planetary superorganism is exactly some of what you said

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Maybe...

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Eliminating poverty...

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I mean, this is why it's not strictly a biological step to go to the superorganism

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
If we're going to get into intentionality and rationality, maybe that's what's missing to...

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
to bring us to that next step

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And evolution's just not predictive, and there's nothing strange about evolution leading a system into a complete disaster

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
But as you were saying, cultural evolution is different because we have these scenarios in our mind

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And I think we're not thinking about the future enough as a...

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Yes, making people smarter would be a really good idea

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So one of the things that this little discussion brings to mind

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
The little discussion brings out is that we have all these values like human rights

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
And they're not written into nature

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
They're invented by humans

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Or the traditional religious worldview is that they're dictated by a creator

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That each human has innate value

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And so the scientific and post-enlightenment world is trying to figure out how to ground concepts like human rights

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Which is... it's a great invention, but it's a fiction

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Just like money's a fiction, it's not really real

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000
There's no other species, exchanges, matter, energy, and ingenuity based on symbolic systems about values

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So one of the ways to ground...

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Our intuitive sense of the innate value of human rights is in what Whitehead thought about, Alfred North Whitehead

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:08.000
The idea that emerging complexity creates at every stage a greater freedom, greater possibility

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And there are kind of thresholds

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And that the human is a particularly intense threshold

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000
In which the complexity of the cells in our body, the social networks

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:31.000
We're kind of a nexus of a lot of freedom, a lot of choice, a lot of possibility

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I don't think morality is really an issue for other primates

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So it is for us

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I think that the planetary scale that could be to overcome our fears

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
That being subsumed and being less free could be more free

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Is that your personal hope or you think it could be even...

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
In this sort of Whiteheadian metaphysics, there is a telos to the universe

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And that telos is a greater complexity, greater freedom, greater creativity

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And greater beauty, for him beauty of aesthetics is an important point

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So I think you can... it's not fully worked out

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:23.000
But I think you can start to define things that there is a real difference between killing bacteria versus killing humans

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And there's a qualitative and quantitative difference

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And you can't measure it, but it's not just a self-serving bias on my part

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But otherwise human rights is... you have definite ideas about what they should be

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Of course evolution doesn't care at all about our future and that level

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
No, biological evolution has no moral

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I mean, I would just like to register my objection to this fictional...

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I think there are standards of objective standards of morality that have to do with equity and fairness and so on

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
That by thinking hard, you can figure out at least some of them

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I'm not saying that there's a rational resolution to every moral dilemma

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But I think there are some moral principles that chattel slavery is just objectively wrong

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
But it wasn't for most of human history

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
No, it was wrong, all through human history

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.000
People were doing objectively morally horrible things through most of human

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And we're still doing objectively morally horrible human things

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I don't think these are inventions, I think they're discoveries

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I think we've made moral progress by discovering or registering the fact that slavery was wrong

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
That discrimination was wrong, that discrimination against women was wrong

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
It was just unacceptable, morally

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
It wasn't right back when people thought it was okay

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It's not they're thinking one thing or another that makes it okay

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I would like to agree with you, actually, but I wish I could agree with you

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So you're saying there is a moral evolution?

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Yes, I think there is some more...

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Certainly moral evolution, but I think it's directed

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Our moral behavior has gotten in many ways better

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Because it's through the recognition, coming through moral slays

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
When you think about the civil rights movement here

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
It was a matter of getting people, the majority of people to care about a minority on purely moral grounds

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
On saying, look, this system is just wrong, maybe I'm benefiting from it

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So how do you think that might play out in the future as we have tendencies

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You brought up that are frightening tendencies, maybe for the subsumption of the individual

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Into the super organism, you know, anthill

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Do you see that we are going to need to either invent or discover or still have to be doing that?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Like there's more to come?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Well, look, I think there are a lot of...

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Just as people could live in a society with chattel slavery

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And somehow avert their gaze and avert their mind from it

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Even though they knew, I mean, Jefferson knew, these people knew they were doing something wrong at a deep level

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But we have lots of self-rationalization, a lot of blocking, psychological blocking mechanisms

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
To keep us from recognizing how terrible certain things we are doing

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You know, hopefully as time goes on, people will start to see...

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They'll look back at our society and say, you were so primitive

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Because they will have actually put into practice things that if we think about them in a calm way

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We'll say, yeah, we're really our society

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I mean, as I say, we live in a society where there's such a thing as the working poor

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That if someone can be employed 40 hours a week

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
And still be hard and still be able...

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
There's just no moral principle that should allow that in any society

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000
If you're a socialist, you think people shouldn't even have to work to live

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
And you can make that argument, that's going to be a harder argument around here

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
But even now, on both sides of the political spectrum

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
How could anybody say, yeah, somebody can be out there working 40 hours a week

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And still not be above the poverty line

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000
So I just want to point out again that animals and trees and plants don't have moral choices

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
We have moral choices

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So now we need to talk about how did morality emerge in human evolution

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And again, we have hunter-gatherer brains, we're all tribal creatures

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
We harmlessly divert that into sports or other things

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:50.000
We less so harmlessly divert that into ideologies and nationalism

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
And ethnic chauvinism and so on and so forth

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
And so there's two ways to approach our moral

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
One is what's functional, what's best for the individual for the group

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And the other is principled

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And so you're taking a principled position

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And there's reasons why that's good too

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
We certainly both agree that there's moral evolution

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But you almost sound like you'd like the God there

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
With the Ten Commandments

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
And somehow imprinting in our biology

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Rules against slavery and fantasize

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Like God, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is like you're merging the two things here

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
There was an old art, there's a...

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
If you go back to Plato in the youth of Fro, he gave the right argument about this

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Creating morality isn't something even God could do

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
If you think God made up morality

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Then you're saying, all right, I'll have Ten Commandments

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Should it be thou shalt kill or thou shalt not kill?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Well, pretty much six and one and a half a dozen of the other

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Because there's no moral principle

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Then you think that's just an arbitrary choice

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Then it wouldn't be a moral principle

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But what about the fact that those societies that chose thou shalt kill?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Which, honey did, especially outsiders

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Then they didn't survive as well

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000
There's kind of a selection process in historical cultures

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's also true that the world evolves in ways

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
The reality of our situation evolves in ways that fundamentally change the moral landscape

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
There are moral challenges we have now that people didn't have a couple hundred years ago

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:46.000
There's a historian, an environmental historian named Francois Muho, a French guy

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Who wrote an essay called Thomas Jefferson and Me a couple years ago

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
We talked about Thomas Jefferson and slavery and how, as you say, he knew that it was wrong

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
But he said that Jefferson and his contemporaries lived with what he called a moral deficit

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Because even though their new slavery was wrong, they could not imagine

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
How they could live without it

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And so they lived doing something they knew that it was wrong

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
And he goes further that slavery was a big part of how they got the energy to power their society

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The way we get energy to power our society now, we know it's wrong and it's harming future generations

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
This was not something we had to confront a couple hundred years ago, or a couple thousand years ago

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Certainly when the world was functionally infinite

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Now the world is no longer functionally infinite for us

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And we are confronted with new moral challenges

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And it's very complicated because it's not enough to just say, well we have to change how we live

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
If you wrote your bicycle here, you're fine

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Although I applaud it

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I took the train out here, that wasn't too bad

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But it's a global problem that we have to address globally

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's not enough to change our energy distribution because these issues of inequity

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We are raising people in developing countries deserve a more high energy lifestyle than they have now

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Because the, you know, rural electrification

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Being able to cook their meals without having to gather wood and gun

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
That's going to cause them respiratory harm

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
There's a basic way in which they deserve and need more energy

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And yet we all live in the same atmosphere, so it's our moral obligation

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Not just to change the way we live, but to help them change the way they live

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And this is an entirely new kind of moral conundrum that humanity has never had to face before

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.000
So there may be moral, I agree with you actually that there are moral absolutes that we can at least search for

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But certainly the landscape has changed, so there are moral conundrums we face now

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
That people have not had to face before, and that may well be true again in the future, the landscape shifts

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
So have you thought of what that might mean for the individual psychology?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Well again, to me it's part of this trying to learn how to become a larger entity than ourselves

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Work together in groups in a functional and sustainable way

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You may not like the language of super organism, and that's fine with me

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Because it's really more of a metaphor than anything else

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But certainly I think we can agree that guided by compassion and principles of equity

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And some of these principles we agree on

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:35.000
That we have to learn, we're faced now with a need to move into a mode where we can function well together in larger groups than we've had to before

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.000
And to me that reflects this kind of hierarchy that you've described in an interesting way

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But even without departing from even the traditional biological hierarchy, human species is unique

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
In a way that it's the only species that exceeded the natural boundaries of its own ecosystem

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
We don't live within constraints or we give an ecosystem

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So for us, due to a large extent to our capacity of culture, cultural exchange, we occupy the entire globe

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And we can use the entire planet and I can't entirely agree with you that because of that, that's the unique challenge

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Now all the species at any level have that maybe say moral obligation, but they kind of have a global role

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
In forming the future of its own environment

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And that's why it's certainly unique, even irrespective of culture, and the culture is probably what is responsible for the global status of our species

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
There have been species, of course, in the past who have changed the planet and suffered the consequences of that

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Going back to our friends, the cyanobacteria who poisoned the whole world

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
There's a one species that's right, there have been organisms in the past

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And I think you can find examples of single species that have done major things to the globe

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
But at any rate, in that sense it's not a new conundrum

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
But yet it is a new conundrum, but what's new about it, we're aware of it

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.000
We feel this sense of responsibility, we are, whether you want to call it evolving or changing

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Or whatever word you want to use, moving into the future as a changing entity through new mechanisms

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And obviously we're not just doing that in some vacuum space, we're doing it against the backdrop of a planet

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:27.000
The evolution of which we have somehow suddenly found ourselves integral to

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.000
And so these are now, and this is my sort of fascination in the really subject of the book I've just written

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
We're not just talking about a change in biological evolution, we're talking about a change in planetary evolution

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:47.000
That is coming about through this new level of, if we can call it evolution, cultural change

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
There's one thing that intrigues me about that, then the world, so yes, cyanobacteria or what I like to call

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Biochemical guilds have changed the world, but then it's now in our minds

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000
The carbon dioxide level is above 400 parts per million, well not everybody's mind yet

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
But hopefully it will be because it's in the air and it's talked about

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And so the world, in the way it's a problem, our minds have caused the problem, so now they're starting to appreciate that process

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Strange feedback between our minds and the planet, it wasn't my mind, it wasn't your mind

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I didn't invent fossil fuel consumption, I didn't invent computers

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It was this distributed mind, and we're already involved in this larger collective, whatever you call it

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
And I think economic markets are kind of interesting in that respect

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Because most economists and investors would agree that it's got a mind of its own

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And if they could understand it and predict it, they'd be filthy rich until everybody else adapt their mind

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And so we're already involved in culture and economics and discovery

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And this whole economy of knowledge and know-how and language and everything else

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And we're like the bacteria in our stomach trying to understand what is this thing I live in

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I always notice, and I know nothing about economics, and I'm really glad you're addressing this on this level

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I can't wait to read your book, but I always can't wait to write it

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
What are you doing here, go home and write it

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I always notice when I venture to the business pages, which occasionally I do

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
The way the language that we use to describe the market

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It has emotions, it has intentions

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
We talk about the market is spooked, or the market became afraid of this, or the market was worried about this

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Or the market was buoyed, or happy because of this

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The market has bipolar disorder

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Is this just a metaphor, an easy way to describe something, or are we actually describing some sort of...

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.000
We talk about it like a conscious entity, and yet obviously it's some manifestation of our own individual choices

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.000
That's where my knowledge of this ends, it's just sort of being befuddled by that

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
We're on the same thing

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
It's the emergence part of it

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I think, I'm sorry, I would be a little cautious about this emergence talk

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And making it all sound so mysterious, because it seems to me we're missing

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000
In the case of fossil fuels, there is just the blind greed of certain people

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Who wanted to make a lot of money, and didn't care, just like the cigarette manufacturers and so on

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
They were doing something that for Sea of We was going to be horrible, they didn't care

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Now you can talk about the emergence of this, but that's the problem, right?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Don't look at sound like it's the big one

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
But it's not interesting

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
The fossil fuel industry is making money, and they want to continue to make money

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But that's not the whole story

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You get no benefit from fossil fuels and the people who make money on it, you get no benefit

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
No, I didn't say that, I'm saying that

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Well, I'm not the same, I mean fossil fuels

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000
There's a conscious attempt which has succeeded to make people disbelieve scientific results

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.000
To question the entire scientific enterprise, to think this whole thing is a hoax

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And that's having terrible political, making it impossible to address this politically

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And that's the way we can do it

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Whether I had benefited from fossil fuels or not, and at what point it became clear the damage

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Of course, in the beginning, I can imagine people saying no matter what humans do

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000
We're too puny, right? The stuff coming out of my tailpipe can't possibly mean that

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
There's going to be human change

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Well, the greenhouse effect was not even understood

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
So there was time, it took time to figure that out

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
In a rational situation, once you figured it out, there would be steps taken to

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Emeliorate it

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000
So this being blocked by that, and it's not mysterious why we're being blocked by it, right?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
So I think what you're describing is absolutely true, but it's not the whole story

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I feel like this global mind we're talking about, which is actually kind of dumb and slow, is figuring it out

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And fossil fuels have been this wonderful thing

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000
They are a wonderful thing, I mean, we discovered that they replaced our slaves

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000
They replaced whale oil, which seemed great for a while, and then we realized that we did that a little too long

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It did some damage that we wish we hadn't done

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
200 years from now, that's how we look at fossil fuels

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
We did that a little bit too long, and we did damage that we wish hadn't been done

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:50.000
They've been an amazing source of energy, and if you look at the level of poverty

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Over the last 200 years has gone down, down, down, down, down

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000
There's been amazing progress, human infant mortality is half what it was 30 years ago

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
There are a lot of ways in which this is the best time to be a human being alive

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And a lot of that has to do with fossil fuels

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Now it's absolutely true that we need to change what we're doing

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And a big part of the reason we're not fast enough has to do with the pandemic

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And we're all about greed, and people denying that and delaying it

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So I completely agree with you, but the long story is one of we did this thing that seemed great, it was great

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And now we're realizing that we need to stop doing it as quickly as we can

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.000
And part of the reason we're having trouble realizing that we, this global human mind is because of this fact

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
That we're not on the same page, and in fact some people are profiting by keeping us all off the same page

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I just want to say that the people who work in ExxonMobil or wherever do not think of themselves as evil

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I'm sure they don't

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And they have a very few people do

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Exactly

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Okay, we will stop here and go to the audience for their questions

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.200
for their questions. You have to go to the microphone if you have a question.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:16.120
Yes, we also are talking once he says, okay, to ground this.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.600
This is getting... Can you have a question? Yeah.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:27.560
Hi, I'm Gio. I'm a neuroscientist by training and I stopped doing that because of my

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:35.640
new passion for psychocultural development. So emergence in culture is really the thing that

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.800
wakes me up in the morning and I was really enjoyed this really a rich conversation.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:50.360
I have one question, essentially about cultural development. And you said something really interesting

01:24:50.360 --> 01:25:04.840
about that I didn't get before, about that if you add energy to matter, you create complexity.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:09.800
Right? You said something like that. And it's kind of interesting because then you bounce back

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:16.280
something that was said before about cultural development. I said there is a big difference

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.480
and it's a learning we learn. And I was sort of wondering if you could make a parallel between

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:33.000
matter and a flow of energy creating complexity as fueling emergence and complexity in the

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:41.480
biological physical world and having mental structures that of course you didn't talk about that but

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:49.160
they are mental structures and they change. And this flow of information which is really learning,

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.280
which is the information that's available and that a particular individual will also be sensitive

01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:02.760
to able to read, would actually fuel emerging, I mean, complexity, creativity and the emergence

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:12.840
of new mental structure. I was wondering if you could, if you had like any ideas about what is

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:20.280
actually happening when we talk about cultural development or consciousness development.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:30.360
It's too complicated. I can talk. I mean, so I think culture requires energy

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:38.440
as just like all biological things and for this great acceleration that we've been through in

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:47.480
the last century from three times as many people practically in my lifetime, much more consumption

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:54.680
of fossil fuels, so on and so forth. I think that all requires energy to happen. But I think I

01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:02.440
want to also say two things. One in Chasan's work, Eric Chasan, he talks about optimal energy flows.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.280
If all the energy that we use outside of our bodies was going through our bodies, we'd all

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:16.920
be burnt toast. So there are different ranges of optimal energy. They often, in big history,

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:24.120
they often use the term Goldilocks parameters and sometimes they're leaps or shifts from prokaryotes

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:34.680
to eukaryotes or whatever. But it's all the same process, whether it's single cells or human brains.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:44.680
It's energy, matter, and ingenuity or information that contains ingenuity. So DNA is a way of coding

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:51.960
information and what's more important than the information is, it's information that does something.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:59.240
And so our brains are also good at coding information and the stuff we remember,

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:07.240
information that does something useful. And then that information is exchanged between brains

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:15.960
and across generations. And that's what bacteria do it by lateral genes transfer. But when you get

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:21.880
into eukaryotic evolution and sexual reproduction and distinct lineages, then you have a different

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:27.960
type of selection process, a more Darwinian. And it's not that Darwinian selection doesn't

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:34.360
operate on our genes, it does. But we have this other way of evolving through collective learning,

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.200
through symbolic language. And maybe the most important thing we invent are fictions like money

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:51.640
or human rights or religions or cities. So I don't know if that answers your question, but there's

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:58.760
a question. Don't you think that there is a correlation or at least like a mirror image between

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:07.560
flow of energy in matter, fueling biological and physical evolution and flow of information

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:15.480
within mental structures, flowing the creativity and complexity in the emergence of new mental

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:21.400
structures? So you could talk about information density flow. Yeah, exactly. That would be a

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:29.240
term that I use. Information density flow. So humans are particularly amazing. And now of course

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:36.280
we're creating new information, we're drowning in data. So one of the really interesting things

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:44.200
to look at their trajectory of digital information and plot it out against the amount of energy

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:50.040
required to store that information. So I think right now about 10% of the electric grid in the

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:59.720
United States is devoted to maintaining computers and computer data banks and super data centers.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:06.760
And that, you know, if like if the banking system goes to a blockchain, that will require a new

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:12.120
leap. If you look at the amount of genetic information that is generated or the amount of

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:18.280
information that they generated, it's CERN. So we're on this exponential leap of information,

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:24.840
but it's not, it's what matters is information that does something that has some ingenuity to it.

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:32.760
And that may be lost in the jungle as it were. Okay, I'm okay with his question just in terms of

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:39.480
we feed, so to speak, mentally on patterns of light and sound and to some degree smell,

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:48.600
but mostly in touch. But you know, so there is, we are requiring these inputs not just for the raw

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.680
energy of the light coming in. I mean, it's not really helping my body. It's way too little

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:58.280
that's coming from your, you're asking that question of as I'm getting patterns of light and sound.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:05.480
So I know very literal sense of his, his question of I do see that there is an analogy there.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.120
And then what we do with that, of course, is it's not just it's inherent that we have to do

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.600
something, it's not inherent, we have to do something with what he he spoke in English to us. So

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:23.000
we're already receptive to that. One last response and then we move to the next question.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.360
I'm not a cultural anthropologist to really provide a full answer, but as far as understand,

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:43.800
the part of the development of the human brain was a part fueled by the change of human feeding

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:49.320
patterns and diets, especially with regard to cooking, which led to the extremely much of my

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:54.520
vision that for any other organism consumption of energy and probably at the level of individual

01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:01.720
organism, even before you start talking about some communal responses to the collective consciousness.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:06.600
So for at the level of individual with the development of the brain that will lead to the

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:16.040
greater capacity of thinking processes, there was a definitely influx of energy from the change

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:21.560
of truly biological structures. So it has to do with feeding strategies change in the feeding

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:27.880
apparatus, the ability to cook and related to that utilization of tools. So I think it's directly

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:33.720
involved. Okay, next question. Oh, there are more.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:45.480
It's been a very interesting discussion, but one in particularly in terms of the

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:55.000
question of energy and ecology and so forth, but nobody mentioned an experiment that took place

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:05.560
about 75 years ago, which was an experiment conducted by a rather small group, maybe a thousand to

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:11.960
two thousand physicists who produced an atom bomb and the history of the science of this

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:21.400
really goes back to Einstein and Bohr and so on. So it was a long process and they were very

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:33.160
conscious of the ethical and moral possibilities about this event. We don't have to go into all

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:39.000
of the discussions that took place. Among the scientists, there were differences of opinion,

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:50.040
but generally those one of the argument who said that knowledge and information is more important

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:57.640
than a decision about what the result or the consequences of this would be. Of course, they were

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:04.840
under the pressure of feeling that the Nazis were developing an atom as well as we were,

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:12.520
and that the Nazis, if they got one, would be more horrible than if we exploded it. And they also

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:18.840
thought that this would have a great effect on the expense, expansiveness and availability of

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:29.160
energy because they thought atomic energy could be, we know all about this. But this wasn't

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:36.200
discussed and one of the reasons why I suppose it wasn't discussed is that they didn't know what

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:41.480
the effects would be in the long run. They thought they knew what the effects would be in the short

01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:48.520
run, but not in the long run. We still don't know whether this atomic development,

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:55.800
what the effects in the long run are going to be. And so I think that nobody has been discussing

01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:03.880
how we can find some way to be able to predict the future better, not only in the stock market,

01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:10.840
which will make one of us a richer or not, because I think that's the real problem. We can't predict

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:20.280
the future. We don't know what's going to happen. And we are still living in the where I am anyway,

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.640
in the belief that the more we know and the more we understand about nature, our own nature is in

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.360
the nature around us, the better off we'll be. But that hasn't been proven yet.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:41.320
Thank you. Well, you raised some excellent points. The Manhattan Project scientists, many of them were

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:49.240
aware of what was going to result and were terrified of it. But as you said, they were more terrified of

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.680
what would happen if they didn't do this and the Nazis did it. As far as I know, there was nobody

01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:00.760
involved in the Manhattan Project. None of the scientists who said, we shouldn't do this. Let's

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:07.560
stop because of what were unleashed. There were a lot of them that are immediately afterwards became

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:14.840
leaders in the disarmament movement. People like Philip Morrison, and for the rest of their lives,

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:21.400
many of them, this was what they devoted themselves to, was nuclear disarmament, because they realized

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:28.440
immediately that they had helped create something that was not really a weapon in a meaningful way,

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:40.680
but was a global suicide machine, which it remains. And there was even, they were even faced with

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:45.880
the knowledge, the possibility that when they did the Trinity test, they might destroy the world.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:53.320
There was a calculation that they weren't sure, depending on the cross sections of some of these

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.040
reactions that they might fuse the entire atmosphere. And at that moment, destroy all life on earth.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:04.760
They thought it was very unlikely. And they decided to go ahead with it. So, I mean, I think they

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.080
were aware of these moral contradictions. They were choosing what they thought was the lesser

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:14.280
of evil. And then a lot of them spent the rest of their lives working to put the genie back in

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:21.000
the bottle that they had helped unleash. And we still live under that thread in a way that I think

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:28.200
people underestimate for reasons that have to do with your profession, probably more than mine.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:35.080
Addressing the psychiatrist. But as far as predicting the future, let me just say one more thing.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.840
Part of what I did, I was at the Library of Congress for a year, a couple years ago,

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:45.720
as the chair of astrobiology. And one of the projects I did that I wrote up as a part of this

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:50.360
book, Earth and Human Hands, was it was called a short history of the future, where I looked at

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:55.960
predictions of the future through a large swath of history, and particular predictions of now

01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:02.040
that were written 100 years ago, 200 years ago. And one thing you realize when you do this exercise

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:09.160
is that nobody can predict the future well. Even really smart people, H2Ls, and, you know,

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.400
Sage, people who regard as Sage, who predicted certain aspects of it really well. But nobody

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:20.200
gets the game changers. And I think that that will always be true and that I'm not even sure

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.800
being able to predict the future well in total should be our goal. But there are certainly

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:34.200
aspects of that that have now become essential as far as those levers that we're pooling on the

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.080
Earth. Obviously climate modeling is important because that's a lever that we're pooling. So,

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:46.200
you know, we'll never be able to really predict the future well, but we'll be able to increase

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:55.720
our ability to break that down into some tangible goals, such as predicting the

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.960
effect on the climate of the doubling of CO2, things like that we'll get better at. But as far as,

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:05.080
I mean, the problem you're addressing really has to do with managing ourselves and our behavior,

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:13.560
collective behavior as we get more powerful tools. And that, I'm not sure, is even really a problem

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.880
of science so much as it is of spirituality and other realms we haven't entirely addressed yet

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:26.680
in this conversation. Can I say a word about the predictability problem? This actually,

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:30.200
at the very beginning, I said, well, here's an interesting thing that it's amazing that

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:35.480
above the micro-physical level where we think there are these strict laws,

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:41.240
that there's anything predictable at higher levels, right, that they should form enough structure

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:49.080
that and have enough stability and predictability. In the case of, say, atoms, you put a bunch of

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:55.560
atoms together and you get the ideal gas laws, which are very simple, right, and very, very

01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:01.640
predictive. And it's really important for that that all the atoms are the same or they interact

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:08.440
in very much the same ways. The climate is more or less the same thing, but you get because of

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:13.560
the flows, it's a chaotic system, and so it's more complicated. But the kinds of predictions

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:18.200
we're worried about, which have to do with human beings, that's a whole different ball game,

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.320
because every single one of us is different. And every single one of us will respond differently

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:29.000
to our environment and differently to inputs. And you can't have a statistical mechanical

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.880
theory that's going to predict human behavior. Well, you never will have, because there's too

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.920
much idiosyncrasy in each individual brain. So there's not the kind of uniformity that's going

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.200
to allow for such a thing. So I think if you wanted to predict, who predicted the last election

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.760
correctly? And this is something that it's not far in the future, right? We were all living in this

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:57.240
society. It had to do with collective psychology, it had to do with all sorts of things that I think

01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:04.200
are just not ever going to be amenable to strict prediction in any way. So I'm sorry to give you

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:32.520
that story. But I want to propose a major breakthrough in making progress in the way human beings think

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:40.360
together by sorting our different ways of being human, our different ways of thinking, our different

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:49.640
ways of making sense. And what I've devoted my last 50 years to is applying Freud's emphasis on

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:57.720
early experiences to that single most important item in all of life. It's people, can you name me

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:03.080
one most important item in all of life? And the answer is, I believe, pretty clearly, the sun.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:13.800
And applying Freud to the sun, I would make this proposition that the flow of solar energy to us

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:22.440
here, let's say in the middle third of the upper half of the planet goes as a curve, one curve a

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:28.360
year, it's something like 200 calories per square centimeter at the low end Christmas time for a

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:37.960
whole day to 800, six months later. So we have a solar energy flow that is sort of sinusoidal shape.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:47.640
But the point is this, your birthday turns out to be the phase with respect to that sine curve,

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:53.800
a fundamental dimension. And so we can make progress if we get rescue birthday away from

01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:02.280
astrology and its nonsensical premises and approach it more in a Freudian way. We're talking about

01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:10.680
light and dark, hot and cold. And we can sort humanity usefully so that we can learn how to think

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:19.560
together and make progress in a democracy. We can even solve the riddle of justice that it turns out

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:27.880
this is going to be too heavy. It turns out that in the Old Testament, and I'm an atheist,

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:35.720
but in the Old Testament there is a useful dividing of humanity by 12 in the 12 brothers, 12 sons of

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:43.960
Jacob. And in the fathers, goodbye to his 12 sons, he identifies a lot of traits that I think are

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:49.160
important. The kids who are born when it's cold and dark, and it gets colder and darker, he said,

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:55.320
you guys have too much murder in your heart. But in particular, one of the sons, the son, I

01:43:55.320 --> 01:44:00.920
believe, is born midwinter. He said, you guys are the ones who have the talent for being judges.

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:09.960
And when we make you guys the judges will have justice. Voila. So can you imagine approaching

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:17.560
the puzzlement that we're facing here, the confounding variety of ways of being human,

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:24.680
if we could usefully sort them, if birthday indeed was a legitimate basis for profound

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:29.800
differences in human nature, could you imagine that as a basis for some progress?

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:36.120
Guess when I hear that, I think of like ant casts or something like that, you know, the 12 cast of

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:40.120
humans based on when they were born. I mean, I've wondered like whether I was born in November,

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.520
whether like, okay, I got like a month going down to the dark, but then started coming around soon.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:49.320
I didn't get very far in my own head about that. I guess, I don't know, I think there was something

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:55.480
in nature years ago about astrological sorting. I know you're not saying it's the planets, but

01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:01.800
I think it was pretty much debunked. I'm not saying that the light doesn't have some effect on people,

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:08.920
but so does birth order, parent personality, siblings, what kind of electronics you're using.

01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:15.080
It's complex and complicated. It's complex and complicated. So, okay, next question.

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.560
The point that you made about the Manhattan Project and how these really smart people

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:27.000
came to the conclusion that they needed to be tribal because the Germans would do it

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.160
if they didn't do it is an example of even if we have really smart people, they're still going

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:42.280
to end up being tribal. So, is there any any example in nature where there are people or

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:54.360
organisms evolved from being tribal to being not tribal? So, there's a scaling that happens all

01:45:54.360 --> 01:46:03.320
through human history from small hunter groups, Rob and Dunbar thinks there's actually a neurological

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.280
correlation that probably the largest group the humans would feel comfortable in based on our

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:14.600
brain and the complexity of social relations is about 150 people. And then at that point,

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.480
it would split and there are there's also sort of archetypal

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.040
teams like the archetypal team, the band of brothers. It's like the football team, it's 12

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:34.520
over 10 or 8 or you know, but never 20, never 30, right? So, the business units. So, there's

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:41.560
are kind of an inherited natural scale to human sociality. And one of the great mysteries is

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:46.760
how do we scale it up to millions of people? Like, you know, chimpanzees could not, you know,

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.040
this many chimpanzees could not sit in the same room together. I guarantee all hell would break

01:46:52.040 --> 01:47:00.120
out, right? Especially strangers. So, right? So, you know, how we're not like a big herd animal,

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:05.640
we're intensely concerned about our social relationships. And if they get too complicated,

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.560
our brains can't deal with it. That's Dunbar's quote unquote number. So, one of the ways is

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:17.880
what part of the study, which is religion. And, you know, that's one of the ways that we scale up

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:25.880
society, right? And we go from pretty egalitarian hunter, gather troops to two hierarchical groups,

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:34.280
where there's a minority that steals the surplus production to sustain, you know, different hierarchies

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:42.920
or whatever. And one of the competitive drives, once agriculture comes into play, is that agriculture

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:49.480
is not a high growing productivity, economic activity. It gets established and then it's

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:55.400
pretty stationary. So, if you want to get rich quick, the logic is you go invade your neighbors,

01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.600
you steal their livestock or animal, you kill the men, steal the women, make them slaves,

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:05.880
increase your labor, increase your land. And so, within agricultural civilization, not only do you

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:15.800
get things like patriarchy and, you also get an economic incentive to militarization. And that

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:22.760
militarization, that competition then drives the spread of all these ideas all around the world.

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:33.000
And for good and for bad. So, anyway, it's a mystery that seven billion of us are on this planet right

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:41.480
now. It's a mystery. And that we are, I think, the pinnacle of cooperation in evolution. That's how

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.760
I would frame it rather than the pinnacle of competition. But both have played an important

01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:53.480
role in human history. And to answer your strict question, biologically, there are examples.

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.360
There's this whole counterpoint to, you know, sort of competition and survival of the fittest.

01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:04.360
There's this whole field of biology, social biology, where there is cooperation at different

01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:13.800
levels and group selection has led to remarkable examples of self-sacrifice in nature for the good

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:18.680
of the whole. And it then does come down in some level to propagating genes. Yeah, I mean,

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:23.800
the insects are the stars at this. But there are other examples as well. So, there are biological

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:31.080
factors that have pushed in that direction. But as just mentioned, human biological capacity

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:41.160
does seem to have a limit. Fortunately, we are not limited to our genetic skills. The one thing

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:46.840
that, in addition to being, you know, uniquely perhaps cooperative species, we're also uniquely

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:55.080
adaptable and reinvented species. And, you know, the world is changing in some ways that one can

01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:03.240
imagine, increase our capacity to overcome tribal differences. Global communications, right now,

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:08.200
we're at a moment of possible fragmentation and trying to struggle with some of the effects of

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:13.240
connectivity. But that may just be a moment. But it seems as though the trend is for global

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:20.520
connection. And that combined with our innate sociality may sort of come to our rescue.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.920
Tyler, do you want to respond also? I'm not trying to find what everyone said.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.040
And I would also mention science as something that is a global cooperative.

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:41.480
And, in fact, almost anything where people come together to seek some goal that's bigger than

01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:46.840
themselves. I've been a part of some spacecraft teams, you know, and very close to people. For

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.840
instance, on this New Horizons mission that just made it to Pluto. And that's a team of hundreds

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:56.360
of people who genuinely, I mean, yes, they fall prey to all the petty competitive, you know,

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.400
motivations that we all do. But there's also this level of self-sattrophes that we're all

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:06.120
in this together that we're all seeking this common goal. And humans do have an amazing ability.

01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:09.880
You know, unfortunately, a lot of times it's like our army against their army, which is what

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:15.720
unites us. But there's that capacity that, you know, faced with the challenges of

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:24.120
really the existential challenges that we're starting to become aware of that will require

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:28.920
some level of global cooperation that one can imagine those capacities being employed on a

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:33.320
global level to face those challenges. Yeah, and I'm glad you brought up science because you could

01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:40.200
look at the history of science and the scientific revolution as being a very much cooperativity

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:46.600
among these scientists that were in different nations. They just transcended that, you know,

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:52.200
for the most part. We have very little time, so please make the questions brief and the responses

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:57.640
brief. Okay. The latter part of your conversation was interesting and made me think of a book by

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:06.280
Frederick Frank to be human against all odds on the ability of mankind to transcend its

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.560
reptilian brain, which one has to wonder when we look at the incredible cruelty throughout the

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:16.760
world that man still, you know, perpetrates. And I'm not just talking about areas of conflict,

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:21.000
we can just look right here at home. We don't have to go that far. But the other thing that

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.360
was interesting is you mentioned post-enlightenment and immorality, but maybe we need to look at

01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:33.960
other societies. If we look at the First Nations and therefore it against the Dakota Access Pipeline

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:39.640
and having another view of the world, which is not post-enlightenment, but is much more

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:47.080
humane and is considerate of its fellow human beings and of the principle that we don't inherit

01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:55.320
society, our earth, sorry, from our elders, but that we borrow it from our children. So maybe,

01:52:55.320 --> 01:53:01.560
you know, white man's post-enlightenment isn't so enlightened.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:08.920
Well, speaking as one of the white men here, I don't want it. The panel is...

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.680
Is it the area where we discussed white-enlightenment?

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.160
Last question.

01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.120
I probably should have brought this up when mental structures were mentioned,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.600
being from the arts and humanities, there is a big crisis in the arts and humanities because

01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:30.280
of the increase of knowledge and the changing of mental structures. And this has a tremendous

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:34.920
effect on the nature of art and the nature of literature and the nature of humanities.

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:40.200
There are a few artists now who are trying something called Gesam Kunzwerk, which is an old term,

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:45.720
about trying to unite science and all the disciplines in an art form. And it has its advantages,

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:51.480
but only a very few can really unite all the complexity of science and the humanities.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:56.200
And I think it's something to begin to think of. We can't quite go back to the same mental

01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:02.040
structures in the works of art. Our world is too complex. At the same time, individualism is

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.240
extremely important and must never be forgotten because a work of art does come from a single

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.120
individual. So I just want to remind you, all of this complexity is very interesting. More of the

01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:16.760
artists should be listening. At the same time, it doesn't mean that it's going to have a simple

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:22.440
solution. And we are in a crisis now in terms of the nature and production of the arts.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:48.440
Great comment. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much.
