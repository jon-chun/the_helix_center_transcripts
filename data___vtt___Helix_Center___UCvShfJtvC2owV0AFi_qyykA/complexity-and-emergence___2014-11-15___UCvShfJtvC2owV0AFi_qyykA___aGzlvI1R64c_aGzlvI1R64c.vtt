WEBVTT

02:30.000 --> 02:57.720
I just want your attention for a moment.

02:57.720 --> 03:05.160
We are going to do a very un-psycho-analytic thing and guilt you all into filling out

03:05.160 --> 03:06.160
these surveys.

03:06.160 --> 03:11.880
It's a very important part of what we're doing and part of the grant that was given

03:11.880 --> 03:19.720
for these events depends on our having enough individuals filling out these surveys before

03:19.720 --> 03:22.400
and after the round table.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.000
So we're going to distribute some more of these and please just over the next couple

03:27.000 --> 03:29.600
of minutes make an effort just to fill them out if you can.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
Thanks.

03:30.600 --> 03:35.320
And we also have some more programs available that gives more information on the question

03:35.320 --> 04:00.840
for today and the participants.

04:00.840 --> 04:27.120
Not too high because then keep banging on me.

04:27.120 --> 04:41.240
So tell us about it.

04:41.240 --> 04:50.200
Next slide.

04:50.200 --> 04:57.280
Yes,azac.

05:57.280 --> 06:07.280
I think it's...

06:07.280 --> 06:11.280
Is it too heavy?

06:11.280 --> 06:16.280
It's like a couple of minutes.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.280
No more.

06:19.280 --> 06:22.280
No more.

06:22.280 --> 06:27.280
If we're in, Julie looks, we can get more people kind.

06:27.280 --> 06:32.280
Exactly.

06:32.280 --> 06:47.280
Okay, we're going to get started.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.280
I'm Rob Penzer.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.040
I'm the Associate Director of the Heel

06:50.040 --> 06:58.040

07:23.560 --> 07:27.640
Then on December 18th, we continue our Templeton Foundation

07:27.640 --> 07:31.160
funded roundtable series with the search for immortality,

07:31.160 --> 07:35.240
with philosopher Martin Hagland, astronomer Chris Impey,

07:46.640 --> 07:51.180
And there will be more Templeton Foundation events

07:51.180 --> 07:53.340
coming in the following year, as well as

07:53.340 --> 07:54.340
non-Templeton events.

07:54.340 --> 07:58.260
So watch our website for further announcements.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.100
Now I'd like to introduce our esteemed participants

08:01.100 --> 08:03.380
in today's roundtable, Complexity and Emergence.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.220
And for the benefit of the viewing audience,

08:05.220 --> 08:08.220
could each of you raise your hand when I say your name?

08:08.220 --> 08:11.100
Mark Alford is professor and chairman

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200

08:16.360 --> 08:19.440
of particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics,

08:19.440 --> 08:22.720
focusing on the theater and stars and the ultra dense matter

08:22.720 --> 08:24.420
that exists inside them.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.360
After receiving his PhD from Harvard,

08:33.200 --> 08:35.880
and then a lectureship at Glasgow University.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.800
In 2005, he received an outstanding junior investigator

08:38.800 --> 08:41.180
award from the US Department of Energy.

08:41.180 --> 08:44.060
For the last five years, he has taught Washington University's

08:44.060 --> 08:47.060
physics and society course, introducing the non-science

08:47.060 --> 08:49.620
students to the methods of physics and their application

08:49.620 --> 08:52.260
to questions that confront us as citizens of a developed

08:52.260 --> 08:54.220
and developing world.

08:54.220 --> 08:57.020

12:21.620 --> 12:24.620
and media outlets, too numerous to mention.

12:24.620 --> 12:29.620
Now, our panelists will begin.

12:29.620 --> 12:30.300
Hi.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.820
Well, perhaps I could start us off with a very general question.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.900
What do we mean by the notion of emergence?

12:37.900 --> 12:40.980
Emergence is back in vogue in discussion

12:40.980 --> 12:44.340
about the nature of the physical world.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.860
But it seems to me that different people

12:46.860 --> 12:48.060
may mean different things.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.460
There's a very uncontroversial sense of emergence,

12:51.460 --> 12:54.340
which simply means that there are levels

12:54.340 --> 12:57.820
of organization in the natural world that involve patterns

12:57.820 --> 13:00.700
that are distinct and inclined from lower level patterns

13:00.700 --> 13:04.180
of explanation and behavior and structure.

13:04.180 --> 13:05.620
In that sense, it's uncontroversial

13:05.620 --> 13:06.820
that there's emergence.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.940
Chemistry isn't identical to fundamental physics.

13:09.940 --> 13:13.700
Biology is not identical in form in its concepts,

13:13.700 --> 13:16.700
its characteristic patterns of explanation to chemistry,

13:16.700 --> 13:18.940
let alone psychology, further still,

13:18.940 --> 13:21.220
from any of these fundamental sciences.

13:21.220 --> 13:23.260
So in that sense, it's uncontroversial

13:23.260 --> 13:24.860
that there's emergence.

13:24.860 --> 13:28.060
The controversial question then is,

13:28.060 --> 13:30.540
how do these different levels of explanation,

13:30.540 --> 13:33.740
levels of organization, connect to one another?

13:33.740 --> 13:35.460
And so I thought I'd just kick it off

13:35.460 --> 13:37.420
by asking you to weigh in on that question.

13:40.740 --> 13:41.580
We'd like to begin.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.900
I don't mind taking that.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.980
I guess one of the things that interests me

13:45.980 --> 13:48.540
about the concept of emergence is this question

13:48.540 --> 13:49.620
of causality.

13:49.620 --> 13:54.620
And if you have bottom up causality

13:55.580 --> 13:59.540
so that if you understand the fundamentals of the electrons

13:59.540 --> 14:01.420
and the atoms that you can in principle

14:01.420 --> 14:05.900
put the follows and the properties of any emergent

14:05.900 --> 14:07.940
phenomena are ultimately predictable

14:07.940 --> 14:09.740
from those simpler phenomena.

14:09.740 --> 14:13.220
All this idea of bottom down causality

14:13.220 --> 14:18.140
where the emergent phenomena alters, I guess in a sense,

14:18.140 --> 14:21.260
it means altering the physical environment

14:21.260 --> 14:23.940
in which more fundamental processes play out

14:23.940 --> 14:26.500
and they then play out in a different way.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.140
You fundamental processes emerge.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.900
And I guess as a physicist, I tend to think

14:30.900 --> 14:35.420
of things like superconductivity and stuff like that

14:35.420 --> 14:40.420
where the structure of some solid substance

14:42.140 --> 14:44.340
that will become superconducting alters

14:44.340 --> 14:47.540
the fundamental characteristics of electrons.

14:47.540 --> 14:50.300
It can form this maybe old physics

14:50.300 --> 14:54.100
but koopa pairs and things that then have different properties.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.100
And of course, so I guess for me,

14:56.100 --> 14:58.100
that's a really interesting question,

14:58.100 --> 15:00.380
something I have no answer to.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.740
And I'm completely ignorant of this notion

15:02.740 --> 15:06.780
of causality operating in two different directions,

15:06.780 --> 15:08.580
perhaps even simultaneously.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.060
So I think I can maybe build up your comments here

15:14.060 --> 15:17.820
as an early universe cosmologist.

15:17.820 --> 15:21.100
I tend to take things back to the beginning.

15:21.100 --> 15:25.020
And something that I think about a lot is what,

15:25.020 --> 15:27.020
so we think about the universe itself

15:27.020 --> 15:30.780
as a complex emergent system.

15:31.820 --> 15:36.820
If that's the case, it seems like we can go back in time

15:37.820 --> 15:40.020
and sort of upward in energy

15:40.020 --> 15:42.060
and think about what the conditions were

15:42.060 --> 15:45.020
in the early universe that allowed

15:45.020 --> 15:49.700
for a complex system to emerge.

15:49.700 --> 15:53.180
Because in one sense, from a theoretical point of view,

15:54.460 --> 15:57.180
we would expect that the universe was formed

15:57.180 --> 16:01.220
in a symmetric state in which photons created

16:01.220 --> 16:04.900
particle, antiparticle pairs and vice versa.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.700
And if that had been the case,

16:06.700 --> 16:11.700
then the universe would just be a sort of soup of photons

16:11.700 --> 16:16.500
with a proton, antiproton pairs sort of here and there.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.300
And there would be no complexity

16:18.300 --> 16:20.580
and there would be no structure.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.580
And it is because there were these violations

16:24.580 --> 16:26.500
of early in the universe

16:26.500 --> 16:29.580
that we actually have a complex system to talk about.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.500
So I think that's where I tend to go

16:31.500 --> 16:35.340
when I hear the word emergence

16:35.340 --> 16:38.460
in the context of the physical universe

16:38.460 --> 16:42.540
is way back and really thinking about conservation laws

16:42.540 --> 16:44.260
and broken symmetries.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.980
Okay, so what I find interesting is that emergence

16:48.980 --> 16:50.820
is used in opposite ways.

16:52.180 --> 16:53.900
The strong type of emergence

16:53.900 --> 16:55.980
that Kayla was just talking about

16:55.980 --> 16:57.660
is used to say that the whole is more

16:57.660 --> 16:59.020
than the sum of the parts.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.380
But then there's the weak kind of emergence

17:03.380 --> 17:07.820
where you're saying that you can explain the behavior,

17:07.820 --> 17:10.060
complex interesting behavior of something larger

17:10.060 --> 17:11.740
in terms of its constituents.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.700
And then it's got a sort of reductive feel to it

17:14.700 --> 17:17.580
and you're using emergence, the same sort of idea

17:17.580 --> 17:19.500
to say, well, there isn't really anything new here

17:19.500 --> 17:21.260
to talk about, it looks interesting,

17:21.260 --> 17:24.260
but it's actually just the same lego blocks,

17:24.260 --> 17:25.300
arranged differently.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.620
And so you can, depending on how someone's using

17:27.620 --> 17:29.020
the word emergence, they can be cutting

17:29.020 --> 17:31.020
in very different directions.

17:31.020 --> 17:33.580
Yeah, one question that they have is,

17:33.580 --> 17:34.900
in this definition, for example,

17:34.900 --> 17:36.420
does it mean that the different levels

17:36.420 --> 17:38.100
they're independent?

17:38.100 --> 17:40.460
I mean, obviously, if the atomic physics is different,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.020
so the physics is different, the chemistry

17:42.020 --> 17:43.060
is going to be different.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.580
So it's not going to be completely dependent

17:44.580 --> 17:45.860
on the previous level.

17:45.860 --> 17:48.780
So there from the, I mean, introduction is the way,

17:48.780 --> 17:50.660
I mean, there are certain things that depend

17:50.660 --> 17:52.860
on the other level.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.740
So it is not completely new, completely free emergence,

17:55.740 --> 17:57.700
I mean, it's dependent on the other ones,

17:57.700 --> 18:00.340
the same way that economy depends on the biology,

18:00.340 --> 18:01.620
I mean, you can not.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.820
So if there is something that is completely new

18:05.820 --> 18:08.100
that appears on a different level,

18:08.100 --> 18:11.980
it's because we don't have the power within the theory

18:11.980 --> 18:14.540
or within our machines or our simulations

18:14.540 --> 18:16.380
to predict that there is something new

18:16.380 --> 18:19.340
or it's because there is something really new there.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.540
Well, if I could jump in there.

18:23.540 --> 18:24.580
I think you're putting your finger

18:24.580 --> 18:27.540
on a fundamental question, which is,

18:27.540 --> 18:31.100
does the very idea that the universe is built up

18:31.100 --> 18:34.460
out of some more fundamental stuff entail

18:34.460 --> 18:36.860
that the only kind of emergence

18:36.860 --> 18:38.980
that one could expect in the world

18:38.980 --> 18:41.420
is this week's or that Mark was talking about?

18:41.420 --> 18:46.180
Because of course we believe that complex objects

18:46.180 --> 18:48.900
in our universe depend in some very strong sense

18:48.900 --> 18:50.420
on their fundamental constituents

18:50.420 --> 18:54.700
and the forces that govern the binding of those constituents.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.340
And I take it that the person proposing

18:57.340 --> 19:01.420
a stronger notion of emergence will say

19:01.420 --> 19:03.860
that while there is that dependency,

19:03.860 --> 19:05.420
you can't have the complex system

19:05.420 --> 19:07.940
if the underlying stuff isn't there functioning

19:07.940 --> 19:11.980
in the way that it does, still there may be certain properties

19:11.980 --> 19:15.460
of the whole that are not wholly fixed by

19:15.460 --> 19:19.900
the underlying arrangement and propensities

19:19.900 --> 19:21.180
of the fundamental stuff.

19:21.180 --> 19:22.740
So could there be in some sense

19:22.740 --> 19:27.220
that you had a threshold level of organized complexity

19:27.220 --> 19:29.940
and then a new feature of the whole appears

19:29.940 --> 19:32.060
that's not a simple structural feature

19:32.060 --> 19:35.060
like the shape of this table, but it exerts

19:35.060 --> 19:37.700
some kind of causal influence subsequently.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.980
Going back to the question of broken symmetry.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.540
So if you have something that these

19:41.540 --> 19:44.220
there are different solutions for the practical problem

19:44.220 --> 19:47.220
and you choose one, I mean, because he started

19:47.220 --> 19:49.300
got what happened or something like that.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.180
Then I don't know, I would not say

19:52.180 --> 19:53.500
that this is kind of emergent.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.340
I mean,

19:55.780 --> 19:57.660
would not, yeah, okay, well, question is

19:57.660 --> 19:59.940
should we be thinking of emergence

19:59.940 --> 20:01.940
in the same way in every context?

20:01.940 --> 20:04.860
There's lots of complex system sciences

20:04.860 --> 20:05.700
at various level.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.540
You're talking about a very fundamental

20:07.540 --> 20:12.140
or kind of big picture that cosmological distribution

20:12.140 --> 20:14.340
of matter or something of that sort.

20:14.340 --> 20:18.180
That's one very interesting area where

20:18.180 --> 20:20.700
the question of emergence arises,

20:20.700 --> 20:24.340
but then it arises in more specific kinds of sciences,

20:24.340 --> 20:27.060
self-organizing systems, biological properties,

20:27.060 --> 20:29.580
psychological properties, consciousness, right?

20:29.580 --> 20:32.700
The mysterious nature of our own subjective awareness

20:32.700 --> 20:36.300
as persons and perhaps the way we should think about

20:36.300 --> 20:39.940
this, the idea of emergence in these contexts

20:39.940 --> 20:41.220
could it possibly be different?

20:41.220 --> 20:43.700
Is it an empirical question or is it

20:43.700 --> 20:46.780
a purely conceptual question?

20:46.780 --> 20:49.380
That is, might empirical data suggest

20:49.380 --> 20:51.380
there's a stronger form of emergence going on

20:51.380 --> 20:54.780
in relation to this specific phenomena,

20:54.780 --> 20:57.620
whereas Marx's notion of weak emergence

20:57.620 --> 21:00.380
is perfectly adequate in abstract terms

21:00.380 --> 21:02.860
to capture what's going on in some other domain.

21:02.860 --> 21:03.700
What do you think?

21:03.700 --> 21:06.460
As a scientist, you just come with an a priori

21:06.460 --> 21:08.540
presumption of weak emergence.

21:08.540 --> 21:11.100
I think scientists always get to have weak emergence

21:11.100 --> 21:13.100
because they always want to say that everything

21:13.100 --> 21:16.860
everybody else is just a game with,

21:16.860 --> 21:18.900
according to the rules and containing the ingredients

21:18.900 --> 21:21.500
that the scientist, preferably the physicists,

21:21.500 --> 21:24.700
lay down at the very beginning and then the people

21:24.700 --> 21:27.860
at the high level or special scientists, whatever you want

21:27.860 --> 21:32.740
to call them, would like to fight the reductionism

21:32.740 --> 21:35.060
and the ultimate form of fighting it

21:35.060 --> 21:37.060
is what you were just saying, where

21:37.060 --> 21:38.780
you have some structure that emerges,

21:38.780 --> 21:42.380
some high level structure that actually supposedly plays

21:42.380 --> 21:44.060
a role, a causal influence.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.460
It actually does something.

21:45.460 --> 21:48.900
And it's not just all the swarm of molecules of which

21:48.900 --> 21:52.700
is made up, all secretly, all doing stuff that somehow adds up

21:52.700 --> 21:53.500
to something, right?

21:53.500 --> 21:57.580
What you're hinting at is something beyond that,

21:57.580 --> 22:01.660
not only is it not obviously obtainable

22:01.660 --> 22:04.540
from the sum of the parts, it actually isn't.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.300
That's what you would, that's the holy grail.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.340
Is that the fair?

22:09.340 --> 22:12.900
Yeah, and then the question is, is it for empirical reasons

22:12.900 --> 22:17.020
that we might doubt there is such a strongly emerging

22:17.020 --> 22:21.380
phenomena or is it just a kind of working hypothesis that

22:21.380 --> 22:24.900
our native, our default setting as scientists,

22:24.900 --> 22:29.300
when we approach a domain, is that ultimately there's

22:29.300 --> 22:33.620
a kind of ability, so it's at best, weaker emergence.

22:33.620 --> 22:37.900
Well, the default is certainly going

22:37.900 --> 22:40.900
to be being able to do business as usual.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.780
So I think you'd need some pretty dramatic evidence

22:43.780 --> 22:47.700
to push people away from the idea that ultimately it's

22:47.700 --> 22:50.420
all the standard ingredients operating according

22:50.420 --> 22:52.740
to the standard rules.

22:52.740 --> 22:56.180
And what we can think about would be interesting,

22:56.180 --> 22:59.020
would be what if such evidence showed up?

22:59.020 --> 23:02.180
What if you found something where it looked

23:02.180 --> 23:05.420
as if you really couldn't, some actual phenomenon,

23:05.420 --> 23:07.020
that you really couldn't explain it

23:07.020 --> 23:10.260
by using the standard model of particle physics

23:10.260 --> 23:13.500
or using whatever you usually did?

23:13.500 --> 23:14.420
How would we react?

23:14.420 --> 23:18.060
Yeah, what can be the best example of these strong?

23:18.060 --> 23:21.100
How do you distinguish it from simply being ignorant?

23:21.100 --> 23:22.820
Well, that's fundamental.

23:22.820 --> 23:27.300
Well, so some philosophers and others

23:27.300 --> 23:29.660
will point to conscious awareness,

23:29.660 --> 23:33.860
subjective experience that we're all having right now.

23:33.860 --> 23:39.020
As we think about the nature of the universe,

23:39.020 --> 23:41.860
we seem to have this direct immediate apprehension

23:41.860 --> 23:45.540
of our own conscious states and the qualities

23:45.540 --> 23:49.380
of our experience, the looks of colors, the sounds,

23:49.380 --> 23:54.300
given off by moving bodies.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.700
These categories have no place in a physical description

23:57.700 --> 23:59.460
of the world around us.

23:59.460 --> 24:02.340
And yet they are an aspect of the way

24:02.340 --> 24:04.020
we experience the world.

24:04.020 --> 24:07.020
We think that we have a very good understanding

24:07.020 --> 24:08.980
of how the neurons work and they are connected

24:08.980 --> 24:10.500
and all these things.

24:10.500 --> 24:15.220
We would not be able to predict something like that.

24:15.220 --> 24:20.340
The Australian philosopher Frank Jackson

24:20.340 --> 24:23.420
proposes, you know, a contemplate.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.900
Philosophers are interested always

24:24.900 --> 24:26.180
in the end game scenario, right?

24:26.180 --> 24:27.900
Empirical science is ongoing.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.660
So what we have to do is there's

24:30.660 --> 24:34.460
some sort of strong reason for thinking

24:34.460 --> 24:37.060
that no matter what the future development of science, which

24:37.060 --> 24:39.980
of course is unknown to us right now,

24:39.980 --> 24:45.780
there could not be a thorough explication

24:45.780 --> 24:48.420
of conscious experience in physical terms.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.780
And his argument is, you know, so positive,

24:50.780 --> 24:53.260
we have a neuroscientist, call her Mary.

24:53.260 --> 24:58.140
And Mary knows everything about the neuroscientific processes

24:58.140 --> 25:00.500
underlying color experience.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.060
So she knows what's going on in the visual cortex.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.780
She knows how the light information comes into the eye,

25:05.780 --> 25:07.780
how it triggers what's going on in the brain.

25:07.780 --> 25:11.140
And she can do all that in neuroscientific terms,

25:11.140 --> 25:15.180
enough so that if she sees a computer read out of somebody's

25:15.180 --> 25:19.500
brain, she can tell you about the intrinsic character

25:19.500 --> 25:20.300
of the experience.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.020
But suppose Mary herself has never had color experience.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.660
Suppose Mary grew up in a black and white room

25:25.660 --> 25:30.740
and was imprisoned there by her diabolical parents.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.700
But then she escapes as an adult.

25:32.700 --> 25:36.380
And she suddenly goes out, she sees a bright red rose.

25:36.380 --> 25:40.900
Her first ever non-monochromatic color experience.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.220
And she says to herself, so that's

25:43.220 --> 25:47.060
what it's like to experience redness.

25:47.060 --> 25:49.540
It seems like she's learning something new,

25:49.540 --> 25:53.260
not about the physical world, but about the character

25:53.260 --> 25:56.460
of color experience, the intrinsic subjective character

25:56.460 --> 25:58.100
of color experience.

25:58.100 --> 26:02.060
And it would appear that simply having a picture

26:02.060 --> 26:04.380
of the structure and dynamics of the brain

26:04.380 --> 26:08.100
is not going to disclose that intrinsic quality.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.540
A congenitally blind color scientist

26:11.540 --> 26:14.260
can know everything about the structural arrangements

26:14.260 --> 26:17.100
of the brain and the dynamical processes

26:17.100 --> 26:18.940
that govern the unfolding of that.

26:18.940 --> 26:23.020
But it seems intuitively to us is going to necessarily

26:23.020 --> 26:26.660
lack acquaintance with the intrinsic character

26:26.660 --> 26:27.780
of that color experience, some kind

26:27.780 --> 26:29.780
of intrinsic property of the color experience.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.500
Yeah, I can imagine the same experiment

26:31.500 --> 26:34.540
and the experiences that are not humans, for example.

26:34.540 --> 26:36.420
And then you don't need to postulate anything

26:36.420 --> 26:40.860
like a consciousness for understanding

26:40.860 --> 26:44.580
the reaction of this and the behavior of this animal,

26:44.580 --> 26:47.020
for example.

26:47.020 --> 26:47.740
Oh, sorry.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.980
Can you hear me now?

26:48.980 --> 26:49.500
Yes.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.540
So if you take another animal that is not human,

26:53.540 --> 26:55.940
and then you do a similar experiment,

26:55.940 --> 26:58.060
that's probably more ethical.

26:58.060 --> 27:02.300
So then, probably the assignment would realize

27:02.300 --> 27:03.900
that they have some experience or not

27:03.900 --> 27:05.380
being cautious of doing that.

27:05.380 --> 27:08.940
But it's probably the same behavior.

27:08.940 --> 27:10.700
I mean, we don't need to postulate something

27:10.700 --> 27:12.740
like a consciousness at these points.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.220
But don't we know that we ourselves are conscious?

27:15.220 --> 27:19.340
Isn't that something given to us before any engaging

27:19.340 --> 27:22.620
in science that's given to us more immediately

27:22.620 --> 27:25.820
than anything else, that I myself am a conscious being

27:25.820 --> 27:29.300
that I'm having experiences of a certain sort.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.500
I'm wondering whether what you're suggesting is,

27:31.500 --> 27:34.580
well, this consciousness notion is something

27:34.580 --> 27:38.860
that mature science is going to do away with.

27:38.860 --> 27:43.020
We can explain everything in terms of structure and dynamics.

27:43.020 --> 27:46.500
And so no need to postulate consciousness.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.780
But the consciousness doesn't seem to be something

27:48.780 --> 27:49.700
that we postulate.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.500
It seems to be something that we start with.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.980
It's part of our data.

27:52.980 --> 27:56.220
Yeah, my only thing is that if, I mean, it is the question.

27:56.220 --> 27:58.940
If we forget about there is something like consciousness,

27:58.940 --> 28:03.060
I think the world can be exactly explainable in the same way

28:03.060 --> 28:04.420
or not explainable in the same way.

28:04.420 --> 28:06.020
I mean, if there is a person here,

28:06.020 --> 28:07.900
if that is not conscious or something like that,

28:07.900 --> 28:10.500
then it can't react in similar way.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.340
Who's the zombie?

28:12.340 --> 28:19.660
I can't react in the same way.

28:19.660 --> 28:21.180
I think there's a more fundamental problem

28:21.180 --> 28:24.100
with what you're saying, which is that you're

28:24.100 --> 28:25.620
sort of a first person thing.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.220
You're saying there's this first person thing

28:27.220 --> 28:29.740
that I have this conscious experience.

28:29.740 --> 28:31.860
And could science ever capture that?

28:31.860 --> 28:34.380
No, because science is inherently third person.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.500
But actually, all forms of inquiry.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.460
And then you could even say all forms of knowledge

28:38.460 --> 28:40.100
are inherently third person.

28:40.100 --> 28:43.340
But there's really almost nothing that you can say.

28:43.340 --> 28:45.180
You have that experience.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.860
You could say you have the experience.

28:46.860 --> 28:49.740
But beyond that, it doesn't seem like there's anything

28:49.740 --> 28:51.740
you can do or say.

28:51.740 --> 28:56.540
So supposing that the strong emergentists dream came true.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.100
And there were these phenomena.

28:58.100 --> 29:02.460
And when somebody was angry, something

29:02.460 --> 29:04.100
happened in the synapses of their brain

29:04.100 --> 29:06.620
that wasn't because of other synapses firing.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.260
It's coming from God knows where.

29:08.260 --> 29:11.300
It seems like it's coming from outside the system.

29:11.300 --> 29:15.100
OK, so now we've seen this sort of thing before in science.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.620
We've had processes that seem to not conserve energy.

29:18.620 --> 29:20.380
And we postulated the neutrino.

29:20.380 --> 29:23.100
And you have little pieces of metal moving around on paper

29:23.100 --> 29:23.980
with nothing touching them.

29:23.980 --> 29:26.020
And you postulate a magnetic field.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.540
So we'll go in there.

29:27.540 --> 29:30.100
We'll postulate some other thing.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.860
We'll try and explain what's going on.

29:31.860 --> 29:33.620
We'll try and understand it.

29:33.620 --> 29:36.340
All that's going to be third person.

29:36.340 --> 29:39.940
And in fact, even a psychologist

29:39.940 --> 29:43.340
is explicitly investigating feelings.

29:43.340 --> 29:44.420
It's all third person.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.820
You're investigating other people's feelings.

29:45.820 --> 29:48.740
You're investigating how they behave, what they want, what

29:48.740 --> 29:50.620
they do.

29:50.620 --> 29:54.660
Psychoanalysis is inherently third person.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.140
It's very hard, as far as I can see, to think up.

29:58.140 --> 30:01.740
The first person thing that seems like the motivation

30:01.740 --> 30:06.580
for emergence is actually a form of knowledge.

30:06.580 --> 30:08.740
Another thing I think in science, one of the things

30:08.740 --> 30:12.100
that we postulate that there is a magnetic field, for example,

30:12.100 --> 30:14.540
there are some predictions that can be done there.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.140
And going back to my point is that if we have an animal

30:17.140 --> 30:19.260
and we want to know, is there a test

30:19.260 --> 30:20.980
that we can do to the animal?

30:20.980 --> 30:24.100
To know if this animal or this person is conscious or not,

30:24.100 --> 30:28.220
we thought postulate in the existence of the consciousness.

30:28.220 --> 30:32.060
I think we can exactly predict the same behavior.

30:32.060 --> 30:32.820
Good.

30:32.820 --> 30:34.700
Maybe we should just pursue a bit longer,

30:34.700 --> 30:37.060
because I still think there's a little bit

30:37.060 --> 30:39.980
about the case of consciousness.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.300
But I think it's a special case.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.020
So I think eventually we'll want to transition

30:43.020 --> 30:45.020
to talking about other forms of complexity.

30:45.020 --> 30:48.500
So the reason I say it seems like a special case is precisely

30:48.500 --> 30:53.060
because in other domains, like you've been both

30:53.060 --> 30:58.740
are indicating right now, it's when we get puzzling phenomena

30:58.740 --> 31:01.460
that is observable physical phenomena

31:01.460 --> 31:06.100
that are current inventory, or physical inventory of properties

31:06.100 --> 31:09.260
and in forces doesn't seem adequate to capture

31:09.260 --> 31:12.580
that we then have to broaden out our physical

31:12.580 --> 31:16.140
understanding, so electromagnetism in the 19th century.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.820
In the case of consciousness, it's

31:17.820 --> 31:20.060
not the behavior of consciousness that

31:20.060 --> 31:22.380
leads us to think we're going to need

31:22.380 --> 31:24.500
some new fundamental explanatory principle.

31:24.500 --> 31:26.140
It's in the intrinsic character.

31:26.140 --> 31:27.980
We have this acquaintance with consciousness,

31:27.980 --> 31:30.460
and then it's left for future theorizing to say,

31:30.460 --> 31:31.900
what difference does it make?

31:31.900 --> 31:33.740
Is it epiphenomenal?

31:33.740 --> 31:36.580
Is it such that it's just there, but it's

31:36.580 --> 31:39.940
an offshoot of the intrinsic character

31:39.940 --> 31:41.740
of neurophysiological processes, but it

31:41.740 --> 31:44.780
makes no fundamental difference to explaining

31:44.780 --> 31:47.980
the behavior of the conscious person,

31:47.980 --> 31:50.140
or does it impact, have an impact?

31:50.140 --> 31:52.540
That's still an open question.

31:52.540 --> 31:55.420
Once you take on board, consciousness

31:55.420 --> 31:58.820
is a new fundamental kind of feature.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.980
So it's a very sad taste, and Mark was saying,

32:01.980 --> 32:05.740
but from the point of view of theoretical science,

32:05.740 --> 32:08.220
to make progress in order to gain knowledge,

32:08.220 --> 32:11.100
we have to take a third personal point of view.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.220
And I think that's right.

32:12.220 --> 32:14.740
In every other domain, other than conscious experience,

32:14.740 --> 32:17.740
itself, precisely because what we're theorizing about

32:17.740 --> 32:24.740
is a first personal experiential kind of state.

32:24.740 --> 32:28.780
So to try to understand the solidity of this table,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.300
your first personal experience as an investigator

32:31.300 --> 32:35.420
is irrelevant, provided you have enough experiential powers.

32:35.420 --> 32:37.580
Maybe you're blind, maybe you're deaf.

32:37.580 --> 32:41.060
You have certain limitations on your sensory apparatus,

32:41.060 --> 32:43.020
but it provided you have enough in order

32:43.020 --> 32:47.740
to understand the theory of physical bonding processes.

32:47.740 --> 32:48.260
Matter.

32:48.260 --> 32:52.380
It doesn't matter that you lack knowledge of what

32:52.380 --> 32:56.740
it's like as a normally cited person to see the table.

32:56.740 --> 32:58.620
You can still understand completely

32:58.620 --> 33:00.700
the physical dynamics of the table

33:00.700 --> 33:03.660
and why it's a relatively stable, solid object.

33:03.660 --> 33:06.620
But conscious experience itself is the first person phenomena.

33:06.620 --> 33:08.340
So if you say, well, we're going to leave that out

33:08.340 --> 33:10.380
of the picture and just talk about the dynamics

33:10.380 --> 33:13.500
of neurons in relevant portions of the brain,

33:13.500 --> 33:15.020
well, you're leaving out precisely what

33:15.020 --> 33:19.500
is being put forward to for explanation.

33:19.500 --> 33:23.500
So it's a first personal phenomena intrinsically.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.260
So this is maybe taking it in a slightly different direction,

33:27.260 --> 33:29.100
but it's also because I'm a simple person

33:29.100 --> 33:31.820
and I'm getting very confused with all these discussions

33:31.820 --> 33:32.500
of conscious.

33:32.500 --> 33:36.820
But one thing that pops into my head as you're talking,

33:36.820 --> 33:40.140
and I think it relates to the first question,

33:40.140 --> 33:44.740
what does emergence and complexity mean to you?

33:44.740 --> 33:47.780
You're assuming, I think, or perhaps when people talk

33:47.780 --> 33:50.420
about consciousness that everyone has the same type

33:50.420 --> 33:51.940
of consciousness.

33:51.940 --> 33:55.140
Now, if we say that consciousness comes

33:55.140 --> 33:58.100
as an emergent phenomena from an extraordinarily complex

33:58.100 --> 34:00.740
biological system, electrochemical signals and so on,

34:00.740 --> 34:04.860
there's no guarantee that it's precisely the same for everyone.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.700
There are enough neurons and synapses

34:06.700 --> 34:10.180
that every individual human, every one of seven billion

34:10.180 --> 34:12.420
minds, human minds that exist on this planet,

34:12.420 --> 34:15.460
actually have something that's slightly different about them.

34:15.460 --> 34:18.980
Now, in a statistical sense, we can do

34:18.980 --> 34:23.220
tests to examine consciousness and our reactions

34:23.220 --> 34:25.660
to whether that's a red rose or a black and white rose

34:25.660 --> 34:26.500
and so on.

34:26.500 --> 34:30.260
But that's kind of a statistical test.

34:30.260 --> 34:34.580
It's not getting to the core of one of the reasons,

34:34.580 --> 34:36.020
I guess what I'm trying to say is that one

34:36.020 --> 34:37.660
of the reasons something like consciousness

34:37.660 --> 34:42.260
may be such a slippery thing, apart from our innate relationship

34:42.260 --> 34:46.020
to it, is it may be different all the time.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.900
It's something that comes out of enormous complexity.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.220
And the same is true of other emergent phenomena.

34:51.220 --> 34:54.460
And this is one of the things we may be having a hard time

34:54.460 --> 34:57.740
getting hold of is that there's stochasticity

34:57.740 --> 35:01.500
in this whole process, that's random, that's everything.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.100
It's going to be slightly different in every single instance.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.140
And perhaps that is one of the things

35:07.140 --> 35:09.300
that is making this difficult for us to grow.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.020
It's certainly making it difficult for me to grow.

35:11.020 --> 35:13.860
But maybe that's just because I'm very simplistic

35:13.860 --> 35:14.580
about these things.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.740
Does that trigger any thoughts?

35:16.740 --> 35:18.620
Yeah, I think it's not what you're saying.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.380
I think it's not difficult to understand

35:20.380 --> 35:23.100
because it's like planets which you understand very well.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.340
Well, I don't.

35:24.340 --> 35:25.580
OK, which come in.

35:25.580 --> 35:29.300
Millions of different varieties and a very hard to pin down.

35:29.300 --> 35:30.980
When you say everyone's consciousness

35:30.980 --> 35:32.500
is different from each other.

35:32.500 --> 35:33.220
Well, maybe.

35:33.220 --> 35:34.740
Well, I don't think there's even a maybe.

35:34.740 --> 35:37.140
It's not even clear there's a question.

35:37.140 --> 35:38.380
There is no way.

35:38.380 --> 35:40.500
There is a way to compare this planet to that planet.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.300
Even if it's difficult, you can send the probe,

35:42.300 --> 35:43.500
measure the spectrum.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.500
There is no way, even in principle,

35:45.500 --> 35:48.860
to compare your consciousness with anyone else's.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.580
We don't even know what the question means.

35:50.580 --> 35:51.980
What do we do to answer it?

35:51.980 --> 35:54.260
I think that's what's actually so slippery and hard about it.

35:54.260 --> 35:58.340
Not that it's very difficult, practically.

35:58.340 --> 36:00.500
So my present conscious experience

36:00.500 --> 36:04.780
is not just open to investigators to all look at,

36:04.780 --> 36:06.540
verify that it has certain properties,

36:06.540 --> 36:08.100
and then move on to the next subject,

36:08.100 --> 36:10.020
and then do the comparison.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.860
Each of us at the end of the day,

36:11.860 --> 36:16.100
if we take the fundamentally of conscious experience seriously,

36:16.100 --> 36:18.740
we're stuck with saying all we ever have,

36:18.740 --> 36:22.420
any individual researcher has direct observational access

36:22.420 --> 36:25.220
to is her own conscious experience.

36:25.220 --> 36:30.140
And so then one could worry that there's

36:30.140 --> 36:33.940
much greater variation in conscious experience,

36:33.940 --> 36:36.620
even for people similarly poised, physically,

36:36.620 --> 36:43.620
looking out at the same angle, how much variation is there.

36:43.620 --> 36:48.220
It looks like we just have to make indirect guesses based

36:48.220 --> 36:50.380
on physical similarity.

36:50.380 --> 36:54.700
The brain scientists tell us about processes that are going on,

36:54.700 --> 36:57.860
and they're being commonalities of types,

36:57.860 --> 37:00.980
that there's perhaps no guarantee that that directly corresponds

37:00.980 --> 37:06.060
to commonality of intrinsic conscious properties.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.420
Yeah.

37:07.420 --> 37:10.740
Well, I wonder whether we could shift from consciousness,

37:10.740 --> 37:13.700
and maybe I could pass the baton, since I'm a philosopher

37:13.700 --> 37:17.340
of mind, but there's all these other interesting physical

37:17.340 --> 37:17.940
phenomena.

37:17.940 --> 37:22.580
So I wonder if somebody could run with a form put out there

37:22.580 --> 37:25.340
for the rest of us some form of complexity

37:25.340 --> 37:27.900
in a domain that you study and with it.

37:27.900 --> 37:31.220
So I think, for example, yes, that we were discussing before.

37:31.220 --> 37:32.660
One interesting one is, for example,

37:32.660 --> 37:34.020
something like the origin of life.

37:34.020 --> 37:36.300
I mean, if knowing the fundamental physics,

37:36.300 --> 37:38.420
laws, and the chemistry, and everything,

37:38.420 --> 37:40.580
if we could predict that there is something like life,

37:40.580 --> 37:41.980
and if the life would be in this form,

37:41.980 --> 37:43.980
or there are several forms, or something like that.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.620
I mean, obviously, life exists, and it can be measured.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.460
So it's a well-defined problem.

37:49.460 --> 37:53.180
So I think here we have an expert that

37:53.180 --> 37:57.540
can give an opinion that is a little bit more solid than mine.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.420
Yeah, I mean, I think origins of life

37:59.420 --> 38:04.060
is an excellent example, because we've built.

38:04.060 --> 38:06.100
What's interesting about the origins of life question

38:06.100 --> 38:08.980
just to go back to very sort of practical terms

38:08.980 --> 38:12.580
is that it's a bit like defining life.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.980
There's a joke that goes on in circles

38:14.980 --> 38:18.100
where if you stop a random scientist on the street

38:18.100 --> 38:20.100
and you ask them, tell me what life is.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.260
Define that.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.460
You get a different answer each time.

38:23.460 --> 38:27.220
And one of the excuses that we come up with,

38:27.220 --> 38:29.660
well, life is a sort of emergent phenomenon.

38:29.660 --> 38:32.780
It's a complex thing, and so, et cetera, et cetera.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.740
But this directly impacts the quest

38:35.740 --> 38:40.660
to understand the origin point of at least life here on Earth.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.500
Is there a clearly defined origin point?

38:42.500 --> 38:45.780
So we start to explore this, and we look, perhaps,

38:45.780 --> 38:51.220
at the nature of biomolecules, how they might come

38:51.220 --> 38:54.820
together and chain reactions to reduce polymer-like molecules

38:54.820 --> 38:57.620
that then fold and do other things, and so on.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.620
We might look at, we might look for origins of life

39:00.620 --> 39:04.420
by studying inorganic templates on the Earth.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.660
So, for example, looking at hydrothermal vent systems,

39:07.660 --> 39:11.140
whether there are electrical and chemical gradients

39:11.140 --> 39:12.940
that look remarkably similar to things

39:12.940 --> 39:15.420
that we see across cell walls.

39:15.420 --> 39:18.500
And the interesting thing about the origins of life question

39:18.500 --> 39:22.460
is that much like defining life, there are probably,

39:22.460 --> 39:24.580
right now, 100 theories out there,

39:24.580 --> 39:27.700
or 100 investigations, each is different

39:27.700 --> 39:31.660
than trying to answer what was the origin point of life.

39:31.660 --> 39:35.140
And I think what's becoming clear from that, at least,

39:35.140 --> 39:39.620
my mind, is that it's not unreasonable to think of life,

39:39.620 --> 39:42.420
also, as some kind of emergent phenomena.

39:42.420 --> 39:44.740
It's an emergent property of chemistry.

39:44.740 --> 39:48.940
But it may have had multiple origin points.

39:48.940 --> 39:54.540
And so this adds another layer to the issue of complexity

39:54.540 --> 39:56.180
and emergence.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.980
Maybe there are some phenomena that

39:57.980 --> 40:02.220
are initiated in many different ways simultaneously.

40:02.220 --> 40:05.180
And it's the combination of all those that come together.

40:05.180 --> 40:09.020
So I think in origins of life research,

40:09.020 --> 40:12.500
there's something that we might learn by understanding

40:12.500 --> 40:14.420
what really is emergence.

40:14.420 --> 40:17.180
And is there, sorry to come back to this.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.980
And I'm a reductionist.

40:18.980 --> 40:19.820
Don't get me wrong.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.740
But I do believe that there are feedbacks, feedback loops.

40:25.740 --> 40:27.940
And I think, a sort of intermediate way

40:27.940 --> 40:32.020
of thinking about this bottom up to top down causality

40:32.020 --> 40:34.380
is that there are feedback loops that are initiated.

40:34.380 --> 40:38.140
You have an emergent phenomena, and it influences what's

40:38.140 --> 40:39.380
happening at a more fundamental level.

40:39.380 --> 40:42.820
But there is feedback, because at more fundamental level,

40:42.820 --> 40:46.460
they turn influences the emergent phenomena.

40:46.460 --> 40:49.020
And there may be stuff like that happening

40:49.020 --> 40:50.780
in questions of origins of life.

40:50.780 --> 40:53.140
So I know it's a little vague and nebulous.

40:53.140 --> 40:56.620
But yeah, origins of life.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.340
If there's an emergent phenomena that we're really interested

40:59.340 --> 41:02.460
in, it's life.

41:02.460 --> 41:02.980
So I don't know.

41:02.980 --> 41:07.620
Does anyone have any feelings or thoughts about that?

41:07.620 --> 41:10.740
Is life an emergent phenomenon?

41:10.740 --> 41:12.740
You want to vote?

41:12.740 --> 41:16.620
Well, there's only four of us.

41:16.620 --> 41:18.740
Anyone is going to disagree with that.

41:18.740 --> 41:21.020
But is it?

41:21.020 --> 41:22.980
Then what type of emergent phenomena?

41:22.980 --> 41:25.060
Yeah, so that's a good question.

41:25.060 --> 41:28.820
I think weekly emergent, we would all probably go for.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.900
Because there isn't this sort of classic argument

41:32.900 --> 41:34.580
that it has to be something other than that.

41:34.580 --> 41:38.940
So it could all come from the dance of molecules.

41:38.940 --> 41:41.260
So that's probably enough for people

41:41.260 --> 41:42.980
to say that's the default hypothesis

41:42.980 --> 41:45.020
until you kick me off it.

41:45.020 --> 41:47.860
Yeah, it's interesting that in the history of science,

41:47.860 --> 41:52.980
in the late 19th and early 20th century,

41:52.980 --> 41:56.260
there was a lot of very serious scientists

41:56.260 --> 41:59.180
who thought that life was a strongly emergent phenomena

41:59.180 --> 42:01.180
that they thought, well, just look.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.140
Look at a living thing.

42:02.140 --> 42:03.820
Look at the dynamical principles.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.340
There's a kind of teleology there

42:05.340 --> 42:08.740
that you don't see in non-living matter.

42:08.740 --> 42:12.900
But that kind of perspective sort of completely

42:12.900 --> 42:17.540
fell by the board with the rise of the DNA analysis of life

42:17.540 --> 42:19.500
and coming to understand that one thing we know,

42:19.500 --> 42:21.700
life is a very complex phenomena.

42:21.700 --> 42:25.500
So this idea that it's a simple quality that just sort of appears

42:25.500 --> 42:29.580
when matter is arranged in the right sort of form.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.860
That's not taking seriously.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.260
And yet it's interesting that you're

42:34.260 --> 42:36.740
wanting to bring back in the question of,

42:36.740 --> 42:38.940
in terms of the origin point of life.

42:38.940 --> 42:40.260
So I think there are several things

42:40.260 --> 42:43.020
that I think one should take this idea seriously also.

42:43.020 --> 42:45.380
I mean, it's amazing that when life, I mean,

42:45.380 --> 42:47.140
when the Earth was habitable, I mean,

42:47.140 --> 42:51.740
a few million years or not even a thousand million years

42:51.740 --> 42:56.500
after that, it was after that we started having science of life.

42:56.500 --> 43:00.180
So it was very, very immediate that this happened.

43:00.180 --> 43:02.300
So I don't know.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.740
I mean, we have only one example.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.780
So basically, we have two solutions to the problem.

43:05.780 --> 43:07.940
One no life in some problem in some planets

43:07.940 --> 43:09.340
and one life in ours.

43:09.340 --> 43:10.580
So it's only one.

43:10.580 --> 43:14.620
But I mean, it's interesting that it happened so fast.

43:14.620 --> 43:17.620
So I think it could be that we don't understand exactly how

43:17.620 --> 43:19.980
to connect the dots of something that is starting

43:19.980 --> 43:21.220
from a soup of molecules.

43:21.220 --> 43:23.820
They still have organized to arrive to something

43:23.820 --> 43:25.420
that is kind of life-like.

43:25.420 --> 43:27.500
And we don't know if the solution is unique as the one

43:27.500 --> 43:29.500
that we have, or they have many different solutions

43:29.500 --> 43:30.140
in each planet.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.380
I mean, perhaps in a few years, we

43:31.380 --> 43:32.740
will have a collection of planets

43:32.740 --> 43:37.260
in a star wars reach of those with different creatures.

43:37.260 --> 43:39.820
There is a request that you all have to evolve.

43:39.820 --> 43:40.580
Oh, I say sorry.

43:40.580 --> 43:42.940
Yeah.

43:42.940 --> 43:46.460
So are any of us here fairly knowledgeable

43:46.460 --> 43:49.900
about more general self-replicating systems that

43:49.900 --> 43:53.940
are non-living and does this shed light perhaps on?

43:53.940 --> 43:56.220
There's a lot of science going on,

43:56.220 --> 43:58.660
treating of simpler non-living systems,

43:58.660 --> 44:01.620
but nevertheless, share with living systems

44:01.620 --> 44:05.820
this self-replicating dynamics and apparently

44:05.820 --> 44:10.980
a kind of spontaneous emergence, but probably

44:10.980 --> 44:13.780
of a weak form of emergence where we can actually

44:13.780 --> 44:16.940
understand very well the underlying physical principles

44:16.940 --> 44:18.180
that govern these systems.

44:18.180 --> 44:21.420
And I just wonder for somebody who studies living systems

44:21.420 --> 44:23.860
themselves, which are much more complex,

44:23.860 --> 44:26.900
whether this is something that is potentially

44:26.900 --> 44:30.460
going to shed light and provide the answer to your question.

44:30.460 --> 44:33.340
I think people, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

44:33.340 --> 44:36.140
back in, what's it, the 1970s, 1980s,

44:36.140 --> 44:39.180
people got fascinated by cellular or dominant, right?

44:39.180 --> 44:42.140
These little essentially computer codes

44:42.140 --> 44:44.020
that had very simple rules.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.540
And suddenly you could get all this complexity emerging

44:46.540 --> 44:47.100
and so on.

44:47.100 --> 44:52.020
I don't know what people work on today in that area.

44:52.020 --> 44:55.220
Is there some particular field you have in mind where people

44:55.220 --> 44:55.740
are?

44:55.740 --> 44:57.540
Well, I just know that there are very

44:57.540 --> 44:59.860
simple physical mechanisms that exhibit.

44:59.860 --> 45:01.980
I don't know a great deal about it.

45:01.980 --> 45:04.260
That's why I was wondering if any of you could speak more

45:04.260 --> 45:05.340
to it.

45:05.340 --> 45:07.620
But they can be studied.

45:07.620 --> 45:09.540
So these aren't just computer simulations,

45:09.540 --> 45:11.740
like cognitive life.

45:11.740 --> 45:13.420
These are actual physical systems that

45:13.420 --> 45:17.540
exhibit self-replication of a kind.

45:17.540 --> 45:21.860
I think you'd have to have Stephen Wolfram to have that done

45:21.860 --> 45:22.380
in detail.

45:26.340 --> 45:29.060
So I think that I'd like to make a point about evolution,

45:29.060 --> 45:30.380
actually, in connection with this.

45:30.380 --> 45:34.620
And that is that, so just as there's

45:34.620 --> 45:38.900
people who would like mind to be something more than the physical

45:38.900 --> 45:42.340
body, there's many people who would like the development

45:42.340 --> 45:48.100
of life culminating in us to be more than just random variation

45:48.100 --> 45:49.620
plus natural selection.

45:49.620 --> 45:53.900
And there's an overstatement that scientists are prone to

45:53.900 --> 45:58.820
in this, that we have biology and we have a mechanism

45:58.820 --> 46:03.980
by which you can see how random variation plus natural

46:03.980 --> 46:09.820
selection could give you complicated organisms like us.

46:09.820 --> 46:10.820
That's true.

46:10.820 --> 46:14.900
What you often see scientists do is convert that into a very

46:14.900 --> 46:19.940
different statement, which is we know that random mutations

46:19.940 --> 46:23.300
plus natural selection gave rise to us.

46:23.300 --> 46:26.380
In other words, they go from random mutations plus natural

46:26.380 --> 46:30.060
selection would be enough to that's actually what happened.

46:30.060 --> 46:32.580
We know that all the mutations that actually happened in

46:32.580 --> 46:36.020
the history of the universe to produce us were random.

46:36.020 --> 46:37.140
Those are two very distant statements.

46:37.140 --> 46:39.340
And the second one is completely beyond what we know.

46:39.340 --> 46:41.140
Of course, we don't know that all those mutations were

46:41.140 --> 46:41.500
random.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.700
We have no idea.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.340
But you often find scientists saying that.

46:45.340 --> 46:49.540
And then you get this big collision that people say, oh,

46:49.540 --> 46:52.460
you're eliminating God, or you're eliminating something.

46:52.460 --> 46:56.260
And I think as scientists, here physicists lecturing the

46:56.260 --> 46:59.460
biologists, how dare I?

46:59.460 --> 47:01.780
I think we should be careful what we say.

47:01.780 --> 47:02.860
We say what we know.

47:02.860 --> 47:05.420
And we don't say more than we know.

47:08.380 --> 47:09.420
I think that's a good point.

47:09.420 --> 47:11.700
I think it's very difficult sometimes.

47:11.700 --> 47:15.300
I know that just the use of language as such that you

47:15.300 --> 47:17.260
find yourself in a corner and you'll say something

47:17.260 --> 47:18.780
after what you go.

47:18.780 --> 47:21.500
No, I shouldn't have said that because I've opened myself

47:21.500 --> 47:23.740
up to other things.

47:23.740 --> 47:28.180
Yeah, it's often remarked that in physics, we had Newton,

47:28.180 --> 47:31.220
and then we had Einstein.

47:31.220 --> 47:33.660
At the state of play at the end of the 19th century, people

47:33.660 --> 47:35.460
thought physics is basically done.

47:35.460 --> 47:37.980
It's just mop up work.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.820
And then we get this radical revolution in physical

47:40.820 --> 47:41.780
understanding.

47:41.780 --> 47:44.940
And as a result, physicists are perhaps more cautious

47:44.940 --> 47:47.060
and tentative of their endorsement of even very

47:47.060 --> 47:48.500
well-confirmed theories.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.860
Biology's had its Newton in Darwin, but it hasn't yet

47:52.860 --> 47:56.540
had its Einstein that potentially that could be out,

47:56.540 --> 48:00.620
which isn't to say Darwin goes away, but it might say that

48:00.620 --> 48:03.380
there's more to the picture here than simply this very

48:03.380 --> 48:07.500
powerful explanatory mechanism that Darwin put forth.

48:07.500 --> 48:10.060
I think that's true.

48:10.060 --> 48:15.340
But this goes to the question of scientists inevitably

48:15.340 --> 48:19.060
in formulating theories, they generalize from a limited

48:19.060 --> 48:25.220
amount of data work with the theory and say, absent to some

48:25.220 --> 48:27.980
reason to think otherwise, we think this perspective

48:27.980 --> 48:29.820
generalizes.

48:29.820 --> 48:34.540
So physicists confirm particle physics, basic dynamics of

48:34.540 --> 48:37.420
how particles interact by treating relatively small

48:37.420 --> 48:38.180
scale systems.

48:38.180 --> 48:40.780
And I'm looking at you as a ocean, please correct me when I

48:40.780 --> 48:42.980
say something that's just false.

48:42.980 --> 48:44.940
But as I understand it, right?

48:44.940 --> 48:47.860
And then we assume that, well, of course, the universe

48:47.860 --> 48:51.380
involves, I don't know, 10 to the 90th power particles,

48:51.380 --> 48:55.340
perhaps, but it's essentially just the same thing writ large,

48:55.340 --> 48:58.460
just an unimaginably large number of interactions.

48:58.460 --> 49:01.980
But the same principles that we observe in these systems

49:01.980 --> 49:05.860
we've carefully isolated applies quite generally.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.220
And that goes to the question of emergence, maybe at some

49:09.220 --> 49:13.420
point of structural complexity out in the wild, outside of

49:13.420 --> 49:17.020
our carefully constructed isolated systems, things

49:17.020 --> 49:18.700
function a bit differently.

49:18.700 --> 49:22.220
And then similarly, I take that to be the point Mark was

49:22.220 --> 49:25.540
promoting with evolutionary explanations.

49:25.540 --> 49:29.580
Yes, we do know this kind of mechanism is at play in the

49:29.580 --> 49:31.020
biological realm.

49:31.020 --> 49:35.180
But whether that's fully capturing what's going on is an

49:35.180 --> 49:36.780
open question.

49:36.780 --> 49:42.540
If you observe mutations that are always random, couldn't

49:42.540 --> 49:44.100
you draw that conclusion?

49:44.100 --> 49:46.980
Who's to say they're random?

49:46.980 --> 49:51.380
Random means we don't have an explanation for why they did

49:51.380 --> 49:54.220
this and not that.

49:54.220 --> 50:00.020
Well, OK, so an explanation might come along at some point.

50:00.020 --> 50:04.820
All you can say is you can't explain why the mutations

50:04.820 --> 50:05.180
did what they did.

50:05.180 --> 50:08.220
So you are saying the concept of randomness is not valid at

50:08.220 --> 50:09.460
all.

50:09.460 --> 50:13.060
I'm saying it's a non-statement.

50:13.060 --> 50:15.020
It's not a statement.

50:15.020 --> 50:18.740
It's a statement that we don't know what happened there.

50:18.740 --> 50:21.220
It's not a statement that we do know that nothing

50:21.220 --> 50:23.940
interesting happened there.

50:23.940 --> 50:26.780
So the fact that you can predict that there will be more

50:26.780 --> 50:30.260
of those things happening in a fashion quote-unquote

50:30.260 --> 50:33.860
random is not what you're saying.

50:33.860 --> 50:37.820
Because this argument that we don't know, there's nothing

50:37.820 --> 50:43.020
that we can state where we can say for sure that we know.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.220
There's always we don't know in everything.

50:45.220 --> 50:47.620
Well, the interesting thing about an evolution thing is

50:47.620 --> 50:48.780
that you don't need to know.

50:48.780 --> 50:52.060
Random, in other words, you don't need to imprint anything

50:52.060 --> 50:53.420
on these variations.

50:53.420 --> 50:57.460
If they were random, combine them with natural selection,

50:57.460 --> 50:58.900
that would be good enough.

50:58.900 --> 51:02.780
That doesn't need to be a purpose or pattern in them.

51:02.780 --> 51:07.300
But that doesn't mean that there actually wasn't one in

51:07.300 --> 51:10.460
the mutations that happened that led to us.

51:10.460 --> 51:12.500
And of course, if you're a scientist, you say, why would

51:12.500 --> 51:16.180
you bother postulating some crazy extra thing?

51:16.180 --> 51:17.660
And yes, fine.

51:17.660 --> 51:18.300
You don't have to.

51:18.300 --> 51:19.300
That's the whole point.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.700
But you're not forbidden to.

51:20.700 --> 51:25.060
There isn't evidence to disprove it, right?

51:25.060 --> 51:26.300
Just a point of clarification.

51:26.300 --> 51:29.540
My understanding that the way evolutionary biologists use

51:29.540 --> 51:34.300
the notion of randomness in terms of genetic mutations is

51:34.300 --> 51:37.780
simply that there can be a very predictable, in fact,

51:37.780 --> 51:43.140
quantifiable rate of variation for different types of genes.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.860
Might be one in four million or whatever

51:44.860 --> 51:48.380
to do a digital gene type.

51:48.380 --> 51:50.380
So there's predictability there.

51:50.380 --> 51:56.460
And the term randomness is used to say that the change is

51:56.460 --> 52:00.420
they don't, there's no bias towards favorable change

52:00.420 --> 52:01.780
towards the organism.

52:01.780 --> 52:03.300
In that sense, it's random.

52:03.300 --> 52:06.940
I think what we know from the data is that.

52:06.940 --> 52:07.260
Yes.

52:07.260 --> 52:09.620
What we know from the data is that the mutations, I mean,

52:09.620 --> 52:11.740
their distribution of mutations, not all the mutations,

52:11.740 --> 52:12.900
are created equal.

52:12.900 --> 52:14.860
They happen in particular flavors.

52:14.860 --> 52:16.740
And this is organism-dependent.

52:16.740 --> 52:17.900
We know very well also.

52:17.900 --> 52:20.980
We know a lot of things about what is the molecular understanding,

52:20.980 --> 52:22.460
I mean, how these things happen.

52:22.460 --> 52:25.980
I mean, if there is the amination of a particular base,

52:25.980 --> 52:27.980
we know what is the chemistry that happens there.

52:27.980 --> 52:30.340
We know many of the enzymes that are down in there.

52:30.340 --> 52:31.700
And there is a huge research.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.700
I mean, in cancer, for example, one of the things

52:33.700 --> 52:34.300
that we are doing.

52:34.300 --> 52:36.500
We know that cancers are produced by random mutations.

52:36.500 --> 52:39.540
We have evolution happens all around us, in our bodies.

52:39.540 --> 52:41.420
And then we don't understand.

52:41.420 --> 52:43.260
We cannot predict exactly what is the mutation.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.340
But we understand very well what other mechanisms that

52:45.340 --> 52:46.100
happened.

52:46.100 --> 52:47.980
We understand some of the distributions.

52:47.980 --> 52:50.980
We understand many of the things that are there.

52:50.980 --> 52:52.940
And we have a lot of data.

52:52.940 --> 52:55.700
You understand by descending to the bio-physical level.

52:55.700 --> 52:56.700
Yes.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.620
It's not a part.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.580
We cannot predict what is going to be the base

52:59.580 --> 53:00.620
that is going to be mutated.

53:00.620 --> 53:04.100
But we can understand what are the mechanisms that are playing

53:04.100 --> 53:04.600
there.

53:08.940 --> 53:11.540
What do you think about the random?

53:11.540 --> 53:12.460
Randomness.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.340
I think randomness is critical.

53:14.340 --> 53:18.700
We wouldn't be sitting here if it went for randomness.

53:18.700 --> 53:19.380
It's interesting.

53:19.380 --> 53:24.500
In my field, one of the things that we come up against,

53:24.500 --> 53:29.020
I'm engaged with many people in the quest

53:29.020 --> 53:31.100
to understand whether or not there's life elsewhere

53:31.100 --> 53:32.580
in the universe.

53:32.580 --> 53:35.460
And I'm approaching it in a very practical way.

53:35.460 --> 53:38.940
We're looking for environments beyond the earth

53:38.940 --> 53:41.860
where life might exist, or life that we at least

53:41.860 --> 53:43.540
could recognize.

53:43.540 --> 53:46.540
And I think one of the interesting questions

53:46.540 --> 53:50.860
that we haven't really addressed yet is even if, let's

53:50.860 --> 53:55.700
suppose that the biochemistry that exists here on the earth

53:55.700 --> 53:58.620
and has existed for most of the last 4 billion years

53:58.620 --> 54:01.220
is indeed universal.

54:01.220 --> 54:03.820
And that actually, the evidence suggests

54:03.820 --> 54:06.620
that maybe correctly look out into the universe

54:06.620 --> 54:07.540
as astronomers.

54:07.540 --> 54:12.260
We find carbon-based molecules everywhere.

54:12.260 --> 54:14.900
It's the dominant type of chemistry in the universe.

54:14.900 --> 54:17.620
Carbon-based molecules are forming out in interstellar space

54:17.620 --> 54:19.500
over billions of years.

54:19.500 --> 54:23.260
70% of all the molecules you see floating between the stars

54:23.260 --> 54:24.740
are organic molecules.

54:24.740 --> 54:26.460
It's just the chemistry of the universe.

54:26.460 --> 54:27.340
That's the way it is.

54:27.340 --> 54:29.980
So at least very simplistically, you

54:29.980 --> 54:34.500
could perhaps connect the dot to say that there's not

54:34.500 --> 54:40.380
a coincidence that life here is based around carbon chemistry.

54:40.380 --> 54:46.580
But what are the possible outcomes?

54:46.580 --> 54:51.380
Let's suppose origin events for life, you mentioned this,

54:51.380 --> 54:54.460
we think that life got going pretty rapidly here

54:54.460 --> 54:56.940
on the earth following the final formation.

54:56.940 --> 54:58.540
The epoch of the planet.

54:58.540 --> 55:02.300
And statistically, it really doesn't tell you much

55:02.300 --> 55:04.060
because it's only one data point.

55:04.060 --> 55:07.420
So it's a little dangerous to say, oh, it started quickly here.

55:07.420 --> 55:10.820
And therefore, maybe it happens easily elsewhere.

55:10.820 --> 55:13.060
That's a very dangerous thing to say.

55:13.060 --> 55:15.420
But I'm coming to the point about random.

55:15.420 --> 55:17.780
That's one of the interesting things

55:17.780 --> 55:20.260
that I don't think any of us have really tackled yet

55:20.260 --> 55:23.420
because we don't know how to tackle it

55:23.420 --> 55:27.780
is even if the biochemistry is the same everywhere,

55:27.780 --> 55:29.820
wherever life occurs in the universe,

55:29.820 --> 55:32.380
assuming it does elsewhere, the biochemistry is

55:32.380 --> 55:34.100
basically the same.

55:34.100 --> 55:36.980
How different can the outcomes be?

55:36.980 --> 55:39.700
How random is this?

55:39.700 --> 55:42.500
I mean, OK, we're used to thinking of what life on earth,

55:42.500 --> 55:46.060
we have single-celled organisms, bacteria and archaea.

55:46.060 --> 55:47.980
That seems kind of fundamental.

55:47.980 --> 55:49.100
You have a cell structure.

55:49.100 --> 55:51.620
You have the DNA and the cell structure,

55:51.620 --> 55:52.980
et cetera, lots of things followed

55:52.980 --> 55:56.180
from that, and then at some point, complex cells like ours

55:56.180 --> 55:58.780
came along.

55:58.780 --> 56:03.900
Is it not clear to me at all that even things like bacteria

56:03.900 --> 56:06.700
are a necessary outcome of biochemistry?

56:06.700 --> 56:08.060
Maybe you could do it differently

56:08.060 --> 56:11.340
and have a completely different evolutionary history.

56:11.340 --> 56:13.980
And so in that sense, randomness, I think,

56:13.980 --> 56:17.220
comes in to this quest to look for life elsewhere in the universe

56:17.220 --> 56:21.100
because for all we know, we're staring at it,

56:21.100 --> 56:23.260
and it's the same biochemistry.

56:23.260 --> 56:26.660
It just turned out so radically differently

56:26.660 --> 56:28.660
that we're having a hard time spotting it.

56:28.660 --> 56:31.500
Now, I can qualify that statement.

56:31.500 --> 56:35.220
So in that sense, randomness plays a huge role

56:35.220 --> 56:37.620
in questions I'm interested in.

56:37.620 --> 56:40.100
It also plays, I mean, just to come to something

56:40.100 --> 56:43.780
not to do with life, just in planetary systems,

56:43.780 --> 56:47.860
what we've realized over really the, well,

56:47.860 --> 56:49.900
I guess we started seeing clues to this

56:49.900 --> 56:52.780
before we had discovered planets around other stars,

56:52.780 --> 56:53.860
which we have now done.

56:53.860 --> 56:56.020
In the last 20 years, we've discovered planets

56:56.020 --> 56:58.220
around other stars, and they are abundant.

56:58.220 --> 57:02.180
What we've also learned is that planetary systems turn out

57:02.180 --> 57:04.060
different every time.

57:04.060 --> 57:07.580
We have this sort of imprint in our heads

57:07.580 --> 57:10.620
that the solar system was the prototype,

57:10.620 --> 57:14.060
the template for how planetary systems should appear.

57:14.060 --> 57:16.460
You have the little rocky planets close to the star.

57:16.460 --> 57:17.940
You have your gas giant planets.

57:17.940 --> 57:19.220
You have other things out there,

57:19.220 --> 57:21.540
and it all sort of made sense.

57:21.540 --> 57:22.980
And we've had to sort of tear that up

57:22.980 --> 57:26.820
and throw that out the window, because it isn't true.

57:26.820 --> 57:30.820
Planetary systems are inherently non-linear,

57:30.820 --> 57:36.460
and the outcome of the formation processes of planets

57:36.460 --> 57:39.180
will spit out different stuff every single time,

57:39.180 --> 57:41.340
incredibly diverse.

57:41.340 --> 57:45.740
And that's something that is an enormous challenge for us.

57:45.740 --> 57:47.660
And essentially, it's randomness.

57:47.660 --> 57:51.820
The core is randomness, non-linearity, complexity.

57:51.820 --> 57:55.180
And I think, for me, one of the things that weighs on me

57:55.180 --> 58:00.300
or that I have no good answer is we still think that way

58:00.300 --> 58:02.500
when we're looking for life elsewhere.

58:02.500 --> 58:05.900
We're still strongly imprinted with the notion, well, yes,

58:05.900 --> 58:07.620
we know the details will be different.

58:07.620 --> 58:10.900
Maybe it's a planet of chickens, or maybe it's

58:10.900 --> 58:13.980
it's a planet of octopus or something.

58:13.980 --> 58:17.180
But the truth is, we don't even know that.

58:17.180 --> 58:18.620
It could be extraordinary.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.060
Maybe.

58:19.060 --> 58:19.460
I don't know.

58:19.460 --> 58:20.420
Maybe you have.

58:20.420 --> 58:22.740
I would be interested if anyone has an opinion

58:22.740 --> 58:28.140
that somehow biochemistry and life

58:28.140 --> 58:31.820
is going to sort of converge on similar forms

58:31.820 --> 58:34.020
and similar mechanisms that we have here on Earth.

58:34.020 --> 58:38.580
Well, this matter is debated, yes, in theoretical biology.

58:38.580 --> 58:42.580
So Stephen J. Gould, a famous popular science writer,

58:42.580 --> 58:46.060
famously said, if you're rewound the tape of evolution

58:46.060 --> 58:49.940
and let it play out again, under slightly divergent

58:49.940 --> 58:53.020
initial circumstances, you'd get something completely different.

58:53.020 --> 58:55.580
And I think I think he was thinking it was so completely

58:55.580 --> 58:56.460
different.

58:56.460 --> 58:56.980
OK.

58:56.980 --> 58:59.980
But he tended to push this line.

58:59.980 --> 59:03.820
But then you have Simon Conway Morris, who's famously,

59:03.820 --> 59:07.060
I think he's off at Cambridge or Oxford, wanting to say,

59:07.060 --> 59:09.580
no, actually, we have a lot of evidence for convergence

59:09.580 --> 59:13.220
in evolution that certain types of solutions

59:13.220 --> 59:17.020
to certain kinds of problems for organism types, like the mammalian

59:17.020 --> 59:21.900
eye, I think, it's believed has evolved five times in the camera eye.

59:21.900 --> 59:24.740
The camera eye, the form of it.

59:24.740 --> 59:29.100
It's a neat solution to a certain kind of so-to-speak problem

59:29.100 --> 59:30.460
from an evolutionary point of view.

59:30.460 --> 59:32.380
Once you have organisms of a certain kind,

59:32.380 --> 59:34.060
that they're going to move in that.

59:34.060 --> 59:36.540
So there's a kind of landscape, a biased landscape,

59:36.540 --> 59:39.540
if you like, of biological organisms

59:39.540 --> 59:42.420
they're going to inevitably move in a certain direction.

59:42.420 --> 59:47.460
So I think one proof that randomness is important in biology

59:47.460 --> 59:50.020
is that you can prepare the experiment.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.460
In the same conditions, the other thing

59:51.460 --> 59:54.220
is that natural selection works in different conditions

59:54.220 --> 59:56.540
and then these things change.

59:56.540 --> 59:58.300
But if you prepare exactly the same conditions

59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300
and you take copies of an organism that is identical

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.380
and you put it in different plates,

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.700
and then you move it forward, you can

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.500
see that the mutations at the accumulate at the end,

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:09.420
they are different.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.700
And then you give, I don't know, you give an experiment,

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.740
you give some type of aiotic or something like that.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.220
Some of these survive, some of they don't.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.980
So starting from identical initial conditions

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.460
and the outcome is different.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.140
So this is done in the lab.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.700
And then in that case, I think biology is random,

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.740
I mean, in this sense.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.300
I mean, at least we cannot predict a priori

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.380
given the initial conditions who is going to be

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.460
resistant to the mitabiotic and who is not

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.460
of this bacterium that they're identical from the beginning.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.260
So this is pushing back against the small global picture

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.860
that someone like my Morris has in mind.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.780
As I understand it, so you're saying, look,

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.900
we can, in a small scale trajectory of evolution,

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.260
we can see it happening starting from slightly different

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.740
initial conditions, things going in very different directions.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.460
What I'm doing is looking at evolution in real time.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.500
So we work with viruses, for example.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.580
I mean, viruses, they evolve every application,

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.180
they have a mutation, cancers.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.500
This is evolution that's happening in real time.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.020
And there are processes that accumulate mutations

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:11.940
and all these things.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.340
And one of the things that is very clear,

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.900
I mean, especially in the last five years,

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.980
that now we're sequencing tons of cancers,

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:21.100
is that every patient that comes with the same type of cancer,

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.540
let's say a glioblastoma, for example,

01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.980
they take different patients.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.260
The amount of mutations, I mean, the mutations that happen,

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.580
they are different, each patient is a different constellation

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.660
of mutations.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.180
So, and they start basically from similar conditions.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:34.820
We don't know exactly what are the conditions,

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.660
but they have different paths.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.780
I mean, some of the key players, some of the genes,

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.300
they are the same, but most of them, they don't.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.700
So, and then the game.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.220
What is the understanding, just randomness?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.620
So understanding that each individual has a different...

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:54.060
The observation is that they are different.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:59.020
And then cellophorrhaging, and the idea

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:00.300
is that there is a random process.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.740
There are several biological processes

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.140
that can create mutations with different flavors.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.100
And then these mutations happen random.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.540
So probably if we take, we have like 10 to the 14 cells

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:13.140
in our body, each of the cells, they have different mutations.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.980
Most of the mutations don't do anything.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.060
But some of the mutations, they contribute to the growth

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.180
of the cell.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.620
And then when you accumulate the right or the wrong combination

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:24.140
of mutations is when the whole clonal expansion happens.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.060
And then when we sequence the tumor at the end,

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:28.140
what we have is a picture of what are the mutations

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.500
that are accumulated in the history of this particular clone.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.740
And they are different.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.500
I mean, these in cancers we know that it's there.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.460
So in terms of complexity and the emergence idea,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:45.060
so if you look at cancers as the end product,

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:50.660
as the complex outcome of what was happening,

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:59.140
then the final outcome is determined by events

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:03.700
that are all by mutations that are very different.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.660
But the outcome is the same.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.300
The outcome, I mean, one of the things

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.900
I have to be cautious with that, I mean,

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.780
one of the several mutations, they

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.140
are exactly the same in different patients.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.180
And this is why, I mean, we are looking what is called,

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:21.660
I mean, in cancer genomics jargon.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.780
This is this idea that if they are, for example,

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:27.340
in glioblastoma, they are around 50 mutations

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.700
in a particular patient, that they are protein changing

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:30.660
from that.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.340
Most of them, they are passengers.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.140
So they are mutations that they don't do anything.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.100
They happen by random.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.980
I mean, they are in the background.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.140
So they don't contribute to the particular phenotype

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.500
to this growth.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.300
And some of those, they are going to be drivers.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:48.100
So the whole regal of the field is

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.420
trying to find of these 50, which are the ones that

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.660
are really important for the tumor.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.620
The classical experiment or the classical method

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.460
is recurrence.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.540
So if you see that, because you do the experiment,

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.100
you have many different people, each of those

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.380
with a different cancer.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.060
And you see that there is a mutation in a gene,

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:04.940
let's say, P53.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.620
And another patient, they have mutation in the same gene.

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.140
The probability that this is happened by random

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.540
into the independent individuals is very low.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.460
And then you assess that this particular gene

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.780
could be important for cancer.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.620
And then there are a lot of experimental follow-up,

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.660
trying to understand what are the molecular mechanisms

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.420
of how this particular alteration in that particular gene

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.900
could contribute to the cancer.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:32.380
So that's a very standard method.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:36.500
So could I ask perhaps the appearance of the driver,

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.820
type mutations thought that these two are just random.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:44.720
And they just, once they're, they

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.460
tend to determine a phenotypic process,

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.140
a process observable of that.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.620
So this is something about they keep showing up.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:56.220
So without going into the debate of all of our state.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.700
Is there something down random about that

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.380
in biological terms?

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.660
I mean, it depends on how you define random.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.620
So there are several, for example.

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.140
I mean, if you go to the sun, then you

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.260
get some radiation.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.980
And radiation, we know what is causing damage in some DNA.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.540
And there are several chemical processes,

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.580
or smoking, or something.

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.500
I mean, these are things that are kind of processes

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.780
that in this background, they increment

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.820
the rate of certain type of mutations.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.580
And these things contribute to those environmental factors.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.580
By us.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.580
By mutation.

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.580
So you have a distribution.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.500
So you have the model that we work.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.220
Is that we have a probability of changing their four bases.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.540
And then, so you have, each of the four bases

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.980
can change to the other three.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.060
So you can have a matrix of different possibilities.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.100
So there's a distribution.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.020
And this distribution is conditional on the environment

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.180
that you have, and the molecular mechanisms that

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:45.860
are beyond that.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.420
So you can see, for example, just counting the mutations that

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:48.920
happened.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.740
There are some of those that happened more frequently

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.860
than other ones.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.460
And then, one of the things that is very interesting

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.820
is understanding, for example, if there

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.580
are patients that they have different mutation

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.980
patterns that other patients that can give you a clue

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.540
of what are the molecular mechanisms that

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.740
are acting at that particular set of patients.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:09.460
So there are many questions there.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:10.820
But the questions are very precise.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.500
I mean, in the sense that you can measure things,

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.820
and then you have tons of data, and then you

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.460
can fit distributions.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.580
And random means sampling from a particular distribution.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.580
So it's not a fit uniform.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.340
As a cosmologist listening to you,

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:29.300
I feel sort of jealous that you have so many systems

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.140
that you can study.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:33.060
Because in cosmology, we have our one universe.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.340
And I was thinking about this dependence

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.060
on initial conditions.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.940
And this is such an essential point

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.180
when we think about the emergence of complexity

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:45.620
in the universe, which is that if the values of the fundamental

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.300
constants were slightly different,

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.540
we would have a very different universe.

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.220
And of course, the wonderful thing

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.500
about doing this kind of research today

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:57.380
is that we can study sort of imaginary universes

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.780
via computational analyses.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.820
And we can see that if we were to change

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:06.460
the charge of the electron by a small fraction,

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:08.620
the universe would look completely different.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.660
But how wonderful it would be to have all of these little

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.500
universes and a multiverse to study and see, well,

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:17.500
what fundamentally do we need to get this kind of emergent

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.740
phenomena in our universe is the way that you can study

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.580
the initial conditions in the DNA and the environment

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.700
that create this kind of the beginning of a cancer

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.540
tumor, for example.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.420
Yeah, I think one of the things that is interesting

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.220
in biological systems, especially the ones that are

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.660
evolving very fast.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.260
I mean, if you talk about human evolution,

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.340
or it's much harder, but something

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.740
that you can do in the lab is you can create a system,

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:44.140
change conditions, and then try to see

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.060
how the distributions, I mean, randomness

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.100
can be quantified in a particular system.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.540
I mean, there's some distributions.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.260
And how these distributions shift when

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.180
you change the parameters here.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.380
And that's something that is very cool.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.380
So I can see what you shifted from physics to biology.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.100
But in the early universe, you have lots of spectrums

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.740
of fluctuation.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.240
Right.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.380
It's just that they all seem to give rise

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.180
to similar looking galaxies.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:09.020
Is that a fair statement?

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.060
The primordial fluctuations.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:11.460
Yeah.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.740
The post-inflation.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740
Sure.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.180
That they're different as different as different mutations.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.620
And yet.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.740
I don't know if I would say that those fluctuations

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.860
are as different as the sorts of things

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.940
that we talk about in biology.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:29.780
I think what we're talking about in the early universe

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:33.500
are fluctuating the original quantum field.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.460
These conditions then just give rise

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.900
to these slight density perturbations.

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:39.540
And then those density perturbations

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:42.820
evolve with the expanding cooling universe

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:46.020
to produce gravitational wells that

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.500
tend to then produce galaxies.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:53.180
So I don't know if they're as different statistically

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.060
as that system.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.380
But I don't know.

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.060
It could be convinced otherwise.

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:01.500
Well, so he's got four rungs in his ladder.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.460
And he can put them in different orders.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.420
And you've got this random field that

01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.620
can have a different value at each point in space

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.900
across light years.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.020
It seems so bad.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:15.980
It's just interesting that you get very similar looking

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.580
galaxies coming out of it.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.860
Is that right, though?

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.060
All galaxies kind of brothers?

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:25.740
I mean, galaxies are quite similar in a sense.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.820
I mean, they're different or slightly different

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:29.980
evolutionary histories.

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:34.020
But they are similar, certainly, in their properties.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:36.460
I'm just thinking back to these primordial density

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:42.100
fluctuations, because what we find, of course, is that the early

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.180
universe is incredibly homogeneous and isotropic.

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.340
I mean, it's an incredibly homogeneous system.

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.340
And then we have these.

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.980
If we look at it from the point of view of temperature,

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:57.180
temperature fluctuations on the order of one part in 100,000,

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.580
those are the level of the fluctuations.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.060
And those little fluctuations are enough

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:06.300
to give rise to this very interesting looking

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.340
and beautiful looking universe.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.260
So I don't know if we can compare those with the base pairs,

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.980
those tiny little temperature fluctuations.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:19.380
But on the very large scale, the universe continues

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.620
to look homogeneous and isotropic on the scale

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.860
sort of beyond galaxies.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.020
Superclusters, I suppose.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:33.860
So it continues just not sure if it's so different

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.500
on the small scale.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:39.660
So could we affect the evolution of the universe?

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.380
I mean, that would be the ultimate closure, right,

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:44.540
where you have complicated things get rise to life.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.740
And then life goes back and changes the whole.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.540
So in practice, you mean not only?

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:51.820
Well, let's dream.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.540
But the evolution of the whole universe

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.300
or some part of it.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:55.780
Sure.

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.180
Could we create a baby universe?

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.980
I think we're going to have to start

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:05.340
to define universe carefully if we're going to ask that question.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.820
Choose whatever definition makes it interesting.

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:09.660
But there is something that I mean,

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.940
in further down the timeline from the sort of cosmology

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:17.300
that you focus on, sort of cosmology I used to do

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:21.460
before I got into the planets was, yeah, there's this.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:25.420
There's a certain volume of the present day universe

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:30.740
that you tend to say, well, that's kind of a fair sample.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.540
And I've forgotten the typical side.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:37.220
Maybe it's 20 million light years across or something.

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:39.460
It'll contain enough galaxies that you

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.020
have a cross-section of everything.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:47.060
And that's like your Petri dish, right?

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.660
I'm saying, OK, I've got that experiment.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.300
And I've got another experiment over there

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.940
that is essentially, there can be other than radiation

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.500
passing between these two places.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.620
There's no other causal relationships.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.940
It's like having multiple experiments.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.820
But it's for things like galaxies.

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.020
I think when you're talking about taking,

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.900
yes, the properties of the early universe,

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.020
I mean, you only have that one experiment, right?

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.380
It's infinitely large.

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.460
But you don't see all of it.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:15.740
Well, we only see to the edge from which light

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:16.860
is at time to reach it.

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.060
Yeah, we see what is it?

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.660
10 billion, 100 billion galaxies.

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:20.620
How many do we see?

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.260
No, about 300 billion.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.060
No, people say sorry.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.860
It's sort of fascinating to me that they're all sort of looking

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.620
like the uniformity is sort of weird.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.420
But the uniformity on that large scale

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:37.060
reflects the uniformity of the early universe.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:42.620
So it's because we had this very uniform universe

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:45.500
in the early days that the universe looks so uniform

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.780
on the large scale today.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.220
But then, of course, from the perspective

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.340
of the topic of this conversation,

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.580
once you look at a smaller scale, so smaller than 100 megapar

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.620
sex or whatever it is that we're looking at,

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:59.420
that we get these much more interesting, complex

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.260
sorts of structures.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.340
I'll go back to another experiment that happens also.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.620
There is the actual planets, for example.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.380
There you have different clouds forming stars,

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:08.380
and then you have planets.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.500
And then, I mean, now we start looking at distribution.

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.380
So each of those is a different experiment.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:14.300
And they are now, I don't know how many, they are like,

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.740
5,000 or something like that?

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:17.420
A little over 4,000.

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.500
So then you have 4,000 experiments

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.660
of similar things creating planets.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:22.820
And then you have distribution.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.980
I mean, you can do statistics.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:25.740
I mean, distribution of planets, what

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.580
is the largest, the distances, and the alticities,

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.300
and all these things.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.900
I mean, you can do a lot of things there.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:32.420
So I think in this aspect, I mean,

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.940
it's becoming a very different experiment.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.420
I mean, you cannot produce them, but you cannot observe them.

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:39.220
No, absolutely.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:41.140
I mean, it's funny when I started out

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.740
as an astronomer, some people said,

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.300
we are such an impoverished science.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.620
You can only look at stuff.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.100
You can never do the experiments.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:51.460
But it's extraordinary what you can do by just looking

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.220
and observing.

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:56.180
And the universe, OK, maybe the one universe,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.460
that's one experiment, but then the subdivisions

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.580
of the universe are multiple experiments

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.300
on the different phenomena that emerge in our universe.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.100
And it's extraordinary what happens.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.260
Actually, this may piss you off because it's sort of one

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.620
of these top-down type things.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.900
But something we've learned to do with galaxies, for example,

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:24.180
that I think nobody predicted and really

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:26.580
comes from quite fundamental physics is the fact

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.860
that the form and nature of galaxies.

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.580
So galaxies are a great agglomeration of stars.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.660
The Milky Way has maybe 200 billion stars in it also.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.340
And there are all these other billions of galaxies,

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.580
and they're all sort of morphologically different.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.860
And there are different histories.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:46.620
And when and where exactly the stars were made in those galaxies.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.420
Some of that we now understand is

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:54.220
driven by the behavior of supermassive black holes

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.020
that form perhaps contemporaneously

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.140
with these galaxies way back 13 billion years ago.

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:01.740
And they're huge things.

01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:03.900
Some of them are a billion times a million.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.540
And as matter falls into them, it generates energy

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.300
that pours back out across the galaxy

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.300
and influences subsequent generations of stars.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.380
And so it profoundly impacts the characteristics of the stars,

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:20.420
the planets, everything.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.220
But who would have thought?

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.660
This is coming from black holes.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.660
And it's the particular properties of black holes

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:29.940
that give rise to that kind of interesting feedback.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.700
I mean, I find that kind of extraordinary.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.380
Because presumably you could have universes where

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.820
you can't make black holes.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.100
Is that possible?

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.420
I guess anything is possible.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.820
I think anything is possible depending on your physical law.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.500
If we have a law of gravitation the way

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.420
that we have in this universe, then we could get black holes.

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:51.180
But to go off your comment about black holes,

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.460
even more fundamentally than that, the fact

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.500
that actually the evolution of the universe

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.900
seems to be affected so profoundly

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.300
by the presence of dark matter and dark energy, which

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.940
are these really mysterious substances

01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:07.060
that we've only learned about in the last, I mean,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:10.020
less than 100 years, even for dark matter.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.180
And yeah, so it seems like such a,

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:17.180
and we know, of course, that dark matter gravitationally

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.460
influences the formation histories of galaxies

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:24.140
and dark energy really on the larger scale

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.380
of the universe affecting whether or not a galaxy cluster

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:29.820
can actually come together without being sort of pushed

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:32.460
apart by the expansion of space.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:39.180
So there's so many factors, so much physics going into

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.780
this seemingly simple process of galaxy formation even.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.660
Of course, the stuff we're made of is just 4% of everything.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.500
Start matter, dark energy, the total mass energy content

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.980
of the universe, most of it isn't like us.

01:16:55.980 --> 01:16:56.860
That's right.

01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:02.100
With this tiny little sprinkling of normal matter

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.980
and the periodic matter that's doing all this interesting stuff.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:06.900
But it's interesting.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:08.900
I mean, I don't know if you'd agree with this,

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:12.620
but perhaps we're too ignorant of what dark matter really is

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.980
and what it's actually, we can't see it directly.

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.380
We can only see it through its gravitational influence.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.180
But the interesting thing is it's

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.180
that tiny sprinkling, that 4%, that

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.340
seems to have all this complexity.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.860
And I guess that's just the nature of it.

01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:29.980
That's just how it is.

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:33.980
Well, it's possible, of course, that it's quite interesting

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.500
these days because we know that dark matter is out there

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:41.420
based on its gravitational influence on the visible matter.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:45.180
And we've never been able to detect it in either a space,

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:47.900
space, or earth-based observatory.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:52.300
So when we create theories of what dark matter could be,

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.100
we inevitably begin with the simplest possible situation.

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:59.260
So my PhD thesis, for example, I postulated

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.180
a Maverick dark matter where there was only one,

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:03.580
all of the dark matter.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.460
So 95% of the matter in the universe,

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:12.180
or that's not right, 80% of the matter and 20%

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.020
of the matter and energy content was composed

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:16.500
of one single particle.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.420
But of course, that's just a hypothesis.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.820
Given the complexity of the.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.300
You have one type of particle.

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.780
One type of particle, yeah, not one particle.

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:28.220
That would be quite strange.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.980
I think it would be a thesis.

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:33.420
It would be quite strange.

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:39.260
And given the complexity of the visible segment

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:42.060
of our universe, I think it would,

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:47.380
it's naive to assume that the dark section of the universe

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.020
is simpler than that.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.420
So yes, we just don't know.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:55.460
It could be composed of a very complex spectrum of particles

01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:57.900
and interactions that we just can't probe.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:00.140
So that's a whole other level of complexity

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:02.380
that may never be accessible to us.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.700
And we hope, of course, that it is in our present day

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.580
experiments, especially at the LHC.

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:15.780
I introduce consciousness as one place where science and philosophy

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.380
sort of butt up against the chamber.

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:23.340
Yes, well, and but now sort of your bailiwick

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:27.180
is seems like contemporary cosmology is another.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:33.100
So you mentioned the way the universe seems to be,

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:36.900
the fact that we can do computer simulations of assuming

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.780
slight variations in the initial conditions

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.740
or slight variations in the properties of fundamental

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:45.860
particles, and then see how would things play out

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:49.020
at a kind of macroscopic level.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:54.620
And apparently physicists say that an vanishingly small

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:58.020
percentage of these possible variations

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.700
is anything suitable for the development of life,

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.220
so-called fine-tuning.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.820
So our universe seems exquisitely fine-tuned

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.420
for the eventual emergence of life.

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.300
What sort of you as a theorist, as a physical theorist,

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:17.100
to what extent do you feel driven to look for explanations?

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:20.300
So we get theoretical cosmologists speculating

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.620
about multiverse.

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.900
Maybe our universe just has what it has what it takes

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.580
for there to be life.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.540
The reason that we see such a thing,

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:32.140
this is such an extraordinary thing,

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:36.780
is that there have been untold billions of such universes

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:41.980
emerging or being given rise to by some premordial condition,

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.780
most of which, almost all of which, have no life.

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:46.980
And of course, we happen to notice it

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.420
because we can only notice the universe that

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.100
is capable of sustaining life.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:57.220
So to kind of try to explain away the surprising and seemingly

01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.940
rigged character of the universe by postulating our universe

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:04.580
as one of just a huge number of universes.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.300
Are you inclined towards that sort of thinking?

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:13.300
And what's the state of play these days among physicists?

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.940
From a historical point of view, you

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:22.700
kind of want to take a Copernican principle to the extreme

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.980
or something that first we discovered

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.300
that the Earth was not the center of the solar system.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:32.420
And then the solar system was not the only system.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.900
And then our galaxy was not very special.

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.060
And our galaxy cluster is not very special.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.420
If we take that to the extreme, then certainly

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:43.460
it would seem like a reasonable proposition

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:49.540
that our universe is not the only universe.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.580
From an experimental point of view,

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:56.060
it's complicated because if there are other universes,

01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:59.380
and again, coming back to the precise definition

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:04.340
of a universe, if a universe is everything

01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.700
that we can possibly probe, then another universe,

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.420
by definition, cannot be studied.

01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:16.060
So from a scientific point of view that becomes complicated,

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.860
that hasn't prevented everybody from not.

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.140
Investigateing it, I think it's a very reasonable thing

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:26.500
to study is are there theoretical physics models that

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:32.300
would give rise to multiple universes?

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.660
And people are doing it.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.980
And it's particularly interesting, of course,

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.940
in the realm of string theory.

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:41.580
Me personally, it just seems so, it's a little bit like even

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.820
string theory within our universe,

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.220
that if it's, and maybe you can speak to this,

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:50.900
having been in that realm, if it's

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.020
inaccessible experimentally, even within our universe,

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:59.420
then for sure people should continue to study it.

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:03.060
But is it science?

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:06.980
If it's not a falsifiable theory, so maybe

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:08.860
it will become such a thing.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.180
But it's not there yet.

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.340
And with a multiverse, it gets even more complicated,

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.860
because we go outside of this universe.

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:15.460
So I don't know.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:18.700
Somebody who's been in string theory, maybe Roel can.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.020
Yeah.

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.940
So when I was in the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:23.420
I was working.

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:26.820
And there is a very strong group in string theory.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.700
And then there was also the debate,

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.620
when there was all these landscapes, ideas, and all

01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.540
these things.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.380
And I have friends in the two fields.

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:36.460
So I have my personal opinion that I'm

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:39.740
not going to reveal.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.420
But I think it's a very interesting debate.

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.940
So I think that debates would be there.

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.860
Can I reveal my personal opinion?

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.580
Since you're being coy.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.340
I think this multiverse explanation is extremely dangerous.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.700
I think it's a cop out.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.300
So there have been things in the past that were mysterious.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.900
Like at one point, all the electrons in the universe

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.740
have the same mass and the same charge.

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.380
My god, what an amazing coincidence.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.860
Who rigged that?

01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.900
Maybe there's a billion universes.

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.460
We just happen to be in the one where they all

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.380
happen to come out the same.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.380
Well, if you think that, that stops you

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.940
from discovering what we now think

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:16.540
is the real explanation, which is that there

01:24:16.540 --> 01:24:19.020
is one electron field everywhere.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.780
And these different particles are just

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:24.620
sort of excitations of that one field.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.260
So a coincidence like that is a call

01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.660
to do good science to explain it.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:32.100
And things like, oh, well, maybe it just randomly came out

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.900
because I postulated a billion, sorry, 10 to the 500,

01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.860
unobservable things.

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:41.060
And we happen to be in the one which is the way that we see.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:46.140
It just seems to me, you might as well say, I think Zeus did it.

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.140
Yeah.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.500
No, he's just.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:49.260
Yeah.

01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.540
I mean, this is exactly where the debate was at this time.

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:55.340
And one of my closest friends, this person

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.140
that is working in these things.

01:24:58.140 --> 01:25:01.660
But I think the difference is that, I mean,

01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.140
it's not a crazy speculation.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.420
I think there's an underlying theory,

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.420
like a string theory, more than a theory.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.140
It's a framework of thinking.

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.940
And then there you can do calculations.

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:10.900
You can do distributions.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.260
You can do things that are more quantitative.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.060
If you could get evidence for this,

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.620
and you weren't just postulating all those multiple copies,

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:25.820
simply in order to get out of our copy, that's a problem.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.260
But if in our universe you can find,

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.460
you were saying it's very difficult to observe, right?

01:25:29.460 --> 01:25:31.580
If, nonetheless, you can find some sort of evidence

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.260
that all these other things exist,

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:36.500
independent of needing them to explain this.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.740
That's fine, of course.

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:40.460
And maybe I can just add one.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.380
This is a slightly more mundane point.

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.820
But you talk about the apparent fine-tuning

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.060
of the universe for life.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.700
And I think often that gets a little blurry,

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.620
because the truth is the details of it

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:58.180
are that you could actually tweak the fundamental properties

01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.460
of the cosmos.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.980
Fair amount, and in principle, still

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:06.860
have the sequence of events that led to life here on Earth.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.380
So for example, you can tweak properties a little bit

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:14.900
and still get stars that produce carbon in some quantity.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.180
So it's just something about this notion.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:22.340
Oh, it's perfectly tuned for life.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.580
It's not actually true.

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:26.740
I mean, it is tuned in such a, oh,

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.740
there is a coincidence of fundamental properties

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:34.020
such that in at least one place it was possible for life

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.900
to emerge, that is different than saying

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.660
universe is somehow perfectly, perfectly tuned.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:44.500
You can go and you can play with cross-section of interaction

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.580
for nuclear processes in stars.

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:49.940
Fair amount, and still make carbon and still have stars

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.860
that basically look like the stars that we see in our universe.

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.180
So in a sense, for me, the more interesting question

01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:00.260
and this I'm totally biased is what

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.860
is it that determines the total amount of life

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.700
in the universe, not just the fact

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.100
that there is one instance of life.

01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:11.060
There must be something, at least within our observable universe,

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:15.740
which is a finite thing, that determines how often and how

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:20.420
much life, how many living organisms or things

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:22.220
are there in the entire observable universe.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.700
That's a fixed number, any given cosmic time.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.140
That, to me, is the boy.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.580
Anyway, sorry, that's going off on a slight tangent.

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.180
I mean, just as I understand it, we're

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:37.540
talking about different sorts of independent factors that

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:41.340
are relatively fundamental, at least in the current physical

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.100
framework.

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.100
And some of them have more play, right?

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.380
You could still get life with some.

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.540
And then others are exquisitely fine tuned.

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.900
So there's variation.

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:52.860
And the estimates vary.

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:54.300
There's a little bit of controversy

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.620
about how independent some of these are of others.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.220
So two to three dozen, perhaps as many of independent fine

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.060
tuned factors.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.060
And some of them, I'm told, are exquisitely fine tuned.

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:08.220
You really can't play with it very much at all.

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.500
A number of like the engines.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.300
Yeah.

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:11.300
Yeah, that's one.

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:11.800
Right.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.100
Is there the cosmological concept?

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:13.940
Are you having a company too?

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.940
Yeah, it does watch.

01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.300
And the concept is another fine tuning problem.

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.940
But the whole fine tuning thing is absurd.

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.140
Who is to say, the knobs, we think

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.660
that the labeling we have on the knobs

01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.540
when we write the physics textbook is somehow

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:29.740
the label that God uses to decide, well, what mass

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.900
electron I get given, what cosmological.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.020
The whole point of science is to understand things

01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:37.060
and explain things.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:39.180
And so firstly, if you think there's a miracle,

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.260
you should be coming up with a real explanation for it.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:45.860
And secondly, maybe the laws of physics

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.380
just are what they are.

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.300
And that's a great achievement, right?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.820
To be able to explain all sorts of things

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:55.620
from snowflakes to whatever on the basis

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.420
of a fairly simple set of laws with 19 arbitrary constants.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:01.020
Well, I think good.

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.580
Well, it may not be a question.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.820
If that turns out to be the state of the fundamental theory,

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:07.580
right, we can't simplify.

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.420
Actually, that gets to an interesting question

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.940
that we ought to talk about.

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:12.460
Maybe there is no fundamental theory.

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:14.100
Maybe it's always emerging from something,

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.620
your elephants all the way down, right?

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:17.620
Turtle.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:17.620
Turtle.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.620
Turtle.

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:21.340
Different religion.

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:22.340
So that's all the way down.

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.540
It's about passing all the way down.

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:24.540
So call it.

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:27.540
If the properties of my body, the causal capacities

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:30.860
I have biologically are derived, in some sense,

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.900
from the interaction of my cells and their arrangement

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:38.740
and so forth, they're not fundamental physical force

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:40.620
properties that I have.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.740
But if it's derived, can you can causality

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:47.460
be forever passed on and nothing ever has it intrinsically?

01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:51.660
Has any kind of inherent capacity to do things?

01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:53.380
Can you forever borrow?

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:56.580
It sounds like it's analogous to borrowing money.

01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.100
Somebody's got to have money originally,

01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:01.980
because it can't be infinitely borrowed.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:02.500
Yeah.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.500
One of the things that is, I think,

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.900
what is different in physics is that.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.620
So now I don't have the microphone.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.100
So one of the things, I think, in fundamental physics

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:13.820
that is different is that what the 20th century has been

01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.820
is basically unifying, finding frameworks.

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.060
I mean, you have a way of computing things.

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.900
I mean, you have field theories.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.900
You have ways of understanding of how to do calculations.

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:27.300
You have a few fundamental blocks.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.060
And the fundamental blocks, they have been reduced

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.700
to something that is a very small number.

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.820
I mean, it's good.

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:34.340
And the number of constants, I mean,

01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:36.220
I can say they are 20 something or something.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.780
It's kind of not very large.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.900
But it has been this trend.

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.420
And I think this dream of many physicists, especially,

01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:45.780
I mean, from the 50s to the 70s, and these things,

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.580
it was this idea that you can, every,

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:50.660
this tendency would be to finding a unifying theory,

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:54.260
that it would be the only one that can explain everything.

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:55.060
I mean, it can be that.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.060
I mean, there is another fundamental theory

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.820
that instead of in four forces, I mean, you have like 25.

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:03.340
And then you go back to something that is more complex.

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.020
So, but this has been this tendency.

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.460
And I think this has been the dream of finding something

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:08.820
that is unifying.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.340
And it was an expectation.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.620
And I don't know, I mean, how is it going?

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:18.140
And an interesting thing that happens there in our quest

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:24.260
for, shall we say, one of these interesting properties

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:28.580
of the universe is that physics manifests very differently

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:30.620
at different energy scales.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:35.420
So as we've been seeking unifying laws,

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.940
physics has also changed.

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:39.580
So we started in this classical universe

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:42.580
and entered the realm of special relativity

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.620
and quantum field theory.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:46.500
And then we look at what happens with the four

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.660
fundamental interactions as we increase in energy.

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.220
And they begin to unify.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:54.580
And they become different, more unified interactions.

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.300
But it's so interesting that the physics changes fundamentally

01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.700
with energy scale.

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:01.580
So that, I think, also is related to this notion

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.340
of complexity and emergence.

01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:06.140
But actually something, I don't know

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.580
if I can use the word unexpected,

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:10.220
but something new happens at certain energies.

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:13.220
Actually, different physics emerges.

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:16.500
Yeah, so I wanted to go back to the notion of randomness,

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.860
because I think we can be a little bit more

01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.900
quantitative in these things.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:22.260
I think, for example, in the experiment

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.940
that was describing of the cancers of the bacteria

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.420
in getting antibiotic resistance or something,

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.100
I mean, you prepare identically the same thing.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.020
And at the end, you cannot predict

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:35.260
which of these 20 experiments that you, identically prepare,

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.460
is going to be the one that is going

01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:39.300
to give antibiotic resistance in this particular thing

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.260
or the person who is going to get the cancer or the cell

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:42.820
that is going to get the cancer.

01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:44.820
But you can get things about distributions.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.020
And then on understanding what are the basic mechanisms

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.660
that happen there, that's very useful.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:54.780
I mean, you can get what are the mutational factors

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.060
that contribute to that.

01:32:57.060 --> 01:32:59.180
What are the mutations happened?

01:32:59.180 --> 01:32:59.940
What are the genes?

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:02.060
How are these mutations in these genes

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.780
confer resistance to the antibiotic?

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.300
So you learn many things about what

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.300
is the underlying thing that happens.

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.900
And they are distributions, and you learn things

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.700
about distributions.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:14.460
That is very useful because you learn many, many different things.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.300
In the planets, for example, in the exoplanets,

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.780
now that we are observing many, is basically

01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:19.940
similar thing of the galaxies.

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.780
I mean, you start with similar conditions,

01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:23.180
and then you can try to see starting

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.300
from the similar condition.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.980
You have the same experiment.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:27.740
Even if you cannot predict exactly what

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.220
is the exact position of the planets,

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:32.500
if you can get to kind of a distribution of laws,

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.860
the probability of finding something

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:35.900
with the mass of the Jupiter in one

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.700
astronomical unit is this one, something

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.180
about probabilities and how these things happened.

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:40.820
So that's it.

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:42.180
This is a very powerful tool.

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.820
I mean, even if we don't know exactly the deterministic answer

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:47.540
to something, I think to predict distributions

01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.900
is very, very useful.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.900
And even if this is an emerging, I mean,

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:55.020
if the distribution per se is an emerging phenomenon,

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:58.980
that you cannot compute exactly from the initial conditions,

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:03.460
I think this is very useful, and it's used a lot.

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:07.500
OK, before we go to questions, I should tell you

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.660
that we are having a round table on consciousness in March.

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:36.180
Questions?

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:39.660
Great presentation on astrophysical astrobiology.

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:41.540
I'd like to get back to emergence,

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:45.340
and I was hoping that each of the panels could describe

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.180
in a thumbnail their definition of emergent consciousness.

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:52.740
And then if you could really reassure me

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:58.340
how machine emergent consciousness will not

01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:00.260
be man's most dangerous invention.

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.460
Oh, really?

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.620
That's for an example, for example.

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:16.020
Yeah, so I do, as my remarks perhaps suggested,

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:20.100
I do tend to think of animal consciousness,

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:22.220
subjective consciousness that we have,

01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:24.300
that presumably other mammals have,

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:27.900
and who knows how far down the life scale it goes,

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.580
that it's a strongly emergent kind of phenomenon.

01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:35.820
It involves giving rise to fundamentally new features

01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:40.860
of the whole organism, that are structural features,

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.780
but that are sustained, certainly,

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.020
by the physical properties of the organism.

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:48.660
So that's how I think about emergent consciousness,

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.860
and it gives rise to very difficult questions

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.180
about how one could ever theorize about it scientifically.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.220
I appreciate it.

01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:58.740
But I guess to quote the early 20th century emergentist,

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:02.580
Samuel Alexander, Scottish emergentist, scientist,

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:04.860
we have to approach these things with the piety

01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.380
of the natural investigator.

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:10.620
That's how mysteriously we find ourselves

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:12.940
as conscious beings in a world that's

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.700
driven fundamentally by physical forces,

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.300
and then it's our job if we want to theorize about it

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.220
to figure out how that could be, but it's true.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:26.300
Now, the business of scientists who

01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:30.700
replicate forms of life that perhaps could be conscious,

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.980
could be purpose of forms that might

01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:39.420
be less prone to irrational and behavioral than ourselves

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.660
and get organized and take over or something like that.

01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.940
I can't provide any reassurances on that score.

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:47.780
I just don't know what the possibilities are.

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.420
I think we just don't know what the possibilities are.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.180
Thank you.

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.220
So you have to ask her.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.140
Anyone else who might want to jump?

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.220
I don't know if anyone else wants to.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:36:59.220
That was a good answer.

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.340
I want to say one thing, but I'll go after you.

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.340
So yeah, I don't have anything intelligent to say.

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:06.700
That's fine.

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:11.860
So I think if some man-made creature behaved

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.980
in a sufficiently sophisticated way,

01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.500
we would have to say it was conscious.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.300
If it really, if it cried when it's offspring

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.700
were lost in the mall or whatever,

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.540
I'd, I think, be very difficult to deny that it was feeling

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:28.980
things and I think that would be impossible to avoid.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.300
As to whether that would translate into danger to us,

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:33.620
that we simply can't tell.

01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:35.060
Cura's actually your answer.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:38.540
Does that mean that you think that this sort of strongly

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:44.060
emergent new thing wouldn't exist built the thing?

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.380
Instead of it evolving naturally or being just descended

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:50.620
from us, if we built a very complex robot,

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.300
an artificial intelligence, and it behaved

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:56.860
in a sufficiently like or even doglike way,

01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:01.180
do you think that would mean that the stuff that the emergent

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:03.740
mental stuff was actually emerging in it?

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:08.100
I think we'd have that we can't say for sure

01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.580
a priori, right?

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.700
All we know about is that there's consciousness associated

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.340
with a certain kind of biological form of life

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:18.460
rooted in neurophysiology just because we have direct

01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:20.540
acquaintance with that phenomena and we know it's

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:23.060
intimately associated with our neurophysiology.

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.940
Whether something that was sort of functionally equivalent

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:28.380
to neurophysiology, but say silicon-based,

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.940
something artificial, whether that would give rise

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:34.540
to subjective experience or simply something that would

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:38.460
mimic, but not actually involve conscious experience,

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.780
but would mimic the kind of behavior that conscious

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.500
being such as ourselves engaged in, like crying and so forth.

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:47.860
That's a deep question and it's hard to say.

01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.940
We couldn't answer it.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:53.420
We couldn't necessarily verify what would be our best theory

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.860
based on the behavior.

01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:58.140
But yeah, it's a difficult question.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:58.660
Yeah, I don't know.

01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:00.140
I'm just wondering if there is something

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.540
like a Turing test or something like that for consciousness.

01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:04.940
Well, basically, I'm saying I believe the Turing test

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:08.020
and he's saying he doesn't completely buy it.

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.220
Yeah, so can we postulate that there is,

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:13.780
imagine that there is no consciousness.

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:16.500
And if there is an animal, they were

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:19.100
saying before something that there is no consciousness

01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.340
and it's behaving exactly in the same way.

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:23.060
And then the other thing that I think

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:25.020
I found very problematic about consciousness

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.140
is that when you think evolution in an evolution,

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:29.460
when you think the relationship between different

01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:31.580
organisms in an evolutionary way,

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.540
I mean, it's very hard to make a cut.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:37.460
When evolution happens, so when consciousness happens or not,

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.820
it's a very problematic concept.

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:43.140
Yeah, any notion of strong emergence

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:46.340
implies a certain degree of discontinuity

01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.740
and natural evolution of process.

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:51.420
But I think that's just not very well defined.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.300
I don't think it's particularly useful.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.300
And it's problematic.

01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:58.340
I mean, this is the problem with consciousness, I think.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:04.420
But concerning the origins of life here, maybe elsewhere,

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:07.220
why can't we answer that question by just creating

01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:12.500
it in the laboratory from fundamental elements?

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.820
It seems like the initial condition

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.420
shouldn't be that hard.

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:19.020
You know what they were when the Earth started.

01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:22.180
And it seems like we were a lot cheaper than going

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.980
to some very places trying to find it.

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:27.780
Is it just that we don't have the biggest idea how it was done?

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.420
Well, yeah.

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.220
So I have to say that you've got to search the universe

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:36.220
because that's my career that's a place for life.

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.300
But no, you have a point.

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:40.260
And so there are people whose approach to this question

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.900
is to try and build life in the lab

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:47.580
or have life merge out of whatever they're doing in the lab.

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:51.740
So the people looking at the sort of more complex level,

01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:55.940
there are people building cells from scratch, building DNA

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.380
from scratch and trying to make that function.

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.260
And then at a lower level, there are people looking at,

01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:04.940
as you intimate, if you take the mix of chemistry

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.900
that we think perhaps existed on the early Earth

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:10.620
4 billion years ago and you put it in the right conditions,

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.540
what happens?

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.780
And I think part of the problem is we don't actually

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:19.140
know precisely what was going on 4 billion years ago.

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:22.100
We don't know what the start of mix

01:41:22.100 --> 01:41:24.260
was on the surface of the early Earth.

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:28.700
It perhaps was more complex than we previously thought

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.140
because we're now realizing that during the process

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:35.500
of star and planet formation, there's

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:39.020
this great swirling disk of material

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:41.220
that's there for a few tens of millions of years.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.620
And there's an enormous amount of complex chemistry

01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:44.940
that happens in that.

01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.700
It only really happens then.

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:50.980
It doesn't happen in the sort of tenuous nebula

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.820
between the stars.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.500
And it doesn't probably happen in the same way

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:57.460
once you've got a planetary surface.

01:41:57.460 --> 01:41:59.860
So it's, yeah, I'm biased.

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.900
This is my sort of take on this.

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:05.580
There may be something special, special is a bad word.

01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:08.660
There may be something that goes on in a forming planetary

01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:12.980
system that puts a far more rich and complex chemical mixture

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:14.020
down now.

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.380
So what people are seeing with these experiments

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.740
where they have, for example amino acids and certain catalysts

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:25.820
and ultraviolet light in a simulated marine environment,

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:29.060
stuff does start to happen.

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:33.740
Problem is making the conditions right so it keeps going.

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.620
And we don't know how long it took.

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:37.940
So simulating this in a lab.

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.860
Maybe you need to run the simulation

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.340
in the lab for a million years.

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:41.820
And don't know.

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:45.740
Maybe you need to have many cubic miles of material.

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:46.240
Right.

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.180
In one little corner which the right thing happens,

01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:49.260
one's in a billion years.

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:50.740
So I think it's a great question.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.820
I think people are definitely doing that.

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:57.020
My bias take is we need to do the other thing too,

01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:00.140
which is to look for finished examples.

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.220
Yeah, I think the difference in just in volume

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.260
and the difference in time is so many orders

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:07.260
from magnitude away from the lab and the things that,

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.500
I mean, you cannot extrapolate.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.140
It's difficult.

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:13.620
I mean, there may be ways to sort of accelerate opportunity.

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.220
Yeah, but these many orders of magnitude.

01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:15.720
Sure.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.740
Yeah, absolutely.

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.820
I was glad to hear you were channeling Yogi Vara.

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:24.740
And you've said it was remarkable how much you could do

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:32.060
just by looking at his quote was, I think it's amazing how

01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.580
much you can observe just by watching.

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:35.460
So very similar.

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.780
He was a wise man.

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:40.980
The first planetary scientist, I'm curious.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.980
Something struck me when I was a child,

01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:47.340
and it wasn't my parents, in the Museum of Natural History,

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:49.740
and that was the giant T-Rex skeleton.

01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:53.060
And I looked at it and I said, it has a pelvis.

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:53.900
It has a spine.

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.820
It has a skull.

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.820
It's got arms, legs.

01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.020
Owns look sort of similar.

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.820
The muscles.

01:44:00.820 --> 01:44:03.900
Is that the galaxies coming together?

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.340
Is there a common ancestor that I'm unaware of?

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.940
Or is it just the environmental pressures coming up

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.780
with some kind of a similar result, even though dinosaurs

01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:15.500
and mammals are quite different?

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:17.100
So that's still my question.

01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:17.740
Yeah.

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:18.740
My eight-year-old question.

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:19.860
A common origin.

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:20.300
I'm sorry?

01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:24.820
We have the common ancestor that has all the features.

01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:25.660
Thank you.

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:37.900
Very briefly, just to answer Dr. Alfred's question

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:40.900
why do most of the galaxies look similar?

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:45.020
It's because the laws of physics are the same in all

01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:47.500
of our known universe.

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:52.980
In a multiverse, as alluded to by string theory,

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:55.940
for example, the physical constants

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:59.860
might be different than you would have different formations

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.220
or not at all.

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:05.940
Anyway, getting back to the emergence of consciousness.

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:08.060
Seems to me that consciousness is just

01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:11.180
a response to our environment.

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.940
Nothing special except that it's on a very complex level.

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:19.220
No different from an amoeba responding to its environment.

01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:21.660
It seems that the entire conversation

01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:27.460
was very egocentric and also geocentric, earth

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:29.820
centric.

01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:33.660
I think everybody in this room is conscious.

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.100
And I think most of us would agree

01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:40.460
that most mammals are conscious, although that was not accepted

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.060
until the 20th century, still not accepted

01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:46.940
by some religious fanatics.

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:50.580
But would you say a worm is conscious?

01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.540
Would you say a plant is conscious?

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.700
Plants have been known to respond differently

01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:56.340
to different types of music, for example.

01:45:56.340 --> 01:46:10.780
And as Dr. Scharf stated, there are complex organic molecules

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.340
in interstellar space.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:19.140
In fact, most of the essential amino acids

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:23.740
have been found in meteorites that have landed on earth.

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.780
So life and consciousness unique to planet earth

01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:29.940
is not necessarily the truth.

01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:37.940
But my question is, what is your threshold for consciousness?

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:42.500
Humans are obviously conscious by our definition of mammals.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:50.540
As a worm, as a flower, is a molecule that can self-replicate.

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:52.540
Is that conscious or not conscious?

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.140
What is a threshold?

01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.220
Good.

01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:00.660
So distinguish two things that have come together

01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:02.300
in certain complex ways.

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:09.460
One is goal-directed behavioral response

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.940
to some kind of stimuli of your sense organs.

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:15.340
Worms engage in that.

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.140
Plants engage in that.

01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.980
There's a responsiveness, behavioral responsiveness.

01:47:20.980 --> 01:47:23.340
But the idea of consciousness is something

01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:28.100
that mediates stimuli and certain kinds of behavioral response.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:29.740
So you asked me a question.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:30.860
I'm consciously aware of that.

01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:31.780
I'm thinking about it.

01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.700
I'm having conscious thoughts.

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:36.940
And then that has now led to my verbal behavior.

01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:39.220
That's the observable thing.

01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:39.700
It's my speech.

01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:45.020
So you say, well, what's the definition?

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.260
When do we have consciousness?

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.980
Well, we have consciousness when there's something

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:52.460
it's like to be that kind of organism.

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:55.740
It has a point of view.

01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:59.260
Non-living things, we assume, like tables,

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.220
have no point of view.

01:48:00.220 --> 01:48:00.900
They just are.

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:04.300
They have intrinsic properties that

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:07.580
can be described in third personal terms.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.260
Plants we typically suppose, maybe biology

01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:13.980
will surprise us one day, but we typically suppose there's

01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.620
nothing it's like to be a plant, although it does engage

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:20.460
in an organismic response to stimuli.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.900
There's no subjective experience associated

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.300
because it doesn't have the right

01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:29.820
or best understanding of where do conscious states,

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:30.900
where are their origins?

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:32.460
Well, it's for us.

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.420
Its origins is in a functioning neurophysiological system

01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:36.900
of a certain kind.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.260
And then things get a bit obscure.

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:42.820
How does functioning neuronal interactions

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.980
and large-scale neural assemblies

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:47.380
give rise to subjective experience?

01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:49.020
That's the difficult question.

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:49.540
Yeah.

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:50.540
Please.

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:56.220
On an atomic scale, particles governed

01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:59.380
by quantum physics, which is really everything,

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.420
do not respond in a deterministic way.

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:05.820
So can't we say that an electron has an opinion?

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.780
You say consciousness is an opinion.

01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:10.060
An electron could, if you shoot an electron out

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.700
of a cathode ray tube, it could land over there,

01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:14.820
over there, over there.

01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:17.260
We could say that's an opinion.

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.100
Why is that not conscious?

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:20.100
There's no no no no.

01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.900
What makes our consciousness so special

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.620
and what is the threshold level?

01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:26.220
I think one can do the weight gain

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.540
might serve in the next step, question.

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:29.860
The subject is conscious.

01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:31.100
I want to say one thing about it.

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:32.460
It's like wealthy.

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.900
Wealthy is 10K a year more than me.

01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:39.260
And conscious is a little bit simpler behavior than mine,

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:41.780
but not too much simpler.

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:44.060
This is an ego section.

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:48.260
Well, who sets the definitions of the words?

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.460
Not the words.

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.860
LAUGHTER

01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.860
Thank you.

01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:55.060
Kind of related.

01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:58.100
I hope it comes out coherently.

01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:01.580
So the beginning of consciousness, self-consciousness,

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.700
and the beginning of life from non-life,

01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:07.060
even the emergence of a complex universe,

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:10.220
seems to require the input of some kind of information.

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:13.220
So when an infant becomes self-aware,

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:15.740
he's talking to his parents, parents are speaking to,

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:18.180
it seems to correlate when infants become self-aware.

01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:20.460
There's information exchange happening

01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:22.820
from inanimate to animate.

01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:23.900
You have a genetic code.

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:26.140
That's a genetic language.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:31.180
Something about language systems seems to inherently arbitrary.

01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.180
The rules of grammar of the English language

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:36.060
don't derive from physical laws.

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:38.380
So can you guys bounce that around?

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:42.340
What does that imply about the emergence of life

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.660
and self-consciousness?

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.380
I mean, maybe I was going to say this before to the previous question,

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.580
but it was perhaps more appropriate here.

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:55.900
I mean, what's interesting when I hear people talking

01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:00.180
about consciousness, and is there a threshold beyond which

01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:03.340
this is conscious in the way that we've seen, and so on?

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:06.060
I wonder if you could just forget about all that for a moment

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:09.220
and ask, well, OK, so why is there consciousness?

01:51:09.220 --> 01:51:11.580
Now, obviously, the easy thing to say is, well,

01:51:11.580 --> 01:51:15.460
it's because there's some sort of evolutionary advantage.

01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:17.740
It's to do with, yes, our response to stimuli.

01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:21.380
It's to do with our ability to make abstractions

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:25.900
and it's due to the ability of other things to do that.

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.940
So perhaps somewhere in here, there

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:33.340
has to be talk about the origins of consciousness.

01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:35.820
What point in evolutionary history

01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.780
and why was it suddenly advantageous,

01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:41.260
or was it just a chance thing that some organism mutated

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:43.820
in the right way, there was some point mutation

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:47.740
in the piece of DNA, and you had enough complexity

01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:52.180
and neuronal growth or whatever to give rise this?

01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.900
Because I haven't heard that piece of this at all.

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:56.380
Yeah, the other thing, how independent,

01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:57.460
going back to the question, I thought

01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.100
it was very, very interesting, is

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.900
that how dependent is on language,

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:03.660
the definition of consciousness?

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.620
I mean, you are saying that we are kind of aware,

01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.980
and then we are talking the whole time with ourselves,

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.820
and we are internalizing kind of a speech for ourselves.

01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:15.340
So if there is a person that cannot talk

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:20.100
and has been isolated from the world of communication,

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.180
is there a way of saying that this person without access

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.780
to any language, this person is conscious?

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:30.060
And I would certainly think so, right?

01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:34.340
Language may be, it's a difficult theoretical question

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:37.700
that cognitive scientists theorize about,

01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:41.820
but the dependency of abstract reflective thought

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:44.700
on language and how the two are bound up.

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:47.460
That's one question, but consciousness itself, right?

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.940
There are animals that we have reason to believe

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.580
do not have a language capacity,

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:55.860
but presumably because they're basic neurophysiology,

01:52:55.860 --> 01:52:58.060
sufficiently similar to us, and their behaviors,

01:52:58.060 --> 01:53:02.060
indicates they are engaged, they do have conscious space.

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:03.460
With this communication, there is conscious space.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:04.780
In non-linguistic ways, right?

01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.380
That's why we think dogs are conscious.

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:10.380
Because it doesn't have to be language.

01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:14.060
Yes, but now the question of the original question

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.700
that was being asked about the relationship

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:17.620
of information to consciousness,

01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.700
this is something that some cognitive scientists do think,

01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:23.900
right, they puzzle, what is the function of consciousness?

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.180
Why do you need this intermediary, subjective,

01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:28.020
mental aspect?

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:30.580
What would that be doing biologically,

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:34.180
presumably it has to have some kind of advantage?

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:36.900
Surely it's not just a mere chance mutation,

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:38.660
it's such a remarkable thing.

01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:42.780
And so some scientists do theorize

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:45.580
it has something to do with information

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.460
that is had by different modules

01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:50.220
in our neurophysiological system,

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:51.860
in some sense, coming together, right?

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.060
So right now I can have visual information,

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:56.700
auditory information, I can be thinking about the topic

01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:58.460
we're talking about, all this information

01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:00.340
is coming together for me, somehow,

01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:03.660
in one overarching, complex conscious state.

01:54:03.660 --> 01:54:06.740
And there's usefulness of a kind of a free sharing

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:11.460
of information that perhaps this is just the beginning

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.660
of a spectrum, that consciousness seems to be a place

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:18.700
where a lot of information that we derive both

01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.340
from our senses and internal thought processes

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.420
comes together.

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:26.740
And so perhaps it is actually very relevant,

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:27.580
but we don't know.

01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:31.780
A lot of my questions were already asked,

01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:34.780
so I'm making one up as I go along a couple.

01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:37.020
But first, a couple of cool observations.

01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:40.940
I think some of the trouble of discussing this

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:44.140
is that we have a predilection to name our experiences

01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.980
and our observations and then treat that idea as an idea,

01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:51.020
as a real thing and then proceed to give it properties.

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:54.220
So to me, that's one of the real difficulties

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.900
in consciousness.

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:57.700
That's not really part of my question.

01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.660
But I'll just point out that the reason the conversation

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:02.540
goes nowhere until there is a physical substrate

01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:04.780
that we can point to and work with,

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:08.100
it's in a self-enclosed area of neural philosophy.

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.780
So that's as far as it goes.

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:12.540
However, the question related that,

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:14.860
and then I have another similar couple

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.300
of observation and question.

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:22.060
The neocortex generates a weak electromagnetic field

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:26.820
that's been implicated in relatively recent research

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:30.380
as being the mechanism for synchronization

01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:31.540
between distal brain areas

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.780
because the axonal propagation speed of 100 meters

01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:36.260
and second doesn't account for it.

01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:41.380
So I'm hoping to hear any response at all

01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:44.260
based on someone I'm with my lead in.

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:48.700
Or perhaps you might think about that,

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:52.300
about the experience of consciousness

01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:56.500
is possibly the experience of the electromagnetic fields

01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:00.060
field and interaction with the neocortex,

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.020
something like that.

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.460
So that's number one.

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.620
Number two has to do with dark matter,

01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.140
which is also guilty of being an idea,

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:09.300
not an idea just yet,

01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:11.540
although we observe the physical phenomena.

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:14.900
So the question I have there is that,

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:17.420
my understanding of the standard model

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:20.060
and some of the more troubling new introduction,

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.300
supersymmetry, some other areas,

01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:26.020
indicate that if dark, a dark,

01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:29.300
mathematical, perhaps other than a weakly,

01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:32.100
a strongly interactive, massive particle,

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.460
if it's something different,

01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.580
then the standard model has to,

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.340
it can't accommodate that.

01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:40.140
So that was a question for you.

01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:41.820
Okay, thank you.

01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.780
So two questions.

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:45.660
One is for you, one is for you.

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:48.940
Oh, I'll just say a little bit that I do know

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:52.860
about your first question about synchronicity

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:54.860
in the brain, maybe connecting.

01:56:56.780 --> 01:56:58.340
Well, I know how much synchronicity is,

01:56:58.340 --> 01:57:03.340
I think what you're talking about, I'm sorry.

01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:06.340
I think I was intending the word in the sense you have in mind.

01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:11.340
So this was an idea that was put forward by Christoph Koch,

01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:15.340
a computational biologist at Caltech together with Francis Crick

01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:19.340
of Crick and Watson fame that maybe this is the biological,

01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:23.340
the physical substrate to consciousness and chanting it now.

01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.340
I'll pass it over to my colleague who actually knows this stuff,

01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:31.340
perhaps, that this idea has sort of died away,

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:36.340
that Francis Crick himself has now latched onto a new different sort of iPod.

01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:40.340
But there wasn't. There was another paper that was in the last couple of years ago.

01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:46.340
Okay, I'm not a biologist, so I can't speak with any authoritaviveness.

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:47.340
You understand?

01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:51.340
So I think to say about that, because I don't know the topic very well.

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:55.340
So also, I mean, I'm very skeptical about many consciousness things.

01:57:55.340 --> 01:58:00.340
Going back to the dark matter, and this is something that I think they are very different things.

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:03.340
The dark matter has been observed. I mean, it has not been observed with photons,

01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:06.340
but it has been observed with their gravitational...

01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:11.340
And they are kind of very nice experiments, I mean experiments by nature that happens to be there,

01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.340
and you can explain very good things that are there.

01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:19.340
So I think it's there, it's observed, and the only thing is that it's not interacting with light.

01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:24.340
And consciousness, by... I mean, has not been observed.

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:29.340
So on the dark matter, and let me just see if I understand your question.

01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:36.340
So it sounds like what you're asking is the...

01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:40.340
How our models of dark matter fit into the standard model?

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:41.340
Is that the essence of the question?

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:46.340
Essentially, when I was at the LHC conference, there was some pretty robust discussion about

01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:55.340
the understanding that depending on what, if and what the dark matter particle turns out to be,

01:58:55.340 --> 01:59:00.340
if it does, that it would not fit into very nicely the standard model as we have it now.

01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:05.340
Completely correct, and in fact, it does not fit into the standard model at all.

01:59:05.340 --> 01:59:08.340
So what does that mean, that aside from the physics?

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:14.340
Well, there are a number of issues with the standard model.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:19.340
We know that it's not a fundamental theory of the universe, and there are a number of problems with it.

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:25.340
The first one being that it does not contain a quantum theory of gravity.

01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.340
That's the first issue.

01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:31.340
It does not account for neutrino masses, which seems like this is a standard model problem, right?

01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:36.340
We have neutrinos in the standard model, and in the standard model, they're massless.

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:40.340
Third, there's no viable dark matter candidate within the standard model.

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:45.340
And then fourth, there are a number of mathematical issues that are a little bit subtle with a standard model.

01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:57.340
So the fact that there must be, it may be a strong word, but all of these experimental pieces,

01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:04.340
plus the theoretical piece on the mathematics, certainly suggest that there is a more fundamental theory.

02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:13.340
And I would say that when we talk about supersymmetry, for example, supersymmetry is sort of one more fundamental,

02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:20.340
like one fundamental step down from the standard model in the sense that we now invoke a new symmetry between fermions and bosons.

02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.340
So it's a more fundamental theory.

02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:28.340
However, even supersymmetry in its simplest form does not necessarily involve gravitation.

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.340
Now, there are superstring theories, right?

02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:34.340
String theories that involve supersymmetry.

02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:40.340
So even supersymmetry is an effective theory of some more fundamental theory.

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:47.340
That's what's driving theoretical physicists right now, is the sense that we will have some unified theory in the bottom.

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.340
So we're just one really quick follow-up.

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:51.340
Have you listened to?

02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.340
I'll talk to you.

02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:54.340
Sure, we can talk about biceps too.

02:00:54.340 --> 02:01:01.340
The first indication is that it may not be dust.

02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:02.340
Is that true?

02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:07.340
I thought it was dust.

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:16.340
And event that reductionist scientists claim as a great victory for their team is that many phenomena that were catalogued and

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:25.340
described by classical thermodynamicists were subsequently explained at a microscopic fundamental level by statistical mechanitians.

02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:30.340
So this is a very inviting target for champions of strong emergence.

02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:37.340
And a particular crack at it that I've heard recently goes like this.

02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.340
I think this is from a physicist named Sean Carroll.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:49.340
He was a very important phenomenon occurring in physical systems everywhere at all different levels, all different energies,

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:52.340
involving many different substances.

02:01:52.340 --> 02:02:02.340
And he says that when you examine these closely, it appears as if the way they happen is the same, no matter what the system is made of.

02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:06.340
In other words, it really doesn't depend on what the nature of the particle is.

02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:15.340
So then how can you say that the microscopic particulars of what the constituents of the system are?

02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:20.340
Is there any way determining what's happening at the higher level?

02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:26.340
I have my own reasons for not being impressed by that argument, but I want to know what the members of the panel think.

02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:27.340
Thank you.

02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:36.340
It would be an example of weak emergence. It would be successfully explaining large-scale behavior in terms of little...

02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:41.340
It's true that sometimes changing the little stuff doesn't make much difference to the big stuff.

02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:46.340
And galaxies may be an example of that. Any old fluctuation will give you the same thing.

02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:49.340
So can you...

02:02:49.340 --> 02:02:51.340
I think you're a very critical experience.

02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:53.340
Critical exponents and all these things.

02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:59.340
Critical exponents where they are phase transitions, trying to see... you can classify the phase transitions, but some exponents of...

02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:14.340
I think that what the argument was was that if properties of the microscopic constituents are determining what's happening,

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:21.340
then the way it happens should in some way depend on what those particles are.

02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:23.340
In some way, but it may be very little.

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:25.340
So sometimes you'll find that much the same microscopic...

02:03:25.340 --> 02:03:33.340
Sorry, wildly different microscopic inputs give you much the same macroscopic output, but sometimes, like mutations, it makes a huge difference.

02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:36.340
So... is that... is that on?

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:41.340
I think probably... I mean, you have in mind, like in statistical mechanics, when you imagine that you change...

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:48.340
I mean, you can't describe, for example, the casting of this room with temperature, and pressure, and volume, and these different things.

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:55.340
And you don't have to know what are the details of the molecules. So if you just change hydrogen or nitrogen by whatever it is, I mean...

02:03:55.340 --> 02:04:02.340
Then basically you can describe the same system with a few variables that are independent of what is the microscopic details of the gas that is in the room.

02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:08.340
Is that... is that... and then there are distributions that you can do statistics on the same.

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:19.340
Well, I think you've essentially recapitulated what my own objection was to the... to what I thought when I first read this.

02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:22.340
I thought...

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.340
So...

02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:25.340
Yeah.

02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:30.340
Next question, and then you can...

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:37.340
I just wanted to thank all of you who have been a tremendous discussion with wide-ranging input from different fields,

02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:40.340
and I'm sure everybody else have greatly enjoyed it.

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:45.340
My question really goes back to the fundamental question of...

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:52.340
...mergence. I take it most of you have staked out a position as weak emergence proponents.

02:04:52.340 --> 02:05:01.340
And I'm just trying to get my arms around what that means. I mean, a cloud, when it produces rain, I guess we don't think of rain as emergence,

02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:08.340
but if it's a little colder and it produces snowflakes, and each one of them is unique and has this extraordinary crystal structure,

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:11.340
we think of it as an emergent phenomenon.

02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:16.340
But I think it's something... I don't know enough about meteorology to know,

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:22.340
but I assume it's something that science can replicate in the laboratory and understand thoroughly.

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:29.340
Is that really... is it just something that's very neat that we... that comes out as something simple,

02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:34.340
like bees produce... have this extraordinary society or starling...

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:37.340
...I produce these amazing patterns.

02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:43.340
I'm ruling out the strong version of emergence, which seems to me just sort of got to the gaps to some extent.

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:51.340
Is there more to emergence that it's just really cool stuff that comes out of simple stuff that we either understand thoroughly

02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:56.340
or at least have the possibility of understanding thoroughly?

02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:59.340
I think that's about it.

02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:04.340
I think that's about it for most...

02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:11.340
I would say that's about it for a lot of the phenomena in question.

02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:15.340
That is, just because I do think of consciousness as strongly emergent,

02:06:15.340 --> 02:06:18.340
that doesn't give me any tendency towards thinking of any of these other...

02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:23.340
I think that's part of the one thing that's distorted, thinking about emergence this way,

02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:28.340
we gravitate towards one simple overarching sort of explanatory paradigm.

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:31.340
Is it weak emergence or strong? And I think we've got different phenomena,

02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:36.340
and it's an empirical question in every case, and maybe we need to theorize about it differently.

02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:43.340
There is a commonality. The reason we use the word emergence in all these cases is just the idea of new,

02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:52.340
interesting patterns that involve forms of behavior and property instantiations that are different from the kinds of patterns

02:06:52.340 --> 02:07:01.340
describable in lower level sciences, the different properties concepts than one invokes in lower level science.

02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:07.340
And so in that sense, that's emergence, that's uncontroversial, but the details,

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:12.340
and whether or not it amounts to something much stronger than merely that,

02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:15.340
that becomes an empirical question.

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:24.340
I have a question about, not just mamme in the sense of mamme outside of us,

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:30.340
but also our own instrumentation as in how much we understand our senses,

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:36.340
and how that plays into how we think of what we know.

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:41.340
And it seems that during the discussion there was...

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:48.340
Well, there was no mention of it, I'm sure it plays into the consciousness of what you study and what you measure,

02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:53.340
because sometimes I feel like we forget that.

02:07:53.340 --> 02:07:59.340
And in terms of... It goes... I want to link it back to the idea of consciousness.

02:07:59.340 --> 02:08:09.340
You know, one thing about communicating our consciousness is not just language in the sense of human language.

02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:14.340
If you put too much stuff on that table, it will break, is that communication.

02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:18.340
Isn't that feedback? Is it feedback communication?

02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:29.340
So how do we know that... I think we're losing the sense that we have a limited capacity to understand that

02:08:29.340 --> 02:08:35.340
if you can talk about measuring and the idea of instruments and how that limits us.

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:49.340
It always feels like that we forget that we have this limitation would continue to be limited by not only our capacity to understand,

02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:55.340
well, ultimately our capacity to understand, but also our instrumentation, the instruments that we use.

02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:58.340
So if you can talk about that a little bit.

02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.340
What's up, you're up.

02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:08.340
Yeah, I think it's an interesting point. As you were saying, I was thinking, well, the funny thing is we live at a time where we're now

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:13.340
construing tools and instruments, particularly in terms of software and computers,

02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:21.340
that greatly extend our ability to understand things, to understand particularly things like emergent phenomena

02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:29.340
where, I mean, you talked about, you end up thinking about distributions of things rather than an individual instance of a particular

02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:31.340
vent or whatever.

02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:37.340
So, you know, this is just what popped into my head.

02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:41.340
The conversation is constantly changing.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:48.340
And perhaps it's always... we're constantly augmenting capacity.

02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:54.340
We used to do it by grinding lenses and peering into test tubes or out at the stars.

02:09:54.340 --> 02:10:02.340
And we're still doing that, but now we're also constructing software and machines that greatly extend our capacity to

02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:12.340
build and conceptualize vast amounts of data that otherwise would appear extremely unstructured to our raw sensors.

02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:17.340
So I... yeah, I don't know. That doesn't really answer anything. I just put that.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:24.340
I think there's a deep and difficult question here. So we have our basic five senses.

02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:30.340
I'm looking at this tabletop which has a cylindrical, shallow cylindrical shape.

02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:34.340
I can learn about that perceptually through vision.

02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:40.340
It has a certain look to me from a certain angle. I can get tactile information about its shape.

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:48.340
We... these... the tactile information and the visual information, they go together so constantly in us that we forget if we

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:52.340
stopped and isolated. Those are completely different forms of information that are coming in.

02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:57.340
And we've just learned to associate them so that if I close my eyes and have that check, I can picture before my mind

02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:01.340
something that will look like what it will look like when I open my eyes.

02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:07.340
But in fact, these are two just very different. And as you say, they have a certain degree of precision.

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:15.340
They have certain limits, our senses. So then theoretical science sort of tries to abstract away from these things

02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:20.340
and give kind of formalized pictures of reality, kind of very, you know,

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:27.340
mathematically dynamical theories. But then when it comes to, yeah, but do we understand what the theory is saying?

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:31.340
It seems like the formalism isn't enough. I mean, quantum mechanics is the great case, right?

02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:36.340
It's this beautiful mathematical formalism, apparently. Notice you understand it well.

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:42.340
And it's extremely predictably accurate. I'm told the most accurate theory in the history of science, right?

02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:49.340
And yet you say, but intuitively to understand, it's one thing to work with the theory and say, okay, apply the formalism,

02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:55.340
do the measurements of a certain sort, and you can predict not individual outcomes, but distribution of outcomes.

02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:00.340
And it all comes out right. But then you say, yeah, but what is it saying about the deep structure of matter?

02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:05.340
And because we can't visualize it, we can't connect it to our senses, we feel like there's a barrier.

02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:14.340
We can't really understand it. So for us, understanding is bounded by our ability to picture and visualize.

02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:19.340
So it raises deep, I think, deep philosophical questions about the limits of understanding.

02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:26.340
Yeah. And it seems like because we think from our own perspective, and we very seldomly think of things from another perspective,

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:31.340
maybe even another animal's perspective. Forget the table's perspective.

02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:41.340
You know, that sometimes that limits us from understanding from a different way and seldom the egotistical aspect of ourselves

02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:48.340
refuse to let us think from other perspectives in some ways. And that limits our understanding as well.

02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:50.340
Thank you.

02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:57.340
Thanks for this amazing discussion. You really have blown my mind.

02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:03.340
And so I wanted to ask a couple, two quick questions. I make it quick.

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:09.340
Dr. Robodon, you really bummed me out when you shot down the whole consciousness idea.

02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:16.340
I thought we were going to talk about all different kinds of consciousness, and you're like, no, there's no such thing.

02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:23.340
So this question is for you. I read some really interesting stuff about how our thoughts and our moods and stuff can be influenced

02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:30.340
by the flora in our intestines or that. That parasites and other things can influence our thoughts, or maybe even our thoughts.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:39.340
So I've kind of been feeling like that consciousness or thought, if that's a better word for you, is,

02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:46.340
a consensus of different things happening and maybe even of different living things happening.

02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:53.340
And so I wanted you to maybe share anything that thoughts you have on that concept.

02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:58.340
And then the question was for Dr. Khrushberg.

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:04.340
I noticed in your bio, and it must be in here because you didn't want it taken out.

02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:11.340
So I figured it's fair game that you're a Buddhist.

02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:18.340
And so I really wanted to know your perspective on your thoughts of emergence and all of this particle physics and stuff.

02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:23.340
And how does that fit with Buddhism? And do you see any similarities or kind of those two?

02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:29.340
Because to me, as a layman in both the language sometimes sounds the same.

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:36.340
When I think of emergence and when I think of the singular mind, I'm not a Buddhist.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:40.340
But you know what I mean. So those are my questions. Thank you.

02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:49.340
So regarding the democratic thought in theory of consciousness, because I don't know what consciousness is, or thought.

02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:58.340
So no, I don't think thought is true. But I think there's some very interesting data that can be quantitatively

02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:07.340
be precise. For example, if one of the things that I think is fascinating, if we just look in the genome of any of our cells,

02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:11.340
so this is like two copies and they are 3 billion letters of those.

02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:17.340
Only 1% is called in genes, so only 1% is doing proteins, most of the proteins that we know.

02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:22.340
But this is like 10% that they're dead viruses, many of those they are alive.

02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:26.340
So there are things that happened in our history. They came and they infected us.

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.340
They stay there, many of those they die.

02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:38.340
And we carry this cemetery. Each of our cells, they carry a cemetery of viruses that is more than the protein coding part of our genome.

02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:45.340
And this is fascinating. And you see there are a lot of exchange of genomic materials between different species also.

02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:52.340
And in bacteria it happens very often. But through different mechanisms, for example, these things, we have a lot of things even in our cells.

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:56.340
And then, as you were saying, in all the microbiome, in all the...

02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:03.340
This is a very active field of research. It's trying to connect many of my colleagues. They are trying to connect the microbiome and many different things,

02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:09.340
many different health conditions. And it's a very active field of research.

02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.340
And it's very challenging from many technical points of views.

02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:19.340
But I can discuss with you in detail many of these things. It's very, very interesting.

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:25.340
And the other thing is, I think, just saying that we are a very homogeneous type of organism and all these things.

02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:31.340
Even from the evolution point of view, I think it's fascinating. I mean, we know that some of our genes, ones that are important for us,

02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:45.340
and they were coming from other organisms. So this is fascinating. I mean, that we have this migration of different information between different species that have been blocked by our traditional viewpoint.

02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:52.340
And in animals, it's usually kind of the idea of species that they are kind of isolated reproductive units is true.

02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:57.340
But when you go to plants, for example, you see that many of the plants that we drink and smoke every day, I mean,

02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:02.340
they are the combination of merging of different species and all these things. This is fascinating.

02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:11.340
Now that we are reading a lot of these genomes, we realize how these amounts of information from different places is coming together.

02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:18.340
All this is fascinating.

02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:25.340
So...

02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:29.340
First you have to meditate.

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:34.340
Exactly.

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:53.340
Let me begin by saying that I'm a practitioner of Buddhism, and I'm not a thinker of Buddhism, which means that I'm a meditation practitioner,

02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:56.340
and I practice meditation regularly.

02:17:56.340 --> 02:18:13.340
And your question is very interesting because in my experience, my first-person experience, there are analogies between what I know about theoretical physics

02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:21.340
and my experience in meditation and consequently in daily life.

02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:30.340
One example, and this is something that I've thought a little bit about, is the notion of space in theoretical physics and in Buddhism.

02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:40.340
Of course, we've talked a little bit about space, but space, from a physics point of view, is actually very complicated.

02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:46.340
If you take out all of the stuff that's in space, that's in the universe, and you're just left with space,

02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:51.340
that space actually has some fundamental energy to it.

02:18:51.340 --> 02:19:05.340
You have this ability to create particle pairs just from the vacuum, and from those energy fluctuations, we get the emergence of particles.

02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:11.340
In fact, these fluctuations give rise to structure in the universe.

02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:27.340
And again, this is very experiential, but something similar happens, I think, with our experience, in the sense that it emerges from what we would say in Buddhism, is the Dharmakaya, the vast space of experience.

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:41.340
And Dharmakaya, there is a Sambo Gakaya, an energy fluctuation, and out of that emerges our experience, which is the Nirmana Kaya.

02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:56.340
So there are some similar, I mean this is, I could really go on for a while here, but that's one thing that from my experience, kind of one analogy between physics and the experience of reality

02:19:56.340 --> 02:19:59.340
that we kind of tap into through meditation.

02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:04.340
So let me stop there, and we can talk more about it after, but it's...

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:06.340
Last question.

02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:15.340
So I'll just ask the question first, and I don't give my reasons for asking the question, but the question is, so we've talked a lot about different things.

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:24.340
What is actually an example of strongly emergent phenomena in the science, and this is why I'm asking this, so you're pointing.

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:35.340
It's because we've talked about a kind of philosophy of mind, so the problem of consciousness, and we say it's like specifically in the nature of consciousness itself that we can't, that it's not reducible.

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:49.340
And then we kind of came up with one example, and with you with physics, that was that the idea of multiple universes, and we get to the definite, if we give a really specific, precise definition of the universe, then we can't say that there is more than one.

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:51.340
It's just logically impossible.

02:20:51.340 --> 02:21:02.340
So then, my question would be, is strongly emergent phenomena only in those two cases or in a case where it's just definitionally impossible?

02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:20.340
I'm up with phenomena that explains the higher level, and on the other hand, like with environmental, biological science chemistry, do we actually have examples of strongly emergent phenomena?

02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:29.340
Even if you don't believe in them yourself, I can tell you're all rejectionist, but if you don't believe in what are the examples?

02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:49.340
I think there might be a problem with strong emergence in principle, which is that if you see some new thing that is apparently strongly emergent, your first effort is going to be to create new entities, to subsume it into a new framework,

02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:53.340
and then it'll just be part of the whole theory you already have.

02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:58.340
It won't have emerged. It'll just like the magnetic field or neutrino, you'll just add it to the inventory and keep it.

02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:04.340
And then the question is, what kind of thing could that not apply to?

02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:12.340
And the poster child for that was conscious experience, but then my suggestion about that was that it's decoupled from everything.

02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:19.340
It's sort of unreachable in principle, and so, yeah, it's decoupled from being able to be subsumed into that, because it's decoupled from everything.

02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:23.340
You're going to disagree with that, so you get airtime.

02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:31.340
But so maybe strong emergence is a difficult thing to actually really have.

02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:43.340
Play-off Mark's comment. First, an advertisement for a different way of being a realist about conscious experience and saying that it's fundamental without being emergentist is to say it's ubiquitous.

02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:48.340
This so-called old panpsychist idea, which is getting some new play again.

02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:57.340
So then you say, our conscious experience is just a full-blown particular form of something that's there in matter everywhere.

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:02.340
You treat it as something fundamental. Maybe it's the intrinsic character of the physical more generally.

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:06.340
Lots of ideas. Flossers like to run play with this idea.

02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:11.340
I'm not myself disposed in that direction, but a lot of people are.

02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:21.340
But the other thing, the only other thing I wanted to say and really to kick it to some people with the physics background is we haven't talked about quantum entanglement, right?

02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:27.340
And that seems like it could be naturally, this is very low-level physics, right?

02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:47.340
Where particles need to be treated in a certain way and the rough idea is that you cannot describe, you can't decompose the coupled system in terms of the intrinsic properties and the relations among them of the individual particles that entered into this system.

02:23:47.340 --> 02:24:00.340
There's some sense of systemic property of this entangled system that isn't, you can't think of it as in some sense just built up out of the individual properties, items in isolation.

02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:06.340
And then some people say, going space-time, looking at you, this is all up your alley, I assume.

02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:14.340
Some people say, well, if quantum mechanics is ubiquitous, then the whole universe becomes possibly needs to be thought of theorized as.

02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:21.340
And then one great big quantum entangled system is an accessible, strong emergence perhaps.

02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:24.340
But with that, I'll just pass it over to you.

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:30.340
I don't think that's a tangled medicine example of...

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:42.340
Okay, so for entangled man, you have a particle that can be up or down, another particle is up or down, and then you have a way of describing this thing, which is a vector space, another one.

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:45.340
And you construct a new one by taking the tensor product of the two.

02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:53.340
So taking the units, you can construct a hidden space, you can construct a space that is the space of everything.

02:24:53.340 --> 02:25:01.340
So taking each of the units, you can take a new definition or a new definition in a space that you can describe the whole system.

02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:08.340
I think as an example of what I was saying, the wave function, right, we say, oh, that's the wave function and that captures all this entanglement.

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:16.340
And then we talk about the wave function, that's how we do physics now. So we just added a new entity to capture that thing.

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:29.340
But if this new entity is a global thing, it's not an atomistic thing, then in what sense have we not embedded some kind of strong notion of emergence into the fundamental theory thing?

02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:39.340
So we have to drive by the individual. So if there are these bottles here and each of those, you have the definition of, I mean, a way of quantizing the system,

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:43.340
you can combine the whole system by taking the product of all these different things.

02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:46.340
So this is a very well-formal way of doing these things.

02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.340
I'm not going to debate.

02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:52.340
It makes a sense of the connection between things and there was presence in classical physics before you had wave functions.

02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:53.340
That's true.

02:25:53.340 --> 02:25:57.340
Okay. Please feel your questioners and thank you very much.

02:25:57.340 --> 02:26:02.340
Thank you.
