WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.880
I have to do all the time.

00:20.880 --> 00:27.560
To enjoy the exhibit, it will continue on display through this Saturday and you can check the

00:27.560 --> 00:30.480
helix center website for details.

00:30.480 --> 00:38.880
I would like to introduce our participants in tonight's round table creative turbulence.

00:38.880 --> 00:45.440
To my right is Dennis Pelly, professor of psychology and neuro science at New York University.

00:45.440 --> 00:52.240
His right is Enrico Fonda, postdoctoral researcher at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

00:52.240 --> 00:57.400
Next is Dana Carwis, artist and lecturer, integrated digital media, department of technology

00:57.400 --> 01:01.600
culture and society at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

01:01.600 --> 01:07.000
Next is Luc Dubois, composer, artist and performer, co-director of integrated digital media and

01:07.000 --> 01:12.360
director of the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center, both of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.

01:12.360 --> 01:17.560
And joining us shortly is Caterpellis Reneavassen, professor of department of physics at the

01:17.560 --> 01:22.920
Caront Institute and the Eugene Kleiner Professor of Innovation, department of mechanical

01:22.920 --> 01:26.880
and aerospace engineering, and dean of the Tandon School of Engineering and University

01:26.880 --> 01:29.560
professor all at NYU.

01:29.560 --> 01:33.760
So with that, ladies and gentlemen, buckle your seat belts, we're about to encounter

01:33.760 --> 01:36.680
turbulence.

01:36.680 --> 01:43.240
Perhaps Enrico, you can start by telling us a little bit about how this came about.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.840
Yeah, so I started when I was doing research at the University of Maryland in the down

01:47.840 --> 01:53.440
lake lab group and I was doing research on quantum vortices, which are quantum tornadoes

01:53.440 --> 01:58.960
that live inside super fluid helium, which is a liquid helium at very low temperature,

01:58.960 --> 02:01.560
which is macroscopic quantum order.

02:01.560 --> 02:08.040
And so these videos were really kind of interesting and we had the publication about it and some

02:08.040 --> 02:12.800
press release that was really interested by the public.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.800
They were asking strange questions even about it and seemed that it really inspired the

02:18.800 --> 02:21.800
fantasy of people about the project.

02:21.800 --> 02:27.000
So we thought it might be interesting also to see in a light that it's different compared

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
to the scientific area and so might include it in some artistic setting.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.880
So with that idea, then we decided to incorporate also some artists to collaborate with scientists

02:39.880 --> 02:41.400
to get together a show.

02:41.400 --> 02:48.240
And so we get together with Luke, Dana, Professor Jivalda, and to set up this show.

02:48.240 --> 02:54.760
And so you can see some of these artwork before the quantum vortices you've probably already

02:54.760 --> 02:58.320
seen are those the research that have been done before.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.360
And then there are some other ones like work by Dana.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.360
Maybe you can tell us.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.360
Sure.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.840
So can everyone hear me okay?

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
Great.

03:08.840 --> 03:13.600
So the piece I have out here is the one in the corner called immutable swell.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.840
And it was something that I was kind of thinking about for a while, but ended up putting together

03:18.840 --> 03:22.040
last summer when I was near the ocean.

03:22.040 --> 03:27.560
So the piece was born out of both my fear of the ocean and my love of it.

03:27.560 --> 03:32.760
And I'd always look at the ocean at night and try to understand what was happening and

03:32.760 --> 03:37.280
why it was maybe more fearful at night to look at it than during the day or even swimming

03:37.280 --> 03:38.520
in it.

03:38.520 --> 03:43.320
And I started looking at different models of ocean waves just to try to look at the data

03:43.320 --> 03:45.200
and understand it in a new way.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.400
Kind of in the same way that maybe in other projects I would look at maybe a thunderstorm

03:50.400 --> 03:54.640
through Doppler radar or through false image coloring.

03:54.640 --> 03:59.840
You see the red area and there's a ton of rain or you see kind of like a green area and

03:59.840 --> 04:01.520
it's maybe not as scary.

04:01.520 --> 04:05.840
But then if you look at the thunderstorm itself outside, you can really feel it.

04:05.840 --> 04:12.880
You can see kind of like the synoptic meteorologists looking at the sky before numerical modeling

04:12.880 --> 04:14.440
came around.

04:14.440 --> 04:19.240
There was kind of a direct observation of knowing that something was coming.

04:19.240 --> 04:27.800
And I kind of took this departure from the normal scientific inscription that is very

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
trusted.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.120
So I'm looking at Enrico because he is the scientist here among us.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.120
And I think that, and you, yes, and Dennis.

04:36.120 --> 04:43.360
So just thinking about kind of this, going into this project, kind of thinking about new

04:43.360 --> 04:49.960
ways of kind of experiencing scientific data by still using it and using collection methods

04:49.960 --> 04:51.560
that were somewhat scientific.

04:51.560 --> 05:00.840
So for this particular piece, I took my phone and it has an accelerometer and pressure

05:00.840 --> 05:07.680
data and location data and I wrapped it up in multiple levels of waterproofing attached

05:07.680 --> 05:13.720
it to a fishing pole at first and cast it out into the sea, in Turro, Massachusetts.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.480
And watched it.

05:15.480 --> 05:21.600
I actually swam out a few times and then with the fishing pole and cast it during the clips

05:21.600 --> 05:25.760
for the summer because no one was in the water and I didn't want to disturb anyone.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.080
So I was by myself way out there.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.680
And I floated with the phone back and the fishing pole.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.120
Just trying to kind of, and I was scared.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
It was deep.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
I couldn't.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.280
I'm very terrified of the water.

05:37.280 --> 05:44.160
And I ended up letting the phone go back and forth as a sensor to shore.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.680
And then this happened multiple times.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.920
And I took that data and it was recorded at 100 hertz.

05:49.920 --> 05:56.000
So there was dimensional data of me with the phone at first and then the fishing pole

05:56.000 --> 05:57.880
in the phone in the water.

05:57.880 --> 06:06.760
So I was able to collect over 500,000 data points of waves coming in to the shore and

06:06.760 --> 06:08.040
breaking on the shore.

06:08.040 --> 06:15.720
So then I took that data and brought it through Python and kind of traditional ways of visualizing

06:15.720 --> 06:19.960
it and started to play with the form.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.440
So what is the dimensional form of this?

06:21.440 --> 06:27.680
How can I get this invisible kind of direct experience of floating in the wave exported

06:27.680 --> 06:33.280
into some type of dimensional observation that someone could look at and emotionally

06:33.280 --> 06:37.480
feel that that's what it feels like to be floating in the ocean?

06:37.480 --> 06:43.360
Because all these wave models I was looking at, they were missing this dimension of emotional

06:43.360 --> 06:44.720
connection to the thing itself.

06:44.720 --> 06:49.040
Like when I look at a model of a scientific wave, and there's very beautiful models and

06:49.040 --> 06:52.840
they can show you hundreds of different things and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
different ways.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.400
I didn't quite ever say like, oh, that's what it feels like to be in a wave.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.800
So I wanted to play with that.

07:01.800 --> 07:11.080
So I took all those data points and put them in a dimensional model and just extruded them

07:11.080 --> 07:16.000
into, it was just a cube that I kept twisting and twisting and twisting.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.480
But you can start to see the shape of the wave as it was hitting my body or as it was

07:22.480 --> 07:24.400
hitting the sensor itself.

07:24.400 --> 07:30.880
So I had it as a very complex model, which is what the image is.

07:30.880 --> 07:36.960
And then I took the challenge of printing that with a machine back into a form, which

07:36.960 --> 07:38.880
is what you're seeing in the hallway.

07:38.880 --> 07:44.400
So he should come join.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.200
So really it's a question of scientific.

07:46.200 --> 07:52.320
How do we get beyond traditional scientific vernacular and inscription that is very trusted

07:52.320 --> 08:01.760
and often looked at by a professional and it becomes, it can translate into the public

08:01.760 --> 08:07.760
or into the research and people trust that data, scientific data and how to use other

08:07.760 --> 08:09.280
kind of visualization tools.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.960
Kind of in the spirit of Edward Tufti, but breaking that even further and trying to get

08:14.960 --> 08:19.800
to a new way of looking at something or a new way of feeling something that is a phenomenon

08:19.800 --> 08:21.760
that we all experience.

08:21.760 --> 08:27.760
And it's a break of these scientists looking at this phenomenon separate from the thing

08:27.760 --> 08:28.760
itself.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.320
And I know that's not possible at certain scales.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.080
So if you're looking at something in a macro-scaler, micro-scaler, if you're looking at the Mars

08:34.080 --> 08:38.360
rover, there's no way that the person observing that is ever going to be able to see that

08:38.360 --> 08:40.080
data with their naked eye.

08:40.080 --> 08:48.240
So I'm very curious about coming up with new ways to look at it in an unmediated, almost

08:48.240 --> 08:52.760
caveman way of looking at something or feeling something.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.560
Has anyone looking at it said that they could feel the wave?

08:57.560 --> 08:58.560
Yes.

08:58.560 --> 09:03.600
Once I told them it was a wave, they could understand it as a wave.

09:03.600 --> 09:10.040
It's a beautifully romantic kind of, my favorite art science overlaps always have this thing

09:10.040 --> 09:11.520
that's very human to them.

09:11.520 --> 09:16.360
So I love the whole, you throw your phone in the water when you have a terrible breakup.

09:16.360 --> 09:22.480
That's like the throwing the phone in the water.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.680
And it's the same thing with Raphael's piece and the idea that it's an utterance.

09:26.680 --> 09:31.960
It's just a very human natural thing and we're somehow leveraging what we understand about

09:31.960 --> 09:33.720
physics to show it to you.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.400
And I don't know, I think that's really cool.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.680
That's a really good way to bring it home.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
Yeah.

09:39.680 --> 09:47.560
Regarding visualization of data, also the work by collective motion by David McLeo, the professor

09:47.560 --> 09:55.000
at NYU showing this collective motion of particles that are interacting with each other and

09:55.000 --> 10:05.320
create this fluid-like form that was in the theme of the whole project, was fluids.

10:05.320 --> 10:10.200
And also that was visualization of data but interpreted to the eye of the artist.

10:10.200 --> 10:15.640
In the beginning, in fact, I was overlooking the interaction.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.440
In the beginning, there were a lot of back and forths of data between the artists and

10:20.440 --> 10:24.640
the scientists because the artist said the data of the scientist wasn't good, wasn't

10:24.640 --> 10:26.960
looking good for some reason.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.960
And so it's something to be considered what is looking good or not.

10:30.960 --> 10:37.320
Eventually, they found something that was meaningful both scientifically and aesthetically,

10:37.320 --> 10:42.880
according to the eyes of the artist.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.480
And those decisions become completely subjective.

10:46.480 --> 10:54.800
So there's this moment where there's a kind of a testing process, I think, that the artists

10:54.800 --> 10:58.520
go through with whatever data they're working with, especially if they're working with scientific

10:58.520 --> 11:05.200
data or any data set or any phenomena, that there's a moment where it shifts to maybe

11:05.200 --> 11:07.560
how they're looking at it.

11:07.560 --> 11:14.080
And potentially, this credits it in a scientific realm but offers something else that maybe

11:14.080 --> 11:15.560
the scientists won't be able to reach.

11:15.560 --> 11:21.280
So that's a really interesting space to work in when the data or the phenomena we're looking

11:21.280 --> 11:29.320
at when it's transitioning into this kind of subjective space of the interpreter or the

11:29.320 --> 11:30.320
new inscriber.

11:30.320 --> 11:38.720
It's also speaking to sort of like the shared aesthetic qualities and experience that there

11:38.720 --> 11:45.960
resonates between the artist and the scientist, that they're experiencing something on a similar

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
level.

11:46.960 --> 11:53.680
It's kind of like the, I guess from the 19, even before this, in history, I don't think

11:53.680 --> 11:59.200
that's the exact date, but when the naturalists would go out and look at new land or they'd

11:59.200 --> 12:04.880
find new species and they would take notes on, so these scientists would be taking notes

12:04.880 --> 12:09.760
on what they saw and they would go back and they would hire an artist that could draw

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
it better than they could.

12:10.760 --> 12:18.360
So you get these beautiful atlases with species from the beginning of time that we're unable

12:18.360 --> 12:23.360
to be photographed because that didn't exist yet, but this dialogue that the scientist

12:23.360 --> 12:28.960
had to have with the artist to tell them, okay, that you need to draw it like this.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.360
Because if the scientist drew it, it might have just looked like a cartoon.

12:32.360 --> 12:37.320
So there's a kind of a communication that has existed for a while between artists and

12:37.320 --> 12:43.120
scientists trying to realize or visually interpret the phenomena.

12:43.120 --> 12:49.360
Back in the days, you were also Leonardo was doing both and before the science was born.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.880
Right, but Leonardo would consider painting an art.

12:51.880 --> 12:59.200
I mean, sorry, a painting of science because he, because of the instrumentation needed to

12:59.200 --> 13:01.560
be used in the painting.

13:01.560 --> 13:06.560
So he would, Leonardo's time, he considered painting of science.

13:06.560 --> 13:11.640
Also because the painter had a divine mind, he could see things the way God could.

13:11.640 --> 13:17.200
So there was an ultimate truth in what Leonardo was after.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.680
His professor is Serena Boston.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.680
Hi.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
Apologies for being great.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
Oh, that's okay.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.680
We're glad you're here.

13:25.680 --> 13:39.200
I know we want to know if we have the slides.

13:39.200 --> 13:46.640
When everybody else is spoken, I'll take it.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.640
Did you have some slides that you wanted to present?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.640
I had four of them.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.120
Are I still half of them?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
Go to Ariel.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.120
Sure.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.200
Yeah, go for it.

14:02.200 --> 14:08.800
I wanted to say that first of all, thank you for having us here.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.360
Thank you.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.200
It's new to me.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.760
Yes.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.160
Thank you.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.040
My ears are not the right size.

14:21.040 --> 14:31.560
Also when you think about science and art, I know that these are quite often deemed as

14:31.560 --> 14:33.760
two different sorts of activities.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.840
And in fact, there are very immense differences.

14:36.840 --> 14:44.520
But on the other hand, if you go a little bit deeper, all my friends tell me that the

14:44.520 --> 14:57.480
sense of beauty and also its ability to evoke emotions are sort of very similar.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.680
I wanted to illustrate to you one or two things.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.520
Here is the most beautiful week question in mathematics.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.520
Now, why would you say it is most beautiful?

15:08.520 --> 15:13.040
It's not apparent to people who are not trained in mathematics.

15:13.040 --> 15:18.920
So what it does is it's now, of course, since 1748.

15:18.920 --> 15:25.280
It combines five very important quantities since this nice way.

15:25.280 --> 15:34.880
Zero, as you know, is just a quantity to which if you add anything, the quantity to remain

15:34.880 --> 15:36.560
the same.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.720
And that's the so-called additive invariant.

15:40.720 --> 15:47.000
And one is something you multiply anything with, it will still give you the same thing.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.200
And pi, as you know, is the ratio of the circumference of the circle to its diameter.

15:52.200 --> 15:57.720
And it has been computed to 20 quadrillionth place.

15:57.720 --> 16:04.000
That is not million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, 20 times.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.760
And it still has no pattern and it keeps going.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.720
There is no end to it.

16:08.720 --> 16:15.200
I, as you would all recognize, is a square root of minus one, which is a strange quantity.

16:15.200 --> 16:22.240
And E is so-called Euler number, which also has been computed to 500 billion places and

16:22.240 --> 16:25.440
it still continues ad nauseam.

16:25.440 --> 16:31.200
But somehow when you combine like this, all of that is somehow gone.

16:31.200 --> 16:35.560
All this complexity that you see individually is totally gone.

16:35.560 --> 16:40.880
And you have this extraordinarily simple formula due to Euler.

16:40.880 --> 16:47.080
And it is like E equals MC squared or some very similar thing that people know.

16:47.080 --> 16:52.840
So of course, you will have to learn a little bit about how to appreciate this.

16:52.840 --> 16:59.240
And that's part of what I think is in appreciation of art, literature, anything like that.

16:59.240 --> 17:05.800
And the other one, next one, you all recognize this, this is the wave.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.080
Can you go to the next one?

17:08.080 --> 17:11.400
This is the great wave of Kanagawa in Japan.

17:11.400 --> 17:17.840
When Japan was for 250 years, sort of removed from the rest of the world, it basically developed

17:17.840 --> 17:24.160
its own skills in art, in all kinds of other human endeavors.

17:24.160 --> 17:31.040
And you can see the wave, the huge wave, which is now known as the rogue wave in the literature,

17:31.040 --> 17:37.360
keyboards now capsized and there is the Mount Fuji at the very back with the snow cap on

17:37.360 --> 17:38.400
it.

17:38.400 --> 17:46.400
And there are all kinds of scientific emotions that this will produce for us if I could go

17:46.400 --> 17:48.960
on at it, but I will not do that.

17:48.960 --> 17:56.680
And the third one, which again, all of you remember, this lovely little part of the bigger

17:56.680 --> 18:02.480
poem, the woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep.

18:02.480 --> 18:08.360
So he's working that he has responsibilities that he can't take himself off from going

18:08.360 --> 18:13.840
into the woods and enjoying them and miles to go before I sleep and miles to go before

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
I sleep.

18:14.840 --> 18:20.320
I can't omit the fact that the last line has been repeated twice and repeated and so it

18:20.320 --> 18:28.000
is really extraordinary set of emotions that this will bring to bear on whoever reads it.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.040
And the last one is the topic of the conversation today about turbulence and its beauty and

18:36.040 --> 18:37.840
what it has for art.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.640
It's just a jet that is coming down.

18:40.640 --> 18:46.400
You can see tendrils and vertices and all of them somehow combined in some very complex

18:46.400 --> 18:48.200
way.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.520
There is an admixture of order on the one hand and chaos on the other.

18:52.520 --> 18:58.040
To me that evokes again extraordinary sense of beauty and extraordinary set of complex

18:58.040 --> 18:59.240
ideas.

18:59.240 --> 19:04.480
And to me, therefore, these illustrate somehow the kinds of things which I will not spell

19:04.480 --> 19:05.640
out for you.

19:05.640 --> 19:12.600
I think that science has in all its major endeavors.

19:12.600 --> 19:18.200
It's utilitarian and therefore people sort of don't understand that beyond the utilitarian

19:18.200 --> 19:24.200
aspect of science there's all kinds of beauty in it and that's what really gives rise to

19:24.200 --> 19:31.280
a satisfaction of doing something worthwhile and if truth and beauty can never be equated

19:31.280 --> 19:34.640
to each other, well, maybe there is something to it.

19:34.640 --> 19:40.640
That's all I wanted to say.

19:40.640 --> 19:45.640
Well perhaps this speaks to your interest in the psychophysics of beauty.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.640
Okay, so I'll just say a couple words about myself.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.760
I wanted to join this discussion.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.560
So I'm a psychophysicist.

19:54.560 --> 20:04.440
I study perception by behavior and most of my work is on object recognition, how we recognize

20:04.440 --> 20:09.160
things, how we read, but a new line of my research is trying to understand the experience

20:09.160 --> 20:13.040
of beauty.

20:13.040 --> 20:19.800
So in thinking about what we would talk about tonight, I thought there was a danger that

20:19.800 --> 20:22.600
we might all agree.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.560
So I tried to pick something that we might disagree about.

20:27.560 --> 20:35.240
So I'm going to take a position that perhaps others will want to differ from.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.200
We're teasing too.

20:37.200 --> 20:41.120
Well, that's what we'll argue about.

20:41.120 --> 20:50.680
So the theme tonight is this magic show that Indrico organized about combining art and

20:50.680 --> 20:52.960
science.

20:52.960 --> 20:58.360
And I suspect we all more or less agree about what science is, making up a definition, I

20:58.360 --> 21:04.080
would say something about an attempt to reach a mathematical understanding of something

21:04.080 --> 21:08.920
that's subject to test by prediction and experiment.

21:08.920 --> 21:09.960
You might disagree about that.

21:09.960 --> 21:16.120
But it seems more likely that we're going to disagree about what art is.

21:16.120 --> 21:21.040
And so I looked up what Wikipedia gives as definition of art.

21:21.040 --> 21:26.800
And I hadn't quite expected it, but it gives it conditional on the year.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.080
So let me just read it to his only couple sentences.

21:29.080 --> 21:35.080
Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory, or performing

21:35.080 --> 21:44.600
artifacts, artworks, expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill intended to

21:44.600 --> 21:47.960
be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.720
Okay, that seems reasonable.

21:50.720 --> 21:57.360
And then it goes on to say until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery

21:57.360 --> 22:02.080
and was not differentiated from crafts or science.

22:02.080 --> 22:10.640
So Dana brought up Da Vinci earlier, and you were suggesting with that division, according

22:10.640 --> 22:13.080
to Wikipedia, I think he wouldn't have made any distinction.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.680
His paintings and his engineering are all art.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.920
So art here in the sense of artifact made by man.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.880
Right, but he would also say it's science.

22:23.880 --> 22:29.760
He would Leonardo thought that painting and his era was science because of the instrumentation

22:29.760 --> 22:30.760
and also that's like...

22:30.760 --> 22:33.040
So those two words would distinguish his activities, right?

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
Yes.

22:34.040 --> 22:38.160
And that's like legacy now when we feel like liberal arts.

22:38.160 --> 22:46.480
So my sense is that the spirit of this show is actually a 17th century perspective of

22:46.480 --> 22:52.720
treating art and science as not having any division and that they are demonstrating a

22:52.720 --> 22:59.240
mastery to share an appreciation of the topic.

22:59.240 --> 23:07.440
So one of the things that if we're going to try and parse would be actually whether the

23:07.440 --> 23:14.560
artist had the intent of producing objects that had the purpose of being appreciated

23:14.560 --> 23:17.160
for beauty and emotional power.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.440
Okay, that's my position.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.840
I'm hoping someone would disagree.

23:21.840 --> 23:27.080
I would argue, I mean, being a person that created an artwork for the show that...

23:27.080 --> 23:28.080
Right, perfect.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.360
I mean, I really struggled.

23:30.360 --> 23:37.120
Is this an artwork or is it just a really fancy visualization of some type of phenomena?

23:37.120 --> 23:42.200
And for me, I'm not sure if it's art in my mind.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.280
I know it's an object I made.

23:45.280 --> 23:52.000
I'm coming also from an architecture background and it fits in a sculptural format and it was

23:52.000 --> 23:54.760
printed on really beautiful paper and it's this inkjet print.

23:54.760 --> 24:01.520
But I really struggle as someone creating and playing with this data as an experiment

24:01.520 --> 24:07.480
as I'm going through it in the process of just getting from the data set to what you

24:07.480 --> 24:10.320
see out there.

24:10.320 --> 24:16.960
I'm a former body surfer and so I could resonate to your comments about how attractive and

24:16.960 --> 24:27.920
frightening the ocean is and how you had the frustration in looking at a lot of other visualization

24:27.920 --> 24:35.840
work about waves that failed to convey any of that emotional energy and that you were...

24:35.840 --> 24:41.120
That missing bit was part of your motivation doing your piece.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
Trying to seek.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.480
I was seeking some way to view it, I guess, for myself, which would be kind of...

24:47.480 --> 24:53.920
I think that would tip me over into the realm of an artist in the process and also have

24:53.920 --> 25:00.720
served no purpose or consequence except for other people to look at it or myself to look

25:00.720 --> 25:05.480
at it and be like, okay, that looks like a really pressurized experience of what I'm

25:05.480 --> 25:10.760
trying to share while floating.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.760
Anyone else?

25:11.760 --> 25:17.200
So the question, would you distinguish just the pure visualization of the vortices?

25:17.200 --> 25:21.240
No, when you made your piece, I think you collaborated in several of them.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.800
Yes, some of them were collaboration with artists.

25:23.800 --> 25:29.040
Were you trying to produce something that would produce an experience of beauty in the observer

25:29.040 --> 25:34.680
or some other strong emotion or did you have a different purpose?

25:34.680 --> 25:40.680
So I was collaborating on the scientific part, so I was not actually having the goal of producing

25:40.680 --> 25:46.360
something was in the mind of the artist, that particular task, to deal with that.

25:46.360 --> 25:51.760
But there was our research about a concept behind, for example, the work by Rafael

25:51.760 --> 25:52.760
Lusano-Hamer.

25:52.760 --> 25:59.360
He was this concept of the words staying in the atmosphere forever.

25:59.360 --> 26:05.320
He tried to conceptualize that into a form of art and an object.

26:05.320 --> 26:11.160
And he actually tried to different kinds of pieces of art, but some of them didn't work

26:11.160 --> 26:12.840
out well like he wanted.

26:12.840 --> 26:18.240
And so eventually just one piece was eventually finalized, like the one that was here, the

26:18.240 --> 26:21.960
3D printed of the flow there of someone speaking.

26:21.960 --> 26:27.560
So in this case, there was a concept that wanted to be expressed.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.800
And I think also some form of beauty, but you have to ask the artist because I cannot

26:31.800 --> 26:33.800
speak for him.

26:33.800 --> 26:39.600
Okay, so I'm going to push to...

26:39.600 --> 26:45.080
So I saw the piece and I'm very interested in the concept of how it was made, and I was

26:45.080 --> 26:47.600
interested in seeing the form.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.920
But I wanted to ask, can we do a show of hands in the studio?

26:50.920 --> 26:51.920
Please.

26:51.920 --> 26:59.760
And so how many people were moved by the 3D visualization of the speech, the pressure

26:59.760 --> 27:02.680
pattern produced by the speech?

27:02.680 --> 27:14.240
Okay, and how many were not moved?

27:14.240 --> 27:25.120
So the sense of a strong, powerful emotion that overcomes you.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.880
You should re-ask the question, having defined it.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.880
Sorry.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.240
You should re-ask the question, ask it again.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.080
No, we've defined it.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.200
Okay, so shall we vote again?

27:37.200 --> 27:43.480
So how many people were moved by the visualization of the speech pattern?

27:43.480 --> 27:46.440
And how many people were not moved?

27:46.440 --> 27:47.600
About 50-50.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.960
So that means a lot of people here were moved.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.440
So that's a successful piece.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.000
Can I say this?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Please.

27:55.000 --> 28:01.280
I don't remember the precise words that Keats used at one time, but I think he said something

28:01.280 --> 28:02.780
like this.

28:02.780 --> 28:10.120
If you begin to get into the nitty-gritty of things, you will sort of detract from its

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
beauty.

28:11.120 --> 28:17.840
That is to say, you go to the ocean, you admire these beautiful waves, but once you begin

28:17.840 --> 28:24.320
asking, well, at what speed are they going, or at what angle are they propagating, and

28:24.320 --> 28:27.880
what kind of drop patterns it produces and so on.

28:27.880 --> 28:31.520
Keats thought that it diminishes the beauty of the whole thing.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.960
On the other hand, there is another view which says, why?

28:34.960 --> 28:36.480
Why would it do that?

28:36.480 --> 28:45.240
The object that you saw before is still exactly as formidable as it was before in some ways.

28:45.240 --> 28:51.320
But now, having asked these questions, you have a deeper insight into the phenomena that

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
you admired before.

28:53.320 --> 28:59.000
Will the knowledge somehow diminish the beauty of the object?

28:59.000 --> 29:03.880
Now that's something that many people think is what happens.

29:03.880 --> 29:10.000
What is to say, you see this sunset, it's so beautiful, but once you begin to ask, well,

29:10.000 --> 29:14.800
what's the spectrum of the sunset, you know what angle is the sunsetting, etc.

29:14.800 --> 29:19.280
It somehow seems to become mundane, but I don't see that that's how it should be treated

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
at all.

29:20.280 --> 29:25.560
So in fact, there is a speech pattern which you might abstractly admire, but once you

29:25.560 --> 29:31.200
somehow make a pattern out of it, you begin to say, is this what it is, and then you somehow

29:31.200 --> 29:38.800
lose interest or lose your ability to relate to the mystery that you had before?

29:38.800 --> 29:44.040
And to me, that somehow looks even though I was not terribly impressed and I raised my

29:44.040 --> 29:51.440
hand for the second category, I think the fact that you somehow make it more concrete,

29:51.440 --> 29:58.280
make it more understandable, make it more more expressible in terms of quantitative things,

29:58.280 --> 30:01.440
does not diminish the beauty of anything as I know.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.680
That's my personal prejudice.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.720
My sense is depends on the teacher.

30:06.720 --> 30:15.280
So many of the works here were produced by physicists and I am reasonably sure that they

30:15.280 --> 30:20.520
love physics and that the more they study physics, physics doesn't become less interesting

30:20.520 --> 30:23.880
or less attractive by the process of study.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.520
But there are some teachers who kill topics.

30:26.520 --> 30:35.560
In fact, what I was told as a graduate student was the purpose of you writing a paper is

30:35.560 --> 30:40.600
not to kill the field and that is to say, not say the last word on it, but actually

30:40.600 --> 30:46.080
to enhance the interest of others so it could be carried on further.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.720
So I think you are absolutely right.

30:48.720 --> 30:54.480
Some teachers can kill the interest, somehow present it as a finished product and then

30:54.480 --> 30:56.560
you have no interest in it anymore.

30:56.560 --> 31:01.840
I think that comes back to maybe what I was saying a little earlier about this kind of

31:01.840 --> 31:09.480
knowledge formation around the topic, going to the teacher or even the beauty found in

31:09.480 --> 31:12.000
the data, the quantitative data.

31:12.000 --> 31:19.000
And there's, I think the artists and I think what Raphael and some of these other artists

31:19.000 --> 31:26.720
are trying to do is essentially calibrate that quantitative information towards beauty

31:26.720 --> 31:27.720
again.

31:27.720 --> 31:35.560
So it starts as a phenomena, it gets removed from the phenomena into the numbers, numbers

31:35.560 --> 31:40.760
and then there's these kind of calibration techniques that are really specific to the

31:40.760 --> 31:48.160
artists and those experiments and calibration of resurrecting the beauty back out of the

31:48.160 --> 31:58.480
data to be experienced isn't going to kill the looking at a sunset.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.840
Even if you take a photograph of a sunset, that can never explain what you're actually

32:02.840 --> 32:08.800
seeing any photograph or any painting compared to what you're seeing and with your naked

32:08.800 --> 32:09.800
eye.

32:09.800 --> 32:16.360
And for me it goes back to this kind of human or naked eye observation of being able to

32:16.360 --> 32:18.440
look at a phenomena.

32:18.440 --> 32:26.040
There is the, you made a point that somehow there is an abstraction of something that

32:26.040 --> 32:31.840
is a workative and that's what the artists seem to work on.

32:31.840 --> 32:37.800
The point is that that's the kind of freedom that a scientist probably does not have in

32:37.800 --> 32:38.960
some sense.

32:38.960 --> 32:44.320
So you might say therefore they are somewhat different that is to say the abstractions

32:44.320 --> 32:52.840
should still in science satisfy certain rules which we think are all right.

32:52.840 --> 32:59.200
Now this constraint somehow is the heart of the matter of the distinction between these

32:59.200 --> 33:04.040
two activities.

33:04.040 --> 33:10.800
Now I'm not sure that if you train yourself a little bit that this requirement or the

33:10.800 --> 33:15.880
constraint that you have certain loss that you have to obey in how you abstract things

33:15.880 --> 33:19.280
and how you describe them and all that.

33:19.280 --> 33:24.680
I'm not sure that it should diminish the beauty of the enterprise.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.040
That's my own thinking on this.

33:28.040 --> 33:33.020
But I know a lot of people think that the fact that you are constrained somehow, the

33:33.020 --> 33:42.200
fact that you do not, you cannot write down any arbitrary equation or something like that,

33:42.200 --> 33:47.600
we will somehow kill the originality, creativity, beauty, etc.

33:47.600 --> 33:54.160
On the other hand the fact that you can describe something in nature in some quantitative ways

33:54.160 --> 33:57.160
is such an extraordinary phenomenon.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.440
We have no right to doing any of those things.

33:59.440 --> 34:06.160
I mean we are humans, we somehow we seem to comprehend everything that goes beyond us,

34:06.160 --> 34:07.880
the universe.

34:07.880 --> 34:16.120
How can we, tiny specks of dust in the universe, can comprehend something so universal, so

34:16.120 --> 34:18.520
large and so inspiring.

34:18.520 --> 34:27.440
So to me it actually enhances and adds beauty to the whole thing rather than diminish it.

34:27.440 --> 34:33.240
I can say how beautiful is this but then you want to really go a little bit deeper, a little

34:33.240 --> 34:35.320
understand a little bit more.

34:35.320 --> 34:36.760
Why does it diminish anything?

34:36.760 --> 34:38.560
Why does it diminish the sunset?

34:38.560 --> 34:47.920
I mean that's one position let's say, one I take just because you said one of us should

34:47.920 --> 34:48.920
agree.

34:48.920 --> 34:53.520
I can bring up an example of maybe a funny example that everyone can relate to.

34:53.520 --> 35:01.080
So when in 1972 we had the- Were you born at that time?

35:01.080 --> 35:04.640
Not yet, I was making it some way.

35:04.640 --> 35:11.280
So we're all familiar with the view of Earth from space, Blue Marble.

35:11.280 --> 35:22.400
That was a photograph that was taken by astronauts on Apollo 17, no, 11.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.400
So I'm not following that.

35:24.400 --> 35:31.640
Yes, sorry about fact, but anyway the point is that this single image of Earth was taken

35:31.640 --> 35:40.920
by a camera, set back down and the intent of the image wasn't by the astronauts to just

35:40.920 --> 35:50.400
take this grand image of the Earth that we knew it at that time and still know it.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.680
It wasn't part of the mission plan.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.560
So they took this photograph.

35:53.560 --> 35:58.360
It came back down and NASA flipped it.

35:58.360 --> 36:04.560
So I guess when it originally arrived on the film it was taken with the South Pole, basically

36:04.560 --> 36:05.560
not.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.440
So they flipped it and then they color corrected it a little bit and then that got put out

36:09.440 --> 36:10.960
into the world.

36:10.960 --> 36:18.320
And that had an effect on the astronauts who saw it and other people who have been in space,

36:18.320 --> 36:24.800
the overview effect, some emotional kind of shift that happens by looking at something

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
from afar.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.600
But it can also happen to people who just see the photograph.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.240
So that's kind of one example of a phenomenon.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.840
Maybe there's like an emotional addition to this.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.680
We don't have access to that phenomenon with our own eyes.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.520
It comes through a camera.

36:39.520 --> 36:47.160
So that's one example where it's like a surprise that happens with the technology and the science

36:47.160 --> 36:50.520
and the instruments that allowed us to take this image.

36:50.520 --> 36:56.640
And people by just seeing this had emotional surprising reaction.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.720
It was maybe mirroring what the astronauts were feeling or if they've learned about this

37:00.720 --> 37:03.720
feeling, that there's no borders.

37:03.720 --> 37:11.240
There's this kind of Earth, not from space, but Earth in space and how that image could

37:11.240 --> 37:12.440
have an impact.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.440
So I think that's like one example.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.360
And I was stunningly beautiful, yes, I agree.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.960
And the way it was, the trip it was doing on your mind was part of it, yes.

37:21.960 --> 37:22.960
Yeah.

37:22.960 --> 37:30.920
So I do think that there is potential to have these dramatic emotional experiences through

37:30.920 --> 37:32.560
just one image.

37:32.560 --> 37:38.400
We're showing people something that they thought they knew in a strange way.

37:38.400 --> 37:42.680
It doesn't look like the toy worlds we grew up with.

37:42.680 --> 37:46.240
And we thought we knew the planet and then we realized that all the political lines are

37:46.240 --> 37:47.240
missing.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.240
We didn't know the planet.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.240
Yeah, that's a question of scale.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.800
And that's the same thing with a lot of these things.

37:51.800 --> 37:56.320
It's like, you can say, you think you know the ocean, but I'm going to show you a different

37:56.320 --> 38:01.800
way that I know the ocean or the web or that I've instrumented the ocean or that I've experienced

38:01.800 --> 38:02.800
the ocean.

38:02.800 --> 38:08.480
I think I know how speech works, but I don't actually know how speech works at all.

38:08.480 --> 38:14.320
Like this whole like, which way do you come in on a problem?

38:14.320 --> 38:15.320
I don't know.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.560
I always think it's really interesting trying to figure out these categories.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.520
I was trained as a musician.

38:20.520 --> 38:27.880
So John Cage has this kind of canny riff that just music is just organized sound.

38:27.880 --> 38:32.880
But another way of saying it is the complete opposite of it has nothing to do with sound.

38:32.880 --> 38:37.880
Music is emotionally manipulating people with physics algorithms and data.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.000
It has nothing to do with anything with your ears.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
So like at the micro level instruments or physics, you know, there's things that weren't

38:45.000 --> 38:49.920
running on physics, then we like sort of add keys and chords and scales as our algorithms.

38:49.920 --> 38:54.000
Then at the macro level, you have a whole piece as an information stream.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.360
So you can make music in a million different ways that have nothing to do with your ears

38:59.360 --> 39:03.040
if you can just sort of change the terms of the definition.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.080
And that's what I think is always exciting about this work.

39:05.080 --> 39:13.720
That's when Rico and I first met, I really enjoyed hearing him riff about the physics

39:13.720 --> 39:17.840
research you work on because you were talking to me about how it sounds.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.920
Do you remember this?

39:19.920 --> 39:23.480
You're talking about the spiracles and they make cracking noises.

39:23.480 --> 39:24.480
Oh, yeah.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.120
Yeah, and you were showing me this video.

39:27.120 --> 39:29.080
And I was like, oh, that's amazing.

39:29.080 --> 39:35.240
There's like this little like Janus is an achus piece in every stream of helium.

39:35.240 --> 39:40.440
And like if you could just get that out of there, we could like make some kind of crazy,

39:40.440 --> 39:44.120
you know, I don't know, thing that they could really evoke it.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.120
I don't know.

39:45.120 --> 39:49.960
And maybe I could remark on your comment on music.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.360
Music is, you said is organized sound.

39:53.360 --> 39:58.960
In some way, it's not the organization at all that matters, which also you said.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.280
But I want to say it in a different way.

40:02.280 --> 40:06.200
It's how different parts of music relate to the other parts.

40:06.200 --> 40:10.560
How an part really relates to the integral whole.

40:10.560 --> 40:15.280
That's what really is important in science to it is not the individual facts that are

40:15.280 --> 40:16.280
important.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.240
It's how they relate to each other.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.960
And that's without really relating to each other.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.920
It's really just an isolated fact.

40:22.920 --> 40:29.280
And that's not of any consequence in terms of, in terms we are discussing.

40:29.280 --> 40:35.880
So one definition of beauty would be how each, this is Heisenberg who said this.

40:35.880 --> 40:42.120
How one part relates to the next part and to the whole.

40:42.120 --> 40:46.480
And that's really what music is, why it is special.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.400
After all the notes are not that complicated.

40:49.400 --> 40:56.520
And I value if you listen to Mozart, it's a very different type of thing.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.440
Well conversation seems to have been more laminar than turbulence.

40:59.440 --> 41:07.680
So I'm wondering if maybe we could transition to talking a bit more about the turbulence

41:07.680 --> 41:09.520
that these projects also.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.800
You say something and decline laminar.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.800
Okay.

41:12.800 --> 41:17.920
Well we can start from the world actually also related to the project that was.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.240
That we are working on right now.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.520
We are looking at it right now.

41:21.520 --> 41:25.720
And it's about the confusion and creation about turbulence.

41:25.720 --> 41:31.000
So the turbulence comes from the Latin verb, verb, turbo, which means to agitate, throw

41:31.000 --> 41:32.760
into confusion.

41:32.760 --> 41:40.000
And we use for the first time by, first time by federal in his lupus and agnus, fable to

41:40.000 --> 41:48.040
describe the water stirred up by the lamb that's equinated, polluted the water by,

41:48.040 --> 41:50.120
out to the wolf.

41:50.120 --> 41:54.720
But then was used by Lnerald Ravinche to describe the turbulence actually of water.

41:54.720 --> 41:59.000
And was said, the turbulence was the word describing it.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.440
And he actually was one of the first one really getting some big insights about the turbulence.

42:05.440 --> 42:16.240
And again, turbulence something that's chaotic, random, and it's the motion of fluid.

42:16.240 --> 42:21.960
And he compared the motion of the fluid to the motion of hair.

42:21.960 --> 42:29.200
And he painted all these nice vortices and described a cascade of vortices, it goes from

42:29.200 --> 42:31.640
the large scale to the small scale.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.680
And so he had the profound insight also just by observing it.

42:35.680 --> 42:39.840
And he also put some very important questions regarding the nature of turbulence, the creation

42:39.840 --> 42:45.240
of turbulence, how it maintains and how it decays that are still open.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.040
You want to?

42:48.040 --> 42:49.440
Yeah.

42:49.440 --> 42:54.200
You will remember this question.

42:54.200 --> 42:57.160
Who will read this turbulent priest?

42:57.160 --> 43:02.160
Oh, remember this, who will read me of this turbulent priest?

43:02.160 --> 43:05.120
Yeah, who was this guy?

43:05.120 --> 43:08.240
That's the first use of the work turbulent, as well.

43:08.240 --> 43:11.280
You remember this in the cathedral.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.280
Is it?

43:13.280 --> 43:15.480
It's referring to Thomas Moore.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.480
Yeah.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.120
Now it's before Thomas Moore, it's his Henry, it's King Henry.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.720
Yeah, he's something, something number.

43:21.720 --> 43:22.720
Yeah.

43:22.720 --> 43:31.760
This is a priest that he got, he really killed and Peter or two actually played the role

43:31.760 --> 43:34.280
of Henry.

43:34.280 --> 43:40.760
And then what's this other guy who was, at least Taylor's husband twice, I forget his

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
name.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.760
Yeah, Richard Burton.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.760
Richard Burton?

43:44.760 --> 43:48.000
Yeah, yeah, he played the role of the priest.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
So who will read this?

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Thomas Beckett.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Thomas Beckett.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Oh, sorry.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, same idea.

43:55.320 --> 44:01.120
Yeah, yeah, that's the priest who get whacked because they talk up to the kings, right?

44:01.120 --> 44:02.240
So that's the, yeah.

44:02.240 --> 44:09.200
So for us, white turbulence is really important is this as I see it.

44:09.200 --> 44:16.560
Physics has generally, for a very long time, taken one object at a time like, for example,

44:16.560 --> 44:23.400
an atom or an electron in controlled circumstances and has studied its properties.

44:23.400 --> 44:27.880
And you can measure, let's say, the charge on the electron to, I don't know, 10 days,

44:27.880 --> 44:31.720
no place, whatever number that is.

44:31.720 --> 44:39.080
But it, so that's how physics has really gone for many, many years.

44:39.080 --> 44:45.200
But it turns out that when you cannot isolate objects, but the objects begin to interact

44:45.200 --> 44:50.240
with each other, then it becomes extremely complicated.

44:50.240 --> 44:56.640
And this is how chaos came into being, for instance, when, let's say, three objects interact

44:56.640 --> 45:04.160
with each other, you can no longer predict how their evolution takes place in long term.

45:04.160 --> 45:08.080
So, turbulence, the essence of the phenomenon is really interaction.

45:08.080 --> 45:15.360
Interaction among its constituent matter, which could be vortices, like Enrico said,

45:15.360 --> 45:17.800
it could be whatever else.

45:17.800 --> 45:25.560
So in reality, most of what we observe around us is really interaction among many components.

45:25.560 --> 45:31.440
Humans interact with each other, government interacts with the citizens in some way, businesses

45:31.440 --> 45:33.960
interact, financial markets are interacting.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.680
They're all the results of some interactions.

45:36.680 --> 45:43.360
So the real question is, when these things interact in some complicated way like that,

45:43.360 --> 45:49.520
is there some fundamental truth behind these interactions?

45:49.520 --> 45:56.320
If I, it may be statistical in nature or somehow or the other, that will transcend the real

45:56.320 --> 46:00.560
specific details of the phenomena you're looking at.

46:00.560 --> 46:07.720
Would the finance markets have some properties that transcend the details of the financial

46:07.720 --> 46:14.320
market and would relate to what, let's say, a flow of turbulent motion of fluid as.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.800
So, that's the question.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.880
So the ultimate question for many of us who work in this field is really to discover within

46:21.880 --> 46:28.480
quotation marks, if there are such rules that transcend the specific details of the constituents

46:28.480 --> 46:30.920
that interact with each other.

46:30.920 --> 46:35.880
And if it is, if that is the case, that would be spectacular.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.720
I don't know that that is the case.

46:37.720 --> 46:44.640
Each time we think we have some understanding of this universal aspects of it, we take one

46:44.640 --> 46:48.680
step back and we just find that that's not exactly right.

46:48.680 --> 46:55.040
And so it may well be true that there are at some level, they are probably similar.

46:55.040 --> 47:01.680
If you take the power spectrum of the financial, let's say the signal on the, and from the

47:01.680 --> 47:07.560
Wall Street stock market, it may have some resemblance to turbulence as a matter of fact.

47:07.560 --> 47:11.640
There have been a lot of people who have studied this.

47:11.640 --> 47:17.680
But you go deeper, one step deeper, this mirage of universality somehow disappears.

47:17.680 --> 47:24.640
If it doesn't disappear exactly, but it will say that they are not really exactly the same.

47:24.640 --> 47:30.640
You go one step deeper, you sort of figure out that really they are even more different.

47:30.640 --> 47:36.040
So it's like peeling onion one level at a time.

47:36.040 --> 47:43.040
It looks like you have, okay, you peel one layer and say, okay, the next layer is there,

47:43.040 --> 47:44.040
etc.

47:44.040 --> 47:46.800
But you go to the core, there may be nothing, right?

47:46.800 --> 47:53.360
I mean, unlike apple, which has a core, onion maybe doesn't.

47:53.360 --> 48:00.240
So the fact is we don't know whether there is such a universal set of rules.

48:00.240 --> 48:05.000
But there are indications that there are, but if it is true, that would be a spectacular

48:05.000 --> 48:12.840
discovery that would really have great consequence intellectually, utilitarian way and everything

48:12.840 --> 48:13.840
else.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.520
That would be why we would study.

48:16.520 --> 48:23.520
Of course, we know if you understand it, we can save fuel on aircraft and make the jets

48:23.520 --> 48:25.640
less noisy and all that.

48:25.640 --> 48:26.800
We understand that too.

48:26.800 --> 48:29.360
I think that's also very important.

48:29.360 --> 48:35.640
But at the bottom, as a person interested in the physics of it, the mathematics of it,

48:35.640 --> 48:38.160
that's really what drives us.

48:38.160 --> 48:47.000
So we write papers on the universality of such and such and next paper we are not so

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
sure.

48:48.000 --> 48:56.400
So I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's how it is.

48:56.400 --> 49:04.040
I wonder if you have more to say about the dimensions of beauty in relation to turbulence

49:04.040 --> 49:05.840
in this topic.

49:05.840 --> 49:16.320
So there was the relationship between turbulence and beauty was founded by Van Gogh somehow.

49:16.320 --> 49:25.600
In the stairs nights, they found that the probability of difference between the luminosity

49:25.600 --> 49:29.840
of two points in the paintings is the same of the probability of the difference of the

49:29.840 --> 49:35.360
velocity of two points in the fluid flow of turbulence.

49:35.360 --> 49:41.120
And this was, they found that it was mostly in the period where Van Gogh was mostly chaotic

49:41.120 --> 49:47.520
in his mind when he was upset and almost crazy.

49:47.520 --> 49:53.680
And while the period that was more relaxed, this characteristic of turbulent motion in

49:53.680 --> 49:56.760
his paintings was not there.

49:56.760 --> 50:02.040
We have a diagnosis for Van Gogh?

50:02.040 --> 50:08.440
Maybe analysts don't like to apply diagnosis to people we haven't in example.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.000
Especially in public.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
All right.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.760
Well, I think for me, at least in thinking about beauty and turbulence, it reminds me

50:15.760 --> 50:25.400
of a study I recently read that across the globe, different painting, landscape paintings

50:25.400 --> 50:29.440
were put in front of different types of people to see if there was some type of universal

50:29.440 --> 50:32.640
beauty in landscape art.

50:32.640 --> 50:43.200
And the consistent beautiful image that each culture had identified was a landscape that

50:43.200 --> 50:46.480
had these following components in it.

50:46.480 --> 50:56.120
So it had some view of the sky, some greenery, some trees, some type of path and some type

50:56.120 --> 50:59.560
of moving water feature.

50:59.560 --> 51:06.320
So this goes also to my other comment that I'm going to say that often spaces, this goes

51:06.320 --> 51:08.440
back to my architecture, the pattern language.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.960
You get anyone know about the pattern language?

51:10.960 --> 51:14.960
It's kind of an architectural Bible that has different patterns you can put together

51:14.960 --> 51:16.200
for designing a space.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.840
For example, windows need to be on two sides of a room.

51:18.840 --> 51:22.200
Those are the types of the rooms that people like to hang out in in different houses, et

51:22.200 --> 51:27.640
cetera, talks about curb height, and they're kind of cute patterns, but also you can design

51:27.640 --> 51:30.960
an entire community around them.

51:30.960 --> 51:37.000
And my favorite one is that people are most happy when they're near moving water and flowing

51:37.000 --> 51:38.200
water.

51:38.200 --> 51:46.360
And this always makes me think about spaces that are successful like Pali Park here.

51:46.360 --> 51:49.880
Anyone familiar with Pali Park?

51:49.880 --> 51:54.480
It has a water feature or even in front of the Seagram Center, so all these kind of water

51:54.480 --> 51:55.640
and moving water.

51:55.640 --> 52:01.560
Even at the, we're not, this could be the lay person just looking at it, but it's about

52:01.560 --> 52:08.600
being near water that has psychological and positive effects on humans.

52:08.600 --> 52:10.000
That's why we all go.

52:10.000 --> 52:15.240
Well, it also makes one wonder about the evolutionary significance of its potable moving water

52:15.240 --> 52:25.000
as opposed to still water and as opposed to ocean water as potable and must have adaptive

52:25.000 --> 52:31.280
meaning to, and that's kind of the, you know, you wonder about the connection between aesthetic

52:31.280 --> 52:33.440
perception, right?

52:33.440 --> 52:35.600
And making judgments about survival.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.600
Right.

52:36.600 --> 52:41.320
There's a really wonderful book that I think came out this past year called Blue Mind by

52:41.320 --> 52:49.840
Wallace Nichols, and they have a conference about the psychology behind being near water

52:49.840 --> 52:51.880
and the effects of water on the human.

52:51.880 --> 53:01.920
It's a really wonderful book, but the author himself puts sensors on his body and jumps

53:01.920 --> 53:04.520
in the water and swims for miles.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.560
But they're more physiological sensors, so it's trying to figure out also how he feels.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.960
And if anyone wants to check out that book, it's been a very, one of my favorites that

53:12.960 --> 53:14.160
I've read in the past year.

53:14.160 --> 53:15.520
What's the name again?

53:15.520 --> 53:16.520
Blue Mind.

53:16.520 --> 53:22.400
Could I make a remark on your comment?

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
Yes.

53:23.400 --> 53:26.760
Maybe related, but if it is not, please excuse me.

53:26.760 --> 53:35.040
So I grew up, I was brought up and grew up in an interior part of another continent.

53:35.040 --> 53:41.200
And the first time I saw the ocean, I was probably 16 years old.

53:41.200 --> 53:47.040
For me, what was most beautiful was the kind of environment in which I grew.

53:47.040 --> 53:51.680
There were mountains and rocky mountains and not huge trees.

53:51.680 --> 53:55.280
It never bothered me about that much.

53:55.280 --> 54:03.520
So we, until I came away to, let's say, New England and something like that, I didn't

54:03.520 --> 54:11.680
quite really have a great admiration for greenery, or blowing water, or anything like

54:11.680 --> 54:12.680
that.

54:12.680 --> 54:23.760
So my sense of what is interesting, what is so admirable somehow, changed.

54:23.760 --> 54:24.760
It changed.

54:24.760 --> 54:30.600
I mean, in fact, on some other matters, I had a certain sense of what constitutes beauty

54:30.600 --> 54:31.600
in women.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.920
I mean it with no disrespect at all.

54:33.920 --> 54:38.480
But now, I mean a totally different environment for many years.

54:38.480 --> 54:43.240
My concept of what beauty in women is has changed altogether.

54:43.240 --> 54:47.240
If not altogether, I mean to a significant degree.

54:47.240 --> 54:53.120
So in some sense, the question for all of you is whether all this is really not as deep

54:53.120 --> 55:00.400
as evolution and things like that, but it is maybe more controlled by your environment.

55:00.400 --> 55:07.600
How, how, if all I know is where I grew up, I don't know that I would appreciate some

55:07.600 --> 55:10.840
of the same things that I do now.

55:10.840 --> 55:18.600
So it may not be as deep as one thing, may not be wired in your evolutionary means.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.560
So that's the question I had for you, actually.

55:21.560 --> 55:27.960
Oh, well, this was just something I was observing and the results came back that these features

55:27.960 --> 55:28.960
for me.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.720
I'm more like you.

55:31.720 --> 55:36.200
I grew up in midwest, so there's no ocean.

55:36.200 --> 55:40.080
I like a big muddy river in rocks.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
Yeah, rocks.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.680
Yeah, I do like the rocks.

55:43.680 --> 55:49.840
But there is something that's kind of, the ocean is more mystical or like it has a level

55:49.840 --> 55:57.840
of mystique for me that is, that shifts between day and night even.

55:57.840 --> 56:03.400
Because you look at the ocean at night, there's no color, so you just can see the forms,

56:03.400 --> 56:05.320
especially on a night with a full moon.

56:05.320 --> 56:09.280
You can really understand where the waves are coming from, how far they're coming,

56:09.280 --> 56:12.960
and it's unbelievable to see the ocean at night.

56:12.960 --> 56:15.920
But also, I would never go in the ocean.

56:15.920 --> 56:18.200
Has anyone gone swimming in the ocean at night?

56:18.200 --> 56:19.200
Way out.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.200
That way out.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.200
And this is scary.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.200
Yeah, that's, it seems, there's fear in that.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.200
Yeah.

56:23.200 --> 56:30.200
At least for me, and that's what that piece is a little bit about.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.720
Like big things we can't get.

56:31.720 --> 56:36.760
I didn't see stars, like a full night sky star, so I was a teenager.

56:36.760 --> 56:42.240
Because I grew up in cities with like so much light pollution, so I thought like stars

56:42.240 --> 56:45.760
was like, oh, there's like four of them.

56:45.760 --> 56:51.960
You know, and then I went and I had a, I took like a road trip, my sophomore year in college

56:51.960 --> 56:57.240
or something like that to Vermont, and then the sunset, and I was like, wait a minute.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.240
What?

56:58.240 --> 57:02.440
You know, and that was like this really amazing, you know, thing where, you know, you see

57:02.440 --> 57:06.280
something just that you thought was kind of manageable and simple, and it turns out to

57:06.280 --> 57:08.920
be incredibly awe-inspiring and complex.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.880
Gives you a little bit of perspective.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.560
That was my like blue marble moment.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.800
It was, it was backwards though.

57:15.800 --> 57:18.640
But it was that like you thought you knew the planet, and then you definitely didn't

57:18.640 --> 57:19.640
know the planet.

57:19.640 --> 57:23.040
And I kind of got, yeah.

57:23.040 --> 57:27.720
So when people do cross-cultural studies on aesthetics, one thing that comes out as a

57:27.720 --> 57:33.080
universal is a preference for curves over angular angles.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.360
That doesn't disprove it being cultural.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.880
It may just be cultural commonalities.

57:38.880 --> 57:39.880
Right.

57:39.880 --> 57:52.560
Returning to turbulence for another minute or so.

57:52.560 --> 58:00.080
So we all know that flow through a pipe is turbulent very often.

58:00.080 --> 58:04.880
The jet exiting from an aircraft is turbulent.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.320
The oceans are turbulent.

58:08.320 --> 58:15.000
The air quite often moves in turbulent ways.

58:15.000 --> 58:20.360
So there are two different views of looking at turbulence.

58:20.360 --> 58:26.120
In a certain sense, what happens inside the pipe is quite different from what happens

58:26.120 --> 58:33.680
inside the ocean because there is friction on the walls and pipes are of finite length

58:33.680 --> 58:36.160
and all of this kind of stuff.

58:36.160 --> 58:42.520
The oceans, although there are walls, they're so far away from the main activity that the

58:42.520 --> 58:46.000
walls may not have any effect.

58:46.000 --> 58:53.080
Therefore, one line of enquiry is to study each of these classes of turbulent flows on

58:53.080 --> 58:54.440
their own merits.

58:54.440 --> 58:58.120
So one becomes an expert in turbulence in pipe flows.

58:58.120 --> 59:03.080
Another becomes an expert in turbulence in ocean, etc.

59:03.080 --> 59:08.280
But there is a second part to which I made a lot of evolution earlier, which is to say

59:08.280 --> 59:13.800
yeah, there are specific aspects that are in fact different from one flow to another.

59:13.800 --> 59:20.560
But is there an essence of the turbulence, so to speak, that transcends each of these

59:20.560 --> 59:25.240
real specific things and what is that?

59:25.240 --> 59:31.120
And if it is true, is it a good model, even going more general, is it a good model for

59:31.120 --> 59:37.800
studying the interaction among many components, a large number of components in some nonlinear

59:37.800 --> 59:43.880
way, nonlinear way that you can sort of forget about the details of where you started.

59:43.880 --> 59:49.840
So that's the line of enquiry.

59:49.840 --> 59:57.080
But what I'm thinking about turbulence, how it's embodied by humans that are feeling it

59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.280
upon themselves as an airplane when you're on an airplane or you kind of understand this

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.640
movement.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:11.080
I think one journey through turbulence, through many different layers of turbulence, could

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:21.080
be the human experience or how it's impacting something that can be felt.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:30.400
My brother is actually an aerospace engineer and his PhD was how turbulent flow goes over

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.720
the wings of jets and makes all these crazy models of it.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:44.000
So for him, it's just about going and being in a wind machine and observing it.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.600
And he actually has a little jet that I think runs off of algae fuel, just as a pet in his

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600
garage.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:59.280
But just kind of trying to understand this, the way he's looking at it as a model or

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.040
through computation or through air.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040
And we're fine with him.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040
He loves it.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.520
Like when we're on an airplane, the skin tossed around in Colorado or whatever, like

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.520
flipping upside down.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.800
He's like, this is awesome.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.960
But I think that it's about that kind of, is there a way that there's an embodied experience?

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:27.360
Maybe not through human but other species or other like birds or other entities that are

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:33.440
living that are being impacted by this.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.240
Each to himself or herself.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240
Yeah.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:50.760
So, I think that's only in human mind at any given interval of time.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:59.600
Zillion thoughts fly through, I'm saying it in not in any real rigorous way.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.000
So many, many thoughts go by.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.920
One thought does not continue in the next instant, etc.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.320
So there is very poor correlation between what you think now and what you might think

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:23.720
next minute, especially for people who haven't concentrated down their mind too much.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.440
See in turbulence too, something like that happens.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:32.280
That is to say, there's only finite correlation between what happens here and what might happen

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.800
a little bit later.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.280
So I have often wondered whether in fact there are models one can make, models mathematical

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.960
models that have finite correlation.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.640
If you're a yogi for instance, you concentrate on one thing for hours and end and the same

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.000
thought, but most people are not.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:03.640
Most people are just fleeting thoughts, enhanced by the complexity, enhanced by the environment

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.120
around oneself.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:14.600
So it may be that there is some deeper model one can actually tell, I have wondered sometimes

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:22.000
between how the mind works and how let's say turbulent flow outside of the human's

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
work.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.280
That might be very interesting and you are interested in mind and how it works and this

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:40.080
would be a very fruitful line of dialogue at least until we decide it is useless.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.240
Do you have any speculation as to what some of the underlying connections are?

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.760
So of course there are special characteristics of the mind or the brain let's say, brain

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.080
and mind are two different entities I understand.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.760
Presumably they are very strongly related even though they're separate.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:09.400
So there is the spatial structure and then there is a temporal variations that take place

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:19.000
and somehow these are all connected to thoughts and one should be able to somehow connect

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:27.960
them and at least at a level of speculation it would be worth thinking about.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:36.880
So there has been quite a bit of work on EEG with thoughts that are parallel to what

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.560
you are suggesting.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:46.600
When we are asleep there is a very strong algorithm and then when the person is awake

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.720
you get less rhythmic behavior.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:05:01.840
I don't know what kinds of correlation lengths you get before you can't predict.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.200
I haven't done any EEG works I'm not sure.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.120
Very interesting.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:18.800
My son maps the brain and using FMRR machines.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:25.640
And then he tries to understand the relation between patterns on the one hand and functionality

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.080
on the other.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.720
I'm not even sure whether the ideas are very properly formulated.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:42.200
Well, FMRRI isn't very good for this because it has a time constant of six seconds.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:46.480
It's not directly measuring neural activity, it's measuring the blood response.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.600
And so you don't really get temporal dynamics out of it.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.520
The megamission.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:02.000
So EEG and MEG both respond fine and they will be fine for looking at that.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.080
Dare we delve into the quantum dimensions of turbulence in our discussion?

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.080
Yes.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:17.880
Well, quantum turbulence is this turbulence that happens in superfluid which is liquid

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:27.240
helium at a temperature below 2.11 Kelvin and it has a macroscopic quantum order.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:32.680
So there is quantum mechanical effects on large scale and you have these vertices that instead

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:37.480
of being all of different sizes like you have in a normal flow they are quantized.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:44.240
So they are all the same and are all multiple of the quantum of circulation which are certain

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.840
quantity.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:52.560
And they are again of atomic size like I was saying in width but macroscopic in length

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.040
and interact in different ways and if you've seen the videos of quantum words that they

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.400
are you've seen the wave emotions they have.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:06.880
And it's very important for many reasons in the order of the dissipation of the energy

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.000
in the quantum turbulence.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.520
And you have this mechanism which is called reconnection when two vertices get together.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:20.240
They get together the exchange tails and then they separate and you probably have seen also

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:25.680
if you haven't you can look them later at this mechanism which is again central to the

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.040
mechanism of dissipation.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:32.040
And dissipation is important because you wouldn't think that in a fluid which is completely

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.200
without friction you will have any dissipation.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:41.080
But in fact you have also dissipation in a quantum fluid.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.480
And so that is also one of the reasons you would like to study quantum turbulence to

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:54.040
see how dissipation compares between the classical and quantum flow.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:04.240
Could I maybe add a little bit maybe just make it less technical than I and Rick on said.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.280
But ordinary room temperature and pressure etc.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:15.520
The fluids that we know air and water and others they do not have any quantum mechanical

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.840
properties or they do everything is quantum mechanics but it somehow gets smeared out

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.160
so it doesn't really matter.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:31.320
So we are always looking at water and air and things like that where there are these

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:38.400
vertices but each vortex spins differently that is different the magnitude that you can

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.840
associate with those vertices will all be different they can be all over the map.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.280
There is no restriction of any sort.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.040
And so studying the interaction among them which is really one of the primary objects

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:57.000
of turbulent studies becomes a little bit more complicated because you have so many

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
dissimilar objects that are interacting with each other.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:10.880
But it so happens that if you take a fluid that can remain in a liquid form even at very

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.960
low temperatures helium is the only one that remains a liquid if you go below about 2.7

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.320
Kelvin everything else freezes to become a solid.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:31.560
But this one for whatever reason remains a liquid and then quantum mechanical effects

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:37.720
begin to show up somehow and this is what you are saying long range order and things

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.120
like that.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.920
The manifestation of these emergence of quantum mechanics in fluids there one of the consequences

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:55.600
is that these vertices which in room temperature were all very dissimilar and things like that

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.120
they become really ordered the circulation around them that is says strength of these

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.560
vertices are all identical.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:11.520
Therefore one thinks that somehow in studying the interaction of identical objects will

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.240
be much easier to understand and in fact if there is any element of truth to what I was

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.360
saying earlier that really interaction among elements is really what matters to understand

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.600
turbulence not so much what the objects themselves are.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:34.400
Then the promises of the thought is that going to quantum mechanical temperatures lower temperatures

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:42.320
where quantum mechanical vertices become manifest it would be easier to understand and it would

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.440
be easier to simulate on a computer it would be therefore lead us to understand that is

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:57.440
really of interest to us which is turbulence around us and inside us as well.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:06.680
And Enrico was so this quantum mechanical quantum vertices have been around us thoughts

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:12.000
for a long time fine one actually was the one who proposed the existence of this quantum

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
vertices and then there was some flurry of activity on this but nobody had seen these

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.560
vertices for a very long time.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.800
So my graduate student Greg Buelly was the first one who actually observed these vertices

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:36.560
and Enrico actually followed him and he made many improvements on how to visualize them

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.040
and then also interaction among the vertices which is the part that he was talking about

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040
earlier.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:50.000
Well I think we are going to open it up to questions from the audience and you could

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.320
step up to the microphone and say your name.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:06.440
Hi my name is William Grassy and I would like you to talk about fluid dynamic equations

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.800
and the different aspects of that.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:16.480
So it is heat and viscosity and pressure and what is fluid there are four things in the

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.240
velocity.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:27.680
So these are the equations that you are using to map out turbulence on an airplane wing

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.320
or whatever and they are nonlinear.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:43.200
My question is really can we think of those four dimensions of fluid dynamics metaphorically

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:53.680
in the sense that these are the components of creating turbulence in gases and liquids.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:59.000
Is there something, can we play with that metaphorically in thinking about art and the

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.760
creation of art?

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760
That is the question.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:02.760
So interesting question.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.760
That is a good question.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.760
That is a good question.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760
That is a good question.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760
You got Dana.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:13.560
So thinking about just to repeat the question.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:21.960
Can these equations for turbulence be metaphorically thought of as art or in art or?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:27.120
It could be emotion or it could be.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.920
That is a very good question.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.960
If you could do it for economics and in the market it could get very rich.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:47.520
Well there is an interesting art project in which some artists took the stock market

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:57.720
data and remapped it to a very believable mountain topography and they rendered it perfectly.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:58.720
Michael Najar.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720
Michael Najar.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:00.720
Yes.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:08.640
So they spatialized the information and these equations in a certain way.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:20.120
So I do think that there are opportunities to when these would spatialize the information

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:31.000
into some type of known representation so it could be landscapes or could be color or

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.880
could be many things.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.840
So there is endless opportunities and I guess that is a problem with art because there is

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.520
hundreds and hundreds of ways to look at it.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:48.520
But there is something that I think crosses over between the two and that might be showing

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.880
something that is invisible, bringing visibility to it.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.800
So I think that is where the metaphor would start for me at least if I was to look at

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.480
this and I was to look at turbulent flow over an airplane and I can look at what my

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.440
brother is doing or I can look at these.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.080
What I was excited about, I think what Enrico said about the tail switching.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.000
Can you say something about tail switching?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I mean just thinking about that that is crazy and wild and this kind of uniformity that

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.200
happens below this temperature and helium that Trini is mentioning.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:27.080
So there is so many ways to make this more visible in different ways.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.560
But the interesting thing about the piece out there is you can actually see it and it

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.960
is a camera.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:41.720
To take maybe a higher level of stab at your question like one of the things that I have

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:48.080
been working on a lot is problematizing this cultural moment that we live in where we sort

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.680
of live in the era of the quantified selfie.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.320
We have all these tools around us, around instrumenting our lives.

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.680
I have got five things on me that are measuring me right now.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.200
I have got my heart beat and how far I have walked.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.440
I have got this thing with all my email, all this stuff.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:16.520
And I think to Trini's point about these very simple interactions add up to things that

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.240
we can't predict.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.920
And that is a metaphor for humanity and life and all this stuff is something that I think

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:33.440
artists have this lens on that is worth valorizing and preserving the idea that it is complicated.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:40.720
I have a self-portrait that I made once where I took all of my email, so like about half

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.720
a million emails.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.200
And so every email I sent in like 20 years or something like that.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:53.120
And I took all the names everybody I have ever emailed with, stuck them in the middle

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.880
of a visualization.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:57.840
And it is called a force directed graph.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.760
I run a physics equation on it.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:05.720
I blow them all up and give everybody gravity based on how long they have been emailing each

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.000
other, how much they have been emailing each other.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.560
And then I would do sort of sentimental analysis on the name.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.280
So if I say I love you, you are heavier to me.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:20.000
And what happens is it ends up making this constellation of my life where there is this

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.040
main line complex and it is very messy.

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.440
Yeah, it looks like a big graph.

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.360
It looks like a big graph of everybody I ever talked to.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.280
And I hand wrote all the names.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.800
So it is not quite as digital as maybe I make it sound.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.440
But like that thing of these very simple things adding up to things that are really

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:43.440
complex can be.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:45.440
A little try to give you a higher answer.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.440
I would like to give a lower answer.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.560
Yeah, I mean, try anyhow.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.840
So I will interpret your question the following way.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.440
If you take a gas flow, gas has zillions of molecules.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.720
Zillions is not a word, but still.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:09.560
And so each molecule must have some effect on how the flow happens.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:15.120
But it just so happens for most purposes, you don't need all these zillion things.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:21.600
You only need as you said five variables, pressure, density, velocity, etc.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:30.760
And so in general, when you are looking at very multidimensional phenomena, it may very

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:34.880
well be that there are only a small number of things that are of interest and importance

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.880
for us.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.960
And that's what happens in fluids and that's what you said.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:49.440
So the question now is whether in other human endeavors, there may be many influences that

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.560
are happening on a thought or an object or a person, but really how many of them are

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.160
important.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:03.200
And if in fact this huge multidimensional space can somehow be reduced to a small number of

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.240
dimensions.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:12.360
Certainly in financial market, every investor, how he or she gets into the market, will have

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.040
some influence on the behavior of the stock market.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.760
But actually, maybe not all of them are important.

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.400
Maybe what happens to Apple may be much more important somehow.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.920
And so if you know a small number of things, it's conceivable that you can get, that's

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.760
the purpose of S&P and all these business, that's what they do.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:41.560
So you might ask therefore an artist when she works on something, whether the multitude

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:48.560
of influences that you think will influence production of an art, are they really important?

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:57.680
Are the multitude of thoughts that happen inside the brain, inside our own world?

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.040
Will all of them matter?

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:05.160
Probably in some way, every little thing will have some little effect.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:12.160
But is it only that there are five or ten or whatever variables that really control what

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160
happens?

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:19.080
It may be as you said, Luke, it may be the technology of the moment, it may be the cultural

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.760
background, it may be the political environment in which you live.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.640
I don't know, I mean are you up-bringing or the tensions that you had when you were a

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.640
child?

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.640
Maybe there are only a small number of things like that.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.440
And that would be interesting to explore.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:39.360
Of course I don't know the answer, but I really like the question.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.840
I simply elaborated my understanding of what you said.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:55.680
I'm on painters, so I don't have as much background in science, but I felt that painting

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.160
or art was a little bit minimized here in its methodology.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.320
And I've spoken before and probably have said some demon things like that word beauty has

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.000
to be reconsidered, how it's spoken about.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.160
Because for the most part, when you read artist's writings, they don't say I'm working toward

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.160
beauty.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.960
This is not what they say their motive is.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.000
And so what then is the artist trying to do?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.440
And there were some topics that came up that began to touch on it, like subjective and

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.520
objective.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.360
The relationship of science to the subjective and objective.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:35.040
The relationship of art is a little different.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.760
Now science you mentioned has constraints, and I like that.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.080
But so do the arts.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.040
They have languages.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:47.120
And languages change, they're complex, but they still have some constriction.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.480
And so if you think about painting, for instance, they've dealt with these issues, but in a

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.760
very different way, space and time, for instance.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:00.200
The futurists were very interested in the concept of time.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.920
The cubists were interested in space.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.720
And so within that framework, they try to devise a language.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.480
Things are more complex today.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.600
And art is really not the thing in itself.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:21.320
It is a building block, just like sciences, toward a relationship between the self and

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.280
the outer world.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.320
And to define how science says that is where the difference lies.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:32.320
What is the relationship between a scientist and the outer world, the subjective and the

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.360
objective, and what is it in the artist?

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.520
And the artist is an individualist.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.440
The scientist is too, but in a different way.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:46.720
I mean, Cezanne said I'm just a link in the long chain of development of my spatial concepts,

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.240
my way of creating a landscape.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.240
Oops.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:57.720
Anyway, I just want to speak up a little bit for the arts, because it's a very complex

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
art.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.880
Can you tell us what you tried to do as an artist?

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.480
Well, I can't.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.560
People say, oh, East to me, are you realist or abstract?

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.880
And I find those questions ridiculous.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:16.960
I am interested in states of mind.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:22.000
And De Currico spoke about it, and he called it shtimmung.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.040
And in Indian music, they have ragas and things.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.400
But states of mind, I don't know, maybe it's more in the realm of study of the mind.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.680
I don't know quite how in science you would deal with such a factor.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:44.280
But I'm interested in states of mind and ways to, I consider myself a poet painter.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:51.200
So I'm interested in words as equivalents in shapes and forms, the way a poet would be.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.360
All right, that's fine.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:58.200
But I do feel that there needs to be a lot more bridges today.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.840
There were bridges in the Renaissance, but there needs to be a lot more bridges today

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.840
about the complexity of the problem.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.960
And it can be discussed, but it's very difficult because we have to get a language set up for

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.960
that.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.280
So I'm not sure what's going on today.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.880
There are so many pictorial languages existing.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.520
There are so many varieties of what art is today.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.600
It's extended beyond the canvas into the space you live in.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:33.040
I mean, it has ranged all over so we no longer can speak that there's only painting and someone

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.440
will be doing a performance and they'll say that's an artist.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.720
So we have a lot of, it's a vast topic.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.120
Now in science, I don't know if you have the equivalents.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:48.520
It's the same, but it has spread so much that one part of the, one group of scientists can't

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.400
relate to the other group.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.440
But once in a while something happens in science.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.680
That is a concept arises and it will collapse a number of things which seem so disparate

01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.960
in the beginning.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.640
And now they are all sort of talking about the same.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.400
In art, I don't know if that happens.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.720
I totally agree with you what you said that it has become very much.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.520
I think the idea of turbulence.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.920
I think fixed form is a problem both in the visual world probably and in some way in the

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.480
sciences.

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:28.680
And I think artists are struggling with what, you know, form in forms in space and the

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.360
irrational elements and the unknown elements.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.680
And there's a lot of, well it started really with abstract expression is to try and explore

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.480
the inner life and try and explore the inner life.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:45.200
They got into a spatial realm that was also undefined in terms.

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:51.520
So I think the languages are, you know, what you just said, it's whether we'll find a universal

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.520
language.

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.520
I don't know if we want to.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.640
I think the excitement in art is the X factor in which you don't know if you want to find

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.200
the answer to X but it's the journey that's important.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.800
And I think artists are very involved with journey more than anything.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:05.800
Yeah.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800
Thank you.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.400
We would say the same too.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:16.000
It's not being there but the process, the becoming, becoming instead of being there is

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.280
really the essence of science actually.

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.520
That's very much the contemporary world.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.840
The journey and the, and yes, very much.

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.840
Thank you.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
Thank you for your very interesting comment.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.840
Hi.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:47.560
So I teach English at high school level.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:56.440
And so one of the things that teaching in terms of two courses I'm teaching, both pretty

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:06.160
much dealing with sort of like the idea of like what is art in terms of like something's

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:07.520
going to ask a question.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:15.800
Isn't the job of both science and art to alert us to alert us and extend our understanding

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.520
of meaning?

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.800
And then thinking of meaning in terms of like what is the archetypal?

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:28.160
You know, that extends beyond time and space.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:34.920
And then how does the archetypal extend to our current collective unconscious or the

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.720
current zeitgeist?

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.160
One of the things I was thinking about, like when you guys were talking about turbulence

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:50.520
and if you can speak more into this, isn't our understanding of sort of what is chaos

01:27:50.520 --> 01:28:00.040
or what is turbulence or what is sort of even confusing?

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:10.520
Just sort of where we are at the moment, you know, and isn't that sort of understanding

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:16.840
of like, I was looking at my notes here.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:22.720
The idea of like complexity of modernity, the same thing in the sense that like complexity

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:29.320
is, modernity is always moving and therefore complexity is always moving and therefore

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:37.200
like what we don't understand and what we come to understand is also always moving.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:47.000
Any takers?

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.720
I'm not sure exactly what you were asking.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.080
Are you saying actually?

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:07.120
So in chaos, what happens is you start with certain types of initial conditions that is

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.920
you know one is born in certain way, once color is that etc.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:20.600
But all of them gets forgotten in a certain sharp period of time.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:26.520
That's the essence of chaos that is initial conditions get forgotten and the evolution

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:34.080
really leads you so far away from where you started that it doesn't matter.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.840
And then you have the complexity.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:44.160
The complexity comes in by the interplay of this forgetting about initial conditions

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.760
and the relation to relation of that to the environment.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:55.440
So I think we are talking about words roughly the same meaning although it's not entirely

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.940
obvious.

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:03.160
So now after that I last track of your thread and thread of your question.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:10.160
So please repeat it for us.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:17.160
I think we are talking about the sort of pursuit of understanding.

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:35.680
It seems like the forum is trying to deal with what is this sort of link between art and

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.680
science.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:31:03.080
And it seems to me that sort of the sort of the pursuit of the sort of the artist is

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:08.160
to sort of capture the current moment.

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:15.920
Like the artist as an English teacher I teach that Mary Shelley is as a 16 year old sitting

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:24.080
down and capturing the industrial revolution through Frankenstein.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:29.560
And you have all of these artists over the point who are sort of capturing our current

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:34.280
understanding but it's so complex.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:42.600
And also like science kind of it seems to me that the scientist does that as well.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.080
Like they only work to sort of like come from T.S. Eliot.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.560
Like I can only work from the school of English that I built up to this point.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.800
It seems the same for the science.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:00.360
I think your question is so large that it might be something that you can also maybe

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.840
you know address after the.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:04.840
Can I make a quick response?

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:13.120
So I think we would all agree that there is this challenge of anyone working in areas

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:18.160
which are trying to achieve understanding of healing for example with this very complex

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.880
world we're in.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:24.360
And Professor Shrinivasan was pointing out some similarities between art and science.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.280
So I would like to add to that some important differences between art and science.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.120
And that one of them is the one concept of one truth.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.920
This came up actually just before we met with Rob because he in psychoanalytics they allow

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.400
for multiple truths.

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.840
Some people laugh at that.

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.880
Thank you.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880
Thank you.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:58.120
It's a defining quality of most of modern science that we only allow one truth.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:03.160
And so a proposition is either right or wrong.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.120
And we work very hard to show it's right.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:09.040
Well actually people propose things and everyone tries to show they're wrong.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:12.920
But in the process you've been often create new things that are slightly different that

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.680
will withstand all the attacks.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.800
And that concept of having one truth I don't think really has a parallel in art.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:27.000
And many people think that the ability of science to make progress, most of our modern

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.720
technology comes from that method of reasoning of thinking that the world is one way and

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.360
that we must prove things.

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.280
And so it's a very different way of thinking and working.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.280
Thank you.

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.080
Is it one of the things for example when I teach post-modernism?

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:53.440
I talk about the fact that my senior essay question was sort of-

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.680
I'm sorry.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:03.640
So one of the senior questions for this year was like charts the death of the progress

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:11.240
towards the death of the meta-narrative from the classic period to the post-modern period.

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:20.520
And so with post-modernity we had that sort of at this point questioning of this idea

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.680
of the ultimate truth, like the meta-narrative.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:30.800
And it seems that with science, because we talked about the fact of the Copernican papers

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:40.960
which were published and then 200 years under the pope until finally released.

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:48.360
And even with science you had this sort of constant challenging of, you know, like with

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:53.400
Einstein challenging Newton and all these other things, right?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.400
Thank you.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:55.400
Yeah.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.040
We can continue the discussion after I want to just leave time for other people to ask

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.640
questions anyone has.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:10.200
Hello, I'm Bob Lang and I'm a psychoanalyst with the White Institute.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.640
And I'd like to go back to the Euler formula which I had never seen before.

01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.520
So you showed that, you said how beautiful it was.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.320
It's very beautiful too.

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:26.360
I didn't understand the item with all of the exponents and so on.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:30.920
But that plus one equals zero.

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.440
So it's an equation.

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:40.080
You take away one from the left side and take it away from the right side and you have the

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.080
exponents equal zero minus one.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:51.200
Now mathematically of course you ignore the zero, but you can also pause and ask that

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.200
question, how can you take one away from nothing?

01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.600
How can nothing have anything to take away from it, right?

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:07.320
And what this brought to mind in relation to the rest of the topic about turbulence and

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:16.480
how things change was the heart sutra in Buddhism which essentially is emptiness form.

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.840
Form is emptiness, a big paradox, right?

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.520
How can form be emptiness and emptiness form?

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:28.600
Well, you know, I think a related aspect of this is impermanence.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.080
Everything is changing all the time.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.920
That it's not just the breath forming that weird shape.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:39.600
It's the clouds of our thoughts appearing and disappearing just like that.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.240
It's our bodies going.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.240
You know, it all depends really the dimension I think that was left out or not emphasized

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.240
so much as time.

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:52.440
You know, if you speed up the clock, everything's gone before you know it and you slow it down

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:57.760
and it seems like we're here, you know, with a certain degree of constancy.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.560
But everything is affecting everything else.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.640
There's the Brownian motion of every of the molecules in our ears.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.960
Everything is disappearing while it's reappearing.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.280
Creation, you know, it's like at the quantum level too.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.840
Things are here and then they're gone and then, you know, are there gone and they're

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.120
not gone and they're here and they're here.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:23.240
So I think there's something that's actually almost universal about chaos and the turbulence

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:29.560
of existence that gets touched on with this.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:37.120
And I wonder actually if the emptiness is formed, form emptiness seems relevant to any

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.000
of you in this regard.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Yeah.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:50.320
This duality is not only prevalent in Buddhism and Hinduism and things like that, but also

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320
in physics.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:38:00.280
If you take a photon, which is the source of light, is it a particle or is it a wave?

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:03.440
It's a particle sometimes, it's a wave sometimes.

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:11.160
So I think all of these things come because we are trying to describe nature which we

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.560
really don't understand that well.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.080
And we have a certain language, we have a certain framework within which we have tried

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:24.480
to describe them and it's always inadequate, especially in the context you said, you know,

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.360
voice doesn't reach there, your eyesight doesn't reach there, you don't know what your, you,

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.520
I mean by you I don't mean you particularly.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.640
We don't know really what reality is like.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:43.240
We only have an image of reality and we construct that image through a language that we have,

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.880
we are aware of.

01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:50.960
And this language is totally inadequate when you go very deep and I think the example you

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.760
gave is one of them in my opinion.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:59.040
We just don't really know what the reality is.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.040
Thank you.

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.200
That's a good place to be.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
Any other questions?

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.400
This will be our last question.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:17.880
I was listening to this conversation and I think like a little bit like the discussion

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:26.880
was down to human beings and art I believe are regulated by something that we call conscience.

01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:33.560
So we are aware of ourself, what we say our thoughts even if we don't control them.

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:42.240
While in nature in physics we assume that like there is not a reading is more objective.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:50.040
Yes, we are traditional image of science is more objective is not related to that subjectivity.

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.680
So what is the situation?

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.840
Are we looking at science as an objective science while in reality there is like a huge

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:08.880
subjective part or our thoughts, our processes are instead controlled by science and so doesn't

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.360
exist the conscience is just like our illusion.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.440
Some of us work in brain science.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.240
It gets murkier.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.440
No, of course.

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:22.800
I was like not using the right term.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:32.360
So part one can take situations in physics that seem very objective and black and white

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.920
and then you can get situations in physics that are become harder to describe and we

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.080
touched on some of those.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:45.680
But you can go into biology and you can say okay we are going to use magnetic resonance

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:53.080
image and we are going to induce oscillations in the molecules and see what kind of radio

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.880
ways we get out and from that we will be able to draw a picture of the brain and then we

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:03.760
can see how brain activity modifies that and we get these patterns out we start making.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.720
But actually if you are interested in understanding human experience you still have to talk to

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.560
the people and ask them what they felt.

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:17.400
So some people are very interested in finding what parts of the brain are most active when

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:22.480
we have the experience of beauty and there is some argument about that.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:33.520
And so one can develop rigorous methods that we use to try and draw inferences about perception

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:37.600
based on subjective reports of participants.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.880
So I do that every day in my lab.

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:44.360
And it is pretty rigorous.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.760
Color vision is pretty well established now and we understand that color vision is the

01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:52.840
three dimensional space.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.840
And some people work on consciousness I happen not to.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:03.080
But it is obviously an important phenomena in our lives.

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:09.200
But I am not sure that it really raises that much of a philosophical problem.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.400
In my work environment it is a technical issue.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.400
Consciousness gets slippery.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.880
The first time you ask someone to ask you whether something is conscious it seems like

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.080
a clear question.

01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.000
The tenth time it is asked it starts to seem like a weird philosophical question does

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
have a clear answer.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.360
If I understand what you are saying related to my question it is like that individuality

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:42.440
doesn't exist because it happened at some point the number of molecules united in a

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:50.400
certain form and processes a certain number of electric steam away the generate heart.

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.400
What we call art.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:58.880
And it is not related to any subjective unique essence of that human being.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.960
I am not sure that follows.

01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:15.960
If you take similar constituent elements but they interact in different ways you will get

01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.760
a different outcome.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.920
The best may be the same but you will get a different outcome.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:28.920
The essence of the question you asked it seems to me was you are saying in science there

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:32.920
is a clear distinction between the observer and the observed.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.680
Where is in art that is not.

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:40.040
In fact it is the mixture of the two that makes it all the same.

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.920
But your answer quite rightly was you know what at one time seemed very subjective can

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:52.640
in fact be formulated now in a more objective where what appears to be more augutive.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.800
There are still some issues that you cannot tackle but maybe we will make more progress

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:05.800
and so the real answer is maybe there is this distinction maybe that is because we don't

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:12.080
understand it well enough maybe you are right who knows I don't know the answer but I think

01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.120
we are making progress in trying to link the two.

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:17.280
That is how I see it anyhow.

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:23.680
As an artist I have kind of worked through kind of oscillating between objective, subjective

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.800
my own conscious experience.

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.120
So for example I have this one piece that is about an earthquake.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:35.760
I was in the Tohoku earthquake in Japan and I felt it with my body.

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:41.360
I wanted to make a work about it because it was an experience that was unforgettable and

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.440
it was very personal.

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:50.240
My first instinct was go find the data in Shinjuku where I was find the sensor and try

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.800
to look at that data in a bunch of different ways to understand the movement again.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:02.240
So I probably made like 20 to 30 experiments in different software, animating cameras,

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:09.200
animating particles, taking the XYZ data, looking at it just as a typical seismic reading

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:15.920
and I finally realized that it was movement over time so I was able to generate a curve,

01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:21.920
like a really dense curve and almost looked like at the molecular level like a bomb.

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:28.440
It was terrifying to look at but it still was distilled and it was still the data that

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.440
was ruling.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.320
So I needed to rip that back into a subjective experience again even though the data was

01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.600
objective at this point it had been removed.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:43.600
I brought it back and I did a gestural painting of what I saw in the data so it was like this

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:48.200
kind of oscillation between, so that's something I'm dealing with all the time is someone making

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.040
work trying to solve that and I don't think ever will but it's a really enjoyable space

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.840
to work through this kind of oscillation between subjective, objective, personal, looking at

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:05.440
something at the way a machine would look at it but that can never replace what it felt

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:08.600
like.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:15.000
Well on that note we'll have to leave things with some, the beauty of some of these uncertainties

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.440
which make them perhaps all the more beautiful.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.800
I want to ask you to join me in thanking our participants.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.360
Thank you Luke, Dana, extremely.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:34.440
Dennis and especially Enrico who spearheaded the organization of this event and thank you

01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:35.440
so much.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.440
Thank you for hosting us.

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:37.440
Thank you.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.440
Thank you.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:47:04.440
Thank you.
