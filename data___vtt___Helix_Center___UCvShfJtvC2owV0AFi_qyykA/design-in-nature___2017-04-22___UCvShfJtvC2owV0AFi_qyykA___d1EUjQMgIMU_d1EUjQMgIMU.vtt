00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Have you done one of these people?

00:02.640 --> 00:03.640
No.

00:03.640 --> 00:04.800
How about you?

00:04.800 --> 00:06.920
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:06.920 --> 00:07.520
Welcome.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.240
I'm Rob Penzer.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.560
I'm the Associate Director of the Heelics Center.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.200
I have an announcement for an upcoming roundtable

00:14.200 --> 00:17.760
on Saturday, May 20th on complexity and emergence.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.120
It's the second of our roundtables on the subject,

00:21.120 --> 00:25.200
called Visions of Cosmic Order from Particles to People.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.680
And our discussants will be William Grassi, who's

00:27.680 --> 00:31.520
the founder of Metanexis, David Grinspoon, senior scientist

00:31.520 --> 00:33.840
at the Planetary Science Institute,

00:33.840 --> 00:35.600
Iliya Tampkin, Professor of Biology

00:35.600 --> 00:37.280
at Northern Virginia Community College

00:37.280 --> 00:39.480
and Research Associate at the National Museum

00:39.480 --> 00:42.800
of Natural History, and Tyler Volk, Professor of Biology

00:42.800 --> 00:45.600
and Environmental Studies at NYU.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.480
So today's topic, Design and Nature,

00:48.480 --> 00:50.840
let me introduce our participants today.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.480
And when I announce your name, if you can raise your hand.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.960
Elizabeth Alter.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.280
Adrian Bejan.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.480
Robin Collins.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.240
Mark Norel.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.240
And Caleb Scharf.

01:05.240 --> 01:09.200
And without further ado, I turn this over to our participants.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.320
You look at him.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
OK.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.320
Well, I get to talk about design and nature.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.520
And design and nature has always been one of these things

01:22.520 --> 01:26.400
that people have questioned since the origins of modern science,

01:26.400 --> 01:27.920
especially in Western Europe, in terms

01:27.920 --> 01:30.200
with the origin of the enlightening.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.760
And design and nature can be boiled down

01:33.760 --> 01:34.960
into two different things.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.600
One, is there a creator?

01:36.600 --> 01:39.720
Is there some intelligent being who

01:39.720 --> 01:41.400
figured all this stuff out?

01:41.400 --> 01:44.280
Or are we just the products of physical constraint?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.360
I mean, is it the reason that knees look like hinges

01:46.360 --> 01:48.200
is because that's the way it works?

01:48.200 --> 01:51.800
Is the reason that we have so many

01:51.800 --> 01:53.920
of the same kinds of eyes and everything

01:53.920 --> 01:57.000
from giant squids to ourselves?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.320
Is that just because of things that

01:59.320 --> 02:03.600
are embedded within our developmental patterns in our DNA

02:03.600 --> 02:08.440
and with evolution being an optimizing process,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.080
that that's just what ends up under different selective

02:11.080 --> 02:12.080
regimes.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.360
So this has always been two different kinds of things

02:14.360 --> 02:16.880
which people have looked at myself.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.040
I'm more on the kind of just replicating piece of DNA.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.560
And this is just the way that it works out as far as

02:22.560 --> 02:26.960
the way that we deal with the world either through constraint.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.560
When I say constraint, I see that it

02:28.560 --> 02:30.960
through physical constraints from the external part

02:30.960 --> 02:33.680
or through constraints just on the basis of what

02:33.680 --> 02:35.760
that our genetic material is possible

02:35.760 --> 02:39.800
to be able to do within certain kinds of things

02:39.800 --> 02:41.800
along with our developmental channeling.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.520
But some other people have some different opinions.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.520
So let's open it up.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.800
I would see that as not you kind of painted those two

02:49.800 --> 02:52.800
as confouries, but you might ask about the constraints

02:52.800 --> 02:57.280
themselves whether there's a design-like pattern

02:57.280 --> 02:59.600
in those constraints.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.240
And so you could have it and you have

03:02.240 --> 03:05.120
to look at physical reality in different levels.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.720
You've got the biological level down to the chemical level.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.800
And the biological level seems to be, at least,

03:11.800 --> 03:16.400
a lot of accidents seems to be one of the governing

03:16.400 --> 03:17.080
principles.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.080
But when you get all the way down to, let's say,

03:19.080 --> 03:21.760
the physical level, that's where I think a real big question

03:21.760 --> 03:23.040
comes in.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.000
To what degree does that look random,

03:25.000 --> 03:30.120
or is that have a design-like character?

03:30.120 --> 03:32.680
And by design in a very general sense,

03:32.680 --> 03:37.480
I would say that the parts, so you can invoke a crater,

03:37.480 --> 03:39.580
but I think there's even a more general sense in which

03:39.580 --> 03:42.880
the parts are arranged in some intricate way

03:42.880 --> 03:46.240
so that they realize some easily recognizable

03:46.240 --> 03:48.600
overall property.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.280
And so in the case of, like, I work in the area,

03:51.280 --> 03:53.920
fine-tuning of the cosmos for life,

03:53.920 --> 03:58.840
and so there, things do seem to be extremely well-adjusted

03:58.840 --> 04:01.840
so that life can exist.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.840
I disagree.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.840
I'll go ahead.

04:04.840 --> 04:05.840
Go ahead.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.840
You go ahead.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.840
Come back.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.280
Well, I get the thing.

04:12.280 --> 04:17.600
I know this understanding of design as you stated it,

04:17.600 --> 04:22.760
but it is a novelty because English is, in fact,

04:22.760 --> 04:26.120
a very, very young language.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.640
Design is a very old concept.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.120
The Council on Latin, the word signal means sign.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.560
It is something that's discernible,

04:36.560 --> 04:38.760
meaning to us, the observers.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.480
And this observation, the sign, conveys a message,

04:43.480 --> 04:47.800
which if followed, it means that it's useful to us.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.480
Engineering, which is my education, comes from that.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.960
It is about, OK, making better drawings.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.880
And so that's design.

04:58.880 --> 05:03.280
And where the image comes from, for example,

05:03.280 --> 05:07.600
the shape of a leaf or the bend in a river,

05:07.600 --> 05:09.760
is the observation.

05:09.760 --> 05:15.520
Has nothing to do with who made that?

05:15.520 --> 05:20.240
It is all about the observer getting the idea

05:20.240 --> 05:22.080
that that observation is useful.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.520
So that the observer with it, with the observation,

05:24.520 --> 05:28.600
and with the artifact that comes from doing something,

05:28.600 --> 05:31.480
acting, based on that observation,

05:31.480 --> 05:38.360
the observer becomes a more empowered mover of itself

05:38.360 --> 05:41.920
or himself on the landscape.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.680
So that's design.

05:43.680 --> 05:49.160
And so design is one of the most universal phenomena,

05:49.160 --> 05:55.760
the most universal phenomenon of value to us that exists.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.840
It's right there, or down there with gravity,

05:58.840 --> 06:03.960
and with the irreversibility, the second law of dynamics.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.640
That is design.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.960
I agree with that entirely, but isn't that a lot,

06:05.960 --> 06:09.160
because of its just constraint, that there's physical constraints?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.040
Quite the opposite.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.280
It's about freedom, not constraints,

06:12.280 --> 06:13.480
without freedom.

06:13.480 --> 06:20.440
On the contrary, without freedom, there's no discernible image,

06:20.440 --> 06:24.240
no change in that image, no evolution.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.280
And I think it speaks to this better than anyone,

06:26.280 --> 06:28.920
because certainly, there is constraint

06:28.920 --> 06:30.640
within the physical world, and stuff,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.960
of what organisms are capable of doing

06:33.960 --> 06:35.120
and not capable of doing.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.120
Sure.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.640
I mean, the classic example of this

06:38.640 --> 06:42.600
is the laryngeal nerve in the giraffe,

06:42.600 --> 06:47.360
which this is a sort of a case study in evolutionary biology.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.240
The laryngeal nerve in the giraffe branches off

06:50.240 --> 06:54.760
the vagus nerve in the brain, travels all the way down

06:54.760 --> 06:56.240
through some arteries in the heart,

06:56.240 --> 06:58.200
and then back up the neck of the giraffe,

06:58.200 --> 07:00.720
where it innervates the larynx.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.280
Why would it travel all that way down and all the way back?

07:03.280 --> 07:05.520
Well, it's just because of the constraint

07:05.520 --> 07:06.800
from its ancestors.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.480
So that design, if you could call it that,

07:09.480 --> 07:14.400
evolved in our fish ancestors, and that constraint,

07:14.400 --> 07:16.560
that physiological constraint remains in the giraffe,

07:16.560 --> 07:21.400
even though it causes this bizarre morphology.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.400
One of the, I think when you're speaking about freedom

07:25.400 --> 07:31.360
that comes as part of design, and as an evolutionary genomist,

07:31.360 --> 07:34.560
I think of that as variation, the raw variation,

07:34.560 --> 07:38.120
that is necessary for adaptation.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.880
And I think one of the interesting aspects

07:42.880 --> 07:47.840
to consider when we think about nature

07:47.840 --> 07:52.920
and whether, as the da Vinci quote that we were provided with,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.880
suggests that nothing is extra in nature

07:55.880 --> 07:59.520
because it's so finely designed for its environs.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.400
If we look at the genome, say the human genome,

08:02.400 --> 08:05.120
3 billion base pairs, 50% of that,

08:05.120 --> 08:10.840
fully 50% of that is repetitive DNA with no known purpose.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.000
So there's a lot of extra stuff out there in nature.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.440
And surely it's shaped by constraint,

08:17.440 --> 08:21.400
but it's that variation that allows freedom to adapt.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.600
I think there's one we have, but we haven't spoken.

08:25.600 --> 08:30.360
So I'm just biting my time.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.120
Well, maybe just to, so I'm trying to understand

08:34.120 --> 08:36.400
when you talk about freedom.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
So I guess, you know, I come out of physics.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.800
And so to me, all that we're talking about here

08:43.800 --> 08:47.080
and what you've talked about, what you've talked about is,

08:47.080 --> 08:51.720
you know, boils down to, well, the constraints,

08:51.720 --> 08:57.400
there are constraints of, I don't want to use the word design.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.480
Wow, that's terrible.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.760
I don't want to use the word design.

09:00.760 --> 09:05.600
Everything is finding its way through a complex energy landscape.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.760
I mean, as a physicist, we always resort to this.

09:08.760 --> 09:14.800
We always say, well, it's all about finding free energy to do work.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.160
So our molecules are doing that all the time.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.560
Our DNA is doing all that all the time.

09:19.560 --> 09:24.120
It's the root of biological evolution at some level.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.960
It is these organisms there.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.720
They're exploring this vast chemical landscape

09:28.720 --> 09:32.200
and where there is opportunity to extract free energy and do

09:32.200 --> 09:33.920
work, it will happen.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.760
And why is that?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.000
Because the whole universe is driven

09:37.000 --> 09:40.560
towards dissipation of energy, right?

09:40.560 --> 09:43.880
And moving towards a higher entropy state.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.680
And so I guess, is that the freedom that you see

09:47.680 --> 09:52.240
is this vast energy landscape that everything

09:52.240 --> 09:54.560
from the river to the molecule is exploring?

09:54.560 --> 09:59.320
I will, OK, since I like that you stick the language

09:59.320 --> 10:00.720
of thermodynamics.

10:00.720 --> 10:08.120
I'll try to make it more readable to everybody.

10:08.120 --> 10:14.640
The first of all, I like the title of your blog, Life Unbound It.

10:14.640 --> 10:18.200
Here's a comment on the so-called constraint.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.040
It does not exist, OK?

10:20.040 --> 10:27.600
There's the space is to be accessed by these flows

10:27.600 --> 10:28.400
that you bring up.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.360
The flows that are driven by the power

10:30.360 --> 10:31.960
that you bring up.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.120
The so-called free energy, a much better name for that

10:35.120 --> 10:40.280
is fuel or food for those of us who live on this planet,

10:40.280 --> 10:46.880
is converted into the power by engines.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.320
And most of the engines are natural, OK?

10:50.320 --> 10:54.760
Animals are basically engines on the tracks.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.720
And of course, we are now very likely

10:57.720 --> 11:03.720
to be riding on engines made by smarter humans

11:03.720 --> 11:07.080
20 years ago in Britain.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.880
And in propelling as much, much more cheaply.

11:10.880 --> 11:15.200
But the question that is not being addressed until now

11:15.200 --> 11:21.600
is, what is that power coming from the free energy useful

11:21.600 --> 11:23.320
for to what end?

11:23.320 --> 11:28.120
And the end is, for greater, easier movement,

11:28.120 --> 11:33.560
movement into this free space, NES, available time,

11:33.560 --> 11:38.680
because obviously here I speak autobiographically,

11:38.680 --> 11:40.480
I would like to live longer.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.880
And so I could move more easily all over

11:44.880 --> 11:47.840
and bring others along with me, you see?

11:47.840 --> 11:50.160
So that's the tendency.

11:50.160 --> 11:59.600
As Neil's board said, nature is about us.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.040
It's about what we say about nature.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.200
That's what's interesting.

12:06.200 --> 12:10.680
So that's the beginning of a more inclusive picture

12:10.680 --> 12:14.000
of the topic.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.560
I read parts of your book.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.280
And I had a question for you.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.440
The constructional laws that things constructive.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.600
Constructive.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.600
Constructive.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.400
If you can say fractal, OK?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.240
Constructal.

12:27.240 --> 12:28.400
It's constructed.

12:28.400 --> 12:33.000
So long is that things systems move towards more easier

12:33.000 --> 12:34.520
and easier flow.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.120
Use your greater access.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.400
I like to, yeah.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.720
So I mean, just a couple of really everyday examples.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.120
My drain gets plugged up.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.640
It seems like it's went from less easy flow

12:45.640 --> 12:49.360
for easy flow to less easy flow, or arteries get clogged.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.240
So how do you deal with examples like that?

12:52.240 --> 12:54.480
Those examples are very different.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.800
Your drain gets plugged up because your drain,

12:57.800 --> 13:00.480
the pipe is not natural.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.920
It is not free to morph, to morph,

13:04.920 --> 13:09.840
to live with the incidental blockage.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.680
The pipe is your artifact.

13:12.680 --> 13:17.000
The drain is you, you're the human and machine specimen.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.040
The river basin is the natural counterpart of your example.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.760
In the river basin, I grew up under Daniel.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.480
And I've been observing as a kid going fishing.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.920
The river basin gets the tree log out of the way.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.280
Tree logs do block the flow.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.760
It does the sunken ship.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.760
But the river, because it is free to morph,

13:40.760 --> 13:43.720
because it is alive, is a flow architecture,

13:43.720 --> 13:48.280
is a sign, is a thing that impresses you,

13:48.280 --> 13:53.320
has the natural, the intrinsic property

13:53.320 --> 13:56.280
of evolving to flow more easily.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.920
So what about arteries?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.400
Arrays?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.600
Yeah, like people.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.440
Same thing.

14:00.440 --> 14:05.040
The artery also does its best until it's old enough

14:05.040 --> 14:11.240
to split, to basically cause an aneurysm, to do all sorts of things.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.200
But it seems to have gone from when you're younger,

14:14.200 --> 14:17.120
your arteries are, there's more free flow.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.760
So the evolution there seems to be from more free flow to less.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.440
And that's what...

14:22.440 --> 14:25.680
No, no, the life of a human being is no devolution.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.680
It's called growth.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.480
Many people in science confuse the life of the individual

14:31.480 --> 14:34.040
with the evolution of the species.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.640
No, evolution is about the...

14:35.640 --> 14:37.160
Not sure we confuse it.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.920
That's what we think is.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.400
Right, it's part and parcel.

14:40.400 --> 14:45.680
A single organism is one instance out of a vast evolutionary landscape, right?

14:45.680 --> 14:46.880
And it's playing...

14:46.880 --> 14:48.680
So I hear...

14:48.680 --> 14:53.400
Are you suggesting that there's agency in a river or an arteries?

14:53.400 --> 14:54.600
I mean, that's the sort of...

14:54.600 --> 14:57.600
I hear that in the language, but I'm not sure that's what you're suggesting.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.040
What is your definition of agency?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.840
I mean, literally the dictionary definition of agency.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.160
Well, you don't know, I'm asking you.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.000
Are you saying...

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
No, I've used the word.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.160
Because here's the word.

15:08.160 --> 15:13.000
Is the river somehow deciding?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.360
No, no, agency doesn't mean that.

15:15.360 --> 15:20.240
Agency is essentially power.

15:20.240 --> 15:26.280
Power, which is that that makes action possible.

15:26.280 --> 15:32.560
Agency is not about the direction in which the design change

15:32.560 --> 15:35.760
happens because of the power that is used.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.000
The direction of the change in flow architecture,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.760
because of that power you brought up the engines earlier,

15:43.760 --> 15:46.920
that is actually the phenomenon of the evolution,

15:46.920 --> 15:53.240
which is of all physics, and which is summarized by the constructive law of physics,

15:53.240 --> 15:55.920
which is really the statement of everything that is...

15:55.920 --> 15:58.360
that is finite size, not the quirk,

15:58.360 --> 16:01.040
where you can tell some more invisible, finite size,

16:01.040 --> 16:04.560
including the solar cell bodies,

16:04.560 --> 16:06.320
has the...

16:06.320 --> 16:09.160
In order to persist, which is to...

16:09.160 --> 16:11.760
That means to live in physics,

16:11.760 --> 16:18.040
it must evolve freely, freely, toward greater access.

16:18.040 --> 16:24.480
Or in your example of the universe, toward the faster route to equilibrium,

16:24.480 --> 16:26.480
which means death.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.480
But why in a biological or an evolutionary context then?

16:29.480 --> 16:33.560
I mean, if you take it back to looking at how evolution works,

16:33.560 --> 16:36.960
why are there then unoccupied ecological spaces?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.440
Because it's that if you...

16:38.440 --> 16:41.280
I mean, we just did it for our students, we just did something

16:41.280 --> 16:43.160
for an exhibit that we want to do,

16:43.160 --> 16:46.560
and you can look at like a three-axis graph of...

16:46.560 --> 16:47.560
Of it?

16:47.560 --> 16:52.000
A three-axis projection of a bird egg, for instance,

16:52.000 --> 16:52.840
and you can...

16:52.840 --> 16:56.000
Like one axis is size, one axis is shape,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.920
and the other axis is color.

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
Okay.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.920
The third is what?

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
Color.

17:00.920 --> 17:01.920
Color.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.920
Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.400
And if you would look at it that from...

17:04.400 --> 17:07.280
It could say, yeah, you know, that evolution is a great optimizing thing,

17:07.280 --> 17:11.000
you would expect that the whole kind of thing would be filled in universally,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
but it's not.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.040
There's big, empty spaces in a lot of it.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
Right.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.040
Of where...

17:16.040 --> 17:17.040
Or just unoccupied ecological spaces.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.560
And that's just one example.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.160
I mean, people have recognized that for a long time,

17:21.160 --> 17:23.840
and then once in a while some major evolutionary event happens,

17:23.840 --> 17:29.000
I mean, previous to about 325 million years ago,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.160
there was nothing that weighed over 20...

17:33.160 --> 17:35.480
25, 30 grams that flew.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.400
And then all of a sudden is that flying reptiles,

17:38.400 --> 17:42.000
charasars evolved, and then also birds evolved,

17:42.000 --> 17:43.920
then later on.

17:43.920 --> 17:48.480
And then all of a sudden that was unoccupied ecological space

17:48.480 --> 17:50.640
that became filled in.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.840
And because of whatever happened, but nevertheless,

17:53.840 --> 17:56.800
is that it's very...

17:56.800 --> 17:58.760
It just doesn't go with this kind of thing,

17:58.760 --> 18:01.760
it is always just that this undercurrent of...

18:01.760 --> 18:05.600
I can respond to you by speaking a language that most people know,

18:05.600 --> 18:10.560
which is that of looking at the river basin morphology, the map.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.720
The wetland, the rain keeps falling, is wide open.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.280
By the river channels, fall hierarchical,

18:17.280 --> 18:19.800
happen only in the sun places.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.720
There is lots of space that's not invaded by...

18:22.720 --> 18:24.520
I mean, you call it design space.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
It were...

18:25.520 --> 18:28.480
Okay, for that my energy landscape.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.720
There are lots of...

18:29.720 --> 18:32.680
Most of it is actually not bathed.

18:32.680 --> 18:37.680
And the reason is that in order to bathe with flow,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.760
an area or a volume, the easiest,

18:40.760 --> 18:44.400
meaning the greatest access to the entire space

18:44.400 --> 18:46.600
is offered by a vasculature.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.440
A vasculature.

18:47.440 --> 18:51.840
This is why all these things that come up are happening.

18:51.840 --> 18:57.840
You mentioned repetitive DNA in this theoretical infinity,

18:57.840 --> 19:01.920
infinite space of DNA combinations.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.600
The reason is that all DNA is not equal,

19:06.600 --> 19:08.840
just like the words in a language.

19:08.840 --> 19:13.680
Most of us speak basically hierarchy of words.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.880
All of them, very few.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.880
It's much smaller than the number than the main vocabulary.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.720
Because that is the way to speak easiest

19:22.720 --> 19:27.160
and the way to communicate with everybody else the fastest.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.440
So you talk about these things that look the same,

19:30.440 --> 19:32.520
that have two eyes, well, they had no eyes

19:32.520 --> 19:35.440
before the Cambrian explosion.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.280
But then...

19:36.280 --> 19:38.960
But they're still limited by like the Aristingular history.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.240
Is it all why I've said it from a common ancestor?

19:41.240 --> 19:42.840
So we're stuck with that.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.440
But let me just say one more thing, which is the punchline.

19:45.440 --> 19:50.080
So when the eye occurred, obviously two eyes were better

19:50.080 --> 19:51.760
because the world is flat.

19:51.760 --> 19:56.760
These beings were perceiving the ambient, which is flat.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.760
The two eyes were oriented this way, not this way.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.760
And that's right.

20:03.760 --> 20:10.760
And as soon as that happened, movement became immensely easier,

20:10.760 --> 20:16.760
easier, safer, farther, just like after the invention of radar

20:16.760 --> 20:19.760
in military aviation.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.760
And so that's why you talked about the nature of optimizing things.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.760
That's why this trade stayed.

20:27.760 --> 20:32.760
The traits that are in fact inferior to existing alternatives

20:32.760 --> 20:33.760
do not stay.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.760
What works is kept.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.760
That's evolution.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.760
And it's a random up to a point.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
That's kind of weird, Bill.

20:42.760 --> 20:46.760
I find it a lot, I mean, you know, not an example.

20:46.760 --> 20:47.760
You know, why are the...

20:47.760 --> 20:48.760
I mean, we had...

20:48.760 --> 20:51.760
It was bilateral symmetry in organisms, I think,

20:51.760 --> 20:53.760
before complex eyes evolved.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.760
I mean, there are other reasons for that.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.760
I'm not an expert in evolution, but...

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Well, I mean, like, you know...

21:02.760 --> 21:06.760
Yeah, in terms of the repetitive DNA,

21:06.760 --> 21:09.760
talking about the reason that exists in the genome,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.760
certainly not all organisms have the degree of repetitive DNA

21:12.760 --> 21:17.760
that mammals have, but it's thought that that's the result of

21:17.760 --> 21:20.760
viral elements, viral DNA that, you know,

21:20.760 --> 21:24.760
that actually come and insert genomic elements

21:24.760 --> 21:26.760
that will copy DNA over and over,

21:26.760 --> 21:28.760
and that's what they do for a living.

21:28.760 --> 21:32.760
So, viral infection into your genome can result in many of those events.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.760
So, you know, I think most people consider that to be a random process.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.760
Yeah, I mean, like birds, when it's since have tiny genomes

21:41.760 --> 21:44.760
compared to mammals, and their ancestors' crocodiles have genomes,

21:44.760 --> 21:48.760
which are not ancestors, but the closest living group to them

21:48.760 --> 21:51.760
have genomes, which are far larger than birds are.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.760
Look, there is the river basin that has no genome,

21:54.760 --> 21:57.760
yet it looks just like the human lung, okay?

21:57.760 --> 21:59.760
Yeah, but that's not a consequence.

21:59.760 --> 22:03.760
That's nothing to do with it, because it's like that it doesn't have a singular history.

22:03.760 --> 22:07.760
It's not related to every other river basin in the planet.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.760
I think that's an example of...

22:09.760 --> 22:13.760
So, people who study complex systems are always talking,

22:13.760 --> 22:16.760
I'm sure you know this, that talk about scaling laws,

22:16.760 --> 22:19.760
for example, that exist across all sorts of things.

22:19.760 --> 22:25.760
So, there are scaling laws in biology between body mass and metabolism, right?

22:25.760 --> 22:29.760
And it's across all organisms, and it's probably it's a result of some

22:29.760 --> 22:33.760
approximate optimization process, but it's still playing out

22:33.760 --> 22:35.760
over billions of years of evolution.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.760
It's the same scaling law that exists in language.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.760
It's called the Zip Law, right?

22:41.760 --> 22:45.760
It's the word use frequency versus, you know,

22:45.760 --> 22:47.760
the...

22:47.760 --> 22:49.760
So, you know, these are all...

22:49.760 --> 22:52.760
I think as a physicist, I would say that a lot of what you're talking about,

22:52.760 --> 22:56.760
the rivers and so on, yes, there are similarities to biological systems,

22:56.760 --> 22:59.760
but they're for slightly different reasons.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.760
They're not because of inherited traits, right?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.760
They're because of...

23:05.760 --> 23:09.760
And this perhaps gets back to the universal idea of design,

23:09.760 --> 23:14.760
that there are these emergent scaling laws, these emergent relationships,

23:14.760 --> 23:22.760
because of the underlying nature of systems driven by, you know,

23:22.760 --> 23:25.760
finding their way through some energy landscape of optimization,

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
of efficiency and so on, right?

23:27.760 --> 23:28.760
I mean, the same...

23:28.760 --> 23:32.760
I think these scaling rules also apply to a circulatory system, right?

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
Right.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.760
And things like the species area curve, how many species you find in, you know,

23:36.760 --> 23:39.760
one square meter versus 100 square meters?

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
Right.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.760
Let me try to clarify the words we speak.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.760
These scaling laws that you mentioned are not laws of physics.

23:48.760 --> 23:53.760
They are compact mathematical summaries, also known as correlations,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.760
of observations.

23:55.760 --> 24:00.760
The law of physics is the purely mental viewing that empowers one to predict

24:00.760 --> 24:02.760
such correlations.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
And that is what I do.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.760
And along the way, what I predict is not only the correlations,

24:08.760 --> 24:12.760
and all these things you bring up, including zips,

24:12.760 --> 24:17.760
I predict why, at one point, the so-called correlation should break down,

24:17.760 --> 24:22.760
because, yes, there is a scaling law to the many, many ramifications

24:22.760 --> 24:29.760
in the human life, but with a constructive law, I predict that the cutoff should be 23

24:29.760 --> 24:30.760
branching levels.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.760
That is the power of a law of physics.

24:33.760 --> 24:39.760
So, yes, most of my colleagues use the word law when, in fact,

24:39.760 --> 24:46.760
they're talking about an empirical activity, which is that of making a more

24:46.760 --> 24:49.760
compact, a huge volume of observations.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.760
The law of physics does that one better.

24:53.760 --> 24:58.760
It makes even more compact a huge number of these correlations.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.760
I'm just going to go back to something previous.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
I said you disagree about the finding too.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.760
I want to further take on it.

25:07.760 --> 25:12.760
Well, I mean, would it be useful if you explain, do you want to explain a little

25:12.760 --> 25:14.760
bit what point is and then I can.

25:14.760 --> 25:20.760
OK, so what's been discussed pretty much since the 70s has been what's called

25:20.760 --> 25:25.760
anthropic fine tuning, and that the universe is, in many ways, the fundamental

25:25.760 --> 25:31.760
structure precisely set so that life can exist at least somewhere

25:31.760 --> 25:33.760
in the universe.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.760
OK, and I usually like to refer to the kind of life is what I call embodied

25:37.760 --> 25:43.760
conscious agents, which would be a generalized version of what we are.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.760
And so you could do this on different levels.

25:46.760 --> 25:51.760
There's the laws of nature, the very general principles like the law of

25:51.760 --> 25:56.760
gravity or that, unlike charges repel each other.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.760
And there has to be the right set of those.

25:58.760 --> 26:04.760
If you like pulled off the law of gravity, there wouldn't be any masses

26:04.760 --> 26:09.760
when clumped together and obviously you wouldn't get highly complex beings like

26:09.760 --> 26:13.760
us and would also be stars, which are the energy sources for them.

26:13.760 --> 26:18.760
And then another, the post-discussed area of this is on what they call the

26:18.760 --> 26:20.760
fundamental parameters of physics.

26:20.760 --> 26:27.760
So those would be like the mass of the proton or even more fundamental than that

26:27.760 --> 26:33.760
is the mass of the up and down quarks, which compose the proton.

26:33.760 --> 26:39.760
Other examples would be the strength of gravity as not just the strength on any

26:39.760 --> 26:47.760
given planet, but that constant g in Newton's law that f equals g, the mass,

26:47.760 --> 26:52.760
first mass times the second mass divided by the distance between m squared,

26:52.760 --> 26:53.760
that's all.

26:53.760 --> 26:57.760
There's a number for that and you can express that for those who have physics

26:57.760 --> 27:00.760
training, you can express that in what's called dimensionalist units.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.760
You don't actually have to refer to units there.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.760
But anyhow, it's a number that gives the strength of gravity.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.760
There's a number that gives the strength of the electromagnetic force, the strong

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
nuclear force, et cetera.

27:11.760 --> 27:19.760
And those have to be precisely adjusted over vast ranges of possibilities in order

27:19.760 --> 27:25.760
to have a universe that allows for what I would say would be life more

27:25.760 --> 27:30.760
generally stable, reproducible complexity.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.760
And I can give more examples than those.

27:32.760 --> 27:37.760
There's lots of examples you can give, but that's the general idea.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.760
Right.

27:38.760 --> 27:44.760
And I think, yeah, what I'll get to why I sort of made my squeak of that objective.

27:44.760 --> 27:50.760
What's so interesting about that as part of this topic of design and nature is that

27:50.760 --> 27:57.760
it could be construed to mean that everything was set up, as you say,

27:57.760 --> 28:02.760
to be just so in order to enable the production of things like stars in the

28:02.760 --> 28:06.760
cosmos, which in turn produced heavy elements in just the right abundancies

28:06.760 --> 28:12.760
to ultimately make planets with chemical compositions that allow for the sort of

28:12.760 --> 28:15.760
complexity that life can emerge from.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.760
And I've been interested in that for a while.

28:18.760 --> 28:24.760
And what's interesting to me, actually, is that now we come back and look at it

28:24.760 --> 28:27.760
with a little more scrutiny.

28:27.760 --> 28:35.760
And I'll explain this as well, that fine tuning is probably not so fine at all,

28:35.760 --> 28:43.760
which negates some of this idea that the universe is perfect for life or just

28:43.760 --> 28:48.760
appears to be perfect for that one instance of, you know, cognizant life that

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
you talk about.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.760
So I have two things to say.

28:51.760 --> 28:56.760
And one is to do with people's investigations of that quite recently that

28:56.760 --> 29:02.760
seem to suggest the universe is not fine-tuned particularly well.

29:02.760 --> 29:07.760
And the other piece of it is, I think you can flip it around and, you know,

29:07.760 --> 29:12.760
it's predicated on the notion of life being a very particular thing, right,

29:12.760 --> 29:16.760
carbon-based organisms somewhat like us.

29:16.760 --> 29:22.760
And the truth is we don't know whether you can build life out of other

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
building blocks or not.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
Suppose you can't.

29:25.760 --> 29:29.760
Suppose life can be more general as a phenomenon.

29:29.760 --> 29:34.760
It can come together out of any set of building blocks that allow for

29:34.760 --> 29:38.760
sufficient complexity, right, and maybe that's, I mean, everybody always says

29:38.760 --> 29:43.760
silicon, but silicon probably isn't a very good element to be involved in this,

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
but it could be.

29:44.760 --> 29:48.760
You know, then that could conceivably change the perception of the universe

29:48.760 --> 29:51.760
being particularly well-fined-tuned.

29:51.760 --> 29:55.760
But I just wanted to say, and this is why I sort of, you know, got excited when

29:55.760 --> 29:58.760
you mentioned it, that, you know, so the hands are very, very

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
important.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.760
You know, so there has been recent work on this from the physics end.

30:02.760 --> 30:08.760
You may well be aware of it, but for example, you mentioned the relative

30:08.760 --> 30:13.760
strength or the strength of gravity, right, and so one of those

30:13.760 --> 30:18.760
dimensionless quantities is the strength of gravity to the strength of

30:18.760 --> 30:20.760
electromagnetic forces.

30:20.760 --> 30:25.760
That ratio has been deemed in the past as something that if that was changed

30:25.760 --> 30:29.760
just a little bit, you couldn't make things like stars, right, because a star

30:29.760 --> 30:33.760
is essentially a competition between gravity and electromagnetic forces.

30:33.760 --> 30:38.760
It's in a sort of dynamic equilibrium as matter comes together.

30:38.760 --> 30:42.760
And so the argument has been, well, if you changed gravity a little bit or you

30:42.760 --> 30:46.760
changed electromagnetic, magnetism a tiny bit, you just wouldn't make stars,

30:46.760 --> 30:48.760
and all that then follows.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.760
But recent investigation of that suggests that in fact, you could still make

30:54.760 --> 30:59.760
stars, even if you change the strength of electromagnetism by maybe a factor

30:59.760 --> 31:04.760
of a thousand, and if you change the strength of gravity, the G constant,

31:04.760 --> 31:10.760
by up to a million, or maybe even 10 million, that space, that parameter

31:10.760 --> 31:14.760
space still allows for stars to form in the universe.

31:14.760 --> 31:18.760
Now they might be different than the stars we used to, they might be about

31:18.760 --> 31:23.760
bigger, but they would still go through the same cycle of nuclear

31:23.760 --> 31:26.760
fusion and element production.

31:26.760 --> 31:31.760
And to me, that's really interesting, if that's true, because it means that at

31:31.760 --> 31:36.760
least one piece of the fine tuning argument, I know there are other factors

31:36.760 --> 31:40.760
to that, other fundamental properties, if you tweak them a little bit,

31:40.760 --> 31:42.760
would be seemingly problematic.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.760
But that suggests to me that it's, first of all, maybe the universe isn't

31:47.760 --> 31:49.760
particularly well tuned for life as we know it.

31:49.760 --> 31:54.760
I mean, we don't actually know, because we've only got the one instance that we

31:54.760 --> 31:56.760
know about right here on the Earth.

31:56.760 --> 32:00.760
So we don't know whether this is a fertile universe or not a fertile

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
universe.

32:01.760 --> 32:09.760
And that, to me, would change, suppose 500 years ago, or 400 years ago,

32:09.760 --> 32:13.760
first telescopes, we just saw life everywhere.

32:13.760 --> 32:18.760
Everybody had big neon signs out across the universe saying, we are here.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.760
What are you up to?

32:20.760 --> 32:21.760
Oh, yeah, Renaissance.

32:21.760 --> 32:22.760
Lovely.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.760
We had that, you know, a thousand years earlier.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.760
Then we'd have lived with a universe replete with living organisms,

32:29.760 --> 32:36.760
and I'm not even sure the question would come up that the universe was fine-tuned.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.760
If what, I didn't quite catch the last scenario.

32:39.760 --> 32:43.760
Suppose the universe, we knew we had known that the universe was packed with

32:43.760 --> 32:47.760
life, that the planet everywhere, and all of them had life, and it was all

32:47.760 --> 32:52.760
sophisticated, technological, it had evolved in many different ways, and so on.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.760
I just wonder whether we'd even ask the question.

32:55.760 --> 33:00.760
And the thing is, we don't know how fertile the universe is.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.760
So sorry, I'm loading this with lots of...

33:02.760 --> 33:06.760
One thing I want to say, okay, start with a response to your second point you made

33:06.760 --> 33:08.760
about assuming carbon-based life.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.760
Most of the arguments actually don't.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.760
For example, the fine-tuning of the cosmological constant, which governs the

33:14.760 --> 33:19.760
expansion rate of space, that simply, if it wasn't within a very small range,

33:19.760 --> 33:25.760
typically estimate as one part in 10 to the 120th power, very, very small number,

33:25.760 --> 33:30.760
that the universe would expand too rapidly for galaxies and stars to form,

33:30.760 --> 33:34.760
so there just wouldn't be planets, there wouldn't be stars, and then you're not even

33:34.760 --> 33:37.760
going to get any kind of complexity.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.760
Or if you looked at the level of laws, if you didn't have like this,

33:40.760 --> 33:45.760
strong nuclear force was long-range force, wasn't just right, you wouldn't have atoms.

33:45.760 --> 33:51.760
And concerning your case, so first of all, I say, the more general, if somebody's

33:51.760 --> 33:56.760
correctly formulating this, most cases won't involve, are not simply focused on

33:56.760 --> 33:57.760
carbon-based life.

33:57.760 --> 34:02.760
There was that case with Fred Hoyle initially with the carbon and oxygen,

34:02.760 --> 34:05.760
but most of them aren't.

34:05.760 --> 34:14.760
And the second thing, in the example you mentioned of the star, I don't think that

34:14.760 --> 34:20.760
it's just whether stars could exist or not with the gravitational-constra-fying

34:20.760 --> 34:21.760
structure constant.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.760
It wasn't just a matter of whether stars could exist, but whether they would have

34:25.760 --> 34:30.760
right temperature last long enough for life to exist.

34:30.760 --> 34:36.760
And there's also, if you change those, there's planetary effects, like the ability to

34:36.760 --> 34:41.760
retain an atmosphere if you increase the strength of gravity, it can fairly easy

34:41.760 --> 34:47.760
to show that you're forced into increasing the surface force on a planet to retain

34:47.760 --> 34:49.760
an atmosphere.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.760
And so, you know, gravity is very weak as a force.

34:52.760 --> 34:57.760
If you didn't dimensionless units, about one in ten to the 38th power of the

34:57.760 --> 35:06.760
strong nuclear force, and if you increase gravity by, let's say, a thousandfold,

35:06.760 --> 35:14.760
then only planets have 30 times the surface force strength of experience, it would be

35:14.760 --> 35:18.760
less, a lot less, I think, ideal for our kind of life.

35:18.760 --> 35:24.760
So, I think you can, the argument actually, when you start talking about the conditions

35:24.760 --> 35:30.760
being even optimal, you might even be able to get light, but it's going to be, as you

35:30.760 --> 35:34.760
increase the surface force, it's going to be a lot harder to do much of anything.

35:34.760 --> 35:41.760
So, I would agree that figuring out all these secondary ramifications is tough, right?

35:41.760 --> 35:46.760
And it may be that you would eliminate regions of this expanded parameter space.

35:46.760 --> 35:51.760
But, no, I mean, the example I gave, that range, and I'm sorry, is just getting into

35:51.760 --> 35:57.760
sort of horribly specific physics. So, we should veer off from this again.

35:57.760 --> 36:04.760
That range I gave for strength of gravity, strength of electromagnetism, is the range

36:04.760 --> 36:11.760
from which you would derive sufficiently long-lived stars with the right sort of

36:11.760 --> 36:15.760
properties to produce, as far as we can tell, I mean, you'd have to run a lot of

36:15.760 --> 36:23.760
physics simulations, an abundance of heavier elements, not so dissimilar to what we

36:23.760 --> 36:29.760
have at the moment. No, I mean, I raised it, not really just to sort of attack this idea,

36:29.760 --> 36:33.760
but it's interesting to me that, you know, and maybe this almost relates to what you

36:33.760 --> 36:39.760
would say, I mean, we impose design on things, right? That's us.

36:39.760 --> 36:42.760
The universe may have nothing to do with that, right?

36:42.760 --> 36:46.760
We tend to impose design more than anything else.

36:46.760 --> 36:50.760
Here's Adam, this is what you just look at, a range of physically possible values,

36:50.760 --> 36:54.760
and then you look at those values that are allowed for complexity, and some of them are

36:54.760 --> 36:58.760
very straight, much more straightforward, you don't have to run the kind of simulations

36:58.760 --> 37:01.760
which we like the concept. Yeah, I mean, I think the cosological concept is a good one.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.760
It's much more straightforward. Right, right. And the other ones are the

37:04.760 --> 37:06.760
planetary effects of change in gravity are pretty straightforward.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.760
But, we bring it back to this idea just how messy all this stuff is, basically.

37:10.760 --> 37:14.760
I mean, the best example of that is, I mean, even if you bought into the creator

37:14.760 --> 37:18.760
kind of stuff, that Adam and Eve, everything, I mean, it's looking around, we all look

37:18.760 --> 37:22.760
different, we wouldn't, because DNA replication is incredibly

37:22.760 --> 37:26.760
messy, and that there's, you know, all of these things,

37:26.760 --> 37:30.760
whether it's, you know, talking about things within the aspect of the beginning

37:30.760 --> 37:34.760
of the universe, to, like, you know, things that, like, you know,

37:34.760 --> 37:38.760
e.coli mutating in petri dishes around the city in different labs.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.760
I mean, there's a lot of messiness and a lot of stochastic kind of things that just

37:42.760 --> 37:46.760
happened to all of these things. And if it weren't messy, we wouldn't beat him.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.760
Exactly. Well, let me, I don't know if you were.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.760
No, I was just going to add to that. And we, as I think you're saying,

37:54.760 --> 37:58.760
are predisposed to see the design and everything, even if

37:58.760 --> 38:02.760
it's created by random processes with, you know,

38:02.760 --> 38:06.760
additional constraints on top. And that's part of not just our brains, but animal brains

38:06.760 --> 38:10.760
in general, that are designed to look for pattern. That itself is adaptive.

38:10.760 --> 38:14.760
Because the brain or any other

38:14.760 --> 38:18.760
such organ is the finite size and

38:18.760 --> 38:22.760
can only do this little in order to enable the moving

38:22.760 --> 38:26.760
vehicle. I've been listening to your discussion.

38:26.760 --> 38:30.760
I don't, I don't, I don't use a lot of our brain. Well, so if you say it's

38:30.760 --> 38:34.760
too small, why don't we use more of it? No, the point I'm making is

38:34.760 --> 38:38.760
that from one generation to the next, we

38:38.760 --> 38:42.760
were exposed to more information, more observations,

38:42.760 --> 38:46.760
reams and reams of this. And of course we

38:46.760 --> 38:50.760
absorb it in the forms of principles and the correlations, but not

38:50.760 --> 38:54.760
number by number in the immense volumes of

38:54.760 --> 38:58.760
tables of data. We, we become

38:58.760 --> 39:02.760
more knowledgeable through, through hierarchical

39:02.760 --> 39:06.760
not through mindless accumulation of volume.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.760
That was the point I was making. I wanted to contribute this discussion

39:10.760 --> 39:14.760
because several points were made here.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.760
The, first of all, I was learning from the

39:18.760 --> 39:22.760
exchange between the two of you, which is basically about physics. The topic today

39:22.760 --> 39:26.760
is Design in Nature, which is something that is familiar to everyone.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.760
It's something for us mortals here, somewhere halfway

39:30.760 --> 39:34.760
between the stars and the protons and the quarks.

39:34.760 --> 39:38.760
Now, many people, as you

39:38.760 --> 39:42.760
implied, equate the

39:42.760 --> 39:46.760
quark, the proton and the infinitesimal with, quote,

39:46.760 --> 39:50.760
even more fundamental. Smaller

39:50.760 --> 39:54.760
does not mean more fundamental. Fundamental fundus in Latin means

39:54.760 --> 39:58.760
at bottom. Look at the Statue of Liberty, the pedestal

39:58.760 --> 40:02.760
is bigger than the statue. The thing,

40:02.760 --> 40:06.760
or the fire brick in Roman architecture, is

40:06.760 --> 40:10.760
finite size. You can kill a man with it. And it is fundamental

40:10.760 --> 40:14.760
because before that, the buildings are really,

40:14.760 --> 40:18.760
really miserable and crumbling earthquakes and so forth.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.760
Most of them, but not after the fire brick. You have

40:22.760 --> 40:26.760
these vaults. You have architecture of a different kind. After the fire

40:26.760 --> 40:30.760
brick came, the steel reinforced concrete all over this country,

40:30.760 --> 40:34.760
skyscrapers and iron bridges. Okay? So

40:34.760 --> 40:36.760
that's fundamental. A

40:36.760 --> 40:40.760
finite size elemental construct,

40:40.760 --> 40:44.760
this thing, the brick, the steel in the cement.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.760
These are fundamental because they are

40:48.760 --> 40:52.760
literally at the bottom of

40:52.760 --> 40:54.380
the

40:54.380 --> 40:58.760
surface. So, in science, unfortunately, language

40:58.760 --> 41:02.760
basically has a life of its own.

41:02.760 --> 41:06.760
Some words are so useful that they end up being used,

41:06.760 --> 41:10.760
actually misused in other places.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.760
The life

41:12.760 --> 41:16.760
carbon based. Of course, that's the view if you

41:16.760 --> 41:20.760
equate the design nature only with

41:20.760 --> 41:24.760
animals, with the biosphere, you see.

41:24.760 --> 41:28.760
But the design nature is general. It's not about that.

41:28.760 --> 41:32.760
So, there's a famous question, what is life?

41:32.760 --> 41:36.760
And I think the answer is very easy if you know

41:36.760 --> 41:38.760
thermodynamics. Because in

41:38.760 --> 41:42.760
thermodynamics, this is the part of physics that had to be born after

41:42.760 --> 41:44.760
the steam engine, the

41:44.760 --> 41:48.760
heat engine, 200 years ago.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.760
So, this is actually Maxwell in Cambridge.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.760
One of the key concepts in physics is that of

41:56.760 --> 42:00.760
the dead state. Death is

42:00.760 --> 42:04.760
resolved as an answer to a question in physics.

42:04.760 --> 42:08.760
Dead means in a system, which means this that you're discussing.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.760
That system is in the dead state. If in it, nothing

42:12.760 --> 42:16.760
moves. That also means nothing morphs. Nothing changes.

42:16.760 --> 42:20.760
Well, the antonym of that is the

42:20.760 --> 42:24.760
life state of a system. It is a system in a

42:24.760 --> 42:28.760
state occupied by flow, meaning

42:28.760 --> 42:32.760
movement. And the change. Change in configuration.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.760
I mentioned earlier change cannot happen without freedom to change.

42:36.760 --> 42:40.760
That's another basic concept in physics.

42:40.760 --> 42:44.760
Process means change. Change of state from this

42:44.760 --> 42:48.760
being of, say, the part of water

42:48.760 --> 42:52.760
to this other being of the part of water.

42:52.760 --> 42:56.760
So, all these things together, taking us from what everybody

42:56.760 --> 43:00.760
understands and accepts, which is dead state in physics.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.760
Life state, the antonym of the first. And then

43:04.760 --> 43:08.760
change in state, which happens because of freedom. That change is evolution.

43:08.760 --> 43:12.760
And the direction of that change is not the haphazard.

43:12.760 --> 43:16.760
It is in one direction, which is that of

43:16.760 --> 43:20.760
changes that facilitate

43:20.760 --> 43:24.760
the occurrence of configurations that

43:24.760 --> 43:28.760
offer greater access. Or all the way to

43:28.760 --> 43:32.760
more efficiency, to smarter economics,

43:32.760 --> 43:36.760
to faster speech, or cheaper communicating between entities that want

43:36.760 --> 43:40.760
to communicate. Or the fact that it is

43:40.760 --> 43:44.760
called economies of scale. The fact that it is easier to move as a group

43:44.760 --> 43:48.760
not as individuals. And on and on, and this is the

43:48.760 --> 43:52.760
river water, the two people entering the stadium,

43:52.760 --> 43:56.760
this is physics. It's everything

43:56.760 --> 44:00.760
showing the same tendency to morph and to surprise the observer

44:00.760 --> 44:04.760
with surprisingly the same kind of pattern.

44:04.760 --> 44:08.760
Pattern is not designed.

44:08.760 --> 44:12.760
Design is a flow configuration with

44:12.760 --> 44:16.760
freedom, but also with a message.

44:16.760 --> 44:20.760
I get the impression the way you talk

44:20.760 --> 44:24.760
is that all of these questions

44:24.760 --> 44:28.760
that are being raised and all of the debates that are happening

44:28.760 --> 44:32.760
that you seem to present it as if you already have all the answers.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.760
And I'm a little bit puzzled by that because

44:36.760 --> 44:40.760
obviously these are unsettled issues.

44:40.760 --> 44:44.760
Well look, since you put it that way, I have to respond by the way.

44:44.760 --> 44:48.760
That goes without saying.

44:48.760 --> 44:52.760
No. On the contrary.

44:52.760 --> 44:56.760
I'm the ignorant who

44:56.760 --> 45:00.760
came to this very old and big

45:00.760 --> 45:04.760
table of discussion. I'm talking about in physics, in biology.

45:04.760 --> 45:08.760
I'm from engineering. I'm a person who

45:08.760 --> 45:12.760
basically was not supposed to be here. But it so happens.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.760
You are here. No, I'm talking about the

45:16.760 --> 45:20.760
in... It is only now that I published, meaning

45:20.760 --> 45:24.760
20 years ago, I published in physics in biology. Previously I was preaching to the

45:24.760 --> 45:28.760
choir. My peers in engineering

45:28.760 --> 45:32.760
get it. They are simply not invited to discussions on

45:32.760 --> 45:36.760
design, even though the word meaning

45:36.760 --> 45:40.760
design is what people do. Incidentally,

45:40.760 --> 45:44.760
this thing with the signal in Latin, then it became

45:44.760 --> 45:48.760
design in Italian. The west got

45:48.760 --> 45:52.760
the science that we cherish today from

45:52.760 --> 45:56.760
the Renaissance. That's how we really got it. And then through the French,

45:56.760 --> 46:00.760
so it means the sign. It doesn't mean

46:00.760 --> 46:04.760
the act of designing something and making it.

46:04.760 --> 46:08.760
That's something totally different. Design happens.

46:08.760 --> 46:12.760
But to finish your point, when I started

46:12.760 --> 46:16.760
to talk about the physics of evolution,

46:16.760 --> 46:20.760
in this most general sense, not as chemistry of carbon,

46:20.760 --> 46:24.760
in the most general sense, I was surprised

46:24.760 --> 46:28.760
to hear from my peers, those who came to the construct

46:28.760 --> 46:32.760
a look from physics in biology, that what I'm telling them from

46:32.760 --> 46:36.760
my direction is in fact

46:36.760 --> 46:40.760
not only familiar to them, but it covers

46:40.760 --> 46:44.760
what the contemporary scientists regard as known

46:44.760 --> 46:48.760
in their various compartments like departments on a campus

46:48.760 --> 46:52.760
that do not talk to each other. So that's the reason... I think good questions.

46:52.760 --> 46:56.760
I want to go back to a previous comment.

46:56.760 --> 47:00.760
You made about that the brain is

47:00.760 --> 47:04.760
programmed to see design in nature.

47:04.760 --> 47:08.760
Now, one could take that as the brain is

47:08.760 --> 47:12.760
programmed to mislead us because there's not near as much design

47:12.760 --> 47:16.760
in nature as the brain seems to want to think. In certain areas

47:16.760 --> 47:20.760
that's certainly true.

47:20.760 --> 47:24.760
But I would want to point out that from the

47:24.760 --> 47:28.760
time of the scientific revolution, you can, I could cite Morris Klein on this

47:28.760 --> 47:32.760
who said the assumption everybody was making

47:32.760 --> 47:36.760
was that

47:36.760 --> 47:40.760
since the time of the Pythagoreans that nature was mathematically designed, meaning

47:40.760 --> 47:44.760
in particular mathematically put together to realize

47:44.760 --> 47:48.760
elegant mathematics. And that, during the

47:48.760 --> 47:52.760
last century, ever since then, has been just enormously fruitful.

47:52.760 --> 47:56.760
You have people like Paul Dirac, one of the

47:56.760 --> 48:00.760
major founders of quantum mechanics, says, you know, the equation must be beautiful.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.760
It's more important than even that experiment because sometimes when they pursued

48:04.760 --> 48:08.760
beauty in the equations and they seemed to conflict with the experiment

48:08.760 --> 48:12.760
later it turned out to be correct. That was Einstein's approach.

48:12.760 --> 48:16.760
It was...look, he would actually, as

48:16.760 --> 48:20.760
major biographer said, he would think of it. Even though he didn't believe in a

48:20.760 --> 48:24.760
idea that he would think to himself, if I were God, what would I do?

48:24.760 --> 48:28.760
In other words, how would be the most beautiful mathematics

48:28.760 --> 48:32.760
to put this together? And that was a guide for him.

48:32.760 --> 48:36.760
And it's been a continual guide and a very successful one.

48:36.760 --> 48:40.760
So I wouldn't want to make the inference that a brain being...

48:40.760 --> 48:44.760
I think we have to resist the inference. That means it's going to mislead us. It's actually amazing

48:44.760 --> 48:48.760
that that kind of idea has been so successful.

48:48.760 --> 48:52.760
At an area we wouldn't expect it because if

48:52.760 --> 48:56.760
it was programmed to...for reproductive

48:56.760 --> 49:00.760
success to see design and everything and to see these elegant

49:00.760 --> 49:04.760
patterns, we wouldn't initially expect

49:04.760 --> 49:08.760
it to work at the underlying level when the mathematics is

49:08.760 --> 49:12.760
far removed from what we see

49:12.760 --> 49:16.760
on the everyday level.

49:16.760 --> 49:20.760
I think I would also understand you that some of the mathematical

49:20.760 --> 49:24.760
beauty may not be as...

49:24.760 --> 49:28.760
I think there is enormous

49:28.760 --> 49:32.760
beauty in this context for mathematics. I think it's very interesting

49:32.760 --> 49:36.760
point that you raised. As you were talking, I was thinking about this

49:36.760 --> 49:40.760
and thinking, okay, so why do we do this? Why do our brains

49:40.760 --> 49:44.760
do this? Is it because, you know, again,

49:44.760 --> 49:48.760
we've evolved presumably like other species

49:48.760 --> 49:52.760
so that our brains are part of a data

49:52.760 --> 49:56.760
processing system, right? And we're bombarded

49:56.760 --> 50:00.760
by millions of pieces of information all the time for every

50:00.760 --> 50:04.760
nerve ending, everything we see, everything we hear, smell,

50:04.760 --> 50:08.760
you know, pheromones that are floating around

50:08.760 --> 50:12.760
in this room that triggers what's the thing. And it's a lot to handle, right?

50:12.760 --> 50:16.760
But, you know, there's a tiger waiting to eat me over there

50:16.760 --> 50:20.760
so I'd better make some good judgment decisions

50:20.760 --> 50:24.760
and I just... you know, this is a very naive way of thinking about it.

50:24.760 --> 50:28.760
I suspect, but is that... does that seem like a plausible

50:28.760 --> 50:32.760
reason why we see patterns, we see

50:32.760 --> 50:36.760
beauty in certain equations? There was some

50:36.760 --> 50:40.760
report very recently talking about the study of people doing math

50:40.760 --> 50:44.760
and I think even looking at FMRI scans, why they were solving

50:44.760 --> 50:48.760
mathematical puzzles and getting that pleasure,

50:48.760 --> 50:52.760
I don't know if it was dopamine or whatever, does that

50:52.760 --> 50:56.760
make sense? Yeah, I'll just mention a quick example

50:56.760 --> 51:00.760
from Fish. Obviously, where our brains are

51:00.760 --> 51:04.760
more complex and understanding our predispositions

51:04.760 --> 51:08.760
is more complicated, but there's a very lovely

51:08.760 --> 51:12.760
long-term study of guppies in Trinidad and these guppies,

51:12.760 --> 51:16.760
I'm sure a lot of you have had guppies as pets, they have these beautiful

51:16.760 --> 51:20.760
tails, very colorful, and the tails are...

51:20.760 --> 51:24.760
the males have the colorful tails and it's thought that these are to attract

51:24.760 --> 51:28.760
females. The females choose the males based on the color of the tails, which are

51:28.760 --> 51:32.760
kind of this bright orange color in this particular area.

51:32.760 --> 51:36.760
And so for a long time the research was completely focused

51:36.760 --> 51:40.760
on why the females prefer these beautiful colorful

51:40.760 --> 51:44.760
tails, and it's lovely, they look designed, right?

51:44.760 --> 51:48.760
And then some smart team came along and thought

51:48.760 --> 51:52.760
to examine what the guppies were eating and it turned out that

51:52.760 --> 51:56.760
these guppies prefer these orange berries that

51:56.760 --> 52:00.760
fall into the river that have a very similar color and

52:00.760 --> 52:04.760
pattern to the males' tails. So it turned out the females,

52:04.760 --> 52:08.760
some neurological level, had a preference for orange, for this bright orange color

52:08.760 --> 52:12.760
of the males' tails, and that on an evolutionary time scale got translated

52:12.760 --> 52:16.760
into a preference for males with these bright orange tails.

52:16.760 --> 52:20.760
So something that looks completely unrelated, turns out...

52:20.760 --> 52:24.760
How does that apply to humans? Yes, good question.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.760
Maybe somebody with a...

52:28.760 --> 52:32.760
So how does that connect up with our brain spin program to see

52:32.760 --> 52:36.760
that there may be at an evolutionary time scale some

52:36.760 --> 52:40.760
predisposition due to selective

52:40.760 --> 52:44.760
forces that we don't see around us anymore,

52:44.760 --> 52:48.760
but that may have been part of our evolutionary history.

52:48.760 --> 52:52.760
It still would be the case that why would we expect that to work

52:52.760 --> 52:56.760
in areas that are so far removed from

52:56.760 --> 53:00.760
what helps us in our long evolutionary past

53:00.760 --> 53:04.760
survive, namely at this fundamental mathematical level, which is actually

53:04.760 --> 53:08.760
very abstract. That's why people have a lot of

53:08.760 --> 53:12.760
difficulty learning quantum mechanics or general relativity

53:12.760 --> 53:16.760
because the mathematics is far different from even...

53:16.760 --> 53:20.760
It's a difficulty explaining how we can even do mathematics in the normal

53:20.760 --> 53:24.760
from an evolutionary perspective. People have worked on that.

53:24.760 --> 53:28.760
But that's the ordinary counting fractions.

53:28.760 --> 53:32.760
That sort of mathematics is very far removed. And as Eugene Vigner wrote a famous essay

53:32.760 --> 53:36.760
on this, as you pointed out, it's chosen. The mathematics

53:36.760 --> 53:40.760
is chosen for its elegance and fruitfulness mathematically

53:40.760 --> 53:44.760
in being able to, let's say, solve equations. And so why would it work so

53:44.760 --> 53:48.760
well there? That's the puzzle I'm pointing to.

53:48.760 --> 53:52.760
I guess, I mean, you know, quantum mechanics...

53:52.760 --> 53:56.760
Right, I mean, to do quantum mechanics you have to know...

53:56.760 --> 54:00.760
I mean, mathematics as we have it.

54:00.760 --> 54:04.760
And so I'm just...

54:04.760 --> 54:08.760
Yeah, we see quantum mechanics

54:08.760 --> 54:12.760
but that beauty wasn't arrived at like that.

54:12.760 --> 54:16.760
No, but the mathematics, using that mathematics with the complex numbers

54:16.760 --> 54:20.760
was developed before the arrival of quantum mechanics

54:20.760 --> 54:24.760
and it's essential, either that or something isomorphic

54:24.760 --> 54:28.760
to it, is essential for quantum mechanics. And that was developed because it was

54:28.760 --> 54:32.760
enormously fruitful and complex numbers are real number, plus

54:32.760 --> 54:36.760
an imaginary number which you could think of as a square root of negative 1.

54:36.760 --> 54:40.760
And so they were developed because it was enormously one reason

54:40.760 --> 54:44.760
you can solve like third order or more

54:44.760 --> 54:48.760
or any polynomial using imaginary numbers, but you can't using the real numbers.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.760
There's no... And so the normal...

54:52.760 --> 54:56.760
enormously fruitful algebraically and in other ways.

54:56.760 --> 55:00.760
And it was developed all independently yet for aesthetic reasons

55:00.760 --> 55:04.760
because of its mathematical fruitfulness and yet that's just the system

55:04.760 --> 55:08.760
that nature is

55:08.760 --> 55:12.760
the mathematics that suits nature.

55:12.760 --> 55:16.760
I wanted to just... you didn't finish your point about the fish.

55:16.760 --> 55:20.760
No, it was pretty much finished.

55:20.760 --> 55:24.760
Yeah, I'm hoping that somebody that used a little bit more about the fish and brain

55:24.760 --> 55:28.760
could take it a little further.

55:28.760 --> 55:32.760
The conclusion being that in terms of

55:32.760 --> 55:36.760
what was making the female fish choose

55:36.760 --> 55:40.760
that, that that was...

55:40.760 --> 55:44.760
was not really a design, it was more something else.

55:44.760 --> 55:48.760
Right, there was a predisposition that looked to us to be

55:48.760 --> 55:52.760
sort of design related at first glance but turned out to have

55:52.760 --> 55:56.760
a deeper evolutionary history that shaped

55:56.760 --> 56:00.760
this preference based on food.

56:00.760 --> 56:04.760
So the ability, maybe the thrill of adding

56:04.760 --> 56:08.760
two numbers together is related

56:08.760 --> 56:12.760
to the ability to think, oh, if I go over there I get

56:12.760 --> 56:16.760
two berries instead of one berry.

56:16.760 --> 56:19.760
I'm going to talk to our colleagues at Columbia and say, very

56:19.760 --> 56:22.760
Candel and stuff is like that he's made his career.

56:22.760 --> 56:26.760
One was in the world prize just on the basis of how that

56:26.760 --> 56:30.760
every single interaction you ever have, everything you ever look at,

56:30.760 --> 56:34.760
not just changes your brain chemically, it changes it physically,

56:34.760 --> 56:38.760
is that new synapses become larger and hotter.

56:38.760 --> 56:42.760
And that there's been a huge amount, I mean, basically we know about the brains of

56:42.760 --> 56:46.760
three things, kind of, we know some about humor, we know some about

56:46.760 --> 56:50.760
mouse, we know a little bit about sea elegance, if you want to say they have a brain or not,

56:50.760 --> 56:54.760
and then a little bit about zebrafish, but certainly I mean they've been

56:54.760 --> 56:58.760
able to demonstrate that in some experimental organisms as well. So like that

56:58.760 --> 57:02.760
we can talk about this set of complex mathematics but

57:02.760 --> 57:06.760
these are relatively new things that are basically the things that have come since

57:06.760 --> 57:10.760
Newton's time. And that, so our brains, when we look at mathematics

57:10.760 --> 57:14.760
today, look fundamentally different than somebody who would have thought

57:14.760 --> 57:18.760
about those same sorts of problems before those mathematics were different.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.760
And not just in a chemical way, I'm just studying and understanding it, but in a physical way as well.

57:22.760 --> 57:28.760
I wanted to bring the discussion back to

57:28.760 --> 57:32.760
design and nature and respond to

57:32.760 --> 57:36.760
things you brought up or actually both of you. Why

57:36.760 --> 57:40.760
is the brain program as well to

57:40.760 --> 57:44.760
detect pattern? You see that, by the way,

57:44.760 --> 57:48.760
right now in the famous story about the NSA

57:48.760 --> 57:52.760
using big data in order to discern

57:52.760 --> 57:56.760
patterns that are useful. And that's the answer to your second point

57:56.760 --> 58:00.760
about beauty, okay? Why is the pattern useful to the

58:00.760 --> 58:04.760
NSA so that the government could act faster

58:04.760 --> 58:08.760
in the direction of protecting all of us. The same with

58:08.760 --> 58:12.760
the animal, obviously one million years

58:12.760 --> 58:16.760
after another million learning that what is good

58:16.760 --> 58:20.760
for it is actually

58:20.760 --> 58:24.760
pleasure because to live is the option that we all like as opposed

58:24.760 --> 58:28.760
to becoming the victim. And so beauty

58:28.760 --> 58:32.760
in physics is a part of this evolutionary

58:32.760 --> 58:36.760
design, meaning changes that we make

58:36.760 --> 58:40.760
every day and how we move in order to get going, to go

58:40.760 --> 58:44.760
through life easier. We like a simple equation

58:44.760 --> 58:48.760
because we get it and we move on. My best example

58:48.760 --> 58:52.760
is why statistics has been proven that most people

58:52.760 --> 58:56.760
like to look at images shaped like this. Like

58:56.760 --> 59:00.760
the business card where like the computer screen or like the screen of the cinema.

59:00.760 --> 59:04.760
The shape happens to have a length to hide ratio

59:04.760 --> 59:08.760
approximately the same as the golden ratio. That's a

59:08.760 --> 59:12.760
coincidence. But why do people like this shape?

59:12.760 --> 59:16.760
Why? Because this is the area that's the easiest, the fastest

59:16.760 --> 59:20.760
to scan with two eyes, okay? This is the animal

59:20.760 --> 59:24.760
in the business of surviving and getting out of the

59:24.760 --> 59:28.760
way of the predator and looking at the world which is flat.

59:28.760 --> 59:32.760
This is why the animal has two eyes on the horizontal and by the way

59:32.760 --> 59:36.760
the area, the ocular area of the two eyes

59:36.760 --> 59:40.760
is an area approximated by this shape. And that is

59:40.760 --> 59:44.760
then the beauty which goes hand in hand with locomotion

59:44.760 --> 59:48.760
and with greater access and with the survival.

59:48.760 --> 59:52.760
So you have the intangibles like beauty as of course

59:52.760 --> 59:56.760
all the way to economics that actually belongs in physics,

59:56.760 --> 01:00:00.760
so I'm sorry.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.760
I'm just wondering if anybody comment

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.760
on evolutionary biologists. On

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.760
Simon Conway morosis thesis I'm just wondering which, because that's I think

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.760
very relevant to the discussion here of that.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.760
That the built in constraints already there from physics,

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.760
chemistry, etc. makes certain, almost inevitable

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.760
certain kinds of organisms. So he's bucking the idea

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.760
particularly popularized by Stephen J. Gould

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.760
that if you ran the evolutionary tape over again

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.760
you'd get very, very different types of life forms and

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.760
that would be a miracle to get, a miracle in the sense of being

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.760
a very, very improbable occurrence to get beings like us

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:52.760
with our level of intelligence. But he thinks that

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.760
the evidence of convergence of things like the compound eye occurring

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.760
independently many different times in evolutionary history

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.760
indicate that these sorts of things

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.760
are much more inevitable than we once thought.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.760
So there is a sort of inevitable set of patterns that are going to occur in nature

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.760
despite a lot of the

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.760
accidental character of mutations. And I'm wondering what you think of that piece

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.760
and the comments you have on. I would certainly agree with Simon on that one

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:28.760
because I think that the evidence of convergence is so great that we can see

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.760
that the same kinds of teeth of occurring

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.760
in different kinds of vertebrates who eat similar kinds of things

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.760
that are totally unrelated from one another. We see that the same kinds of

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:44.760
what I was alluding to before of these empty ecological spaces that are occurring

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.760
and lots of different groups be they insects, be they bats, be they birds

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.760
which occur over and over and over again. I mean that there is

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.760
something which is just some physical constraint which is keeping

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.760
it out of that select that

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.760
we see things like that the sizes and shapes of eggs something that

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.760
our lab has studied and things that you see that

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.760
different groups which have lots of different sizes, lots of different kinds of things that they

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760
come up with the same shapes all the time. So they don't go way out of bounds.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760
So it's really a

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.760
I mean I think that if you were having the evolutionary tape over again

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.760
we might not be mammals, we might not be related to things. Maybe we

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.760
wouldn't exist but the kinds of biodiversity you see on the planet would be partitioned

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.760
pretty much the same way. Just like what was partitioned with totally different animals

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.760
during the Paleozoic period 200 million years ago and then when

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.760
the big extinction at the end of the Paleozoic it came back

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.760
during the Cretaceous period with the same kinds of reefs that came back again in the

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.760
Cenozoic as well with the same kinds of reefs the animals to a

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.760
non-biologist would look pretty much the same but they're totally unrelated to one another.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.760
I would add I contribute

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.760
the addendum that it's

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.760
this thing that you're describing is actually predictable and it's not only about the population of these beings

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.760
but actually the movement of these beings

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.760
the locomotion is in fact the physics. The shape of the egg is

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.760
physics is predictable. The frequency of the egg laying

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.760
is physics and is predictable.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.760
And the as the configuration of animal mass movement on the globe is

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.760
no different than the vascular configuration of

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.760
the movement of all the other water which is much older which is the water in the river basin

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.760
or the movement of air currents on the

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.760
surface of the globe. It's hierarchical and

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.760
with design. I did some reading

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.760
about my colleagues here and I developed

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.760
the questions and one is to you if you'd like to address it because time is running short.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.760
Would you comment on two things. One

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.760
I hear my colleagues in academia

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.760
ringing their hands about the conflict between science and religion

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.760
that's one and second about your own interest

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.760
and specialty and a theory of atonement.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.760
Well I think the theory of atonement

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.760
is going to be somewhat off topic but if you want me to comment on it I can

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.760
but in terms of is there a conflict between science

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.760
and religion I would say no I think science and religion

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.760
at a deeper level there's a superficial conflict. For example young

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.760
earth creationist with their literal interpretation of Genesis

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.760
is in conflict with what we know from

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.760
science that human beings

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.760
apes and other creatures are genetically related so there's

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.760
the common ancestry thesis but at a deeper level

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.760
I think the kind of let's say the belief in God in particular

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.760
and if you want to go more particularly Christian

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.760
the belief in logos the reason

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.760
that the world is an intelligible

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.760
whole and order in an intelligible way

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.760
is deeply consonant with science in fact most people

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.760
in fact all the people who began the scientific revolution

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.760
believed that and thought that Galileo thought that the

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.760
universe was written in the language of mathematics and likewise

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.760
Kepler but what you have to be careful of is

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.760
what level you're looking for this in

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.760
what level you attribute to chance and what level you

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.760
attribute to a more fundamental kind of design

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.760
for example Kepler in he spent

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.760
the early years trying to

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:01.760
figure out a mathematical order to the actual

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:05.760
distance the planets were away from the sun so we look for the

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:09.760
5 platonic solids and that never worked out because

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:13.760
the distance of planets are that's a matter of chance not necessity

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:17.760
but they're actual elliptical orbits and the speed in which they

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:21.760
go that's a matter of physical necessity so he finally eventually found the

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.760
three Kepler's three laws of motion which led to Newton

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.760
at that point so I would say no there's no

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.760
at a deep level there are consonant there's only this superficial

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.760
um conflict

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.760
I'm sorry what would you say but it sounds good to me

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.760
so I don't think the conflict

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.760
but I mean what we get from the popular image

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.760
is this conflict and it was also a thesis promoted by

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.760
which the historian friends of mine say and people are history

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.760
in the history of the science of religion whether or not

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.760
their believers are and god or not

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.760
like Anderson Dixon White I think he's the first president

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.760
of Cornell University promoted this perpetual conflict

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.760
thesis and history was really really bad history

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.760
the footnotes didn't go anywhere and so that

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.760
from the historian's perspective it's way more complex than that there's been

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.760
skirmishes but there's also been a lot of support for

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.760
science from the religious community so

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.760
it's it's it's it's

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.760
that would be my religion I mean

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.760
I would agree with all of this history absolutely I mean someone like Kepler

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:49.760
was deeply religious that's my understanding but

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.760
he also felt that that was perfectly compatible

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.760
with this this empirically studied quantitative

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.760
universe but I mean

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.760
he was even capable of taking quite risky

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:09.760
steps because my understanding is before Kepler people

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.760
assumed that the movement of planets was all in perfect circles

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.760
and Kepler took this leap to say well maybe they're ellipses

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.760
which is pretty shocking for someone

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.760
who was motivated by the idea of

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:29.760
the underlying idea of elegance that heavens were elegantly ordered would give you

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.760
perfect circles the most symmetrical but he was willing to break that but

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:37.760
it was still that underlying idea of an elegant order to the universe

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.760
it's just you can't be you can't get too fixated

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.760
on a certain version of that I mean Einstein got fixated on a certain version

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.760
of that and never could really accept quantum mechanics so

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.760
and sometimes a religious motivation

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.760
can be very helpful I mean the developer the Montre who developed

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.760
the big bang theory

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.760
was religious and it was people like Fred

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.760
Hoyle who opposed it

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.760
strongly until the evidence came in in the 1960s even then he opposed

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.760
I think he never did accept it he

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.760
couldn't imagine the universe having a beginning but somebody from

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:25.760
a kind of theistic perspective that was much easier to imagine

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.760
Einstein couldn't imagine the universe having a beginning and that's why he

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.760
introduced originally the cosmological constant to make to get an eternal

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.760
universe so in that particular case you can see that

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.760
actually the religious believed actually helped the acceptability

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.760
of that the big bang theory so you are saying

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:49.760
that the universe on a surface level religion and science

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.760
may seem not compatible but on a deeper level

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.760
they are compatible right how are they compatible

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.760
there I mean the idea of

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.760
theism that's what I was saying the idea that there's a god who created

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.760
the universe and intelligence behind it would lead you

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.760
to expect that there'd be in the structure of the universe would be

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:17.760
intelligible it would lead you to expect it would be an

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:21.760
elegant elegantly structured at a fundamental level so

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.760
and that we could understand and that's then a mainstay of science is that we

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.760
could actually understand the universe which wasn't given to us that we

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.760
most cultures didn't assume we could really understand the underlying nature of things

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:37.760
but how would you ever like as a scientist when you work in two

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.760
domains you work in mathematics where you work with mathematical proofs

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.760
then you work within the construct of an observational list which you test hypotheses

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.760
how is the idea of god a testable hypothesis

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:53.760
I mean how would you test that? well I mean the thing is you're demanding

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:57.760
that everything all your what you're assuming is

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.760
all knowledge is scientific knowledge and all the hypotheses you have about the world

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.760
can be gained by science I mean a simple reputation

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.760
of that is your own consciousness you'll never get to your own consciousness by a

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:13.760
scientific study you know your conscious because you're aware

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.760
I'm not sure I know my consciousness by a certain your conscious okay

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.760
or moral if you hold a moral throughs you're not getting them by means

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.760
of scientific investigation so I wouldn't subscribe to god

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.760
as a scientific hypothesis I think that's a big mistake to do that

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.760
so you can't

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.760
test god to test the god hypothesis isn't that a slippery slope

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.760
when it comes on to other things then and say well this is really scientific

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.760
well there could be evidence for things without being scientific evidence I mean

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.760
I think you have evidence in mathematics which is not strictly speaking empirical evidence

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.760
there's evidence I mentioned for but as a formality to it at least to

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.760
still prove so there's a difference between evidence and scientific evidence

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.760
scientific evidence is a narrow one particular area that's been very successful

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.760
of kinds of evidence but there's other kinds of evidence or reasons

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.760
that people could have let me clarify why I asked you about

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.760
science and religion both in the evolution

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.760
of Homo sapiens are add-ons they are

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.760
human constructs things we attach to ourselves

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.760
and the vice versa obviously in order to live

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.760
more easily science is obviously that

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:33.760
why do you think now in your own

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.760
specialty and domain why do you think

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.760
religion was

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.760
obviously invented, discovered and adopted by humans

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.760
a long time ago not the Simono Theis and

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.760
to which you are referring why is religion

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:57.760
that's a very complex question but I think it has two

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.760
there's a huge question but I would say

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.760
two things I think people do have a sense of the transcendent and so

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.760
on one side the philosophical side

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.760
they have a sense of the transcendent they have a sense of

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:17.760
moral value and once you have the sense of moral value

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.760
if you see let's say evil in the world

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:25.760
people that commit evil often

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.760
live better lives than those that do good then it seems morality

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.760
in many people's minds require that you know the

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.760
good ultimately are not worse off at least

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:41.760
than the evil are better officers there's a sort of what happens to a person

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.760
and but their moral character is eventually must

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.760
coincide so then you either get just on naturalistic

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.760
basis from those kind of things you either get a having a hell or reincarnation

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.760
system and then there's a sense of

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:01.760
transcendent reality I mean that counting

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.760
for maybe the order you see in the world that the world exists at all

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.760
but then on the there's a whole bunch more religion than that and there's a lot of

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.760
in sociological explanations religion helps

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.760
group cohesiveness and

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:23.760
we see that throughout the world so then there's a whole bunch of sociological issues

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.760
that arise which is another

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.760
big factor in religion and then if you believe in revelation then there can be

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.760
you know the revelatory side but if you just give a naturalistic or merely

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.760
philosophical account I think those are the two two big ones

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.760
and group cohesiveness from an evolutionary perspective is going to help the survival

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.760
of the grid but but there you go these things these good things that you're

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:51.760
enumerating could be contributed by a lover of science

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.760
all the way to wonderful mathematics better

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.760
engineering how to build the city

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.760
how to stay away from danger your name

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.760
the place okay so the urge the human

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.760
urge to live more easily save for longer

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.760
is in the very beginning and the earliest

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:19.760
version in my view at least the word knowledge of the history of man

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.760
the earliest way to

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:27.760
to put that urge to use meaning to use nature

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:31.760
to live with nature to live with the environment

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.760
was to was through religion

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.760
so I am I was curious to know whether

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.760
like many of my colleagues you you regard that you think that

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.760
people in religion should fear science and vice versa

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.760
people in science should fear religion to me they're all

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.760
in fact human religion being older

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.760
and a religion with science is definitely a much better

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.760
add-on than religion without science

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.760
why I agree religion with science is much better

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.760
than religion okay I'm going to go to questions

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.760
please come up to the microphone

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.760
please come up to the microphone and

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.760
thanks be gentle to the questions

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.760
and keep your comments in the form of a question

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:35.760
how you doing?

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.760
so the question that I have is

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:43.760
I guess pretty much I kind of like going off the last

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.760
thing given the fact that

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.760
okay so the question being couldn't mathematics itself be

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.760
quote unquote god right I'm putting in air quotes for a reason

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.760
or couldn't the not couldn't knowledge itself

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.760
be quote unquote god or couldn't sort of

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.760
the idea of like what you were saying before

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.760
in terms of like that transmutative

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.760
nature of things in and of itself

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:19.760
or pattern itself that we sort of

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.760
assign understanding to

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.760
couldn't that in and of itself be god like does

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.760
god necessarily have to be personification or

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.760
anthropomorphization of what we see

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.760
like couldn't the intelligence itself be god

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:43.760
thank you you want to tackle that yeah I'll tackle that

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.760
I think in the I mean the kind of popular image you get

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.760
of god as a god out there that's very anthropomorphic image and molding

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.760
things etc I mean when I think of god

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.760
I think of it just as that an underlying intelligence

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.760
that grounds everything so that the idea is is that if you

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.760
ask the question what is and I know you

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.760
have comments about fundamental what's when you go all the way back to reality

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.760
what do you find is reality ultimately impersonal is that the ultimate

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.760
story so is it just matter in motion for instance

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.760
or so and then consciousness arises out of matter

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.760
so consciousness is sort of an epiphenomenon of the material

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.760
or is that consciousness

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.760
is the most fundamental and then when you get consciousness you get mind

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.760
usually goes along with it and will and intelligence

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.760
and mathematics

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.760
has been the conceptualizations of that intelligence that's one view

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.760
of mathematics and so

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.760
in that conception of god then it's really thinking

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.760
that it's not an anthropomorphic conception of god out there but

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.760
a reality a conscious reality that's underlying and sustaining

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.760
everything and so that it's a question of which route

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.760
do you go at the very beginning of what's most fundamental

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:15.760
which leads you in these two different directions

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.760
let me also address your points first of all

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:23.760
mathematics is not physics physics is nature

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.760
physics is what happens I like the

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.760
Latin version of it nature or notura which is the personification

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.760
of into a lady who gives birth to everything

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.760
so that is physics now in the history of science the

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.760
description and the reasoning of these things that we've seen

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.760
nature came first meaning was born out of this

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.760
notura as geometry

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.760
and that was a very cumbersome argument

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.760
to teach all the way to

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.760
the school of Plato which said

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.760
he who cannot do geometry is not allowed to enter

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.760
very difficult so then it was simplified

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:15.760
algebra, trigonometry

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:19.760
or calculus so in the beginning geometric arguments

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:23.760
from Newton and so mathematics is a

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.760
evolutionary process of simplifying the

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.760
book of physics that's what it is

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.760
so no English is a much simpler language

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.760
than say French and Latin that's why

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.760
English now has taken the world taken over the world

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760
I would disagree just like I didn't make it to screen

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.760
I think in many cases actually the mathematics preceded the physics like I mentioned

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.760
the complex numbers so it wasn't actually useful in physics to quantum

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:59.760
mechanics in the 1930s but complex numbers

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.760
in fact I think it goes back to the 17

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.760
imaginary numbers in the development of the complex number system

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:11.760
in the 18th and 19th century

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.760
clarify just a second the name for the discipline

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:19.760
is new it comes from the second half of the 1800s

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.760
before that it was called mechanics and it is

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.760
called as the Greeks and mechanics is the science of

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.760
figures, bodies

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:35.760
well the ones that statically were described as geometry now these things

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:39.760
the pulleys, the ropes, the buildings, the making of the buildings

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.760
was mechanics the building of the ditches and trenches and roads

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:47.760
so mechanics is the original name for what I was talking about but the question was

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:51.760
could mathematics be God so if you say physics

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.760
could be God?

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.760
well I understand that there are all God's laws

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.760
okay so there's the end to that okay next question

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:07.760
I'm wondering in considering these difficult questions

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:11.760
whether the panelists are really so sure themselves

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.760
as it appears why so difficult people say I don't really

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.760
know it seems obvious to me given the dispute amongst

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.760
you all that no one really knows

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:27.760
do you have doubts or do you really think you're right

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.760
did you do know about what about life

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.760
why things are the way they are?

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.760
that's where scientists we don't know

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.760
but I did not say the beginning of the question because they don't hear

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.760
well would you speak slow enough? this one you have people can be so sure

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.760
themselves about why things are the way they are

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:55.760
given the arguments and disputes and why people can't say I don't know

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.760
it seems like a lot of these questions people really don't know

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.760
but very few people they may share with them

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.760
in secret yes yeah before this meeting started

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.760
we're having a round table in a back room there

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.760
and Dr. Narcissianne

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.760
you brought up the fact that most people think they know more

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.760
than they know I wanted to add to that

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.760
that most professors think they know more than they know

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.760
except England so

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.760
that's the way we are okay and very few

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.760
except those who are in a hurry to go home after a lecture

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.760
or a conference say gee I don't excellent question but

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.760
I don't know so it's a useful answer

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.760
to many of these questions but the urge

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.760
to pursue the question especially when it arrives

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.760
unexpectedly out of an honest audience

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.760
that courage is actually very valuable

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.760
and from me to my students they're very important to teach

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.760
because most people do not get it that they're actually

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.760
free to question authority thank you

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:19.760
if you can't propose some experiment that would prove you're wrong

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.760
or right make some prediction and say we're going to do some experiment to show

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:27.760
it comes out the way I think it does or doesn't do how is that different

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:31.760
than you did the work and physics theory is full of these examples

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.760
but in terms of your theory oh sure

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.760
here is the story of I predicted the evolution

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:43.760
of the speed and sports I predicted it that was in the spring

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.760
of 2008 that was months before the Beijing Olympics

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.760
I predicted that the next winners in sprint ends will be

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.760
bigger okay and with a mathematical formula

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.760
very simple a equals b kind of formula

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.760
and I submitted this as a letter to nature

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.760
with a cover letter in which I said that dear editors

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.760
my colleagues please publish this immediately because in just two months

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.760
from now this will be shown to be correct and they of course

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:19.760
because I'm from engineering decided not even

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:23.760
to review my contribution

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.760
my contribution was on the rebound published a few months

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:31.760
later in the Journal of Experimental Biology in Cambridge not a lightweight journal

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.760
meaning here are the facts

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:39.760
comparative biology journal

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.760
but in Beijing in July my prediction

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.760
turned out to be correct I do not predict the names

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.760
of the winners but I predicted their sizes and their speeds

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.760
you see but that's not proving a fundamental physical

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.760
law or all it is as it is as proving a retrospect

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.760
meaning a hindsight that everything that you brought up

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.760
earlier with the insects and the so-called convergent evolution

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.760
should be happening this way that the

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:15.760
bigger should be faster not just you know waving your hands

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.760
but in a long this in accord with this precise formula

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:23.760
that is to predict that it was not questioned

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.760
in the past is the proof that you are waiting

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.760
oh the question how many predictions did you make that didn't come true that we never heard about

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:39.760
the doctor already comes in the fact that that has not happened yet

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.760
okay thank you you want to say something

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:47.760
I do do you have time

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.760
I just have a couple of comments I really enjoyed this it's wonderful I haven't thought this much

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:55.760
about these issues since college and until the last selection of course

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.760
and I wanted to make a couple of comments

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.760
and they would raise questions regarding the existence

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.760
of God I think the gentleman in a lighter jacket I

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.760
was here late so I don't really have all your names

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.760
mentioned that you can't test the existence of God unless I got that wrong

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.760
and if that is true then how can you describe God that's one question

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.760
you might want to reference a show

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:27.760
that Stephen Colbert had a few weeks ago a few months ago where Ricky Gervais

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:31.760
was there and he proposed a following thought experiment

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.760
which is that if humanity were wiped out or all civilization were wiped out

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.760
what would we recreate the same religions or

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.760
would we recreate the same physics and mathematics which is more likely

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.760
and Colbert was I think stunned by that which is

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.760
impressive considering his deep religious beliefs and his mind

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.760
I also wanted to comment on what you mentioned

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:59.760
about what I think is synchronicity which is kind of

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.760
parallel well I guess parallel evolutionary

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.760
appearances due to different processes and I think that's an important thing

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.760
to keep in mind and the last thing I want to say is I did some research

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.760
when I was a resident I'm a pathologist by training

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:19.760
that did describe symmetries in biology which I can discuss

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.760
with you privately if you're interested that speak to some very basic

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:27.760
primal mathematical principles I don't think it ever saw the light of day

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.760
but it was fascinating sorry a lot

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.760
so the two of you I think are questions

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.760
I think what I heard you write you said

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.760
if you can't test whether God exists how can you describe

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.760
God well I mean we don't have

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760
I can describe God how an idea what consciousness is because I'm conscious

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.760
and I have an idea of what being an agent is and knowledge is

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.760
so I don't see where you'd have to test something to be able to

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:03.760
describe it I could describe on

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.760
a very very distant planet that is

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.760
what physicists would say is outside our light cone which means we'll never

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.760
be able to determine whether it's there or not I can describe

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.760
there's a certain kind of being on the planet let's say a unicorn to view a description of

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.760
the unicorn so I can describe without ever being able to test

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.760
whether that's the case or that there's extraterrestrial intelligence

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.760
outside our light cone so I don't see how the two are connected

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.760
together I think you'd have to have some sort of

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.760
access to the properties you're using to describe the thing but

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:43.760
that doesn't require an ability to be able to test whether it exists or not

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.760
would you like to comment sure yeah first I'll just

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.760
say that I like to think of God as a flying spaghetti monster

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.760
that's a big movement among evolutionary biologists to

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.760
recast religion of flying spaghetti monster but with regard

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.760
to synchronicity and convergence I mean one of

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.760
an interesting topic that's come up in evolutionary biology recently

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.760
is trying to understand convergence not just

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.760
from the framework of

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.760
a common natural selective force which is always how

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.760
since Darwin it's been interpreted when you see two things that look the same

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.760
you say aha they're under similar adaptive pressure

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.760
but now I think with new

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:35.760
new tools genomics new tools

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.760
and developmental biology and cell biology we can start to understand

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.760
the kind of canalization that is the molecular it constraints the molecular

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.760
level that drive convergence in ways that

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.760
may not be as related to adaptive pressure as we think

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:55.760
thank you any other questions

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.760
it seems to me that all of the members of the panel

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:07.760
with the exception of Professor

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:15.760
Bajan would be successfully avoided the topic at hand and I think the topic at hand is

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.760
it says design and nature

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.760
is really is there design and nature and what I heard from

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.760
Professor Bajan was that nature

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:31.760
designs itself and it does it through the mechanism of evolution

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:35.760
which is underpinned by the law of physics

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:39.760
and that means and that really is

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:43.760
something which is in its own way post creation

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.760
or post development in some way so it still leaves open

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.760
the question as to whether or not there was design

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.760
or a designer how did evolution how did the law of physics

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.760
come about?

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:05.760
who wants to tackle that? Let me read a brief

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.760
in my latest book The Physics of Life the answer

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.760
to your point is I agree with what you bring up

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:17.760
is that evolution

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:21.760
which really means changing design with the

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:25.760
perceivable discernible direction over time

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.760
was one earth and everything

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.760
everywhere else from the beginning

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:37.760
and I just want to follow up with a better understanding

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.760
of the nature design and nature. You understand what the living is

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.760
and I think the water flowing down here

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.760
and the water flowing down here

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.760
wants to keep moving then it keeps trying various ways

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.760
of doing and it starts to look just

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.760
that you destroy that or you destroy that

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.760
as an evolution and a removal of part of the water.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:09.760
It's a survival of... it's an evolution of the flow

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:13.760
architecture and the river basin is just one part of it

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:17.760
it's the circuit executed by water in nature

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.760
first there is the rain the rain falls on the ground

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.760
the droplets while falling down

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.760
a quiet shape that tends to

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.760
minimize drag. There we go. So that's the

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:37.760
quality embryo that gives birth to the river basin

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.760
river basin is the wet mud in the beginning then you have the

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.760
riverlets and then the hill slopes and the rivers

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.760
and so all the way to the delta you forgot to mention delta which is the river basin

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:53.760
and then the river is just like the breathing in and breathing out

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.760
and then there is what happens to the water from the river

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.760
basin either evaporation from the ocean or from the Kalahari desert

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:05.760
in the case of the Oka-Langua delta. So and then

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.760
the evaporated humid air is light and it rises

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.760
with the undulating rivers you see meandering rivers

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:17.760
of plumes which then circulate on the

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.760
same world map as the winds more easily

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.760
so this entire so this is where I actually asked you about

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.760
the atonement it's about not only the thing that

01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.760
you bring up which is the river basin it's about the river basin

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.760
flowing together with everything else with the so-called environment

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:41.760
or with the nature itself so the physics

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.760
is holistic the laws of physics are

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.760
obeyed by anything everywhere and anytime

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:53.760
and that's why this discussion at this topic I

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.760
commend you for putting it together as a title is extremely timely

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.760
and it is not about biology it is not about technology evolution

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.760
either it's in fact it's about everything

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.760
that has evolving design. Okay so maybe okay so

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.760
okay so I'll just say you know design

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.760
for me is such a loaded word as a scientist

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:21.760
because the last thing I want to say is that anything is designed

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:25.760
because I don't believe that I don't think anything is designed

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:29.760
design is something we impose after the fact on

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.760
what we see around us and it's because of our squirmy little

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.760
mammalian brains doing the things but

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.760
it doesn't mean that there aren't some really extraordinary questions

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:45.760
and big questions so for example 13.8 billion

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:49.760
years ago the Big Bang the universe was not the way it is now

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.760
it was extremely uniform it was hot it had

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.760
almost no structure to it somehow 13.8

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.760
billion years later it's made structures out of itself

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.760
capable of recognizing that fact

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.760
that's a big question right I mean that and it's a big scientific question

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:13.760
for me and I think that's you know that's the

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.760
more interesting thing how did that happen I agree

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.760
it's physics but I don't know how to connect all the dots

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.760
from 13.8 billion years ago to today and I feel that

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.760
sometimes I look you know we the fact

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.760
that we impose this notion of design and form and shape

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:37.760
and elegance and beauty on the world around us

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:41.760
has been useful in some respects but we don't know if that's the best thing

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:45.760
to do for unearthing the deeper truths I don't know

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.760
I really don't so I just wanted to put that out there and I just wanted to say

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.760
I say design to me and I kind of go into a quivering

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.760
and as I want to run out the door just to say that

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.760
let me know too well do you want to say something

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.760
well not really I mean to me like it's like you know being a scientist

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.760
for me it's not about like figuring out the big questions and all this other kind of stuff

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.760
is just I'm just no seriously I just do it because it's fun

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.760
it's creative like you know like I mean it's like that when we discovered like

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.760
it's like you know I'm known for studying dinosaurs and I can't stand dinosaurs

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.760
but you know it's just a way which

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:31.760
like you know when we figured out what color dinosaurs were it's not like we cared we just wanted to see if we were clever enough to do it

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.760
and to figure out a way that we could use the quantum radiation and stuff to be able to like do it

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.760
and that you know so I can mean a lot of it is just

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:45.760
it's just that because it gives us a you know I use science as a mechanism for us to be able to

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:49.760
you know understand all the way from the most fundamental questions in the world

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:55.760
to like the lint of figuring out what color one kind of dinosaur was 130 million years ago so like that it's just

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.760
it allows us to be able to do that in a repeatable and fundamental way by

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:03.760
you know using mathematics but using technology by asking the right questions

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:07.760
and it's just a way to approach the world in that way so

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.760
Anybody else?

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.760
Okay. Can I ask you another question?

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Oh yes you can ask another question.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.760
So

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:25.760
So what is there?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.760
It's there.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.760
Just fine. I can tell everybody can hear me.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:33.760
In terms of like

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:37.760
so in terms of sort of like

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.760
answering this question

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.760
wouldn't answering the question require like

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.760
some sort of multi-field understanding

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.760
that for the most part like

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.760
well that's two questions

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.760
so wouldn't it require some sort of multi-field understanding that we're just not

01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:01.760
really capable of in any one's

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.760
particular 90 year lifetime?

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.760
It's probably intractable. I mean there's nothing wrong with that.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:09.760
There's nothing wrong with saying we can't do that and I don't know that

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.760
because like one of the things I was thinking of was like

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:17.760
in terms of even just for example I was watching a documentary on

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:21.760
Einstein and it was a situation where like he ran into

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.760
mathematics problems and so it was

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.760
a situation where like there was a race between him and another mathematician

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.760
who was older than he was and you know and he's trying to

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.760
figure things out you know and a lot of

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.760
situations where I think you know where you know yeah

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.760
like physics and science and psychology and all these other things

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:47.760
I teach a

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.760
course and I was just talking with this gentleman on the fact that Carl Jung

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.760
for example knew a lot and consulted with people outside

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.760
of his field you know to answer a lot of different questions and even as

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.760
myself as an English teacher

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.760
I often bring up things in terms of

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.760
science and all these other things that I'm learning about and constantly trying to say

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.760
that I mean in terms of that understanding of like convergence

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.760
I think that would be necessary for understanding

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:21.760
the underlying sort of intelligence

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.760
that there is to creation and then the second thing is

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:29.760
going back to

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:33.760
what you guys were initially talking about in terms of the fact that

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.760
you know the dynamic is always

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:41.760
changing that you know and going

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:45.760
to your question which is

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.760
you know don't we isn't there always a situation

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:53.760
where we don't know you know like I think as some

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.760
I was reading something when they were saying at the edge of the chaos in the world

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.760
is always creation right so isn't there always a situation

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.760
where and if we if we're ever

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:09.760
if we were ever to say this is God then wouldn't that be the end of

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.760
the morning okay so that's your question okay

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.760
you can ask

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.760
the time is it

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.760
your view of it is in fact

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.760
in the right direction the first of all the design is basically a movie

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:33.760
not a sketch in a zoology book

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:37.760
okay that's the first thing the second

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.760
there is no end to evolution the speaks of the

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.760
of the you call it the edge of chaos

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.760
I don't use the word chaos because it means

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.760
I don't know anything meaning I give up it's like turbulence

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.760
so but anyway there is that's the good news that

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.760
there is always a flow architecture

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.760
in the future that will be serving us better

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.760
and what you call it is really

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.760
not only up to you but depends on your upbringing

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.760
some of us have

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:21.760
have gotten both the religion and science others have gotten only the first

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.760
others have only gotten the second but

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:29.760
but every single one of us has the urge to to to to live

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.760
I'm talking about including my cat the urge to to live more easily

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:37.760
or save for longer and

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.760
all the rest again but your question question was

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:45.760
if there's a god should we just stop questioning anything

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:49.760
is that what you were enjoying the fun experience of

01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.760
living under Trump yeah

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.760
yeah no but I think it's not about I mean I guess

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.760
right it's gonna mean right depends right if if if you don't believe in God

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:05.760
right then you're gonna keep questioning and if you do believe in God you have a choice

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.760
right and historically many people who believe in God were

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.760
also scientists and kept questioning the world around them and unveiling

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.760
the majesty of whatever I mean it's just different motivation

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.760
you know someone like me is not motivated that way and even if you told me

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.760
there is a god I go nah nah not really nah

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.760
I'm just not gonna go there

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:33.760
and every year is like what do I believe in

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:37.760
I'd say I believe in the Lord. I feel that's an excellent answer

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.760
I think that's an excellent answer. One last comment

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:45.760
I was just gonna say I think in that's really like some

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.760
theory, a theory or anything and those who want to talk about

01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.760
the quantum creation of reality end up needing

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.760
to hypothesize like the mathematics of quantum mechanics that is

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:01.760
not instantiated anywhere it's just mathematics and that somehow

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:05.760
something that mathematics has given

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:09.760
being so I'm just trying to clarify I think that was your and if you got

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:13.760
to that final theory whether it's a personal god or not

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.760
with questioning

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.760
well you might not be searching for the ultimate explanation anymore but there

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.760
would be a lot of other things to explore.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:29.760
Thank you.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:33.760
Thank you very much.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.760
Thank you very much.

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.760
Thank you.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:45.760
Thank you very much.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.760
Yeah.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:57.760
Thank you.
