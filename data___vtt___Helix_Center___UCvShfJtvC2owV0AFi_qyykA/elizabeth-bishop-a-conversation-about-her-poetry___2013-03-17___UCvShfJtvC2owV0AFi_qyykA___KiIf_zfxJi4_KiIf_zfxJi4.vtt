00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
I'm Ed Nersesian Director of the Helix Center and I want to welcome you to today's program

00:06.080 --> 00:14.320
on Elizabeth Bishop that was organized by the Chair of our Poetry Program, David Paulins,

00:14.320 --> 00:17.620
who will introduce the participants.

00:17.620 --> 00:24.000
Just to tell you the programs we have planned, on April 13th we have a program on Music,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.040
Emotion and Mind.

00:26.040 --> 00:37.120
On April 27th the program is on Curiosity and Ignorance and I think it's May 10th or

00:37.120 --> 00:38.920
something like that.

00:38.920 --> 00:46.680
We have a program, what's that one?

00:46.680 --> 00:50.920
No, it's not on memory.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.520
Should be on memory.

00:53.520 --> 00:58.120
Oh, it's a program on a subject.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.920
We all need to learn more about which is synthetic and systemic biology.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.400
Thank you.

01:06.400 --> 01:13.520
Well, welcome everybody to our talk today about Elizabeth Bishop.

01:13.520 --> 01:19.520
We have a fabulous group of poets and scholars and editors all deeply connected to the work

01:19.520 --> 01:21.200
of Elizabeth Bishop.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.240
I'll introduce them.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.160
Bonnie Castello is a professor at Boston University.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.760
She's here on my right.

01:28.760 --> 01:33.960
She's the author of Marian Moore Imaginary Possessions, Elizabeth Bishop Questions of

01:33.960 --> 01:39.120
Mastery and the general editor of the selected Letters of Marian Moore.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.840
Her more recent literary studies include Shifting Ground and Planets on Tables.

01:45.840 --> 01:50.480
Ms. Castello is currently working on pronoun trouble, Auden and others in the first person

01:50.480 --> 01:51.960
plural.

01:51.960 --> 01:56.880
Alice Quinn is the executive director of the Poetry Society of America and an adjunct

01:56.880 --> 02:01.040
professor at the Graduate School of the Art at Columbia University.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.960
She was the Poetry editor of the New Yorker for two decades and before that was an editor

02:04.960 --> 02:06.960
at Alfred Knopf.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.160
Ms. Quinn compiled the collection of Elizabeth Bishop's unpublished work in Edgar Allan Poe

02:11.160 --> 02:18.000
and the Jukebox, Uncollected Poems, Drafts and Fragments, which appeared in 2006.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.320
She's currently preparing a collection of Elizabeth Bishop's journals and notebooks.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.360
Lloyd Schwartz is the Frederick S. Troy Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts

02:27.360 --> 02:29.240
in Boston.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.040
In addition to being a poet and literary critic, Mr. Schwartz is the classical music editor of

02:34.040 --> 02:39.480
the Boston Phoenix and a regular commentator in NPR's Fresh Air.

02:39.480 --> 02:45.000
In 1994 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism for his writing on music.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.840
He is co-editor of Elizabeth Bishop and her art, a collection of essays on the poet and

02:49.840 --> 02:55.000
the Library of America's edition of her collected works, Elizabeth Bishop, Poems, Proves and

02:55.000 --> 02:56.520
Letters.

02:56.520 --> 03:03.400
His own poems have been included in the Best American Poetry and the Pushcart Prize, Anthologies.

03:03.400 --> 03:09.440
Gene Valentine, sitting between Lloyd and Alice, her first book, Dream Barker and Other Poems,

03:09.440 --> 03:13.320
won the Yale Younger Poets Prize in 1965.

03:13.320 --> 03:19.400
Laura in the Mountain, New and Collected Poems, 1965, 2003, won the National Book Award in

03:19.400 --> 03:21.240
2004.

03:21.240 --> 03:27.960
And her most recent book, Break the Glass, was a finalist for the 2011 Pulitzer Prize.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.440
Ms. Valentine has received grants and fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, the National

03:32.440 --> 03:36.440
Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation.

03:36.440 --> 03:40.720
She's been awarded the Shelley Memorial Award for the Poetry Society of America and the Wallace

03:40.720 --> 03:43.880
Stevens Award by the American Academy of Poets.

03:43.880 --> 03:49.400
She was the state poet of New York from 2008 to 2010.

03:49.400 --> 03:56.360
So if people saw the announcement for today's event, they can see that attention was drawn

03:56.360 --> 04:03.040
to Elizabeth Bishop's powers of observation, which has been noted by many of the people

04:03.040 --> 04:05.640
who've read her poetry closely.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.960
And I'm just going to make a couple of comments about that.

04:07.960 --> 04:13.720
And I'll just quote some things that she has said in referring to her maternal grandmother,

04:13.720 --> 04:20.280
she says, my grandmother had a glass eye, blue, almost like her other one.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.760
And this made her especially vulnerable and precious to me.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.760
My father was dead and my mother was away in a sanatorium.

04:28.760 --> 04:33.280
Until I was teased out of it, I used to ask grandmother when I said goodbye to promise

04:33.280 --> 04:37.520
me not to die before I came home.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.200
And then about her paternal grandfather, she said, he was wall-eyed.

04:41.200 --> 04:47.160
At least one eye turned the wrong way, which made him endlessly interesting to me.

04:47.160 --> 04:53.920
And then in a letter to her from Robert Lowell, he says, no eye in the world has seen what

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
yours has.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.840
And starting with that, I'll turn to our participants to respond.

04:59.840 --> 05:09.120
If I could just add one little anecdote, Robert Lowell introduced Elizabeth Bishop, which she

05:09.120 --> 05:11.840
was giving a reading at the Guggenheim Museum.

05:11.840 --> 05:15.120
And he referred to her famous eye.

05:15.120 --> 05:23.960
When she got on stage, she announced that the famous eye will now put on her glasses.

05:23.960 --> 05:32.960
We were trying to think before downstairs where it was that we read Mary McCarthy, a

05:32.960 --> 05:41.120
vassar classmates description of Bishop's eye as like a great magnifying glass.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.400
And she said, of course, the forfeit would be that you'd have to look at everything with

05:45.400 --> 05:46.480
that eye.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.080
So I think she thought Bishop was a little touchy.

05:49.080 --> 05:56.720
Well, I'll play sort of counterpoint to this just a bit, because I was drawn to Bishop as

05:56.720 --> 05:57.920
a great describer.

05:57.920 --> 06:02.720
I had been reading Mary Ann Moore for a long time, and Mary Ann Moore, as probably some

06:02.720 --> 06:06.640
of you know, was kind of a mentor to Elizabeth Bishop.

06:06.640 --> 06:11.200
And I have always loved description and poetry.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.960
But I think one of the things that happened is that Bishop was such a great describer.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.280
That people's highest tribute to her was her accuracy.

06:21.280 --> 06:30.000
And they missed often how deeply intelligent her poems are, how much psychological resonance

06:30.000 --> 06:32.280
they have.

06:32.280 --> 06:40.200
When I teach Bishop, I love to pass around a New Yorker cartoon that Saul Steinberg did.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.040
And it's of a man in the middle of a spiral.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.960
And at the end of the spiral, he's got a pen in his hand.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.320
And at the end of the spiral, there's a landscape.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.040
But it spins back to him.

06:51.040 --> 06:57.680
And that always made me think about Bishop, that to describe something is always to find

06:57.680 --> 07:06.480
out something about yourself, to come back to the self in some new way that you can't

07:06.480 --> 07:09.080
know about the self only by turning inward.

07:09.080 --> 07:14.080
But it's this constant engagement with the sense or with the visual field, especially

07:14.080 --> 07:18.640
in Bishop's case, I think, that enriches that knowledge.

07:18.640 --> 07:25.480
And it can be self-forgetful, of course, loss of self through engagement with the visual

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
world.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.040
But I think ultimately the knowledge of the self comes back.

07:30.040 --> 07:39.440
And so I think often critics, there was a kind of not damning with faint praise, but

07:39.440 --> 07:45.440
a lack of recognition of the profundity of her poetry, because there was so much attention

07:45.440 --> 07:47.840
to its visual accuracy at first.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.960
So it's just a little counterpoint maybe to...

07:51.960 --> 07:58.760
And just to go back to what Alice was thinking about what Mary McCarthy said, it made me

07:58.760 --> 08:05.840
think of this passage in Crusoe in England, which is, if you don't know, the poem to one

08:05.840 --> 08:10.440
of Bishop's most ambitious and one of her longest poems.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.040
And it's a poem in the voice of Robinson Crusoe.

08:14.040 --> 08:19.200
It's also, it seems to me, one of her most autobiographical poems.

08:19.200 --> 08:26.520
And there's this amazing moment, like I'm chilling moment, where Robinson Crusoe says,

08:26.520 --> 08:34.320
and part of the autobiographical background is that Bishop lived in Brazil for many years,

08:34.320 --> 08:37.080
almost 20 years.

08:37.080 --> 08:43.240
You could call it an exile and you could call it a kind of salvation in some ways.

08:43.240 --> 08:52.000
But he says, Crusoe says, I'd have nightmares of other islands stretching away from mine,

08:52.000 --> 09:00.080
infinities of islands, islands spawning islands like frogs, eggs turning into polywads of islands,

09:00.080 --> 09:06.400
knowing that I had to live on each and every one, eventually for ages registering their

09:06.400 --> 09:10.160
flora, their fauna, their geography.

09:10.160 --> 09:19.800
So that sense that the price of seeing everything so clearly is that you had to see everything

09:19.800 --> 09:23.440
and there was no way of stopping.

09:23.440 --> 09:28.200
I think Jean is going to read, you were thinking of reading North Haven, the poem to Robert

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Lowell.

09:29.200 --> 09:39.920
In Bishop's last notebook, her last formal notebook, there are other little notebooks

09:39.920 --> 09:41.400
she carried around.

09:41.400 --> 09:48.600
But she is up early in the morning in North Haven, sitting on the porch at about six o'clock.

09:48.600 --> 09:55.480
And she's decided to take the wildflower guide and to write down the name of every flower

09:55.480 --> 09:58.120
that she can see from the porch.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.280
And it's about this many flowers, but it's preceded by her writing.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.840
I want now that it's too late to learn the name of everything.

10:06.840 --> 10:13.120
She really did have that delight.

10:13.120 --> 10:22.800
Bonnie talked about critics praising Bishop's accuracy and not her depth.

10:22.800 --> 10:30.160
And there's a wonderful passage in a draft that I think Alice discovered or found at

10:30.160 --> 10:40.400
Vassar of some sort of lecture or article that Bishop was going to give and never finished

10:40.400 --> 10:43.640
called writing poetry is impossible.

10:43.640 --> 10:58.680
And she says in this, and I think this is the statement that we should all remember Bishop

10:58.680 --> 11:05.760
making because it's a profoundly self-reflexive.

11:05.760 --> 11:19.480
She talks about the qualities she admires in the poetry she likes most, our accuracy, spontaneity,

11:19.480 --> 11:22.040
and mystery.

11:22.040 --> 11:32.880
And what an amazing conglomeration of different and yet overlapping things.

11:32.880 --> 11:40.400
And of course it's very funny about, I mean, she's sort of so famous for being accurate.

11:40.400 --> 11:48.880
And yet we know those of us who have really studied her poems that she was perfectly capable

11:48.880 --> 11:52.520
of making things up and was very nervous.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.520
80 watt bulbs and things like that, right?

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
Yeah.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.920
Has anybody ever seen an 80 watt light bulb?

11:59.920 --> 12:06.840
Well, she, and in one of her really greatest poems in the waiting room, she talks about

12:06.840 --> 12:13.080
this issue of the National Geographic which was the issue that came out on her seventh

12:13.080 --> 12:14.480
birthday.

12:14.480 --> 12:20.800
And she describes in detail all these things that are in that issue.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.320
And they're not in that issue.

12:23.320 --> 12:32.200
And that people have written articles about the half a dozen issues of the National Geographic

12:32.200 --> 12:38.800
that came out the year of her seventh birthday where a lot of these things are there.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.880
But they're not in the February 1918 issues.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.760
But it's true to memory.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
It's true to memory.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.560
Memory does that too.

12:47.560 --> 12:54.480
But yeah, except that she knew she was making this up and as Alice said, she was really

12:54.480 --> 13:00.440
worried about New Yorker fact checkers.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.400
And they did check.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.240
And she said, right, right.

13:05.240 --> 13:14.760
And I heard her tell me, what's the thing when you have time with the crew so it works?

13:14.760 --> 13:19.400
And she said, I know.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.760
Yes, right.

13:20.760 --> 13:26.480
She has in that poem in the Crusoe in England, she has Robinson Crusoe trying to remember

13:26.480 --> 13:30.280
a line that is a famous line by Wordsworth.

13:30.280 --> 13:37.880
And the New Yorker fact checkers pointed out that Wordsworth came much later, you know,

13:37.880 --> 13:42.960
the next century, or, you know, in the next century from Robinson Crusoe.

13:42.960 --> 13:52.120
And she said, yeah, I know.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.840
I love the tents of I shant and lied.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.880
Even losing you, I shant and lied.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.880
It's very bizarre.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.880
Who says shant anyway?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
But where is that?

14:01.880 --> 14:02.880
Yeah, right.

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
Right.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.880
Right.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
She was thrown back, wasn't it?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.880
Yeah, grandparents, do you think?

14:08.880 --> 14:09.880
Yeah.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.480
Well, I think that's the phrase safe as houses.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.480
That's a very old-

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
Safe as houses.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.800
My grandmother used to say safe as houses.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.800
Yes.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
Really?

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
Oh, yeah.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.240
And your grandmother was from English?

14:21.240 --> 14:22.240
English.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.240
My English grandmother.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.240
Oh, this was not the Canadian.

14:25.240 --> 14:29.000
No, not the Canadian one, the English one.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.840
One of the things that we were talking about, the temporality of the Crusoe poem, and when

14:35.840 --> 14:45.560
we think about Bishop as a visual poet primarily, we not only want to remind ourselves of the

14:45.560 --> 14:52.800
profundity of the accumulated meaning that's coming through detail rather than some imposition

14:52.800 --> 14:56.400
of symbols into the poem.

14:56.400 --> 15:02.320
But we also, I think, want to be aware that while she's a great describer, she also has

15:02.320 --> 15:09.080
a sense of time in motion, and often her landscapes will be surprisingly, they'll be

15:09.080 --> 15:10.760
like time lapses.

15:10.760 --> 15:15.840
You can feel spring happening as she's describing a hill.

15:15.840 --> 15:21.160
We're often in this kind of space that's half time and half space that is the space

15:21.160 --> 15:23.560
of the mind, partly.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.480
And there are many poems that do that.

15:25.480 --> 15:32.160
And it's a little unsettling at times because you get disoriented in what is the

15:32.160 --> 15:33.160
sequence.

15:33.160 --> 15:40.120
The standard here, you know, or the measure, but she's so interested in that, the psychology

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
of space.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.520
But maybe disoriented is okay.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.440
Bigger party?

15:45.440 --> 15:46.960
Maybe disoriented is okay.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.680
Well, it's a place of discovery, certainly, right?

15:49.680 --> 15:53.680
Yeah, and I'm thinking of that distorted and revealed.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.720
Drowning passage, you know.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.720
Yeah.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.520
Does somebody have that to read?

15:58.520 --> 16:00.280
I do have it to read.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
Yeah.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.080
I didn't mean to.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
No, no, please.

16:04.080 --> 16:09.520
I think it's from a letter to Anne Stevenson who wrote the first book on Bishop and sent

16:09.520 --> 16:12.280
her lots of questions in Brazil.

16:12.280 --> 16:18.720
And Bishop sent her back a very significant, manifestly important letter about seven pages

16:18.720 --> 16:20.720
long, and this is a passage.

16:20.720 --> 16:24.320
Oh, this is a bit long, but I think it's worth it.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.720
It's not terribly long.

16:26.720 --> 16:33.160
There's the gap between the observed world and the unknown, the psychic one, is something

16:33.160 --> 16:39.480
that disturbs Bishop and her early work, and something that only long experience helped

16:39.480 --> 16:40.480
her to overcome.

16:40.480 --> 16:46.600
30 years later, she's able to speak as if there were no conflict.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.720
There is no split.

16:48.720 --> 16:54.000
This is Bishop.

16:54.000 --> 17:02.000
Dreams, works of art, some, glimpses of moments of empathy, is it?

17:02.000 --> 17:09.360
Catch a peripheral vision of whatever it is one can never really see full face, but that

17:09.360 --> 17:12.400
seems enormously important.

17:12.400 --> 17:19.840
I can't believe we are wholly irrational, and I do admire Darwin, but reading Darwin

17:19.840 --> 17:28.360
one admires the beautiful, solid case being built up of his endless, heroic observations.

17:28.360 --> 17:31.480
I tell us a hust.

17:31.480 --> 17:39.440
Almost unconscious or automatic, and then comes a sudden relaxation, a forgetful phrase, and

17:39.440 --> 17:47.360
one feels the strangeness of his undertaking, sees the lonely young man, his eyes fixed

17:47.360 --> 17:56.560
on facts and minute details, sinking or sliding giddily off into the unknown.

17:56.560 --> 18:03.120
What one seems to want in art, she goes on, in experiencing it, is the same thing that

18:03.120 --> 18:10.760
is necessary for its creation, a self-forgetful, perfectly useless concentration.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.440
It's good in it.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.360
But when you said disorienting, I thought of them.

18:18.360 --> 18:25.000
You know, one of the things I love about that passage that you reinforced in the way you

18:25.000 --> 18:30.880
really performed it for us is how she's always in the moment when she's writing, so that

18:30.880 --> 18:36.080
there are all these interjections, the parentheses, the questioning of what she's just asserted.

18:36.080 --> 18:43.000
There are so many ways that Bishop achieves that in poetry, sometimes by using a word

18:43.000 --> 18:50.040
like here, where you just become very present in whatever the thought process is.

18:50.040 --> 18:54.920
I think even there, when she's answering the question from a literary critic, you feel

18:54.920 --> 18:57.720
her kind of thinking it through anew.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.800
So it's very exciting.

18:59.800 --> 19:04.320
It's like her poems in that way.

19:04.320 --> 19:12.120
You remind me of another really famously great passage in Bishop, the end of, at the

19:12.120 --> 19:15.080
fish houses.

19:15.080 --> 19:25.560
She's visiting in Nova Scotia, and she has this kind of epiphany at the end of the poem

19:25.560 --> 19:37.520
where she's dipping her hand in the cold Atlantic, and it's as if the water were a

19:37.520 --> 19:40.480
transmutation of fire.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.160
And then this is the conclusion of the poem.

19:44.160 --> 19:54.440
It is like what we imagine knowledge to be, dark, salt, clear, moving, utterly free, drawn

19:54.440 --> 20:03.880
from the cold, hard mouth of the world, derived from the rocky breasts forever, flowing and

20:03.880 --> 20:13.960
drawn, and since our knowledge is historical, flowing and flown, which is really kind of

20:13.960 --> 20:24.520
playing with grammar, flown is not the past tense of flowing, but it's everything is

20:24.520 --> 20:25.520
moving.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.000
Nothing is static.

20:29.000 --> 20:36.440
Her poems have that quality, and it's kind of a quality, and I think it's one of her

20:36.440 --> 20:42.920
great qualities, one of the great qualities in her poems, is that she is living through

20:42.920 --> 20:43.920
them.

20:43.920 --> 20:50.280
It's not just something, and as you said before, and you've written wonderfully about her questioning

20:50.280 --> 20:56.440
in poems, that nothing is fixed.

20:56.440 --> 21:04.080
And life is something we experience as something constantly changing and never simple.

21:04.080 --> 21:09.720
And I think there's an embrace of that, so that the skepticism is not a negative skepticism.

21:09.720 --> 21:16.520
Modernism skepticism can be very negative, and hers is an interrogative mode of skepticism,

21:16.520 --> 21:20.120
more than a negative harsh rupture.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.400
And as you've said also, I think it's a way of bringing herself home.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.200
It's a way of finding out.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.400
Right, questions are ways of coming in.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.400
I love that.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.800
You know, Franny Blau, her friend, quoted, and I think it was the oral biography, she

21:32.800 --> 21:37.960
said it was later in life that Bishop said to her, I think we're all, I think the world

21:37.960 --> 21:45.440
is a mess, and we're all sub primitive, but we have to be gay in spite of it.

21:45.440 --> 21:52.200
You know that passage in the poem, Lloyd, it is like what we imagine knowledge to be

21:52.200 --> 22:00.920
is embedded in her notebooks from the trip that she took to Nova Scotia to Raggedy Island

22:00.920 --> 22:04.160
in that place.

22:04.160 --> 22:10.040
Her publisher was pursuing her with the copies of her first book, and she escaped to Nova

22:10.040 --> 22:11.840
Scotia.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.240
And she always made it very hard for her own middle of the middle of the net, or to do

22:15.240 --> 22:16.480
anything right.

22:16.480 --> 22:22.040
And so anyhow, she passed on the ferry, the sanatorium, where her mother had been incarcerated

22:22.040 --> 22:25.400
from the time she was five until she graduated from Vassar.

22:25.400 --> 22:32.840
And in the notebooks, she writes, I passed the sanatorium where mother was, I hadn't

22:32.840 --> 22:37.080
prepared for this, which really seems amazing when you read it.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.560
I mean, that's the way you get to that place.

22:40.560 --> 22:46.360
And then following that, almost immediately she writes, it is like what we imagine knowledge

22:46.360 --> 22:47.360
to be.

22:47.360 --> 22:53.040
So I think it has a kind of tragic undertone, or overtone for her.

22:53.040 --> 23:00.200
And that same trip in the notebook, she has, the millions of grains are black, white, tan,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.520
and rose mixed with quartz grains.

23:02.520 --> 23:09.480
Rose and amethyst from her own, her self-portrait poem, sandpiper, which is such a great.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.480
Yeah.

23:10.480 --> 23:15.440
I think some of that power of observation that we've been commenting on has to do probably

23:15.440 --> 23:18.240
with a vigilance.

23:18.240 --> 23:24.200
So perhaps we think she ought to have anticipated passing the sanatorium on the way to the island,

23:24.200 --> 23:25.360
but she wasn't conscious of it.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.960
She wasn't thinking about it.

23:26.960 --> 23:33.640
And yet some part of her mind was probably prepared, and yet also shocked by that experience

23:33.640 --> 23:34.640
the passing bond.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.320
You know, that gives me a chance to quote something that I found so fascinating.

23:39.320 --> 23:45.840
These are all from, these are little quotes from an early notebook that starts in Cuddy

23:45.840 --> 23:53.680
Hunk, which is where Godnelled account says Shakespeare set the tempest in Cuddy Hunk,

23:53.680 --> 23:56.400
this little island off of New Bedford.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.080
And she went there with her friend, the only man in her life other than her friend Tom

24:01.080 --> 24:09.080
Waining, Bob Seaver, who was the brother of a friend, Barbara Chesney, I think, from

24:09.080 --> 24:10.080
Vassar.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.080
And he loved her and gave her his fraternity pin.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.400
And he wanted to marry her.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.160
And he killed himself.

24:15.160 --> 24:19.080
And she got a postcard three days after he died saying, go to hell, Elizabeth.

24:19.080 --> 24:23.520
I mean, it was one of her early, really horrible tragedies.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.760
But she quotes him.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.720
And you can see how much she loved other people's observation.

24:30.720 --> 24:36.880
And this again goes back to Sandpiper.

24:36.880 --> 24:42.480
Bob said at Nantucket once the water where the waves come in on a coarse rolling gravel

24:42.480 --> 24:46.800
that it sounded like fat sputtering in a pan.

24:46.800 --> 24:52.320
The water behind Mrs. Crane's house coming in and short sliding waves on sand, he said

24:52.320 --> 24:54.720
sounded like someone's shoveling snow.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.440
Well, this turns up in Sandpiper.

24:57.440 --> 25:04.400
This is 1934, 1962, little Sandpiper running along.

25:04.400 --> 25:10.480
The beach hisses like fat on his left and interrupted, a sheet of interrupting water.

25:10.480 --> 25:16.240
I mean, these images, she really thought in images.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.440
And they stayed with her forever.

25:19.440 --> 25:25.600
And the entries about New York City in the Depression years are fantastic.

25:25.600 --> 25:30.560
And here's one that makes me think of the pacing that you talked about.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.320
Remember the little essay that she wrote about?

25:33.320 --> 25:36.120
The geese flying over his invasser.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.320
And you know the musical drama.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.920
Some of them are hanging back a little.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.880
It's like a rubato in music.

25:44.880 --> 25:51.680
And then she describes the whole migration as kind of having an invisible net around it.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.600
And that always seems to me the kind of rhyme, the kind of dappled rhyme and the pacing that

25:56.600 --> 25:58.400
she's after in her poems.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.520
But this I think is fascinating.

26:00.520 --> 26:05.600
The other day, and speaks to what you said, before I realized it.

26:05.600 --> 26:11.120
The other day before I realized it, I saw a man winding a barber pole.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.360
The iron poles in the city must be electric.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.840
But this one wasn't.

26:15.840 --> 26:22.880
A large keyhole just below the stripe section, and he wound it, sounded like a clock.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.720
The pole was striking up slowly.

26:25.720 --> 26:30.360
The stripes mounting with effort gradually faster and faster.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.360
Fantastic.

26:31.360 --> 26:35.160
So we come back to the power of her accurate eye.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.720
I mean there's no questioning of that.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.480
I mean it's absolutely there.

26:38.480 --> 26:44.600
But in the pacing, the way she's written it, she gives you how she took it in.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.520
I just love that.

26:46.520 --> 26:54.600
There's a little moment in one of the letters that she's writing to Anne Stevenson.

26:54.600 --> 27:02.320
Bishop was so kind of famously reticent about her personal life.

27:02.320 --> 27:09.680
But here was this young American poet living in England, writing a book about her and asking

27:09.680 --> 27:14.640
her all sorts of questions, and she actually responds to these questions, and she kind

27:14.640 --> 27:20.600
of provides, and it's really great information for all of us who are interested in her, she

27:20.600 --> 27:25.040
provides so much personal detail.

27:25.040 --> 27:31.560
But there is this one absolutely chilling moment in this letter to Anne Stevenson.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.200
She gets to 1934.

27:35.200 --> 27:41.080
And this is her whole comment about 1934.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.400
Met MM, Marianne Moore.

27:44.400 --> 27:50.240
Met MM, Mother Died, Graduated.

27:50.240 --> 27:58.000
That's like that on the front of her notebook from the year she was consultant to the Library

27:58.000 --> 28:01.960
of Congress, Poetry Consultant, on the front of the notebook.

28:01.960 --> 28:08.200
It says 1950, just about my worst comma so far.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.960
Well, maybe this is a good moment.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.720
I don't know if we have time to read a poem or something.

28:15.720 --> 28:21.560
The poem that I had thought I might read to the group today is a poem called The Bite.

28:21.560 --> 28:30.280
Since we're talking about Bishop's diary entries and so on, The Bite is a, I think, a relevant

28:30.280 --> 28:31.480
poem.

28:31.480 --> 28:42.480
It's about, a bite, B-I-G-H-T is a kind of landscape structure in Florida.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.120
The Key West Bite is a kind of enclosing of water.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.200
It's kind of like a bay.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.080
It's a little small enclosure.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.800
But of course it's also upon the bite.

28:53.800 --> 29:01.160
But right underneath the tile of the poem, The Bite, we have rather uncharacteristically,

29:01.160 --> 29:04.400
I think, on my birthday.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.920
And it's a descriptive poem.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.880
There's nothing about her birthday in the rest of the poem.

29:09.880 --> 29:16.840
But anyone who knows Bishop will know that she wrote a letter to Robert Lowell while she

29:16.840 --> 29:26.920
was in Key West and said the water at the Key West Bite looks like blue glass, sorry,

29:26.920 --> 29:27.920
blue gas.

29:27.920 --> 29:34.600
G-A-S-S, the water at the bite looks like blue gas.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.200
The harbor is always a mess here.

29:37.200 --> 29:42.080
Junkie little boats all piled up, some hung with sponges and always a few half sunk or

29:42.080 --> 29:45.680
splintered up from the most recent hurricane.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.920
It reminds me a little of my desk.

29:47.920 --> 29:55.040
So you have to keep that in mind as you listen to this descriptive poem of The Bite.

29:55.040 --> 30:01.880
And there's so many things I love about this poem, certainly the way that this kind of scanning

30:01.880 --> 30:10.080
of the surface of the scene leads to this more inward kind of reflection eventually.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.520
I love that about it.

30:11.520 --> 30:16.640
But I also love just, as Alice suggested, Bishop loved names of things.

30:16.640 --> 30:21.480
She was quite the fisherman.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.920
And so she loved nautical vocabulary.

30:23.920 --> 30:30.000
So there are great words like Jack's straw gaffes and things that if you're not a boat

30:30.000 --> 30:33.040
person, you have to go and look up.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.280
So there's that marvelous sense of vocabulary.

30:35.280 --> 30:46.160
And it's also a marvelous poem because it is, on the one hand, frightening in places, close

30:46.160 --> 30:49.920
to even suicidal kinds of imagery.

30:49.920 --> 30:52.920
But it's also very funny.

30:52.920 --> 30:58.880
And so there's this pulling back from something that's quite dark.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.320
There is this vividness of the scene.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.640
At the same time, there's a kind of dreamlike quality to the poem.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.840
So I'll just read it.

31:08.840 --> 31:13.000
At low tide, like this, how sheer the water is.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.760
White crumbling ribs of moral, protrude and glare.

31:17.760 --> 31:25.440
When the boats are dry, the pilings dry as matches, absorbing rather than being absorbed,

31:25.440 --> 31:28.680
the water in the bite doesn't wet anything.

31:28.680 --> 31:35.040
The color of the gas flame turned as low as possible.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.960
One can smell it turning to gas.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.560
So we could be in a Sylvia Plath poem at this point, right?

31:42.560 --> 31:46.440
If one were boat layer, one would probably hear it turning to marimba music.

31:46.440 --> 31:53.160
So there's a swerve, right?

31:53.160 --> 31:59.640
The little ochre dredge at work off the end of the dock already plays the dry, perfectly

31:59.640 --> 32:02.240
offbeat claves.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.600
The birds are outsized.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.120
And here comes the comic part and I think self-parodic.

32:08.120 --> 32:15.440
Pelican's crash into this peculiar gas unnecessarily hard, it seems to me, like pickaxes rarely

32:15.440 --> 32:21.440
coming up with anything to show for it and going off with enormous elbowings.

32:21.440 --> 32:27.520
Black and white manor warbirds soar on impalpable drafts and open their tails like scissors

32:27.520 --> 32:36.120
on the curves or tents or sorry, unpalpable drafts and open their tails like scissors

32:36.120 --> 32:41.360
on the curves or tents them like wishbones till they tremble.

32:41.360 --> 32:47.880
With frowsy sponge boats keep coming in with the obliging air of retrievers, bristling

32:47.880 --> 32:54.280
with jack straw gaffs and hooks and decorated with bobbles of sponges.

32:54.280 --> 33:00.400
There is a fence of chicken wire along the dock where glinting like little plowshares,

33:00.400 --> 33:07.800
the blue gray shark tails are hung up to dry for the Chinese restaurant trade.

33:07.800 --> 33:14.360
Some of the little white boats are still piled up against each other or lie on their sides,

33:14.360 --> 33:23.120
stove in and not yet salvaged if they ever will be from the last bad storm, like torn

33:23.120 --> 33:26.640
open unanswered letters.

33:26.640 --> 33:31.000
The bite is littered with old correspondences.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.240
Quick click goes the dredge and brings up a dripping jaw full of moral and all the untidy

33:38.240 --> 33:44.680
activity continues, awful but cheerful.

33:44.680 --> 33:51.240
And I love Bishop's gift for bringing important information into a poem through simile, the

33:51.240 --> 33:57.880
unobtrusive mode that allows the world to be the world while the poet introduces her

33:57.880 --> 34:07.480
own thoughts, so the crucial information here of the unopened letters torn open unanswered

34:07.480 --> 34:15.600
letters and the allusions there to correspondences not only interpersonal but she was a great

34:15.600 --> 34:21.040
reader at this time of the poet Baudelaire who had a poem called correspondance and so

34:21.040 --> 34:27.840
she's introducing a conversation with Baudelaire about the nature of the symbol but in this

34:27.840 --> 34:32.080
most subtle and delicate way.

34:32.080 --> 34:36.840
The last line by the way and I maybe one of my colleagues here can tell the story of

34:36.840 --> 34:42.480
how this happened but the last line all the untidy activity continues, awful but cheerful

34:42.480 --> 34:45.200
is engraved in her tombstone.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.200
So it continues.

34:46.200 --> 34:53.440
I just wanted to say that in rereading her poems for today one of the things that impressed

34:53.440 --> 35:03.320
me the most was the incredibly remarkable balance of tension between words that we could call

35:03.320 --> 35:09.160
happy and words that we could call scary or grim.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
Yes.

35:10.160 --> 35:16.640
And this is an excellent example of it, it's usually done in imagery, in descriptors but

35:16.640 --> 35:21.520
here the last line awful and cheerful brings it up almost to a level of abstraction.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
Exactly.

35:22.520 --> 35:25.760
That tension that is always there in the poems.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.760
Right.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.760
Right.

35:27.760 --> 35:34.240
I know when we were talking about her, we brought up her love of naming things.

35:34.240 --> 35:40.680
I really feel that was imprinted early on with her love of Hopkins, pride beauty and all

35:40.680 --> 35:43.520
trades, their gear and tackling trends.

35:43.520 --> 35:44.520
Yes.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
And the sounds.

35:45.520 --> 35:46.520
The sounds.

35:46.520 --> 35:51.640
This poem is just full of fabulous sounds, the mix of the angles.

35:51.640 --> 35:56.520
I mean the word the bite itself has that kind of wonderful angle of Saxon for those of

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
these.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.920
I was going to say, am I interrupting?

36:00.920 --> 36:04.960
I was going to say that we talk about her eyes so much and everyone does but her ears

36:04.960 --> 36:05.960
and that's all that.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.960
She really is living in sound the whole time I think.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.960
Yeah.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.880
And in this poem, Sound and Sight Slipped Together we have that synesthesia where the

36:14.880 --> 36:17.800
blue gas turns to her inbox.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.040
That's right.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.040
That's wonderful.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.040
Yeah.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.040
Yeah.

36:22.040 --> 36:30.160
By the way, Lloyd has reprinted in the Library of America edition the entire correspondence

36:30.160 --> 36:35.160
with Anne Stevenson, which is really like a primer for her.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.160
Yeah.

36:36.160 --> 36:45.000
It's just one of the few places where she is actually talking about her life.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.160
And even in the extraordinary correspondence with Robert Lowell, that 700 page correspondence

36:53.160 --> 37:03.080
that reads like a Victorian novel, it's so gripping, but she doesn't really talk very

37:03.080 --> 37:07.160
much about her personal history, her background.

37:07.160 --> 37:14.160
And they're really talking about more immediate things, absolutely riveting and heartbreaking.

37:14.160 --> 37:21.720
But it is that one place where I think she was really, she was concerned enough to have

37:21.720 --> 37:29.120
that after being, you know, she'd won some prizes and she was being published in the

37:29.120 --> 37:34.680
New Yorker, you know, she had a career, but she was also living in Brazil.

37:34.680 --> 37:42.520
And I think this was, she was just vulnerable enough to be willing to answer Anne Stevenson's

37:42.520 --> 37:43.520
questions.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
Yeah.

37:44.520 --> 37:51.000
And also she said, you know, she sometimes wrote as many as 40 letters a day.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.720
And she described that as sort of working without really working.

37:56.720 --> 38:03.680
Let me just say, you know, for people who may not know the biographical data, Elizabeth

38:03.680 --> 38:09.880
Bishop had the most dramatically tragic early childhood.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.000
Her father died when she was eight months old.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.040
Her mother, I don't know what the story is there about her mother's mental illness, but

38:17.040 --> 38:23.420
she was hospitalized and institutionalized when Elizabeth herself was five, correct?

38:23.420 --> 38:25.080
And then she went to live with grandparents.

38:25.080 --> 38:29.480
And I think there was some shuffling back and forth between the sets of grandparents.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.360
Was there a custody battle also?

38:31.360 --> 38:32.360
No.

38:32.360 --> 38:36.160
But the parents, on the father's side, they...

38:36.160 --> 38:40.040
They eventually understood that it was, she got asthma there.

38:40.040 --> 38:45.560
She said that she felt about on the same level as the dog, that, that, that, that, that,

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
you know.

38:46.560 --> 38:56.040
Well, she was living with her maternal grandparents in Nova Scotia, in a small town in Nova Scotia.

38:56.040 --> 39:01.000
And really enjoying herself as a kid.

39:01.000 --> 39:07.520
And her maternal grandparents were not at all wealthy.

39:07.520 --> 39:11.880
I mean, just maybe barely lower middle class.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.680
It was a towner.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.680
Yeah.

39:14.680 --> 39:25.200
And working family and living in this little cottage in a small town in Nova Scotia.

39:25.200 --> 39:34.000
Bishops' fathers' family were wealthy people from Worcester.

39:34.000 --> 39:43.840
Bishops' paternal grandfather owned a construction company who built, you know, the Boston Public

39:43.840 --> 39:46.040
Library, Symphony Hall.

39:46.040 --> 39:53.200
I mean, they were really major, not architects, but builders.

39:53.200 --> 40:03.360
And the grandparents felt that, you know, their granddaughter living in this kind of

40:03.360 --> 40:12.800
practically on a farm, running around the streets of Great Village, the ironic time of

40:12.800 --> 40:18.160
the city, Great Village.

40:18.160 --> 40:25.480
Running around barefoot and bringing cows out into the meadow and playing tricks, this

40:25.480 --> 40:29.840
was not what their granddaughter ought to be brought up to be.

40:29.840 --> 40:38.160
And they essentially, they didn't exactly abduct her, but they came, it was an agreement,

40:38.160 --> 40:46.720
and they brought Elizabeth to Worcester where she was absolutely miserable.

40:46.720 --> 40:55.760
And as Alice said, develop asthma, develop eczema that never, the as she almost died of

40:55.760 --> 41:03.920
asthma a number of times over her whole life, the eczema never was completely cured, it was

41:03.920 --> 41:07.240
always recurring.

41:07.240 --> 41:15.240
And finally, the grandparents kind of had to admit that they had really made a mistake

41:15.240 --> 41:25.320
and kind of farmed Elizabeth out to her and her mother's sister who was living in Revere,

41:25.320 --> 41:27.280
Massachusetts, one of the suburbs.

41:27.280 --> 41:33.640
And then they paid for, she went to the Walnut Hill School and then to Vassar, so they certainly

41:33.640 --> 41:43.720
paid for absolutely first grade education, but at a great cost to Bishop.

41:43.720 --> 41:48.760
And she was so sick when she first got there they had to carry her up the stairs.

41:48.760 --> 41:53.040
And she didn't go to school until she was 15 or something like that.

41:53.040 --> 41:59.920
And that's her aunt got her long fellow in Wordsworth and Blake and Hopkins and she entered

41:59.920 --> 42:00.920
those poems.

42:00.920 --> 42:10.080
And one little detail about her mother being institutionalized was that Elizabeth was not

42:10.080 --> 42:13.360
allowed to ever visit her mother.

42:13.360 --> 42:23.160
And you know, they thought this was what psychiatry was in 1918, that it would be too

42:23.160 --> 42:30.440
upsetting to Elizabeth's mother to see her daughter.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.960
So she was absolutely forbidden to see her.

42:32.960 --> 42:43.560
So once her mother was taken away and institutionalized, Bishop never saw her again.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.240
So that met M.M.

42:47.240 --> 42:54.440
Well suddenly she has this new sort of surrogate mother in Marion Moore, met M.M.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.800
Mother died, graduated.

42:56.800 --> 43:01.080
You know that that, we'll be awfully careful again.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.080
Exactly.

43:02.080 --> 43:07.680
And for those in the audience who are not terribly familiar with Bishop Therese, beautiful poems

43:07.680 --> 43:14.520
in which she explores her childhood, very famously the poem Sestina, the poem in the

43:14.520 --> 43:16.360
waiting room.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.520
She's a great poet of childhood and memory.

43:19.520 --> 43:26.280
She's also a great poet of travel and landscape and sometimes those things to come together.

43:26.280 --> 43:34.680
But I think this terrible, terrible suffering, not that it's a consolation, but for us as

43:34.680 --> 43:39.560
a gift that she was able to transform it into something very beautiful.

43:39.560 --> 43:44.080
Some of the best poems of Bishop I think are about childhood and memory.

43:44.080 --> 43:50.360
I wanted to read a poem also, but that goes a little later.

43:50.360 --> 43:56.600
I mean this isn't a childhood poem, but it's a poem about Brazil.

43:56.600 --> 44:03.760
And Brazil, she never intended to stay in Brazil.

44:03.760 --> 44:07.240
But on her first visit she got very sick.

44:07.240 --> 44:12.280
She was going to travel around Cape Horn on a Norwegian freighter.

44:12.280 --> 44:18.120
She got as far as Brazil and she was visiting, the boat was docking for a couple of weeks.

44:18.120 --> 44:24.040
And she was going to visit these two acquaintances of hers, whom she'd met in New York, a Brazilian

44:24.040 --> 44:30.080
woman and her American partner.

44:30.080 --> 44:40.760
And she, and this was connected to the asthma and the eczema, she ate a piece of cashew fruit,

44:40.760 --> 44:50.280
the nuts, or cashew nuts are in, and had a violent allergic reaction and a phylactic

44:50.280 --> 44:53.640
shock and had to be hospitalized.

44:53.640 --> 44:58.160
And she blew up, she couldn't breathe, her throat was constricted.

44:58.160 --> 45:01.080
She missed the boat.

45:01.080 --> 45:07.240
And fell in love with the Brazilian woman.

45:07.240 --> 45:14.240
And the Brazilian woman, de Maseto Saguares, came from an aristocratic family, had some

45:14.240 --> 45:24.960
money, said stay, I'll build you a studio, and come to my home, recuperate in this magnificent

45:24.960 --> 45:28.600
home in the mountains.

45:28.600 --> 45:34.080
And that was, it really kind of saved her life right after she had that miserable year

45:34.080 --> 45:43.760
as consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress, the old name for Poet Laureate.

45:43.760 --> 45:49.600
And she really, for many years, she had a really great life in Brazil.

45:49.600 --> 46:00.640
And then things, for various complicated reasons, including political and the commitments of

46:00.640 --> 46:07.080
water to public works, and she was building a park in Rio, it's the most beautiful park

46:07.080 --> 46:11.720
in Rio now, but it essentially, it killed her.

46:11.720 --> 46:22.400
And the relationship began to deteriorate and Bishop left Brazil, and sort of tragic

46:22.400 --> 46:23.400
story.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.400
Are you going to read a rifle?

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
I'm going to read Pink Dawn.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.840
Oh, oh, good.

46:27.840 --> 46:34.560
And she has a poem that she started on the verge of leaving Brazil.

46:34.560 --> 46:39.520
I think the original title of this poem was Farewell to Rio.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.120
And then she changed the title to Pink Dog.

46:42.120 --> 46:49.120
It took her 20 years to finish it, and it was actually, it wasn't the last poem she

46:49.120 --> 46:50.600
started.

46:50.600 --> 46:57.120
I hope Jean is going to read the last poem she started.

46:57.120 --> 47:01.000
But it's the last poem she finished.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.640
It was actually the last poem that she succeeded in finishing.

47:06.640 --> 47:14.720
And it just, I wanted to read it because it says some, it's such a wonderful example

47:14.720 --> 47:23.080
of the things that Bonnie was talking about before, the images of the city, and then the

47:23.080 --> 47:33.120
awful but cheerful in a kind of extreme because there's a really bitter joke in the poem.

47:33.120 --> 47:42.120
And then the sound effects, where she is actually imitating the sound of a samba.

47:42.120 --> 47:52.200
And I think it's my theory that this is her parody of the girl from Ipanema.

47:52.200 --> 47:58.440
And really you can almost, you can almost sing this to the music of the girl from Ipanema.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.440
When did that song get published?

48:00.440 --> 48:07.240
Well that was in the 60s, and it was written by a close friend of hers, Venetia's Demariah,

48:07.240 --> 48:11.040
she was a very famous poet and actor.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.840
She translated him.

48:12.840 --> 48:16.760
Ladies man, she translated him.

48:16.760 --> 48:27.240
We have to say her translation of Venetia's sonnet of intimacy, Bishop was so proud of

48:27.240 --> 48:28.240
it.

48:28.240 --> 48:32.400
You know, people have this image of her as this very prim, you know, misbishop, people

48:32.400 --> 48:35.520
called her misbishop.

48:35.520 --> 48:43.480
That translation had the word, ended with the word piss.

48:43.480 --> 48:52.000
And it was the first time a four-letter word had ever appeared in a poem in the New Yorker.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.600
And Bishop was so proud of it.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.920
I mean she really bragged about it.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.600
But let me read this poem.

49:00.600 --> 49:06.600
I think it's one of her most amazing poems, Pink Dog, Rio de Janeiro.

49:06.600 --> 49:12.880
And remember, the girl from Ipanema begins with this beautiful Brazilian woman and a

49:12.880 --> 49:23.240
bikini crossing the Avanita Atlantica to go to the beach, Pink Dog.

49:23.240 --> 49:27.240
The sun is blazing and the sky is blue.

49:27.240 --> 49:36.360
Umbrellas clothe the beach in every hue, naked, you trot across the avenue.

49:36.360 --> 49:45.480
Oh, never have I seen a dog so bare, naked and pink without a single hair, startled the

49:45.480 --> 49:49.480
passers-by, draw back and stare.

49:49.480 --> 49:53.400
Of course, they're mortally afraid of rabies.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.080
You are not mad.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.560
You have a case of scabies.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.360
But look intelligent.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.400
Where are your babies?

50:02.400 --> 50:06.640
A nursing mother by those hanging teats.

50:06.640 --> 50:16.120
In what slum have you hidden them poor bitch while you go begging, living by your wits?

50:16.120 --> 50:20.720
Didn't you know it's been in all the papers to solve this problem, how they deal with

50:20.720 --> 50:22.240
beggars?

50:22.240 --> 50:26.280
They take and throw them in the tidal rivers.

50:26.280 --> 50:36.680
Yes, idiots, paralytics, parasites go bobbing in the ebbing sewage nights out in the suburbs

50:36.680 --> 50:39.560
where there are no lights.

50:39.560 --> 50:47.320
If they do this to anyone who begs, drugged, drunk or sober with or without legs, what

50:47.320 --> 50:51.960
would they do to sick four-legged dogs?

50:51.960 --> 50:58.720
In the cafes and on the sidewalk corners, the joke is going round that all the beggars

50:58.720 --> 51:04.560
who can afford them now wear life preservers.

51:04.560 --> 51:12.880
In your condition, you would not be able even to float much less to dog paddle.

51:12.880 --> 51:19.640
Now look, the practical, the sensible solution is to wear a phantazia.

51:19.640 --> 51:27.080
Tonight you simply can't afford to be a nysore, but no one will ever see a dog in

51:27.080 --> 51:30.560
mascara this time of year.

51:30.560 --> 51:36.000
Ash Wednesday will come, but carnival is here.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.320
What sombas can you dance?

51:38.320 --> 51:40.440
What will you wear?

51:40.440 --> 51:48.960
They say that carnivals degenerate, radios, Americans, or something have ruined it completely.

51:48.960 --> 51:51.560
They are just talking.

51:51.560 --> 51:54.640
Carnival is always wonderful.

51:54.640 --> 51:59.680
A depolated dog would not look well.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.200
Dress up.

52:01.200 --> 52:07.000
Dress up and dance at carnival.

52:07.000 --> 52:15.360
She actually breaks the line in the middle of the word an, a-n.

52:15.360 --> 52:20.080
You simply can't afford to be a nysore.

52:20.080 --> 52:22.840
The n is on the beginning of the next line.

52:22.840 --> 52:23.840
Glens.

52:23.840 --> 52:24.840
Yeah, glens.

52:24.840 --> 52:25.840
Right.

52:25.840 --> 52:29.240
That s a, should we read song for the rainy season?

52:29.240 --> 52:30.240
Oh, yes.

52:30.240 --> 52:42.600
Which kind of describes almost in anticipation of the end of the paradisical time in Brazil.

52:42.600 --> 52:47.400
That s a poem I wish were a lot better known.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
I forget.

52:48.400 --> 52:49.400
Oh, God.

52:49.400 --> 52:59.640
She talked about pacing by the little spring by their home, and the maid would be, she

52:59.640 --> 53:05.840
said, what must she think of me as I go back repeating phrases over and over?

53:05.840 --> 53:10.920
And I can t help thinking, how did she feel when she came up with hidden, oh, hidden in

53:10.920 --> 53:15.800
the high fog, the house we live in?

53:15.800 --> 53:21.200
Song for the rainy season, hidden, oh, hidden in the high fog, the house we live in beneath

53:21.200 --> 53:23.160
the magnetic rock.

53:23.160 --> 53:31.640
Rain, rainbow ridden, where blood black, bromelias, lichens, owls, and the lint of the waterfalls

53:31.640 --> 53:35.200
cling, familiar, unbidden.

53:35.200 --> 53:42.280
In a dim age of water, the brook sings loud for a rib cage of giant fern.

53:42.280 --> 53:50.600
Vapor climbs up the thick growth effortlessly, turns back, holding them both house and rock

53:50.600 --> 53:52.960
in a private cloud.

53:52.960 --> 53:58.880
At night on the roof, blind drops crawl, and the ordinary brown owl gives us proof he can

53:58.880 --> 53:59.880
count.

53:59.880 --> 54:06.600
Five times, always five, he stamps and takes off after the fat frogs that shilling for

54:06.600 --> 54:09.680
love, clamor, and mount.

54:09.680 --> 54:15.840
House open house to the white dew and the milk white sunrise kind to the eyes.

54:15.840 --> 54:23.360
To membership of silverfish, mouse, bookworms, big moths, with a wall for the mildew's ignorant

54:23.360 --> 54:24.840
map.

54:24.840 --> 54:32.600
Marked and tarnished by the warm touch of the warm breath, maculate cherished, rejoice,

54:32.600 --> 54:39.400
for a later era will differ, a difference that kills or intimidates, much of all our

54:39.400 --> 54:42.320
small, shadowy life.

54:42.320 --> 54:50.360
Without water, the great rock will stare un-magnetized, there, no longer wearing rainbows or rain,

54:50.360 --> 54:56.440
the forgiving air and the high fog gone, the owls will move on, and the several waterfalls

54:56.440 --> 55:01.280
shrivel in the steady sun.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.440
She saw it coming.

55:03.440 --> 55:12.280
I mean, it's that wonderful description of how, of just this open, how, this is a modern

55:12.280 --> 55:17.680
house with glass walls, and you know, it was just, you almost couldn't tell where the house

55:17.680 --> 55:21.920
ended and the, you know, rainforest.

55:21.920 --> 55:28.120
Yeah, actually, I have that wonderful description in a letter saying it's all part of the really

55:28.120 --> 55:33.960
lofty vagueness of Brazil, where a cloud is entering my living room right this minute.

55:33.960 --> 55:34.960
Right.

55:34.960 --> 55:40.640
One of the things that that poem brings out, and actually all the poems we've read bring

55:40.640 --> 55:50.000
out, it brings out, is how often her poems engage animal life.

55:50.000 --> 55:57.840
And I mean, in the case of pink dog in a most sort of parable way, I mean, pink dog is

55:57.840 --> 55:58.840
it.

55:58.840 --> 55:59.840
She's really identifying.

55:59.840 --> 56:05.440
Of course, yeah, pink dog is sort of an allegorical figure there, but there's a continuum, I think,

56:05.440 --> 56:11.560
and all the animals in Bishop are both, they're, they're, they're figures from a kind of the

56:11.560 --> 56:18.520
unconscious life of the world, but they're also surrogates for the poet, her way into,

56:18.520 --> 56:21.520
to get closer to that unconscious life of the world.

56:21.520 --> 56:28.040
And so she's a great poet of animals and encounters with animals in a way very different

56:28.040 --> 56:32.760
from other poets, Marianne Moore, for instance, where there is much more the sense of writing

56:32.760 --> 56:41.760
fables in the ASOP tradition, or else scientific tracks even, you know, which feature articles

56:41.760 --> 56:42.760
on animals.

56:42.760 --> 56:49.680
Bishop's animals have this, this wonderful otherness and yet communication with the human world

56:49.680 --> 56:54.960
or, or resonance with the human world and the owls and so on in that scene, I think, bring

56:54.960 --> 56:56.720
that out really, really well.

56:56.720 --> 57:00.080
Yeah, I actually love the number five.

57:00.080 --> 57:05.240
Five.

57:05.240 --> 57:15.560
Which reminds me, just back to that thing about her vision and what a curse as well as

57:15.560 --> 57:22.800
what a blessing is, in a, in a, in a prose poem called rainy season sub-tropics, there's

57:22.800 --> 57:30.240
a section called giant toad, which begins, I will close at the near the beginning, my

57:30.240 --> 57:40.760
eyes bulge and hurt, they are my one great beauty, even so, they see too much above below

57:40.760 --> 57:43.600
and yet there is not much to see.

57:43.600 --> 57:44.600
Yeah.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.400
Those are extraordinary.

57:46.400 --> 57:48.400
I love those.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.400
Oh, Jean.

57:50.400 --> 57:57.840
Well, I would just think, I don't know if this is obvious, but I just say it in case

57:57.840 --> 57:58.840
it isn't.

57:58.840 --> 58:07.240
But it seems to me that the eye, the everything she saw all around her, probably from when

58:07.240 --> 58:16.560
she was born, was a way of connecting and locating herself in the world.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.840
And I think her rhymes were like that too.

58:18.840 --> 58:23.880
I was thinking before we came today that I don't really have anything to say about her

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
rhymes except that.

58:24.880 --> 58:30.560
But it seemed to me they were comforting to her as they are to us as readers.

58:30.560 --> 58:32.280
Rhyme always is, I think.

58:32.280 --> 58:36.040
It's either very emphatic only or comforting.

58:36.040 --> 58:44.160
But she has, I was first reading her when I was very young, luckily, had her north and

58:44.160 --> 58:48.640
south and a cold spring in my raincoat pocket when I was in college because somebody told

58:48.640 --> 58:50.280
me we'd miss Bishop.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.080
We called everybody that then.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.840
I mean, all the women miss more.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.240
It was ridiculous.

58:56.240 --> 59:01.800
But anyway, I did have that book and I would be so struck by her rhymes because I wasn't

59:01.800 --> 59:05.400
sure, since 1956, if you should rhyme or not.

59:05.400 --> 59:07.440
Anyway, nobody could tell you.

59:07.440 --> 59:12.200
But she was rhyming almost it seemed without effort.

59:12.200 --> 59:15.600
And I guess that's how all great poets do.

59:15.600 --> 59:19.080
But in a wonderful field, I'm back to you.

59:19.080 --> 59:25.160
In a wonderfully fluid way, I think of the fantastic use of rhyme in something like the

59:25.160 --> 59:30.480
moose where it's not a rhyme scheme.

59:30.480 --> 59:38.760
But often she's rhyming words of nature and human world words, so, you know, birches and

59:38.760 --> 59:39.920
churches.

59:39.920 --> 59:45.040
So that there's this beautiful integration that can happen in the place of rhyme.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.800
And it's a master and disaster.

59:46.800 --> 59:49.360
Yes, she stole that one from W.H.

59:49.360 --> 59:50.360
Auden.

59:50.360 --> 59:55.240
But you know, when you say that, it reminded me of something.

59:55.240 --> 59:59.920
Now I can't think what.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.480
Oh, I know what it was.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.960
But I have a friend who's very, very good at writing a form of our Joan Larkin.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.000
And she has said that, and this probably gave me the idea of this thing of seeing and hearing,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
too.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.640
And Joan said she does a crown of solace about some painful subject.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:25.640
But she said it's like a handhold through the pain for her to have the rhyme scheme,

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.800
very tight rhyme scheme in that case.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.920
But I think by the time of the moose, she probably didn't even have to think about it.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
Oh, no.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:38.280
You know, it was so probably in her body, but I'm sure she did think about it.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.120
But you know, she said to a friend of mine, I'm going to stop there a minute, but she

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:48.480
said to a friend of mine, Eleanor Ross Taylor, a very wonderful poet that you know, Alice.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.240
I mean, excuse me, Elizabeth had just done reading.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.840
And so Eleanor poet, too, came up to her and said, I just love that poem, the moose.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.320
It's just, I don't, it's just a miraculous poem, because we all feel that.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.880
But Elizabeth, I think this characteristic from what I know, said, it's just what happened.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:18.360
You know, and that's a very telling thing as well as a sort of fun anecdote, I think,

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.960
of her modesty.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:26.720
But I think, I think she liked what happened, as well as, of course, the pain.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.120
But I think it gave her her life.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Yeah.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
I do think so.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:36.160
I thought you had a five day to cap a poem and she heard somebody saying afterwards, not

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.640
bad for a poem.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
For a poem.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:48.360
Also, it was introduced by a provost, or whoever was in charge of that reading, as Elizabeth

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.800
Bishop will now read her new poem, The Moose.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.280
The Moose.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.080
She got a lot of mileage out of that, too.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:06.240
But I was thinking, hearing you talk about, about, because I'm hoping you will read Sonnet.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:14.560
Because the rhymes are so intricate and they're often, not all the rhymes are at the ends

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:21.360
of the words, but they're kind of buried in the middle of, in the ends of lines, but buried

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.520
in the middle of lines.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:30.680
And there's so much play, if I think if you just heard the poem, you couldn't actually

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:37.720
tell where the lines were supposed to end because they're so playful and tricky and

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720
marvelous.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.520
I think that's so beautiful and I think that's how she got to be.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.040
You don't, I mean, you know her.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.920
So, that feels to me like she just did it all her life and that's how she got to be

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920
there, do you think?

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.920
Yeah.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920
Yeah.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.720
But she just, I don't know, Sonnet.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:02.840
Well, I'll read it.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.040
Caught the bubble in the spirit level, a creature divided and the compass needle wobbling and

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.840
wavering undecided.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:19.240
Freed the broken, the mama, there's mercury running away and the rainbow bird from the

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:30.120
narrow bevel of the empty mirror flying wherever it feels like gay.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.480
That was the poem that ran in the New Yorker after Bishop died and there was some conversation

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:43.120
between Alice, Beth, Fessel and Howard because Bishop had corrected that poem by phone and

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.080
the manuscript as it was in Galilee in the New Yorker said, caught the bubble in the

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:55.720
spirit level, contrarily guided, not a creature divided and then she changed it.

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.320
But Howard had to testify to that really.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.920
That's a good change.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.680
And mirrors were very important to Bishop and in her early notebook she had this wonderful

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.080
entry, age 23.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:17.160
A woman sat, let me see, her wicked mirror took her face, crumpled it quickly and flung

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.240
it back.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.040
And she loved inversions.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.040
Yeah.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:29.000
I mean, we were talking about rhyme and of course, as you well know, Sonnet is an upside

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.160
dance on it.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.600
It's not only a very narrow Sonnet, maybe instead of the full I am in cantameter, but

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:45.320
it's not eight and six in the traditional Sonnet form, but it's upside down, six and

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320
eight.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.920
So she's playing with inversion in all kinds of ways and yet it never feels contrived.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.760
I think that's what you were saying about that kind of, it just seems to emerge.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:57.760
Just seems to have to.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.280
Isn't there an image in one of the poems that takes place in Brazil in which the person

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.760
has to find a mirror that's never been looked into?

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.320
Yes, that's a river man.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320
Oh, the river man.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.320
That's right.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.320
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:14.960
It imagines herself as a shaman type figure.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.960
Yes.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.440
There's also a poem called, an earlier poem called Insomnia about the moon in the bureau

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:34.520
mirror and looking into the mirror as a world inverted, even the phrase is inverted.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:41.840
Their day is always night and forget what the list of thing is and the last line in this

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.920
inverted world is, and you love me.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:50.120
Those were the only poems that she sort of openly said, it's about a love affair, about

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.960
a failed love affair, the beautiful poem conversation, until a name and all its connotation mean

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960
the same.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960
She's so beautiful.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:05.800
Well, I'd kind of like to recite sandpiper, her self-portrait thinking about all of her

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:13.120
travels and that fat pan, that fat sputtering in the pan.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:18.200
So the only reference I think is to Blake to see the world in a grain of sand and eternity

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.800
in an hour.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:25.240
So sandpiper, the roaring alongside he takes for granted and that every so often the world

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.040
is bound to shake.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:33.280
He runs, he runs to the south, finical, awkward, in a state of controlled panic, a student of

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.920
Blake.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:40.760
The beach, this is like fat on his left, an interrupting sheet of water, a sheet of interrupting

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:46.160
water, comes and goes and glazes over his dark and brittle feet.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.600
He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:56.200
Watching rather the spaces of sand between them wear no detail too small, the Atlantic

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.200
drains backwards and downwards.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.800
As he runs, he stares at the dragging grains.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.400
The world is a mist and then the world is minute and fast and clear.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.880
The tide is higher or lower, he couldn't tell you which his beak is focused, he is preoccupied.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.040
Looking for something, something, something poor bird, he is obsessed.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.960
The millions of grains are black, white, tan and brown mixed with quartz grains, rose

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.640
and amethyst, gray, not brown, black, white, tan and gray mixed with quartz.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.760
I love that poem so much.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.360
Speak is focused, he is preoccupied.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.040
Thank you.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:51.400
Ellie Carter, the late Elliot Carter, who recently died almost 104, still writing, wrote a song

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:57.440
cycle based on Elizabeth Bishop Holmes and Sandpiper is in that cycle.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.640
He knew that that was an autobiographical poem.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:14.320
The sandpiper in his setting is played by an oboe, which was Carter's own instrument.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:27.760
He was mirroring her autobiography and searching for something, something, something.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:34.680
The world is minute and vast, both, which seems very Bishop.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.640
The shift in scale that we're always talking about.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:43.520
It's so vibrant when a poet does that.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.960
She didn't like the setting.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:47.480
She didn't like Carter's setting.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.040
She didn't get it.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.480
The other thing about the sandpiper and insomnia and many of her poems is that she had this

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:01.440
conversation with the tradition of poetry.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:11.440
She was deeply read but not at all showy about her reading, not a poet that requires footnotes.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.640
She didn't like footnotes.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:22.920
But there are conversations going on with poetry of the past, not for the purpose of

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:32.480
displaying her edition or a particular narrow kind of mastery, but just because the conversation,

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.720
one of the things poetry is for is to conduct a conversation over time.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:42.520
And insomnia has a conversation with Philip Sidney's famous poem, Addressed to the Moon.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:48.680
And of course Blake's Auguries of Innocence in the sandpiper.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:57.120
She quotes a Herbert line in waiting at Wellfleet, although she doesn't say who she's quoting.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.960
And it doesn't matter if you don't know.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:06.800
The poem is complete by itself, about that knowledge, but there's this layer that is

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.280
pleasing to those of us who do know the poems of the past.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:15.680
And it just reminds us that poetry exists in those two dimensions of the contemporaneity

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.840
and the long vertical feeling of the tradition.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.400
Speaking of Herbert, do you all know the Herbert dream she had?

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.080
You all do.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:34.480
She dreamed that Herbert appeared to her in her dream and with his curls and his scarlet

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.080
shirt, I'll say.

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.600
And he said to her, I can help you.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.600
Isn't that nice?

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.600
That is a Patrick Priest.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.640
I wish I'd get one like that.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.880
But I do believe he did.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
He really did.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.880
After a lot of time, she carried Herbert with her.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.680
In camp when she was a little girl.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.680
I think she did.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:08.080
Talking about George Herbert, the 17th century poet, I think I didn't say that.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.800
It reminds me too that something that we haven't mentioned, I don't think, but which appears

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:21.640
also in many of her poems, sort of not too obviously, is the architecture of the church.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.320
Or maybe a person at the church.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.920
She doesn't make a big point about it, but when she's describing her landscapes, there's

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920
a spire.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920
Right.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920
She's qualifying whether it's a church.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.920
Her cage like the Jesuit church.

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920
No, no.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920
Yes, she does.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.920
Do you know that house?

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:36.920
Oh, excuse me.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920
No, go ahead.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920
No, go ahead.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:42.880
The house in Great Village in Nova Scotia is right next to the church.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.440
And she had an amazing, which was quite a high spire for Great Village.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.720
And she had an amazing thing that she says, somewhere, and I don't remember where.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:12:01.000
If you touched it, this is after her mother had had the scream, she wrote a beautiful story.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.600
Wasn't it a story called the scream about the...

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.600
In the village.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.760
In the village, it's called.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.520
And yeah, the low poem was called the scream.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:15.080
Anyway, it's about a moment of breakdown of her mother when she's being fitted for address.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.160
And it's a beautiful, beautiful story if you get the chance to read it.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.680
I think the first words in the story are the scream.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680
The scream, yeah.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.680
And that's it.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680
Oh, okay.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:30.200
Well, I think it's in there that she talks about the church steeple.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.440
And if you put your finger on the church steeple, it would be the scream.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.440
It's amazing.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.440
Yeah, that is just the image.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:40.440
It is the image.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440
It is like a tuning.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.440
Like a...

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.440
Yeah.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440
It's the scream.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.240
But when you mentioned the church, she was right next to that church for those years,

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240
you know.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.800
She has the Baptist hymns to the seal.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.800
I mean, a lot of...

01:12:54.800 --> 01:13:00.640
You can hear also, uh, some of her poetry has the cadence of Dickinson who got her cadences

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.640
from the hymns.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.520
And you can see that carryover as well.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520
Yes.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520
Yeah.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:10.600
But there is this sort of quiet compass, you know, where the church is being found in

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.760
the landscape in many poems, I think.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.160
Yeah, it comes up that way.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.160
Abivalently sometimes.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.160
Of course.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:21.160
She was in the calluses and I think she had her reservations and stuff.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, the gold and the Vatican made her session.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh, I think that...

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.400
I was looking through the early notebooks to see if I could share some things and...

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:38.000
I think that one of the things about Bishop's poems is that there's always...

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.200
She has a good sense of drama.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200
Oh, yes.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.680
That's where the mystery comes in.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.520
And there was this little tiny fragment.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.080
Again, she's 24 years old here in New York, 1934.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:59.520
When we walked across the bridge, the sun particularized certain windows off the river.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.760
If you should go to such a place at such a time, burst in and say...

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.760
Mm.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.760
Mm.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760
It's great.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.760
And that's what she took from seeing the window.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.760
That's the one...

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760
Oh, my God.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.760
These notebooks are great.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.760
Did she ever try to write a play?

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:23.760
I mean, there's...

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.760
She read a lot of plays in the library.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:28.960
There's a lot of dialogue in her poems, Bill Fins.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:29.960
She was.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.760
She did translate the birds.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760
Yeah, the masks.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:33.760
That's right, of course.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760
Yes.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.760
And Elizabeth and masks, she's driving in such a nice reading.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760
Yeah.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.760
But she never tried to write a original play.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760
No.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.760
She wrote everything else, I think.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760
Yes, didn't she?

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.680
And she loved, loved, loved witty people.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.760
Whitt was very important to her.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.600
And I think she said that Pauline Hemingway was the wittiest person that she had ever

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.600
known.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.200
But she's in one of letters, or maybe to Anne Stevenson, I think.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.480
She said, I've been lucky in my life.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.080
I've known some very, very witty people.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:12.160
And what's the line in one art, at the end of one art?

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.160
The jokey voice.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160
The jokey voice.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160
Oh, the gesture.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.160
The gesture of one.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.160
But the jokey voice.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Yeah, the jokey voice.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.160
So important.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:29.960
And that the two most serious relationships that she has in most serious is the wrong

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:30.960
word.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:39.320
The two really biggest, deepest relationships that she had were with people who were very

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:46.200
witty and entertained a lot of, allegedly, I mean, I never knew a lot of.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:54.400
But Alice Mepfessel, who is very funny, very amusing person, no nonsense.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:01.200
Not very interested in poetry, but who could make Elizabeth laugh.

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.920
That's great.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:08.960
There's a little visual anecdote that Bishop wrote in her notebooks.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:15.600
And spot her friend Margaret Miller, who she loved very deeply in school and college.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.680
And Margaret ended up with the Museum of Modern Art as a curator.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.920
I think one of the authors was Schwitter's catalog.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:34.800
Anyway, Margaret leaned out of the car with a comb in her hand and pretended to comb the

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.800
round chromium dome of the spotlight.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.160
Then she tied a scarf around its head.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:47.200
You just, you see that she was so, I'm trying to play.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:54.220
She was a musician, Schwitter's and Paul Clay, who were two of the wittiest artists, were

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:58.100
also two of her favorite artists.

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:04.760
Well, I mean, Bishop didn't write a vast amount of poetry.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.660
The collective Bishop isn't that big.

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.960
Well, it's bigger now than it was before.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.840
But, I mean, what she allowed to be published wasn't very much.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.120
But as some of you may know, she was a great letter writer, I think you already mentioned.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:22.200
And her sense of humor in the letters is just fantastic.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.680
I think they'll be like Byron's later on.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.680
They'll publish them in 13 volumes.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:38.880
She'd see, there's a wonderful description in Key West of two pelicans on some kind of

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:46.480
boardwalk or something, and a blowfish, they swoop down and grabbed a blowfish.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.000
And one of them had swallowed it, and blowfish expand.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.280
So it started to expand inside the gullet of this pelican, and he spit it out.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.600
She said like a basketball to the other pelican.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.760
So they started playing basketball with the blowfish.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:06.440
And you know, Bishop's eye for that kind of the sense of the delightfully absurd.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:12.480
I mean, in the poem The Bite, I think you see a lot of that where the birds coming back

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.320
with like a bligeing retriever.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:21.080
And it's just very comic, a comic sense of life.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:29.000
She didn't like appearing in public, and she didn't enjoy giving readings.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.280
And she made a number of recordings, and there are a number of recordings, not many,

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.400
there are a number of recordings of her reading.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:45.640
And they're not very good, and they certainly don't capture the quality of the poem or her

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.640
quality.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:53.800
You know, there was a PBS series called Voices and Visions some years ago, a few decades

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.600
ago now.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:03.160
And the producers of the series actually got the actress Blive Danner to read her poems,

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.600
because they couldn't stand the way Bishop read.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.040
I think it was a serious mistake.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:16.440
You wanted to hear Bishop's voice, and Blive Danner, I hope she's not here today, didn't

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.560
hadn't really worked on the poems very much.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:28.240
But there is one recording, and it's on JD McClatchy's, there's a tape, I don't know

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.560
if it's on, I don't even know if it's on a CD.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:39.120
But there's a tape of Bishop reading, and there's one reading, one poem that she reads,

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:46.600
and it's a comic poem called Filling Station, where she herself actually chuckles at one

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.280
of the jokes.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:55.880
And for me, it's the only recording of hers that actually sounds like the person I know,

01:19:55.880 --> 01:20:02.160
because she was so stiff as a reader, but her, just her little jiggle.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.640
Can I read Filling Station?

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:13.120
This is a poem, there's a book called Questions of Travel, it's her third book, and it's divided

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.820
into two parts.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:19.200
One part is called Brazil, and the second part is called Elsewhere.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.400
And the poem Filling Station is in the Elsewhere section, and I always assumed that it was

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.920
the Filling Station across the street from her grandmother's house in Great Village.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:34.200
But in the letters to Anne Stevenson, she says it's in Brazil.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:37.720
It's on this deserted road in Brazil.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:42.280
I mean, I just discovered this myself.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:51.080
But I still think of it as Great Village, Filling Station, or yeah, right, Filling Station.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:21:01.320
Oh, but it is dirty, this little Filling Station, oil soaked, oil permeated to a disturbing overall

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.680
black translucency.

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:07.120
Be careful with that match.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:13.720
Father wears a dirty oil soaked monkey suit that cuts him under the arms.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.600
And several quick and saucy and greasy sons assist him.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.720
This is a family filling station, all quite thoroughly dirty.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.720
Do they live in the station?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.160
It's a question.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.200
Do they live in the station?

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:38.840
It has a cement porch behind the pumps, and on it a set of crushed and grease impregnated

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:45.040
wicker work on the wicker sofa, a dirty dog.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.400
Quite comfy.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:52.480
Some comic books provide the only note of color, of certain color.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:22:04.200
They lie upon a big dim doily, draping a tabaret, part of the set, behind a big her suit, begonia.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.240
I think that's where she giggles.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:10.120
Why the extraneous plant?

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.360
Why the tabaret?

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.800
Why a why the doily?

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:25.200
Broidered in daisy stitch with margarit, I think, and heavy with gray crochet.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.520
Somebody embroidered the doily.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:34.520
Somebody waters the plant, or oils it maybe.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:47.040
It only arranges the rows of cans so that they softly say, so, so, so, to high strung

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.000
automobiles.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.520
Somebody loves us all.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:23:06.200
She told me that so, so, so was what you said to horses if you were in a buggy, and the

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:11.800
horse gets upset that this is what you say to calm the horses down.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.640
So like when cars started coming into these country towns.

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:17.640
Yeah.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:24.480
And that's what, so the SO, it's not just the joke on SO, but that is also this.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.480
That's great to know.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480
That's awesome.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.440
You know, unfortunately we only have less than ten minutes, and I want to give people

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.840
from the audience an opportunity to comment or ask questions.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:44.600
If anyone wants to say something, please come up to the microphone so we can get you on the

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.600
recording.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:52.600
Thank you very much.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.480
Thank you.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.440
This was really wonderful, enlightening and informative.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:05.880
I knew her poetry and I didn't know anything really about her.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.520
I've had this book forever.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.600
And my name is Mero Malofsky, by the way.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:23.480
And one thing I would like to add to the commentary on the, or wonder actually why it wasn't mentioned

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:26.600
was her social consciousness.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:34.520
Particularly her Brazil poems, which are, well like the pink dog, which is very powerful.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.480
But also, I'm not going to read it.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.040
I'm just going to read the titles, squatters, children.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.760
And most profoundly, the one that moves me the most, is the burglar of Babylon.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:53.280
And I'm thinking of her generation and the poets who were socially conscious, like Muriel

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.800
Ruchizer.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:07.320
And our, every generation needs poets to comment and remind us and consolidate our awareness.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.880
And I'm going to do a tiny plug, which is I'm going to be doing, I'm not, you don't

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.440
have to, you know, I'm not saying write this down.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:22.960
But I am going to be doing a presentation at NYU in June that's sponsored by Cleo Psyche.

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:28.280
It's their conference and I'll be part of a panel on psychoanalysis and poetry.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:37.920
And I think it's very important for psychoanalysis to recognize what poetry actually means in

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:43.520
a world, in an internet instant access world.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:51.000
And to remember that the poets always spoke for an entire culture.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.160
So thank you for this.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160
Thank you.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:59.880
You know, there's something that I thought, this psychoanalytically oriented among us

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.200
would be interested to hear.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.440
This is again from the early notebook.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:14.320
If I stretch my thought to Egypt, to India, downtown, it is in my thought I see them.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.000
And they are not at the time reality for me.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.720
If I go to these places, it's a different matter.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.640
History then is something like a huge circus tent, folding adjustable, which we carry around

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.480
with us and set up wherever we are.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.840
It possesses the magical property of being able to take on the characteristics of whatever

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.240
place we are in.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.920
In fact, it can become identical with it.

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.320
That's an interesting circus tent, though.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.640
Hello, my name is Jane Simon and I want to thank the speakers.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.200
And I also wanted to ask if we know anything about her process from the notebooks.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200
Did she write in the morning?

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200
Did she write at night?

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.200
Did she write every day?

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.480
I hear that she wrote a lot of letters.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.920
But you know, because she didn't write many poems that we know of.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.920
That's number one.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.640
And number two, McClatchy mentions that she was a chronic alcoholic.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640
So I did that.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.360
Do you have any comments about that?

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.120
Well, she wasn't an alcoholic.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.840
I don't think to the extent, say, that Barryman.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:21.360
You know, people didn't worry about her the way that, I mean, they worried about her

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:28.520
in her personal life, but not to step up to the microphone and completely lose it.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:35.120
But yeah, I mean, particularly in her 40s and Key West, her friends were terrified.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.160
And she took anti-abuse in Brazil for that.

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:39.160
Definitely.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.320
It was a huge part of her life.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.920
And I think it's in the poetry, definitely.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.520
In the process, I mean, there's certainly been references to her waiting for decades

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:49.680
to get a word for a poem.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.680
It's not true.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.200
Where, you know, she had the idea for a poem and she sort of leave a space, I think.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:04.200
You know, when, and Lull's poem about her talks about her, I wish I could quote it now,

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.320
waiting decades for the perfect word.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:09.920
You make the casual perfect.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.920
Right.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.920
Right.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.920
There are manuscripts.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:17.720
You can look at, for instance, at Harvard, there's a poem called Crusoe at Home.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:24.400
You know, it's a draft of the later poem.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.280
There's many examples of her, but we're re-worth things for her.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:37.200
Crusoe in England, the moose, pink dog, among her masterpieces are poems that took her decades

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.320
to complete.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:46.760
But maybe her most famous poem, One Art, the villain L, in this very complicated form,

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.440
took her a week.

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:55.360
And we have all the drafts which Alice has reprinted in Edgar Allan Poe and the Juke

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.360
Box.

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:03.560
They are amazing because you see the first version is almost prose and it's all over

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.120
the place.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.920
And she instantly figures out that it needs to be in a form.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.800
And she is desperate.

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:18.840
This is a breakup of this relationship with Alice Meth vessel.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:26.600
And she is on the verge of suicide and maybe has even, even makes a, maybe half-hearted

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:29.720
suicide attempt in the process.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.960
And that poem, working on that poem, I have an absolute conviction.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:41.960
It's kept her alive.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.880
This is One Art.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.200
Another side of a more comical, maybe side of her process as a young writer, and many

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:55.800
young writers do this, we mentioned that Mary Ann Moore was very important to her.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:01.480
So not only did they meet and become friends, but they developed a mentor or a protege

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.080
relationship and she would send things to Mary Ann Moore.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:10.040
And Mary Ann Moore would kindly retype them with lots of changes.

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.280
And so at a certain point Bishop decided to back off from that particular side of the

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.480
writing process of showing Mary Ann Moore everything that she wrote.

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:27.000
Well there's a notorious story where Bishop wrote maybe the most ambitious of her early

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.520
poems called Roosters.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.000
It's in her first book.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
A War Pong.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.520
A War Pong, yeah.

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.320
And she sent it to Mary Ann Moore.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:41.240
And it has those triple rhymes as like pink dog.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.640
And she's doing something rather daring, almost writing a kind of nursery rhyme, but

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.120
it's a very serious and very ambitious poem.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:57.040
And Mary Ann Moore really didn't get what she was doing and didn't like the triple rhymes

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.840
and also wanted her to change the title to the cock.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.840
Right.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.440
Not a good idea.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.440
Not a good idea.

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.760
And Bishop, let me just hold up for a second.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:14.800
I know that a couple of our participants had to like catch buses and things at 3.30.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.800
You're okay?

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:16.800
Okay.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:17.800
So we can go a little bit longer.

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.800
Okay.

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800
We'll let people have their chance.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800
Thanks.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.800
Okay.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:27.080
We had an opportunity to look at and listen to the PBS special, which is for anybody's

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.440
information online marvelous.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.440
Is it?

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.360
Oh, I can get it online.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.360
Full hour.

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.360
No interruption.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.360
All right.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:42.240
So I learned a lot last night preparing to be an audience member and listening.

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:46.080
I wanted to know a little bit more about the character of Friday.

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.240
Apparently it was a real person because at one point they made reference to the fact

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:56.880
that she bemoaned the fact that he had passed away of the measles.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.440
So what do we know about this Friday person?

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:08.080
Well, I've always taken that to be a kind of, again, she's doing the Robinson Crusoe

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:13.360
story and Friday of course is the character in Robinson Crusoe.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:21.280
I think it's her veiled reference to Lotta de Maseto Sowaris.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:29.080
That is, this was the, in her loneliness, this is the person who comes and rescues her.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080
Is that the woman?

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080
Yes.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.080
Yes.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.080
Yes.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.960
And I mean, you know, in Crusoe in England, Crusoe is a man, Friday is a man.

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:45.520
They talk about if only they could have had children.

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:53.960
You know, it's not exactly an allegory of one to one, but I think that's sort of, in

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:59.720
my mind, that's sort of where Friday comes in and that it's really, and the poem ends

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:05.600
with the death of Friday and it's so heartbreaking because I think that's who she's thinking of.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:10.600
And Lotta probably committed suicide.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:18.660
I just want to push back just a little though because I tend to, I think many poems come

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:24.480
from personal experience, but I worry when we reduce poems to autobiography.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.400
I mean, the Crusoe story is one of the great archetypal stories of Western culture and

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:32.240
all of that is important.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.360
And Friday represents the native.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.960
He represents the other world, the third world as it was called then.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:47.240
And he represents a relationship to the landscape and to the place that Crusoe doesn't have.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.720
And that's universal.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:57.000
And so I worry when we always want to bring fiction back to fact, that we miss really one

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.160
of the great goals of poetry is to share this.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.160
Yeah.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.120
So it's not to contradict anything that's been said, but just to open it.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.120
But I think that's probably where it comes from.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.320
But that we have to see it as, we have to see the story as the...

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.720
It's all those things I think.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.880
I think it makes sense for me to think of her.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.680
And it's just like in the moose, I think there's an autobiographical element when she overhears

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:28.160
the conversation about the grandparents and eternity and about someone who's a drinker.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.080
That's her way of bringing in that story.

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:32.080
She's overhearing it.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.200
And that's a wonderful way of bringing in the drinking, I think, because I didn't want

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.360
to understate the importance of that in her life.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:44.400
It was a big project of lotas to help her combat that problem.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.000
She was a very cheap drunk.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.320
So did you take her much to get drunk?

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.320
Right.

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320
Yeah.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320
So she could...

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:55.040
And she knew this.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:01.680
But so if she had a drink, it wasn't going to stop there because she would immediately

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.360
get drunk and then she would keep drinking and she would go on binges.

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:15.680
But in a way, the question about whether she was an alcoholic becomes more complicated

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:18.880
because she wasn't always drunk.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.880
And there were just...

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:26.880
There were long periods while she was on anti-buse for a while, from time to time.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.680
But there were also periods when she just wasn't drinking.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.920
And where she was completely lucid and writing poems.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:38.880
And maybe she would have written more poems if she didn't have these binges.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.040
And it was a drinking generation.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.040
Children writers.

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.040
All drink.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.040
Yes.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:55.160
How do you think she might have interacted or fared in world like ours today with Facebook

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.320
and talk shows and self-exposure?

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:05.800
Do you think... and do you think that there could be an Elizabeth Bishop who fully interacts

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.720
electronically today?

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.040
Oh, I hope.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.480
You know, I hope so.

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.480
But I don't think she...

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.040
I can't imagine Elizabeth on Facebook.

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:22.480
She famously said closets, closets and more closets.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.480
Right.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.480
Yeah.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:31.280
But even just the disappearance of... or the erosion of the idea of territoriality and

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.920
regionality because the internet is connecting everybody.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.920
How do you think she might?

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:35.920
Yeah.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:41.840
That's what I was going to say is I have a poet friend who's wheels on the whole thing,

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.480
electronically.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.120
And I said, I don't really do much of it.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.280
And she said, but Jean, you can talk to a poet anywhere in the world.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.920
And you can read their poems.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.320
Anywhere on our little globe.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:05.200
That must have fascinated the ship if she had gotten that good.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:08.040
And they could have read her.

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:16.360
Well, now people in Ireland, you can't graduate from high school without learning ten poems

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.360
of Elizabeth Bishop.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.360
I mean, out of a hundred, I think.

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:27.400
In the realm of photography and documentary, I've sometimes had to talk to students.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:35.120
And when I wanted to point out an artist who was to talk about the issue of sentimentality,

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.080
I send them to Helen Levitt.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.160
And it occurred to me today, if you know Helen Levitt's work, that there's something very

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:48.240
akin to Bishop in the sense that they're artists who are resolutely unsentimental, I think,

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.320
occasionally fierce, but never mean.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:55.640
There's always this love of the world.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.560
So it occurred to me this connection.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:06.080
There's one of her wonderful, unpublished poems.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.120
Is her poem about Buster Keaton, called Keaton.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:18.200
Which is, and it just absolutely figures that Keaton, of all the scream comedians or the

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.040
silent comedians, would be the one who was most attractive to Bishop.

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.280
And the last line of that poem is, I am not sentimental.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:34.680
And it starts out, I think, I will be good.

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.880
And what Helen Levitt loves is ordinary people.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:41.640
Just people on the street and animals and children.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.000
And children especially.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
And they would be a mask on.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.280
If you want to know about the world, look at children and watch them interacting on the

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.440
street.

01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.440
She certainly had that.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:52.400
I think it's a great combination.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.720
She would have loved that.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.200
I always think of Walker Evans when I think of Filling Station, though.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.680
It's like a Walker Evans photograph.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:01.960
Only the tone is a little different.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:02.960
Right.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.120
All right, but we've gone over about almost 15 minutes.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.560
Well, thank you.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:18.400
Thank you.

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.320
To thank this wonderful, wonderful group, I think Elizabeth Bishop is talking appreciation

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.320
to you.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:41.320
Thank you.
