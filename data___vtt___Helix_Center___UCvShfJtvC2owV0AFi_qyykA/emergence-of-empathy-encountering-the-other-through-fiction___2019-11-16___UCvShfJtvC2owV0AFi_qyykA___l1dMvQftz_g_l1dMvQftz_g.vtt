00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
But I'm saying, I'm not sure.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
I think he likes to rip up.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
No, not Alberto.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm good.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
See, that was all thanks.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
It says it was awesome.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
We can only do it so far.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Actually, I still need to.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
So as I'm walking up this hole.

00:19.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm Edward Narcissian, Director of the Helix Center.

00:36.000 --> 00:48.000
Today's program on empathy was suggested to us by

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Alberto Manguel and through a discussion with Beverly Zabriski,

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
we put this round table together.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
So Beverly is going to, who's a member of the Executive Committee of the Center,

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
will introduce the speakers, the participants at the round table.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I just want to tell you that the next round table, which will be the last for this year,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
is on mathematics and other realities.

01:15.000 --> 01:27.000
It was proposed by Harold Amsparker, who is a physicist from Zurich.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And that will be the last one for 2019.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
And we are looking forward to 2020.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Beverly.

01:35.000 --> 01:45.000
Welcome to everyone here in this room and to the audience,

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
this room on the live screen, and also those who really watch their YouTube.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
So I think we have a wonderful program prepared for you,

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
and obviously you're going to be the super audience.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
I want to just mention to you that this whole event is going to be videoed,

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
and including your questions, and please know that if you get up and ask a question,

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
it's considered an automatic release that it's all right for you to then be on YouTube

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
into infinity actually.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So, again welcome.

02:25.000 --> 02:34.000
And part of the computer center emerged full-blown out of the imagination of Ed Accessian,

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
and we're very proud that we're able to continue this ability to bring together

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
the sort of CP snow idea of trying to get the humanities and the sciences together.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
And this is our sort of World Series team on the humanities side.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
So I'm terribly grateful to all of you for coming,

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
and I just want to say a few words about each of you, but just in general,

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
I tried to add up the number of prizes and the number of volumes published by this group,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
and it became too long to even begin to mention.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
It's an astonishingly distinguished group.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
So I'm going to start with Siri here.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
I first met Siri when we did an interview together at the Rubin Museum

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
when there was Young's Red Book exhibit, and in that she spoke as an author,

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
but also a person who has tremendous knowledge of neuropsychoanalysis,

03:40.000 --> 03:46.000
and she spoke of her own experience, also her own mind-body experience.

03:46.000 --> 03:56.000
And there's nothing so enlightening as to hear one person speak in the most irrefutable way

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
about what it is to be a human being with both a mind and body.

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
And her list of awards is enormous, and what book of yours would you most like us to know about?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I'm going to ask each of you that question.

04:12.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh my God, in this group, maybe it's a book the big title is A Woman Looking at Men,

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
Looking at Women, but inside that book there's a 200-page essay on the mind-body problem.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
It's called The Delusions of Certainty. I highly recommend it.

04:33.000 --> 04:46.000
And Yiam Lee is the author of six books, including two story collections,

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
a thousand years of good prayers, gold boy, emerald girl, and three novels.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
And she's also been chosen by The New Yorker as one of the 20 fiction writers under 40 to watch.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Are you still under 40?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
No, I'm not.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
But we're watching.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
And what of your books would you most want this group to read?

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
Well, I would say my latest novel, Where Reasons and that's the book that I want to keep in life.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Where Reasons and Wonderful.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Good to meet them.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
So I've just met today Yiam Lee and I've also just met today, Percival Everett,

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
who's a distinguished professor of English at the University of Southern California.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
And he's come here today to be part of this program from Southern California. Thank you.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
It's an author of 30 books, mostly novels. He's won numerous awards, honors, and fellowships,

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
the most recent being the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western Literature Association in 2018.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
As he puts it, if you do a thing long enough, that just happens.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
I haven't noticed that.

06:03.000 --> 06:10.000
Here are a few of his titles, Glyph, Erasure, So Much Blue and Percival Everett by Virgil Russell.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And I am not Sidney Poitier, but we're glad you're you and we're glad you're here.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
And Joe is a friend.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, yeah.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, so sorry.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
First of all, would you recommend?

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
The next one.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
What's the title?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Telephone.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
On the telephone?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Oh, excellent. Thank you.

06:38.000 --> 06:47.000
Joe is a dear friend. He's a professor of comparative literature at Bard, and he's the author of Romantic Europe and the Ghost of Italy.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
And he received the Scaglione Prize for Italian Studies.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
He's written several books on poetry and cinema and the aesthetics of the Italian art film.

06:59.000 --> 07:12.000
And he also wrote a book about our shared ancestry, the two Italy's, an Italian family in Italy and an Italian family here.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
And he also wrote what is probably, I think, an archetypal version of what it's like to use an author to develop empathy.

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
When he wrote a book, what Dante taught me about grief healing and the mysteries of love.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
So, welcome.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I'll recommend that one.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
And then Alberto.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
This began with Alberto.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
We wanted Alberto to come back ever since he did the program on the library a few years ago.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And he has won.

07:46.000 --> 07:54.000
Alberto gets a prize a month. And he's always traveling around the world receiving one.

07:54.000 --> 08:07.000
And he, up until, I think, five years ago, Alberto lived in France and then came, moved here to New York, which is our great gain.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
And then he went to be the director of the Argentine National Library, which he did until this past year.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Now he's here living in New York.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
And he didn't list any of his books, so I had to look them up.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
The ones that I didn't know about.

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
The last one was called Monsters, Dracula, Alice, Superman, and other literary friends. Fabulous monsters.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
So, I'll read them again.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
Dracula, Alice, Superman, and other literary friends.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And his own drawings are throughout the book.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
Now that you see him, you will recognize his drawings of himself.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
Packing my library, which was about packing the 40,000 volumes in his library in France.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
And bringing them to the Western Hemisphere.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
A reader on reading, a history of reading the library at night.

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
And there is now a traveling exhibit that Alberto has done of a virtual reality with Robert LaPaj

09:09.000 --> 09:15.000
of the nine great libraries of the world, including his own.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Ten libraries.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Ten libraries.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
So it's gone around the world. We're hoping it will come to New York.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
So welcome all. And I'm really looking forward to this.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Okay, we're supposed to start everyone.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Do we have any kind of agreement about what empathy is?

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
Or maybe just when you use the word how you use it, I think it's a good way to begin?

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
My sense is that there's always, I always define empathy against or in conjunction with sympathy.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
And the way I think about it, I don't know what the technical definition is, you can all help me,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
is that sympathy is a sort of sharing of pain.

09:58.000 --> 10:09.000
Sim patias, sim patos, and that empathy was a kind of an imagining of or sort of seeing yourself in the place of sort of things.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
So almost less visceral than sympathy and a little more intellectual and emphasis more in the imagination.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
But that was just my working definition before I got this invitation.

10:21.000 --> 10:30.000
I can say I don't often have sympathy for my characters, but I do have empathy all the time for my characters,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
especially bad ones.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
I have characters who try to murder people.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
I have characters who try to steal babies.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
And I think it's hard to be sympathetic, but I always think it's important to be empathetic.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
But is that that you're feeling with and in them?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I feel in them. I live in them.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Right, so it's a different definition already. That's why this is interesting.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I live in like characters.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
In English, the term begins as a translation of I'm feeling.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It does certainly.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
So it's a recent term, but yes, it conveys the idea that you were talking about,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
and then you go into the character.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
It was aesthetics. It's Robert Fisher.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
So it's I'm Fu Lung and it's quite late.

11:24.000 --> 11:33.000
And it's about feeling one's way into a work of art, which was later, I think it's in the little squib about this,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
translated into empathy by Tichner.

11:37.000 --> 11:45.000
It's also associated with the idea of abstraction within the wind borling.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Yeah, but in elaborate.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, that was early 20th century 1908.

11:53.000 --> 12:06.000
Dissertation by, I don't remember first name, Borling, who was attempting to write a treatise on the universe.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
The universal beauty, the impossibility of it.

12:11.000 --> 12:27.000
And it became a bit of a, what would you call it, a motto for the abstract expressionist in trying to get to a feeling.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
And how did he use empathy?

12:32.000 --> 12:43.000
It hasn't been translated and I worked at it really hard. My understanding is that the empathy comes about with the mere abstraction of the feeling.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
Yeah, this is the, see how many definitions we have already.

12:50.000 --> 13:03.000
I think I make a distinction myself between, for lack of a better term, maybe judgmental empathy and emotional empathy.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
The emotionally being feeling, what other people are feeling, but the other one merely being able to stand in their place and understand their perspective.

13:12.000 --> 13:32.000
I think that's a very important distinction, judgmental and emotional empathy. Because from the point of view of a reader, the empathy you feel with characters is initially an emotional empathy if you feel that empathy.

13:32.000 --> 13:59.000
And then it becomes judgmental. You love the character. Well, a person has a novel that's very powerful called the Water Cure, where a father tortures the man who killed the tortured his daughter.

13:59.000 --> 14:12.000
And you can understand the character, you feel empathy for the character emotional empathy because you say, if somebody that is to one of my children, of course, I would go there.

14:12.000 --> 14:21.000
And then you become judgmental. But I think that's a weaker way of relating to the character.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I think judgment is not empathy.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.000
I mean, I think let's make decisions here. I mean, that's what's important. How can a judgment be empathy?

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
No, it's not a judgment that's empathy. It's empathy that's judgmental. It's not the same thing.

14:35.000 --> 14:44.000
And empathy can be judgmental if you say, I'm very fond of Little Red Riding Hood, but she should have obeyed her mother.

14:44.000 --> 14:52.000
No, but I think those are two distinct things that we have to separate. In other words, for example, well, I think if we want to be a little bit more careful,

14:52.000 --> 15:07.000
I think if we want to be rigorous, I think there's a rigorous distinction that can be made and that distinction is so if it's about feeling as the other, say in a work of fiction,

15:07.000 --> 15:23.000
while you are swept up in the work of fiction, as Josh Poulais says, the eye of the text becomes one's internal eye, which I think is an avenue to empathy.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.000
In order to make the judgment, you have to in some way withdraw from the text.

15:29.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't think so. I think that when you, for want of a better word, identify with the character, you do it emotionally and almost immediately or simultaneously,

15:42.000 --> 15:52.000
you are judging yourself as that character. So I wouldn't separate them in such neat distinctions, at least for me.

15:52.000 --> 16:05.000
I don't know if you're wondering if there's a difference between readers and writers. And I don't think a writer ever judges a reader can come in with that judgment.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
You feel that certain writers should judge.

16:09.000 --> 16:21.000
But I think if you're from a writer's point of view, if you judge, doesn't mean you right away, you lose this empathy for your characters.

16:21.000 --> 16:29.000
It's not necessarily a value to judgment. It's an understanding of perspective.

16:29.000 --> 16:42.000
And that is a judgment, but it's not giving preference to any thinking about that action or that situation.

16:42.000 --> 16:58.000
The thing about empathy that I find troubling, moving through the world, is I wonder if the subjects for whom I'm to feel empathy as a good person

16:58.000 --> 17:12.000
have a certain responsibility? Do I have empathy for, I don't want to do that. You know more thinking about that, I will say.

17:12.000 --> 17:21.000
But I will say John Delinger. Do I have empathy for a murderer, a master.

17:21.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, if I can feel what he's feeling, then I'm afraid. And even if I can put myself into his shoes and imagine what he's doing, then I should be afraid.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
So is there a possibility for empathy in that place?

17:38.000 --> 17:55.000
So take an easier example like crime and punishment. Crime and punishment is a great example of entering inside Raskolnikov and a horrifying act.

17:55.000 --> 18:09.000
I mean, I have empathy for Raskolnikov, which is rather frightening. But at the same time, do you think that you would act like that?

18:09.000 --> 18:24.000
No. So you're judging. No, I'm saying, I think that, again, I do think actually that those experiences may, as you say, come right one after another or even on top of each other

18:24.000 --> 18:33.000
or even be a kind of mixed experience. But I do, I don't think that we can call them, that feeling in if we want to do einfutung.

18:33.000 --> 18:46.000
Einfutung is entering in. There's a beautiful work by Edith Stein called on empathy where she talks about empathy as a foreign experience.

18:46.000 --> 18:56.000
But while you're there, you take the place of the subject in real empathy. And then you have to come back to Judge Edith.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
I use the example of Joe's book, which moved me very much in the dark forest.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
In a dark way. In a dark wood.

19:07.000 --> 19:23.000
That takes as his model the divine comedy. And Joe in losing his wife speaks of Dante losing Beatrice and finding Beatrice.

19:23.000 --> 19:37.000
And the empathy that he feels with that story I feel in his book, while going to the source in Dante, I feel empathy which everything that's happening.

19:37.000 --> 20:00.000
But my empathy with Dante's Beatrice is judgmental because I find her a cold, unfeeling woman who I am not supposed to judge because I'm not supposed to understand the justice of God.

20:00.000 --> 20:26.000
So there are so many levels. I don't think that there is a cut off point in what the reader feels and what the reader judges and what the reader then reflects back to the reader saying this is thereby, except for the grace of God, go why.

20:26.000 --> 20:35.000
This is how we identify with certain characters that don't you think?

20:35.000 --> 20:53.000
Now that you've grown up the book, I think the one thing I could say is where it seems like you're too at loggerheads is that you are emphasizing that feeling in and you say that can't happen with judgment because judgment is a kind of established as a distance.

20:53.000 --> 21:08.000
And Alberto is saying, well, do we have to separate them necessarily? One can feel one's way into a text and also while one's doing so doesn't necessarily have to suspend judgment.

21:08.000 --> 21:28.000
I guess what I would say in the case of reading my story into this character Dante, what I learned afterwards, I had studied Dante for decades really and I had written heavily foot-noted stuff on him and whatnot, but I found that empathy could actually be a cognitive

21:28.000 --> 21:39.000
journey because I felt when I heard Dante's voice and it was more, less Beatrice and more of the loss of Florence because he went into exile.

21:39.000 --> 21:55.000
So he had lost his hometown and wandered through Italy the last 20 years. The poem came alive to me when I could, there's a passage in a paradiso when he says, should it ever come to pass that this sacred poem to which Heaven and Earth have set their hand

21:55.000 --> 22:10.000
basically would get me back to Florence, then I will take the Laurel Crown as poet and hearing that voice, empathizing with the poem for the first time rather than seeing as an object of study, brought me, I think, scholarly insights.

22:10.000 --> 22:37.000
Even the Canto he's, there's this famous Canto he's the Canto of Ulysses, right, in Inferno which was so influential for Primo Leivie, helped him keep his humanity and Auschwitz. When I had studied that Canto for decades but only after my late wife's death and going back to my hometown as I needed my family's help to raise our daughter,

22:37.000 --> 22:50.000
I sensed that same sense of Ulysses not being able to go back to Ithaca. And so that was an empathetic thing that to me brought this great cognitive insight.

22:50.000 --> 23:09.000
I kind of without birth to in the sense that one can read oneself in and invest in something and at the same time it doesn't have to have that suspension of judgments.

23:09.000 --> 23:29.000
Thoughts are that feeling doesn't generate all kinds of intellectual activity. I think it does. And I think then, you know, I'm sorry to bring that science into it. But for example, if you look at what you think of as possibly forms of pre personal

23:29.000 --> 23:50.000
empathy in a phenomenon such as mirror neurons that almost everybody has heard of, I think it's was found in my cock monkeys in the early 90s where a monkey grasping a banana, the same neurons are firing as the monkey who's watching.

23:50.000 --> 24:08.000
Right. So it's action perception. This also appears to be present in human beings. It is something that may become conscious in something like mirror touch synesthesia where you look at someone else being touched and you have a sensation

24:08.000 --> 24:28.000
yourself. So motor sensory forms of empathy exist without that intellectual ingredient. The mirror touch synesthesia is not thinking about Oh, geez, what does it mean to feel this or that? It's a motor sensory response.

24:28.000 --> 24:43.000
So that's what I'm trying to make certain distinctions like that. Now that motor sensory response was considered very important in the 19th century when I'm food and was being discussed.

24:43.000 --> 25:04.000
Lips, for example, all these different German theorists, they were interested in the motor sensory responses usually to visual art. Right? No, what you say is important in terms of the relationship that readers or writers have with literature.

25:04.000 --> 25:19.000
The physical learning or the mirror learning in society of empathy in the sense of feeling other people suffering and needs and opinions.

25:19.000 --> 25:38.000
Do you think that literature is a better gateway to learning these things than the actual being in society? It's a good question. Yes.

25:38.000 --> 25:52.000
I think about when you mentioned that the monkeys, there's a shared experience that's necessary for that empathy. The one monkey has to know about food.

25:52.000 --> 26:10.000
And so if you ask me to feel empathy for someone during their homicidal act, I have no experience with that. And so I don't think it's possible for me to have anything other than a cognitive sort of empathy toward that person.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
I can see why you might have wanted to kill this person. But it's a bad thing.

26:15.000 --> 26:25.000
The novelist, when I have a character who does a horrific thing in the character that you mentioned who tortures the man who he believes.

26:25.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, that's worse. He's not sure. If the murderer of his daughter certainly as soon as I imagined him doing something wrong.

26:40.000 --> 26:54.000
It's not that I imagined him doing something that I would or would not do. He's doing a bad thing. And that's never divorced from my thinking about him or his action.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
That doesn't mean I don't have feelings for what he's doing.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
You have to be when you're writing.

27:01.000 --> 27:12.000
Don't remind me. You said that as a writer you don't have that relationship to your characters.

27:12.000 --> 27:30.000
Because our person said you felt that he was doing something wrong. And I think maybe for my experience, one of my biggest fears growing up was had I been born in cultural revolution, would I become one of the teenagers who would be the teacher to death.

27:30.000 --> 27:43.000
And I always thought, well I could. There's no reason to say no, absolutely not. So I wrote this character who picked the pregnant mother, deformed the baby.

27:43.000 --> 27:57.000
I think at least in the writing part of it, I felt I could be that person. When you said frightening, it was one of the most frightening experiences. Empathy can be frightening.

27:57.000 --> 28:06.000
I was going to ask, I think it might be an important distinction to draw as to whether any important human emotions don't always partake of judgment of some sort.

28:06.000 --> 28:16.000
Like I think we're trying to draw out this idea that within the feeling it already falls within a context that involves judgment at some level.

28:16.000 --> 28:23.000
Maybe not moral judgment, like oh you should go to jail, but some sort of value judgment of some sort.

28:23.000 --> 28:39.000
But do you think that what restraints us from acting out our feeling of empathy for a character that is doing things that are judge-torable?

28:39.000 --> 29:04.000
Do you think that in the feeling of empathy itself or as you were suggesting it comes later as something separate as judgment? When I look at the rascal Nick of, am I seeing someone who acts in a way that I think is justifiable?

29:04.000 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, I think maybe going to child development will help a little bit, right? So that there's a certain moment, you know, and it's various depending on the researchers when the idea of empathy is possible.

29:17.000 --> 29:40.000
But very early on in human life infants will imitate the faces of adults. There are certain infant researchers who believe that empathy arrives much earlier or that children get a sense of, you know, relationality to the other, the mother usually much earlier.

29:40.000 --> 29:56.000
So the question then again is obviously an infant is not making any judgments. Does that mean that very young children or infants are incapable of empathy? I don't think so.

29:56.000 --> 30:12.000
And in fact, one year olds now, this is, you know, in some of the research seem to have very empathetic responses, but they may not be saying, oh, this is a good thing that I'm patting mom because she's crying.

30:12.000 --> 30:27.000
But is there not a difference between those physical learnings and the ones that come through the relationship to fiction and art in general?

30:27.000 --> 30:36.000
Well, you know, I think if you think about this as a literature professor, this I think about this all the time, and I'm kind of of two minds on it.

30:36.000 --> 30:51.000
On the one hand, it strikes me as if you ask the question, it suggests a priori that literature has kind of lost its place as a cultural value in itself because you're asking, can we instrumentalize it a bit?

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
Is it going to make us better? Your brain on Jane Austen, is that going to make you a better person?

30:56.000 --> 31:11.000
But again, I realize we live in the real world and we have to answer those questions. You know, for the ancient Greeks, it was this idea of catharsis. So if you did see something, you did see a murderous display on stage, somehow was supposed to cleanse you of those similar things.

31:11.000 --> 31:31.000
So it did have that kind of socially, I'm sorry, socially social balance. Today, I think, you know, in terms of does literature breed empathy, the way I look at it is like, I think of Aristotle's definition.

31:31.000 --> 31:45.000
He says, history tells us what happened, it gives us something concrete, something real, but it's contingent. In epic poetry, we can extrapolate from that literature, gives us these universals.

31:45.000 --> 32:09.000
It's like you said in your talk at Bard, Erare non fazzy, right? Errors? They're not true, Dante, right? They're not necessarily true, but they're somehow real. Like, I think of literature as creating these real situations out of the make-believe that, of course, we can empathize with them by analogy.

32:09.000 --> 32:24.000
You know, take, for example, Virginia Woolf's to the Lighthouse. It's fiction, right? But to me, what will tell you more about a woman's experience in the 1920s? What will help you empathize more?

32:24.000 --> 32:40.000
Or a boy's experience? For me, the empathy was at the very beginning when the mother promises to take him to the Lighthouse, and the father says, if it doesn't rain, and the father says it will rain.

32:40.000 --> 33:00.000
The kid wants to murder the father. I think that that was so true because it pops up so many times. Somebody who looks at that negative side and just dismantles that whole illusion that you have created.

33:00.000 --> 33:11.000
But you were talking about Aristotle, let's be a little pedantic here. Aristotle uses the word empathy only once. No, you mean catharsis.

33:11.000 --> 33:29.000
No, I hate catharsis, but he uses the word empathy and battles just once. And he uses it to indicate an imitation. He talks about a coward, and when the coward reads about soldiers escaping, the coward will feel this in his hands.

33:29.000 --> 33:45.000
It's very similar to what we are saying that it reflects in our own psyche, but we still haven't solved whether judgment is in the Lighthouse.

33:45.000 --> 34:02.000
No, but I think it's very interesting to make the distinction between human experience in the world and what happens when we read a work of fiction and how it's different.

34:02.000 --> 34:26.000
And I think there's something I like to call it the aesthetic frame, whatever you want, that there's a safety involved in dangerous experiences in fiction that allows us an exit, but it also allows us an expansion of consciousness, not possible in the real world because I would not have coffee with Russ Kolnikov.

34:26.000 --> 34:35.000
So, you know, I would save myself that experience, but in literature you don't have to.

34:35.000 --> 34:48.000
But that is the extraordinary instrument that we have invented as a species to survive, which is the imagination, that allows us to have an experience before having the experience, not having an experience at all.

34:48.000 --> 35:07.000
And also, I think that literature in all these works and yours organizes that chaotic fragmentation of reality were in order to make sense of what surrounds us every day, what we experience every day.

35:07.000 --> 35:32.000
We need to turn it into a story that we tell ourselves, but it's better when we read it in the Bronte's or that kind of culture also conditions us in our reception of art and one of the things that I find distressing.

35:32.000 --> 35:42.000
Now, it's the voyeuristic side of consuming art.

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
And we see it all the time, we see it whenever there's a film, it's based on a true story.

35:48.000 --> 35:57.000
And that's a sewing device. It's not a true story. Even the difference is it's all made up and it can be good or bad.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
But it's a country of the lines that writers used to do. This is not based on it.

36:04.000 --> 36:11.000
The most egregious example of this, I once got a book that was a novel.

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
And the editor had sent a little note out. The novel was about a rape.

36:17.000 --> 36:28.000
And in the letter it said, and just so you know, the author of the novel actually was raped and she is allowing, you know,

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
he's going to talk about the actual rape in relation to the fictional rape.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
And I remember, listen, it might have been a wonderful book, but I just put it down.

36:39.000 --> 36:48.000
And this is, you know, what was Simone Vail said, 75% of our life is imagination and fiction.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
And that's not known.

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
But just to play devil's advocate a bit, because obviously, you know, by necessity,

36:57.000 --> 37:03.000
I'm aligned with this position as a teacher of books of literature and I want them to, you know,

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
permeate the world and people to be reading constantly.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.000
But I think, for example, my mom, right, she's an immigrant from Southern Italy.

37:11.000 --> 37:17.000
Great school education, very intelligent woman, but she's not a reader, never has been.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
She's a deeply empathetic person.

37:19.000 --> 37:27.000
Now, just one half to, in other words, I wonder what literary people, if they back themselves into a whole,

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
if they push the literature makes you more empathetic model.

37:31.000 --> 37:38.000
It makes you not, has the possibility of making you. But if you go that way, it's easier than experiencing

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
all this shit that surrounds us in the world and faltering it.

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
I hear you, so I guess what I'm saying is there is another way to frame or contextualize the literature,

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
expand empathy argument. You mentioned an expansion of consciousness.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
And, you know, now I'm thinking a lot because I don't know what that frame would be,

38:00.000 --> 38:08.000
but I just worry about a kind of, you know, there's a tendency in literary criticism now with a neuro criticism

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
where they're sort of finding what your brain does as you read a certain book.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
I think it's fascinating. It's wonderful, but I also feel like it's part of the dominant, you know,

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
the scientific discourse is always going to take precedence over the humanistic one

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
and kind of now it's even starting to drive literary services.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
I'm sorry, in the Middle East, one time I go.

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
Your mother might be the Roger Federer of feeling empathy.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
As a tennis man, it would be very cruel to my dad.

38:39.000 --> 38:50.000
However, if she were the person who ever had a practice would make her better at, I think.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.000
No, no, no, but these are, I think these are great points, actually. So we don't want to say,

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
which, by the way, in some of these studies, there is Keith Oatley, I don't know if you know who he is,

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
he's the person who's sort of gone the furthest, making the argument that reading literature

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
makes you more empathetic, they've done empirical studies, et cetera, et cetera.

39:12.000 --> 39:19.000
If you look at some of those studies, I think methodologically there are some fudgy stuff in there.

39:19.000 --> 39:30.000
And is empathy, if we're talking about feeling in or feeling as, always the best thing?

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
Or it certainly isn't enough for reading literature, man.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I didn't think about this.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
We, as readers, have a certain experience, which is individual, it's not collective,

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
but it's not the same from one reader to the other. So I trust my experience with literature,

39:52.000 --> 40:00.000
and I know that throughout my childhood where I didn't have a relationship with any other human beings,

40:00.000 --> 40:08.000
except one nanny until I was eight, I knew the world, I knew adventures in death and love and betrayal,

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
and I knew all these things from stories, and so I trust that.

40:12.000 --> 40:19.000
I hear that I guess my thinking is I do think there are some things, some contemporary issues that literature really does,

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
reading more and reading better really does affect. For example, one's ability to detect fake news.

40:25.000 --> 40:34.000
I really think that the more, seriously, the more you, because literature is fundamentally an active processing verbal information,

40:34.000 --> 40:41.000
imagining out from that, and sort of, it holds critical thinking along with creative imaginative thinking.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
I do think that one can essentially index that the more one reads, the more one is exposed to literature,

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
the less likely one is to be susceptible to fake news. So that I would go on a limb on scientifically.

40:55.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm wondering how to sort of contextualize the rubric of empathy within something that is more aligned with what reading is,

41:06.000 --> 41:15.000
which is processing stories and narratives and working with language. That's my question.

41:15.000 --> 41:27.000
It's just that literature gives us the words to say what we experience, and that is enough.

41:27.000 --> 41:41.000
So, I did this experiment with a class one time. When you say literature gave them the words to say things,

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
but oftentimes young students would just say things about themselves. So I give them an assignment.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
I say, this is going to be an assignment. You do not write yourself about yourself, write about something else,

41:53.000 --> 42:00.000
and use an inanimate bobjack. It turns out the backpack is talking about them.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
So, there's a sneaker, so they're talking about them.

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
They're good readers because literature talks about you all the time, points of finger at you and saying,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
this is you or this is not you.

42:13.000 --> 42:20.000
Are we, you know, sometimes maybe reading or thinking of the after narrowing down themselves?

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
Of course, we're reading stories all the time. And not just on pages.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
We look at our window and we see two people we don't know having a discussion,

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
and we read their body language to read the facial expressions.

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
And when they look at the unlocked side door in your house, then you start reading the situation differently.

42:44.000 --> 42:55.000
So it's a constant thing that we do. What we don't have in that situation is access to the interior worlds of those people.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
And that's what literature does.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Absolutely right.

42:59.000 --> 43:05.000
That's right. Because we're creating narratives, I mean, out of that situation all the time.

43:05.000 --> 43:10.000
You see someone go into a store and she comes out with a bag.

43:10.000 --> 43:18.000
We haven't seen anything inside the store, but we link the events and create a narrative out of it.

43:18.000 --> 43:26.000
I want to reframe this just a bit because actually sort of psychodynamically empathy is quite neutral.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
It can be used in a positive sense or a negative sense.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
And the best example of that was a German film, The Lives of Others,

43:35.000 --> 43:44.000
where a Stasi agent is incredible as a torturer because he can feel right into someone.

43:44.000 --> 43:52.000
And certainly people who are analysts and therapists know how careful one has to be by even just echoing something.

43:52.000 --> 43:58.000
One has said to you because it could go straight in like an arrow, not a bomb.

43:58.000 --> 44:06.000
And then at the end of the film he's developed positive empathy for the people that he was originally torturing

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and then comes to their rescue.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
But it's very neutral and can be a very dangerous weapon.

44:13.000 --> 44:20.000
And I don't want to politicize things, but before Alberto, I mean, when Alberto first mentioned this theme,

44:20.000 --> 44:27.000
right after that Obama put out his list of what he was reading this year.

44:27.000 --> 44:35.000
And he said the point was to develop empathy through reading for others that we don't know.

44:35.000 --> 44:43.000
But we know that people in power can use empathy in a very negative and destructive way.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
So I don't want to sentimentalize the word.

44:45.000 --> 44:53.000
But wouldn't it be actually if you're torturing someone then if you were having empathy you would be also feeling the torture?

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
No, you see that's what, but you feel that you're thrilled about the other person's being tortured.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
And that would usually fall into psychopathic kinds of reading.

45:03.000 --> 45:07.000
But empathy can be used extremely well by connet.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
I mean that's the point. I just don't want it to get sentimental.

45:11.000 --> 45:21.000
Actually if you, looking at the research on this, torturers, people, you know, they would not fall into the empathetic category

45:21.000 --> 45:30.000
because they couldn't be feeling, they can be reading the other very well.

45:30.000 --> 45:41.000
But if you're actually experiencing, say, in the Edith Steinthink that you're experiencing some form of pain along with your victim,

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
that's what you're arguing.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
No, I'm saying that you can get turned on by it.

45:46.000 --> 45:53.000
The digression is a very large turn on and sadism is, I just want to keep it real here.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
That's right.

45:54.000 --> 46:03.000
So sadism is when you have an erotic response to the other's pain.

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
And the erotic response you were reading then as empathy.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
No.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
No, I'm sorry, I just want to get it straight.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
Yeah, it's definitely the point.

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
I'm just suggesting that we have to keep in mind the purpose and the motivation for empathy.

46:24.000 --> 46:33.000
And if one knows how to feel into somebody else's pain, one can use that as a weapon.

46:33.000 --> 46:40.000
And that there is a kind of, you could call it erotic or not, but there is a turn on.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
There's a whole turn on that happens.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And I think that's what we're seeing in our society now.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
I just listened to a program on NPR today of an ICE agent and what they were going through

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
as they were turning people away at the border.

46:55.000 --> 47:02.000
So we just have to be very aware of what we use our capacity to feel into other people's experience.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
No, I'm sorry.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
No, go ahead.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
No.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
No.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
What about people who don't experience empathy?

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
The reason I'm asking is, you know, I'm raising a child who's an Asperger, you know, an autism spectrum.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
He's very articulating.

47:18.000 --> 47:23.000
He said, I feel sympathetic about a lot of things, but I just don't feel empathy.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
And I just wonder what about people who don't feel empathy?

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
And do they train themselves by reading or do they learn?

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
I think the research on this on psychopathic and then autism, which is very different.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
But the research on psychopathic is all over the place.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
They know that guilt and empathy seem to go together.

47:49.000 --> 47:56.000
But having no empathy also means having no guilt.

47:56.000 --> 48:06.000
And the reasons are everything from neural networks to, you know, being raised in a certain way to, you know, it's just endless.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Nobody knows.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
But empathy can be used as a tool.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm referring to what Beverly said about torture.

48:17.000 --> 48:25.000
During the military dictatorship in Argentina, France sent their torture specialists

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
from the war of the Deers towards Argentina to train the military in torture.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
And the documents were published.

48:35.000 --> 48:44.000
And so one of the things was that the torture has to feel, and they use the word empathy for the victim,

48:44.000 --> 48:51.000
in order to know what will hurt the victim most, because sometimes it's not a physical pain.

48:51.000 --> 48:56.000
And so they, well, I won't give you examples because they're horrible.

48:56.000 --> 49:04.000
But it wasn't a question of empathy in order to feel that person's pain.

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
It was empathy in order to know that person's pain and normal order to direct the needle.

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
So what is the difference between drawing and feeling?

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
I mean, in a way, that's a pretty good question.

49:17.000 --> 49:24.000
It is. But could part of it be back to the start of our conversation, when one is sympathetic

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
towards someone, one shares, the sense that word has the word sharing built into it.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Empathy doesn't. I agree. I think you're right.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
I mean, empathy is a neutral.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
It happens and it can be used for good or ill.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
But sympathy seems different.

49:39.000 --> 49:46.000
Maybe sympathy is that sharing of pain that sort of would

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
harness the potentially negative applications of empathy.

49:51.000 --> 49:59.000
But it also has a certain connotation, sympathy of arrogance or super seriousness.

49:59.000 --> 50:06.000
I feel sympathy towards what you are doing, but I can't condone it.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Why can't condone it?

50:07.000 --> 50:15.000
So I put myself in a position of excusing or not excusing what you're doing.

50:15.000 --> 50:28.000
But from a higher level, instead empathy goes into the character, goes into the person that you're facing.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
No?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah, I agree.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
It's feeling as. That's what I think the usual definition is.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
It's not knowing.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
It's not knowing.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
To me, it's feeling as.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Well, that becomes an epistemological question.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
It certainly is.

50:43.000 --> 50:55.000
But imagine two people who are in the same accident and they both lost children in this accident.

50:55.000 --> 51:02.000
Does it make sense to say that one feels sympathetic to the other when they were experiencing the same thing?

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
Would one ever say that?

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
Would one person say to the other, I feel sympathy for you?

51:08.000 --> 51:18.000
No, I can't imagine that. But neither can I imagine the use of the word empathy in that circumstance.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
But obviously, we're talking about two people who would be capable of either.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
But would you define this a very interesting situation?

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
What would you call that feeling between these two people?

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
Well, that shared experience, I don't have a word for it.

51:35.000 --> 51:43.000
There's a PR news a few years ago about the two girls in Wisconsin.

51:43.000 --> 51:49.000
They were, they were, they cut school and they were lying down on the train track.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Just having a conversation and they both fell asleep.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
And the train came and cut all four legs.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
And that's the situation where they said the two girls were teenagers.

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
They said only we know each other now what we experience.

52:07.000 --> 52:17.000
So it's not even I feel the pain in my leg or, but exactly we know what we know each other.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
They said.

52:18.000 --> 52:23.000
Well, maybe the way to answer the question would be through an analogy, a fictional analogy.

52:23.000 --> 52:31.000
Is the scene in Othello early on where Othello, who's this great general, but he's like in his 40s,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
which was really old back then.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Wasn't the new 20, right?

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
It was like being 60 today or something.

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
And he's married Desdemona, the most eligible woman in all of Venice.

52:45.000 --> 52:51.000
And the senators can't handle this, that there's this great general, but he's a more, he's a foreigner, right?

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
He's not of the Italian aristocracy.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
And they call him to account.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
And they say, Othello, what potion did you give Desdemona?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
How did you be witcher?

53:03.000 --> 53:09.000
And he says, basically, I told her my life story and to hear it, what does Desdemona seriously incline?

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
He told her story.

53:12.000 --> 53:22.000
So that's an example of a story, a fictional construct eliciting a, he uses the word compassion.

53:22.000 --> 53:30.000
And it's like, is that a sympathetic, to me that's a sympathetic reaction, a sharing, you know,

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
to harp on the rule of the word, rather than an empathy.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
It's so powerful.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
And he says, that's the only witchcraft that I used, right?

53:39.000 --> 53:46.000
Along with lines, I wanted to ask about the sort of interface between imitation, which does come up in some of the neuro,

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
neuroscience studies, but everyone knows what imitation is.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
On the one hand, how does that interface with empathy?

53:53.000 --> 53:57.000
And I think this also gets to the question of knowing versus feeling.

53:57.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm thinking of people who have autism, let's say, in our idiosyncrasance, and they could play these gorgeous, you know,

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
bock fugues with what appears to be great feeling.

54:08.000 --> 54:15.000
And I defy any of you to say they are having the feeling, they're not having the feeling, it's quite confusing.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
But imitation is somehow interrelated with empathy.

54:18.000 --> 54:28.000
Absolutely, the fictional example, Parix and Oncis, Donkey Quotty, who imitates the heroes of the novels of Shivery,

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
he is red, and he does it very well.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
It's the world that's not prepared for his ethics.

54:35.000 --> 54:47.000
But that's a little like trying to identify a speech act, and the story that I'm reminded of is the philosopher's old joke about the parent.

54:47.000 --> 54:53.000
Where the plumber comes to the door and he knocks, no one is at home with the parrots, who is it?

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
And the plumber responds, the plumber.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
He knocks again.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
The parrot says, who is it?

55:00.000 --> 55:09.000
He responds again until the man is so worked up, he bangs in the door, the door crashes and he falls down dead of a heart.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
The family comes home and they look on the plate and say, who is it?

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
And the parrot says, the plumber.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
And the parrot says, the plumber.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
Is he making sense?

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
Right, right.

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
Well, and I mean, the imitation thing, I think this is a great question actually.

55:32.000 --> 55:44.000
I mean, Darwin talks about it in his book about emotions in human beings and animals and how there's a mimicry that's part of certainly mammalian

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
experience.

55:45.000 --> 55:55.000
And that's, you know, I mentioned the baby's imitating faces and then that response seems to go away, actually, with maturity.

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
And in certain neurological patients, there's chronic imitation as well.

56:00.000 --> 56:11.000
It says if there's some form of disinhibition that has happened through the injury and people just start imitating the doctor, for example, if they're in conversation with the doctor.

56:11.000 --> 56:17.000
You know, what is the connection between these imitative responses or if you're reading a book?

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
The thing that Jadui calls, I love this, organic clicks.

56:22.000 --> 56:36.000
He talks about that when you're reading poetry and, you know, either the sounds or the music or the meanings of the words create these, you know, moments of excitement or Suzanne Langer.

56:36.000 --> 56:53.000
And another great philosopher, I think, about experiencing art, not just as, say, these judgments or thoughts or intellectual experiences, but also as rhythmic experiences that are very much embodied.

56:53.000 --> 56:58.000
And that through that embodiment, there are meanings attached to that.

56:58.000 --> 57:11.000
I mean, poetry, I mean, Dante, who you talked about is a great example of music being part of the experience of walking with Dante, which is very much a block.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
But I certainly don't think we should disassociate intellect from feelings, I think.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
No, I agree with you.

57:17.000 --> 57:27.000
But I'm saying that we can never, let's talk about rhythm and music as part of the experience that is connected to empathy.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Certainly.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
But also absolutely and extricably connected to one's intellect as well.

57:34.000 --> 57:38.000
I don't think you can separate feelings and intellect.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah, I think what you're saying is very important in your introduction of the word compassion.

57:43.000 --> 57:51.000
Because to me, what you get through literature is a kind of enlightenment at the same time as empathy.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
You get enlightened about people's lives.

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
I've just read a series of novels that all take place in Eastern Europe.

57:59.000 --> 58:06.000
And I would never have a sense of what it is like to live there as I had read these books.

58:06.000 --> 58:12.000
So I think enlightenment and empathy and literature go together.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
That's a great point.

58:14.000 --> 58:25.000
I was reading, this is really totally off the wall Italian writer, Kurzio Malaparte, who had all sorts of fascist associations.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
But he wrote this book, The Kremlin Ball.

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
And growing up during the Cold War, we grew up with this idea of the evil empire, right?

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
That there was communism versus democracy.

58:37.000 --> 58:43.000
And we all know that, of course, there have been so many historical abuses of it.

58:43.000 --> 58:51.000
But it's hard to forget the original intent of it, where there was a scene where he describes the workers coming home.

58:51.000 --> 59:04.000
And for the first time being able to go to the theater, and this image of these workers streaming out of the trams and Moscow and going to the theater straight from the factory, you know, we of course know that historical experiment failed terribly.

59:04.000 --> 59:09.000
But just that image is like rescued, like you say, it's rescued from time in literature.

59:09.000 --> 59:17.000
It's, you know, whether it was, I think it was a fictionalized account with based in fact, but where else would you get that?

59:17.000 --> 59:32.000
But we go back to what we were saying, based on fact, Malaparte is a wonderful example of somebody who tells the story that you think is real because you feel it is real.

59:32.000 --> 59:40.000
But he makes stuff up in the skin where he's talking about the American occupation of Naples.

59:40.000 --> 59:49.000
The key scene is where they all starting and they start eating the fish in the aquarium, the famous aquarium of Naples.

59:49.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And the last dish is the mermaid that they have a very big creature on a slaver to the table. So he makes you feel empathy for a time and a people, a historical situation, creating fictions, not giving you the number of people who died or that kind of fact.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
And in fact, it may not be necessary or so what does the question?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So a question I would have for all of you is I think that was beautifully put, Alberto.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:46.000
If a society reads less and we are reading less, you know, all the statistics show, and I think it's 30% less the last 10 years, you know, the average American reads 17 minutes a day and spends a combined six hours, something like that on television and social media.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
What effect will that have?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I mean, is there, will that somehow work against our capacity for things like compassion or use the word enlightenment, Beverly?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:12.000
What would be, you know, if we could even speak of it in terms of empathy or just, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what will happen if a society continues to engage with literature less and less as ours is.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Well, you know, a little bit of populace is pretty new.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yes, so it's just making mass literacy.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It's not a question of already getting worse as a question of can we be better with it?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And then there was a, um, um, leaves of grass.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
What would be, and by blue Ontario, sure, and I'm paraphrasing with him, which is okay because it's with him.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
He's, he writes, um, if you want a better society, produce better people.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And I think that's what we, that's our opportunity, not that we can be nostalgic for better people.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Just that we know we're capable.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But we have, uh, every generation has a fake nostalgia for something that never happened.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, we think, uh, before we read everybody had books.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But when we really think of what happened in my class in high school, we were too to connect books.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And the others were busy with soccer and all sorts of other things.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We weren't a community of readers.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
There's tiny percentage of readers.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Every society since the invention of writing.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And, uh, as you say, we hope that maybe those readers can contribute to make better people.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But from the evidence now, it's not happening.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I think also every generation has fake panic.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Yes.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.000
You know, I read, there's this letter, E.B. White, in 1930s, he saw the first television set.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And he really panicked.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
He said, this thing, this machine is going to destroy culture.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Yeah, and I think we're doing fine.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah, we forgot.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So think about the alarm about the book.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
The technology of the book was a terrifying technology.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Uh, the train, and you see, it's, you know, these moral panics, moral panics about the novel in the 18th century.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
That, you know, one-handed reading, everyone, that was the terror.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That young women were going to go into their mood wars, you know, literate girls, and get off on these romance stories.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And that's why slaves were forbidden to learn to read.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Absolutely.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Absolutely.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
That was a terrifying prospect.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
That and that freedom thing.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yeah.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But, um, no.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I wanted to ask about this idea that maybe some good writers, not me, perhaps all, are particularly strong in having empathy.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And then what's the relationship between that and sort of just general creativity?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Because it seems there are some writers who write imagined worlds that they've never experienced and are so wonderful and portraying it.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So, is there a relationship?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I should think that there's a relationship with, between good literature and great empathy.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Some of the best writers in the world were horrible people who would kick children in the street.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Um, no, I was wondering whether some writers may benefit from being so empathic.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I know not all.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I think that's what it's called as the readers.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Yeah, there are differences with the readers.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Yeah.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Oh, it's, it's...

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I'm a different reader from day to day.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Mm-hmm.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So, um, so I can never, uh, or I'm looking to finish a novel.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Um, I can have this idea that I'm going to address these feelings on, but I'm a moving target.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But when I think of everyone who's going to read it, it's going to mean something different to all my five or six readers.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Um, and, and,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:23.000
and it's, it's not my job to set them up for anything.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Um, whether I'm empathetic or not, it's my job to create a world.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
No.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Am I a better, I hope?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
But you raise an interesting point because today, there are many readers who say one can only imagine a world,

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
one should only write about a world that one has lived.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yes, I know.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Well, I'll see that.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That, that, that whole, um, lazy...

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's not your story.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Um, um, um,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
then you wouldn't read the Bible.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Right.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You wouldn't read much, actually.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
I mean, you know, I feel like I, you know,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
in many ways I leave a sort of narrow light, you know, in my new house,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
walking up to stairs and writing and then eating dinner.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I mean, I wouldn't, you know, yes, it's about, I think it does expand our experiences.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It's about really what's saying.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
We carry these, you become fat with books after a while, right?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And it's interesting that apparently those little studies, I mentioned the oldly, uh, studies that non-fiction does not have the same effect as fiction.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Right.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And this is a sort of interesting thing.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And also, guys, there was a gender difference.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Now, I don't mean us here at this table.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Of course not. What I mean is that in the general populace, men avoid fiction.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
They had lower fantasy levels.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Uh, and, um, you know, there was like a whole, and it was not-

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But you know, I read a book with one hand.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Like this.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
So, it's so different.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
In the audience, you have a majority of women, whatever you, in the literary events.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
In literature and in science, it's reversed, right?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So I do the two kinds of talks.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
One for a literary audience, one for like neurologists, uh, uh, uh, uh, neuro science people, and then it's reversed.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
It's about 80% men.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Now, we live in a culture that has divided these two.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I mean, speaking of the helix center.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And I think it's certainly a problem for boys if they grow up thinking that reading novels or poems are a-

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
For sissis.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
For sissis.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And that- that's a losing proposition for the culture.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Uh, you- I- I- uh, thought of a question, but it's perhaps too personal.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
You said that your son is autistic?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Does he read?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
He does.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Yeah.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
How does he read?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000
He reads- I- he's reading interesting because he was in middle school a couple years ago when he was reading Enocharana.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Wow.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And it was- I was amazed that he chose the book himself, and I specifically asked him about how he felt about each of the characters.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
For instance, he really liked Steve-a.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I said, well, you are not a judgmental person.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:27.500
I said, you are not a

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.000
reality-a-fair.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
He said, well, yes.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And he really- he liked everybody because not in his words, everybody is having so much trouble in life in that book.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And I think- I don't think- I think he does express- he doesn't really have the ability to feel empathy, but he sees these things.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Would you say that he doesn't have that ability or he doesn't know how to put it into words?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I think that's the expression.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Expressive language is part of it, yes.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
He sounds empathetic.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
To me too.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I like Steve-a.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I think he's smart enough to feel like it.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
He really can't employ the words.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yeah.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But it's interesting when you say the boys are, you know, are- are more- push more into the sign.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And I have noticed that- like I teach at Princeton and the students who come in, often the boys are from STEM.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You know, they take writing class.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:40.000
They take literature class with the- with the idea that, you know, they cannot really make a living by reading or writing.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
They still have to go back to be their engineers.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yeah.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That's the reality they face.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yeah.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
But at Princeton, those guys are not frightened of feeling the feminine if they read a novel.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But I think there's something a little deeper.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I mean, as a woman novelist, there are two of us here, that people- that- this happens to me all the time.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:14.000
When you sign books, if men come up, they say, I don't read fiction but my wife says, would you sign the book to her?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And I've been pondering this for years now.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And first of all, I think, why didn't your wife come?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Number one.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Number two.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:37.000
I- I- I wouldn't- so- so- so- and then I realized that, you know, again, when you read, you have to submit yourself to the text, to the authority of the text.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That's part of the joy for me anyway.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It's a form of opening yourself to this other voice, an internal narrator that takes over your own, yours is gone, and that voice is there.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And that passionate submission is hard for men who are invested in the idea of masculinity and those particular hierarchies.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Well, there's- I said, part of experiencing art- experiencing art is- is venue, and- and- and also, um, circumstance I was- I- I don't give a lot of readings early on.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I was reading in Maryland, and a man came up to me, and he was obviously interested in the fact that I had written a book.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And- and his- and his question, he was trying to process- he was a contractor, I learned from talking to him, and he was trying to process this.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
He wasn't familiar with- with novels, and- and his question was, did you type all of this yourself?

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And- and- and- and I immediately sought it.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
This wasn't necessarily for him to understand the art in some level. I said, well, yes, sir, I did.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And that- and that was- that was good for him. He- he- he could- he could accept that.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Right.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Um, so it's not only of what's in a novel, it's what surrounds a novel.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Of course.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Um, and I think that's really, um, uh, maybe that's-

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Well, that's right. So that- I think these, if you want to talk about power structures or perceptions, they're all part of our reading experiences.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And I know in my life that there have been moments when I've been open to a text, and moments when I've been closed, and I've had to go back at another moment in my life, then suddenly I'm able to get it.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You know, I've changed. The text is the same.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:46.000
But it's true that, um, certain people, and not just men, certain women, are not able to submit to the text.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You just give them a sort of- it was an anecdote. Um, uh, Edward was signing books.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
A man came up to her and said, would you sign this for my wife?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And she said, what about you, big boy?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's it. I couldn't use it. I'll- I'll get more credit.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But again, in our culture, the way we read and approach fiction in that naive way, it really happened.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:31.000
A woman asked me about a novel in which the main character's head is severed from his body in the first scene.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It's sewn back on, and the novel proceeds, and it's a lobster.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Um, but the, uh, this woman came up to me and she's, again, trying to process- is this all a biographical?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:53.000
This lady who's sitting up here.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Well, I know that there are many in the room who would love to ask some questions if you're open to this.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Totally.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:13.000
And we know we all have fabulous stories to tell, but I ask that we limit ourselves to real questions, and not declarations or narratives.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So, uh, and remember, you will be on the Internet forever.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That's a little bit of witness intimidation, I think.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Yes, please.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Oh, yes, and please do come up to the mic.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I can't find it like this. I asked a question about internal cancer.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
And you thought of oxygen- Oh, right.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Your level is there, help.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
And of course- Can you speak louder?

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I'll go on.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's like, what is it?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Opsy-toasten.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Chemistry.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
The chemistry of, uh, empathy.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Where are you?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Where am I? Do we have it?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And can we exhibit it?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Are there other oxytocin people?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I don't even know how to spell it.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Yeah, so it's, um, it's, um, a hormone that's been associated with trust.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And the thing is, it's also been associated with schadenfreude and other emotions.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So the early ideas about oxytocin as the trust drug, it's there in pregnancy, lactation, and birth.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And so there was this idea that- and it's true if you- if people inhale oxytocin, most people get more trusting.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I mean, there are empirical studies that suggest this, but it's also a lot more complicated than that, as you might imagine.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It's not the trust love.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
My God, they put it in our water.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Yes, heaven, heaven for kids.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Um, but also, for example, there's something that interests me a lot.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That borderline patients, um, it's a personality disorder, psychiatric disorder.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:29.000
If you give oxytocin to controls and borderline patients, the borderline patients have exactly the opposite response.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
There are about three, at least three papers that I've read on this.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And what is the opposite response?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:52.000
They get the upset, tense, anxious, and of course this may be related to earlier attachment issues, um, that are probably part of what we think of as borderline personality disorder.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So it's- it's complicated what it has to do with empathy.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Earlier I was talking about, I think, attachment questions are important to think of in terms of empathy and- and the development of the individual person.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So- but that's about the chemistry I have.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:22.000
You have to come up here.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Hi.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I have a question about, um, so based on the discussion, my understanding is sympathy is feeling- sorry, sharing the feeling why empathy is feeling into feeling as someone.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So I have two questions, is it correct then that empathy is more powerful to motivate action because you feel as someone?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:56.000
And then the second question is, in the thought experiment, if we humanity has to choose between the two, which one should we have and why?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
What is that?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
What does it say?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:08.000
No, you have to answer it.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Um, hi.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
We have a question.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We have a question.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It was a very good- it was a-

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Yeah, that was a- a great question.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Um, I don't know if one has to choose between the two.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:38.000
In fact, I- I- as a writer, I- I imagine that they work, uh, in tandem, that- that- that- that sympathy and empathy are necessarily part of the same- the same thing, um, which is an attempt to-

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to use a really ordinary word.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Understand someone's, uh, perspective and then their- in their situation.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Um, and as you point out, why we want to understand that can be very different.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I might want to understand it so I can know how to get to you, but I might also want to understand it so that I know how to feel.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Mm-hmm.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And I think, you know, I'm thinking of literature, this is the ending of, um, Tequila Mockingbird when Scout walks back to Boo Radley's house.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000
And it's like literally the first time she's been on his porch and looked down into the world from his perspective, right?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And her dad had said, never judge someone until you walked a mile in his shoes.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
So that to me is the seamless blending of empathy and sympathy.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
She's imagining life as Boo Radley.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
And she feels- she says, it made me sad that we've never given him anything.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So she sympathetic towards him.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:46.000
So I think that, you know, at its best the two are working in tandem and some stories can just capture that blend so- so pitch perfectly.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Right.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You too.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Oops.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Go ahead.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000
No, no, no.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I- I wonder if sometimes we do use sympathy as a shortcut so not to push ourselves to be unpathetic.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Because as our Bertels said, you know, we say, I feel sympathetic about the situation which it just ends the discussion.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Mm-hmm.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Okay, but when someone say someone loses someone, you don't say, I send my deepest empathy.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
No.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And you really feel I send my deepest- I don't see the dismissiveness of it.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
To me it's an immersion and someone else's- to me it's compassion, the term earlier.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Yes, but you know, you can sign that sympathy card as a politician who is- who wants to express that and be acknowledged for expressing it.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And that's different from someone who is feeling sympathetic but also empathetic thinking about-

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Right.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Right.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Interesting that you also write condolences because you are saying, consoling, to feel pain with you.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Mm-hmm.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
And that is, I think, a more interesting emotion.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That's- That's-

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I think people can have too much empathy.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000
You know, the doctors, for example, the psychiatrist, I have a seminar, a narrative psychiatry at Weill Cornell.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000
And these psychiatric residents, we talk a lot about empathy and how to manage empathy.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Because, you know, if you're feeling really what the patient is feeling, then you kind of go to pieces.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And in order to not go to pieces, you have to have certain defenses that will help you manage the relation.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
That's the interest.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Wants to jump in a reader and not to say quand.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Yes.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Yes, that's right.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:49.000
So, I get that as a reader, we can feel empathy about a characterization or a book or a screenplay.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I'm wondering, as writers, are you conscious of creating empathy?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Or are you just creating something creative and do you give it any thought in your work?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Well, you know, I'm- I'm- I'm-

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
...of average intelligence and I- but I know that I can't-

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I don't believe that.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I cannot- I cannot create empathy.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
I can tell a story.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Whether- whether someone has an empathetic response to that story, I can't control.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000
In fact, that's the only reason I write is because I cannot control what a story does when I release it.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And it's instructive to me.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And- and some of the response to the work allows me to understand my own empathetic feelings about the work.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So it's- so not only is- is any novel a work in progress always, I- I say that it's- so am I the writer in relation to that work?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:03.000
But as a writer and as a good writer, you know consciously or unconsciously that this detail that you will add will do something,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.000
you call it empathy or whatever, but it will create a different response in the reader.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:25.000
That is to say, when- when Dante has himself as a pilgrim trip on the stone, or when Pinocchio realizes that his father, his soul,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:33.000
his shirt to buy- his coat to buy him a schoolbook, that detail does more than advance the plot.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Let's say you're talking about my entity toward the reader.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:51.000
No, creating empathy in the reader. That is to say, by putting that detail in, if you are a good writer, you know that the reader at this point will shed it here.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I think that's- I think that's more confident, like you were saying, that's my ability to feel empathy toward the reader and to get at the reader.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000
And not necessarily my empathy or some of the feelings toward my character.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Oh yes, yes.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
So it's at that?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And that's more technical.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Technical, mechanical, and I run from it like crazy.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Because- Oh, that's just- Yes, but because in all, in that way, as writers, we are manipulating a story, but also, as I said before,

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:41.000
every reader is different, and to address my understanding of my empathetic feelings toward one reader is to maybe miss everyone else.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Yeah. So yes, on a very, very rudimentary level, that has to be present.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But- But you have to know how to balance it. Oscar Wilde said that you have to have a heart of stone, not to laugh at the death of little nails.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Well, yes. Well, it's- it's-

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Writing is full of contradictions. You have to write what's inside you, but you have to keep it at arm's length so that it doesn't become you.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Yeah, and- and that's difficult, and that- and that happens.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Well, sometimes it happens.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But if the stars are kind yet.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Yes, it's a social justice warrior who believes that human beings live by heuristic rule of thumbs, and we live by stories,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
and we don't make rational decisions, we make emotional decisions.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And as- as the human race is heading off the cliff, and you people as writers want to change the direction of humanity, tell them new stories.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And these tools of empathy and so forth, and what are your thoughts in terms of-

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:09.000
How do you reach people who have kind of set in their ways about what they believe the world is?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Can you use these tools to actually change people's minds?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
You know, as I heard you think, I remember earlier you-

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Percile, you said you had five or six readers. There's a famous Italian writer Alessandro Manzoni who said,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
but anyway, Manzoni wrote this essay once where someone criticized writers of doing something.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
They said only writers of genius should use this device, and Manzoni said,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
is someone really going to stop themselves and say, am I, or am I not a genius?

01:26:51.000 --> 01:27:00.000
And that question sort of reminds me of that a little bit in that, you know, I don't know if a writer can really ask him or herself

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
how I'm going to shape the world, you know, that they're trying so hard just to get the story right.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
They're trying to kind of tell it in a convincing way to try and use language in a certain way.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:22.000
That layer of instrumentality, in my experience, my small experience has never really entered into the equation.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
When we're turning it around, because I don't think writers can know whether, you know, everyone wants to ask someone,

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000
and we'll come up and say something about this really had a big, made a big impression on me or whatever.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But if we turn around and think about the books that have changed us, right,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
that have reoriented in some important way, our vision of the world.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So that, certainly it's happened to me, I think it's probably happened to everyone.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
If you had to choose one, which would it be?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Oh God, you know, well, it's funny because you mentioned little no.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.000
There are two that I read when I was 13, David Carperfield, and Wuthering Heights that scared the life out of me,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
because you know, it was completely amoral.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So, to the amoral point, because you mentioned your social justice warrior,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000
and I think that's, you know, beautifully put, I guess what I would say is, you know,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I think of Sartre at the end of his life where he had dedicated his life to social justice warrioring,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
and he was all about engaged literature, but he ended his life obsessed with Bloebare,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
and he would repeat passages of Madame Bowery, and he wrote this biography, the

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000
idea of his family, where, you know, making fun really of Baudelaire's, there's not

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Baudelaire, Bloebare's lack of social engagement, but to me that's the space that literature also has a social thrust.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It's not necessarily in engaging sociopolitical issues, but in changing the lives of readers in this dimension that is both in

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:04.000
and of, not of this world. In other words, that if we instrumentalize, if we peg literature too much to

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:12.000
sociopolitical theme, we lose that space of the Baudelaire's, of the Wuthering Heights that are, you know,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
that they can change people in a different way.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:23.000
There are two novels that come to mind, Richard Powers, decided to write about climate change by writing fiction and the overstory.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:32.000
And here's a 700-page novel on the destruction of the forests, and I cannot tell you how many people I know who have read that.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And Amitof Ghosh does the same thing. He writes about climate change through his novels, whether it was the glass palace or now the gun

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
warrior, I think, was his last one.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You know, so I think there is a way in which you get into people who will pay attention if you put persons into the tail,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
that they wouldn't necessarily read nonfiction on that.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So I'm sorry.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Well, that's okay. I was also going to say that there is an important distinction between instruction and just exhibiting complexity,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
exhibiting ambiguity, which is obviously important in fiction.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Thank you. Thank you for a very evocative discussion.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
This is a follow-up question about obsession.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Yesterday, many of us spent several hours watching television.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
It's also a follow-up on television.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Now, a young woman sat there, young by my staff, and aroused many different emotions.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:45.000
She was both attacked and praised for 30 years of work.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:52.000
She described a situation where she was sacked in a fairly public way a couple of months ago.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Did that arouse empathy? Did that arouse sympathy? What did that arouse? And what are we going to do about it?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Depends on who you are.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Yes, if you watch, it's that science fiction channel, Fox News.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Then you dismiss this obviously intelligent and engaged person and don't venture toward anything like empathy,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:46.000
because one, you may not be capable of it. And two, it raises too many questions that you're not capable of answering.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Sadly, you can't argue with people who won't look, and that's where we stand.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:03.000
That reminds me of the earlier point where I said my sense was that people are reading less today.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
This is kind of part of a larger crisis about our social-related literature.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And the consensus in the group seemed to be the opposite, that this is kind of a constant that readers are always a kind of self-selecting minority.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:23.000
And yet, I also think that if we look at history, there are periods of cultural decline.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
In other words, it's very hard, as they say, to catch a falling knife and know exactly where one stands.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But I also think it's dangerous to have a neutral attitude that this is just the way of the world.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Perhaps our weakening engagement with literature is part of a general lowering of public discourse,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:52.000
and that there is a connection between the two. That's sort of my stance on it, where it's impossible to pretend we don't live in an age

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
where false narratives are prevalent.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I always tell my students, fake news is the opposite of literature.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Literature tells you it's make-believe, and it sort of brings you to the truth,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
whereas fake news pretends it's real and is just trying to manipulate you.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:17.000
And so, I guess I'm less likely to kind of see this as just business as usual.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I do think there is a connection between.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:27.000
I think there is a side that's business as usual, because readers have always been a minority,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and choose in between the circus and a reading of poetry.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Most of the Romans went to the circus.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But what is constant and has to remain constant as well is the fight for culture,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
for those better people that Whitman wanted.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And the fact that the decline is constant or steady doesn't mean that we should give up.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:12.000
In Atwood's The Testaments, the character of Aunt Lydia, is exactly the danger with which we are faced.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000
The woman who has been fighting for her rights, for women's rights, for what she feels is just.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And at a certain point feels that the social pressure is so great that she just gives in

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
and becomes part of the enemy.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
That's the danger.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I just want to bring the other side as literature can be propaganda too.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That's where I came from. Literature doesn't always do good things.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Literature.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But is it literature at that point?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
In other words, for example, think of great...

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I think there are caught literature, right?

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
These are books.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
You read these books that way too.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Actually, I think these books probably have more harm than goods to communist countries, right?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000
But are we so arrogant to say they're not literature?

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Because there are some who were good.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I mean, we were in Maya or less than San Argentina.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
We were flooded with these bad translations of Russian novels.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And some were very good.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Thus was Iron Forged and the flowing of the dawn and so on.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Yeah.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And so...

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Did you ever read cement?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.000
No.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
No.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
No, I don't recommend it.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:59.420
It sounds like a junk-

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:07.420
When we read our history and depth, maybe things aren't worse than they ever were.

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:12.420
But they feel like it because we are experiencing it now.

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.420
But some things are really different.

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:18.420
I don't know if a sound bite is better than real thinking.

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.420
I suspect that it is.

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:22.420
That a sound bite is not as good as real thinking.

01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:28.420
But I give my students or I challenge them to go watch one of our debates and then go read the

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:33.420
Douglas Lincoln debates and tell me how they are alike.

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.420
That's right.

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.420
I agree.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:36.420
I think.

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:37.420
Okay.

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:43.420
I was just going to bring up something of this point because I'm in the art world.

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:49.420
And there was a time when after the abstract expressionist, the pop art came out and then

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:53.420
there was the philosophy of that art in life for one.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.420
And it began to undermine a certain zeitgeist came out.

01:36:56.420 --> 01:37:02.420
And also the thought of the continual present rather than the arrested time in the past.

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.420
And so not today.

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.420
I see so many people.

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:11.420
There are so many stories of fake news, news, autobiographies, confessions that they feel

01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.420
literature is all around them.

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.420
So I just wondered how some of you felt with this onrush.

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:20.420
I know in the art world we suffer also from something of that.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:26.420
Art has been categorized into political and feminist and all kinds of categories that really

01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:33.420
come from the media in the news world rather than the assimilation in time of interior

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.420
experience.

01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:41.420
And so I'm just curious to know how you feel about this continual storytelling of the media

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:48.420
and everywhere in terms of the fiction world, which I think is and does have some problems.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.420
I think that in the countries that are less advanced with media, you're getting some interesting

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.420
stories.

01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:58.420
I mean, there are things coming out sometimes from Afghanistan or other places where it's

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:00.420
still a bardic tradition.

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:04.420
No, I think this is a very good point.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:11.420
And we were really talking about it earlier about, you know, fictions, and this is here

01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:12.420
too.

01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:17.420
This is not just propaganda, various kinds, but fictions that reassure the reader,

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:22.420
with conventions that they already know, right?

01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:25.420
Movies are like this all the time.

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.420
You watch a movie.

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.420
So what is that giving to the viewer or to the reader?

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:33.420
It's giving what's already known.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:41.420
So it's a kind of repetition, which then I think is not terribly helpful.

01:38:41.420 --> 01:38:44.420
It's because it's hard.

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:46.420
That's hardly new.

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.420
It's not a donut.

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:57.420
Art is always complex art and art that presents problems.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:00.420
It's always played second fiddle too.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.420
Folk music.

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:07.420
But the thing becomes, but it brings people to art.

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:14.420
I don't really like television shows, but it would be great if on a television show we had

01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:19.420
an art hero who wasn't a superhero, but a thinking hero.

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:26.420
And maybe as an artist, it's a failure of mine that I haven't tried to produce one.

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:33.420
But it's always the case that we will be fighting against the easier things to consume.

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.420
And I consume them too.

01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:41.420
I think maybe just as individual, we just have to push back a little.

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:47.420
I just have to use this example because I wrote the novel where a mother had a conversation

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:54.420
with a son who committed suicide and died so they talked across the border between death

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:55.420
and life.

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.420
And my publisher said, can we publish as a memoir?

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:04.420
Because it's more attractive in a way.

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.420
It is more.

01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:07.420
I said, well, nothing.

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:12.420
It came from my life and nothing in this book happened in real life.

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:17.420
I could not talk to a dead son, but that's what it looks like.

01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:20.420
What's the easiest way to?

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.420
So, Chris, when mass literacy came about, I mean, you're absolutely right.

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:27.420
What was really hot?

01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:32.420
Translations of anti-clerical French pornography into English.

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:34.420
They sold like hotcakes, right?

01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:41.420
So, nuns having sex and, you know, that was really big hot stuff.

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:47.420
And when you look at the numbers, what middle march, for example, sold, it's not that many.

01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:49.420
It was a big success.

01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:55.420
So, you're absolutely right that there's a minority of what we like to hear, think of

01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:57.420
as serious readers.

01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:00.420
But I think that minority is essential.

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:05.420
I guess I hold on to the idea of literature as a category.

01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:11.420
It's the books that are culture values over time, separate from all this, the noise that's swirling around.

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:18.420
If you think of a book like Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, right, where everyone's happy, it's a dystopia.

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:24.420
They're doing drugs, having sex, and there's something banned.

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:26.420
Books are banned, right?

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.420
That's the world leaders don't want people reading books.

01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:34.420
They don't want them, they see it as a threat.

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.420
And I really think that-

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.420
You said this as melancholy making.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:42.420
That it leads to complex emotions, at least to complex thought.

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:50.420
And I think there is a connection between, in a really profound way, between great literature and a sense of freedom.

01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.420
Yeah, that's your last question.

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:56.420
I wonder if we could go back to the beginning.

01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:02.420
I do have a question, but I want to make a suggestion about the question.

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:12.420
The question is going to be whether the panelists would agree or disagree, and if disagree why, with the following distinction,

01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:19.420
which is that empathy may have more to do with imagination than sympathy does.

01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:27.420
And I would think of empathy as primarily the ability to imagine the feelings of another,

01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:34.420
which is less viscerally involving than sympathy and therefore more constructive in some situations.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:43.420
And if we do think of it that way, might it explain some of these issues that we're struggling with,

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:55.420
such as the wish for, or the way people are drawn to emotional engagement in soundbites and tweets and so on,

01:42:55.420 --> 01:43:02.420
with a diminution of the ability to imagine something different and other.

01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:14.420
Also might it contribute to the differences between men and women in terms of responses to fiction, where many times men who are very comfortable

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:20.420
with not being stereotypically male are nevertheless less interested in fiction,

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:34.420
and might that have something to do with differences in comfort with imagining?

01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:40.420
Well, again, it's like what, so the roots of the word imagination come from image,

01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:48.420
and so that would go back to a form of mental imagery, I think, if you want to take the roots.

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:57.420
So to imagine probably is reliant also on memory, another form of mental imagery, right?

01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:04.420
You can't really imagine unless you've experienced something and you have mental imagery to use.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:13.420
So then the question is imagination, a cognitive function with emotion attached?

01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:20.420
There are probably unconscious forms of imagination.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:30.420
You know how Manfon Helen Holz talked about unconscious inference as part of a way to predict what's going to happen.

01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.420
I'm just throwing out a few things. I don't have the whole answer.

01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:41.420
Is imagination more about this kind of cognitive function or?

01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:48.420
Well, I've removed the word image only because so much of it is language,

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:55.420
and I don't, I mean I suppose we could continue to use it,

01:44:55.420 --> 01:45:07.420
but somehow that privileging of sight seems to disregard the fact that we don't think without language.

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:12.420
Well, once we reach the mirror stage.

01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:29.420
But that, you know, I'm interested in this thing about what you said about,

01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:34.420
and I've seen it myself in bookstores, people, more women reading,

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:39.420
and I also see that at stables I ride, and it's always girls.

01:45:39.420 --> 01:45:40.420
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:45.420
At the stables. I don't see any boys.

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:56.420
But it's, in my personal life, I don't encounter those differences.

01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:03.420
And so it's interesting for me to hear them, and when I imagine what you're saying,

01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:10.420
then I'm calling on stereotypic images of the culture that allow me to understand it,

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:16.420
and I'm not quite comfortable with that. I don't know what it means.

01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:21.420
You wrote a book called Dictionary of Imaginary Places.

01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:26.420
Yes, but that was imaginary geography.

01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:36.420
The utopia is that we try to imagine and never work.

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:39.420
Like Cleveland.

01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:41.420
Exactly.

01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:45.420
This is about, this isn't really a question, but it is.

01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.420
So in my world, I'm an actor.

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:53.420
So actors have to use imagination all the time.

01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:57.420
But the imagination comes from words.

01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:02.420
So if I play Lady Macbeth, which I have, I'm not, I haven't experienced murder.

01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:04.420
I've never murdered anyone.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:07.420
If I'm doing Tracy Letts August Just Age County,

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:11.420
then I have to know this woman who has drugged out of her mind alcoholic with her children,

01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:15.420
who she's destroying, but she loves and doesn't want to lose.

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:20.420
So there is within us, I believe,

01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:27.420
we are born with or without empathy, and it would be very difficult to be an actor

01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.420
if one didn't have, it wasn't born with empathy,

01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:38.420
because you wouldn't know how to get your imagination to work with the words.

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:43.420
I mean, you have Shakespeare, so he's given you that, and when he wrote,

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:47.420
he certainly wrote a tragedy or a comedy.

01:47:47.420 --> 01:47:53.420
And the universe out of he is because he is able to make us think things

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:59.420
that we have all felt somewhere in our lives, and that's why his plays have endured.

01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:07.420
But it isn't really a question of words or imagination or sympathy or empathy,

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:12.420
it's that it's a marriage of all of those things coming together.

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:18.420
And also the experience of living, raising a child, losing a child,

01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:24.420
a child not speaking to you for years, and you don't know how to get back

01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:28.420
and ask for forgiveness, you don't know how to, you know,

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:30.420
we don't know how to talk to each other.

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:35.420
So we read and we have brilliant people like yourselves helping us,

01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.420
and then when you go to the theater, we read a great book,

01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.420
and I hope part of what we do is that it does change us.

01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:45.420
But to me, it's all, it's a filigree.

01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:46.420
Great.

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:47.420
Thank you.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.420
So thank you so much.

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:54.420
You were also compelling.

01:48:54.420 --> 01:49:02.420
You had to stay here willingly and happily and gladly and gratefully for the whole afternoon.

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:06.420
So thank you for really a brilliant conversation.

01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:09.420
Thank you.

01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:38.420
Thank you.

01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:43.420
Thank you.
