00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hi everybody.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.560
Welcome to the inaugural meeting of the Helix Center for the 2015-2016 season.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.560
I'm Rob Penzer.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.520
I'm the associate director.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.840
And we have some terrific programs in store for you, but before I even tell you anything

00:21.840 --> 00:28.320
more, if you could silence your cell phones, that would be helpful in terms of the electronics

00:28.320 --> 00:30.920
in here for our recording.

00:30.920 --> 00:37.280
On Saturday, October 3rd, understanding genius with Steve Su, who's the vice president for

00:37.280 --> 00:42.600
research and professor of theoretical physics at Michigan State, Rex Young, associate professor

00:42.600 --> 00:47.720

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
Davis.

00:53.240 --> 01:01.240
Then on Saturday, October 24th, the realm of mystery, Saturday, November 7th, speak memory,

01:01.240 --> 01:04.880
Saturday, November 21st, translation matters.

01:04.880 --> 01:12.660
And then we have a special symposium in conjunction with the Adepth's Cultural Institute of Paris

01:12.660 --> 01:18.680
on December 4th, 5th, and 6th, a Freudian perspective on what ails contemporary culture.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.520
For further details on all of these, please go to our website, Pilexcenter.org, which

01:23.520 --> 01:29.080
is completely revised as of today, thanks to Erco Hanlon, our web developer and designer

01:29.080 --> 01:34.160
at Columbia University in EJ, digital media, and follow us on Twitter and Facebook too.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.880
Now to today's roundtable, epigenetics at work.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.920
And when I announce your name, if you could raise your hand so the audience can identify

01:41.920 --> 01:43.120
you properly.

01:43.120 --> 01:48.400
Francis Champagne, associate professor in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University,

01:48.400 --> 01:52.960

01:52.960 --> 01:57.400
at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and jointly appoint in the Department of Mental

01:57.400 --> 02:00.600
Health in the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

02:00.600 --> 02:07.120
Fae Lee, assistant professor of biology at New York University, and Jessica Tyler, professor

02:07.120 --> 02:13.280
department of epigenetics and molecular carcinogenesis at the University of Texas MD Anderson Center.

02:13.280 --> 02:18.240
Okay, now we'll start.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.240
I'm going to start to ask you what these are epigenetics.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.240
I think there are a lot of epigenetics actually.

02:28.240 --> 02:35.880
So in my opinion, epigenetics have two major properties.

02:35.880 --> 02:43.600
One is particle phenomena that is independent of DNA sequence.

02:43.600 --> 02:50.600
And the second one I think is being practical through the cell type of genetics.

02:50.600 --> 03:06.400
Gen2 is a good one.

03:06.400 --> 03:13.120
What's interesting about definitions of that term is how you define it is really much shaped

03:13.120 --> 03:16.760
by the training that you've had or the field that you've come from.

03:16.760 --> 03:23.120
In my lab, we have a lot of discussions about this particular phenomenon.

03:23.120 --> 03:28.760
So if you're coming from the field of genetics, then epigenetics typically will be something

03:28.760 --> 03:33.600
that needs to be heritable because that's what genetics is really, the science of genetics

03:33.600 --> 03:35.720
is dealing with.

03:35.720 --> 03:43.600
If you are coming from a field that's looking more at molecular biology and gene regulation,

03:43.600 --> 03:51.600
then heritability is not necessary for your inclusion in the definition of epigenetics,

03:51.600 --> 03:59.440
really about processes that regulate gene activity without modifying the underlying gene sequence.

03:59.440 --> 04:07.200
But I'd say there's still debates, the funding agencies define it for us, which is a good

04:07.200 --> 04:11.000
definition to use because that will define who gets money on epigenetics.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.840
And they use a fairly broad definition that does not require that the demonstration that

04:17.840 --> 04:23.840
is heritable, in fact there's very few actual demonstrations of heritability of an epigenetic

04:23.840 --> 04:24.840
mark.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.160
So it's best that they probably deviate from constraining our definition.

04:29.160 --> 04:36.640
And to make it even more confusing, there's an intermediate definition, which is the inheritance

04:36.640 --> 04:45.920
of information, independent of DNA information from cell to the daughter cell when a cell

04:45.920 --> 04:47.600
divides.

04:47.600 --> 04:53.440
So that happens throughout our body all the time, which is different from passing on the

04:53.440 --> 04:57.480
information to your daughters or your offspring.

04:57.480 --> 05:03.800
Yeah, I think that's one of the common misconceptions when we talk about when we go on to Wikipedia

05:03.800 --> 05:10.640
and we read what is epigenetics and we see that these chemical modifications that are

05:10.640 --> 05:16.760
heritable, what that means is indeed, just to reiterate that point, it's passed from

05:16.760 --> 05:18.000
cell to cell.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
But what we really don't know and what has fascinating implications are, what does this

05:22.000 --> 05:29.280
mean for our kids, in the past we had thought that whatever we did didn't matter because

05:29.280 --> 05:35.760
it was all just our genetic code, our DNA, the blueprint of the machines of the cells.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.680
So this blueprint, the DNA is the same in every cell of the body.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.720
And this gets passed to our kids and it's fairly robust.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.760
So it doesn't matter if we smoke or if we drink or what we do.

05:46.760 --> 05:53.520
But now epigenetics comes along and it throws this twist in that, hey, what if what I'm

05:53.520 --> 05:57.960
doing can be passed to my children and all of a sudden the game has changed.

05:57.960 --> 06:04.800
And that's what I think makes this other inheritance, this transgenerational epigenetic inheritance

06:04.800 --> 06:05.960
fascinating.

06:05.960 --> 06:12.080
And it's definitely something worth a lot of discussion and it's also controversial.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.360
I think that there's two sides to the issue so maybe we should find out what side everyone's

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
on.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
I agree.

06:19.360 --> 06:26.120
I think that's why I think epigenetics can have profound impact on ourselves because

06:26.120 --> 06:34.440
that means what we do and what we experience could have effect on ourselves and also our

06:34.440 --> 06:35.440
children's.

06:35.440 --> 06:43.160
Although this evidence to show that epigenetic code can be passed transmitted through cell

06:43.160 --> 06:45.880
cycle to cell cycle.

06:45.880 --> 06:52.400
But at least in mammals whether this epigenetic information can be inherited to the next generation

06:52.400 --> 06:57.960
to the grandchildren, I think it's still limited to the evidence.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.200
Maybe you can do more.

07:00.200 --> 07:06.720
I would say so, I mean I think there's phenomenological suggestion that something of that nature is

07:06.720 --> 07:08.520
going on.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.840
But it's a challenging question.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.840
It's not that people aren't asking the question.

07:11.840 --> 07:16.880
People are asking the question, it's a really methodologically challenging thing to do.

07:16.880 --> 07:22.120
So much remodeling is going on when the sperm and egg come together.

07:22.120 --> 07:28.880
That it's really hard to look at the time course at which these molecular changes are

07:28.880 --> 07:36.120
going on and seeing what is actually, are the epigenetic baggage that these cells are

07:36.120 --> 07:37.120
bringing with them?

07:37.120 --> 07:40.360
Is it being removed and replaced?

07:40.360 --> 07:41.360
What is going on?

07:41.360 --> 07:43.120
That's really challenging.

07:43.120 --> 07:52.040
But certainly in the behavioral models, especially when it comes to paternal effects, there's

07:52.040 --> 07:57.480
fairly strong suggestion that at least something is going through the germ cells.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.640
For example, we do a lot of experiments.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.840
Again, most of the evidence is coming from laboratory animals.

08:05.840 --> 08:11.600
We can certainly see patterns in long-lived species, but it's very hard to look at trench

08:11.600 --> 08:15.760
generational inheritance in a mechanistic way in humans.

08:15.760 --> 08:22.600
But if you take cell sperm from a male that has had some sort of life exposure, variation

08:22.600 --> 08:29.080
in nutrition or stress, and you take that cell and you fertilize an egg and you implant

08:29.080 --> 08:35.760
that egg into another female, you can see effects predicted by the male's experience

08:35.760 --> 08:37.840
in the subsequent offspring.

08:37.840 --> 08:41.960
So that does suggest that something is going through the sperm.

08:41.960 --> 08:47.080
Although there could be other processes at play and there could be other things going

08:47.080 --> 08:54.040
on, the sperm is a cell and it carries other things besides DNA and epigenetic modifications.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.680
So we don't know what it is, but something is going through.

08:56.680 --> 09:02.200
And I think that is actually a very big change to the way in which we've thought about the

09:02.200 --> 09:04.280
process of inheritance in general.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.880
So it is not a wipe away everything.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.760
Here's your new genome, work with it, and start anew.

09:12.760 --> 09:17.960
Normally there's probably a lot that is already in place and preformed.

09:17.960 --> 09:24.520
And I think the genomic imprinting literature has really helped to create some basis for

09:24.520 --> 09:28.600
the suggestion that this inheritance is going on.

09:28.600 --> 09:33.960
So we know that there are genes that in a sense carry a molecular memory of which parent

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
they came from.

09:34.960 --> 09:39.880
They're either silenced or active depending on whether you inherited that section of your

09:39.880 --> 09:41.840
genome from your mother or father.

09:41.840 --> 09:47.880
So that suggests that something in your own genome has been influenced by the parents

09:47.880 --> 09:49.440
that you got it from.

09:49.440 --> 09:55.760
But then it's the question of whether we can extrapolate this to non-imprinted genes and

09:55.760 --> 09:59.560
environmentally induced phenomenon, but I think it's still questionable.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.520
So I have a question about genomic imprinting.

10:02.520 --> 10:10.520
But doesn't that get reestablished when you still have chemicals and molecules around

10:10.520 --> 10:16.600
the other than the DNA from the mother and the father from the egg cell and the sperm.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.960
So there is a ratio and re-establishment.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Right.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.960
In the germline it's all re-arrased.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.960
Yes.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.960
But when it's re-established.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
Yes.

10:25.960 --> 10:30.480
I thought you still had some of the environment.

10:30.480 --> 10:36.680
You still have maternal factors that are probably driving the imprinting process in general.

10:36.680 --> 10:37.680
Right.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.200
There is something that is driving it from the mothers.

10:41.200 --> 10:47.720
And that's why studying maternal transmission through the germline is avoided quite actively

10:47.720 --> 10:52.320
because we can't remove the environment from the germline in that case.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.240
Whereas we suspect that to be more the case with fathers.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.400
Though, you know, father, sperm can influence the maternal environment and so on.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.800
So there's a lot of unique processes.

11:03.800 --> 11:13.400
Yeah, there's evidence like in 1944 there's a Dutch family, you know, a very famous example

11:13.400 --> 11:21.520
that the starvation through the grandparents can affect the grandchildren.

11:21.520 --> 11:28.160
So these evidence, I think there's some evidence, the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.

11:28.160 --> 11:34.200
But still I think the molecular mechanism for me is still unclear.

11:34.200 --> 11:43.840
During germline stage and also fertilization, they can have drastic epigenetic reprogramming

11:43.840 --> 11:49.040
that tend to erase, you know, that the previous epigenetic marks.

11:49.040 --> 11:56.320
And how these epigenetic information can be inherently through, I think for me it's still

11:56.320 --> 11:58.280
a challenge to understand.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.480
But I thought the effects of a Dutch famine only persisted.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.480
A few generations.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.480
A few generations.

12:04.480 --> 12:05.480
Yeah, yeah.

12:05.480 --> 12:12.600
And it's complicated, especially with women because women carry inside them the cells that

12:12.600 --> 12:15.360
are going to produce are offspring.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.880
You know, they're developed.

12:16.880 --> 12:21.520
Even, let's say I was pregnant and I had a female baby in me.

12:21.520 --> 12:29.680
That baby already has inside it produced the cells that are going to be that baby's babies.

12:29.680 --> 12:37.560
So if my diet, my nutrition is really poor, I'm not only affecting me and the epigenetic

12:37.560 --> 12:42.840
marks on my genome, but also on my baby and my baby's baby.

12:42.840 --> 12:50.000
So this is why the great grandchildren is really important that an effect be seen in

12:50.000 --> 12:58.320
the great grandchildren of a female in order for it to be really transgenerational inheritance.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.320
Absolutely.

12:59.320 --> 13:06.520
But I mean, it's still completely valid that what we do in the way we eat, where we smoke

13:06.520 --> 13:12.120
our lifestyle, there's clear evidence from studies from Francis and other people that

13:12.120 --> 13:21.880
that affects the health of your offspring in severe ways, like likelihood of having obesity,

13:21.880 --> 13:29.080
diabetes, short lifespan, major effects due to our own diet.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.600
Absolutely.

13:30.600 --> 13:35.800
And those effects, you know, in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's going through the

13:35.800 --> 13:38.240
germline or going through some other factor.

13:38.240 --> 13:43.720
It means that the lifestyle or life exposures of one generation can absolutely have an

13:43.720 --> 13:49.400
effect in subsequent generations, grand to grand offspring, even great grand offspring.

13:49.400 --> 13:56.520
And so I think that realization is probably very important from a policy standpoint.

13:56.520 --> 14:02.720
And it doesn't, you know, you can separate that from the controversy over whether there

14:02.720 --> 14:10.040
is a mark that is being retained even when there's no exposure to poor nutrition or stress.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.040
Indeed.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.040
Yeah, we've been studying genetics for a long time, well over 30 years.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.040
And why?

14:16.040 --> 14:17.720
Why have we been studying genetics?

14:17.720 --> 14:23.040
Because family studies and twin studies have said that diseases are heritable.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.200
What does that mean?

14:24.200 --> 14:30.760
You know, what we do is we compare genetically identical individuals, monozygotic twins,

14:30.760 --> 14:37.160
to fraternal twins or dizygotic twins, twins that have differing amounts of polymorphisms

14:37.160 --> 14:40.480
or, you know, sometimes called mutations in the DNA.

14:40.480 --> 14:46.000
And we see that, hey, the dizygotic twins, the fraternal twins are more dissimilar than

14:46.000 --> 14:47.680
the monozygotic twins for various traits.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.040
We can measure how much does one twin gets schizophrenia versus the other.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
We call this twin discordance.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.400
And it makes a nice example for heritability.

14:56.400 --> 15:02.480
So if we see that more of a particular disease starts to happen with dizygotic twins, we

15:02.480 --> 15:07.520
say, well, we know that their genomes are different, so it must be genetic factors.

15:07.520 --> 15:13.240
But when it comes to, well, one of the problems is that we've been looking for 30 years and

15:13.240 --> 15:16.360
finding these factors hasn't happened.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.360
It hasn't really happened.

15:17.360 --> 15:22.960
And, you know, so now, you know, the genetics community is, you know, pouring millions and

15:22.960 --> 15:24.920
millions and millions and millions of dollars into this.

15:24.920 --> 15:29.480
And we have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, well, not, damn it, maybe about 100,000 individuals

15:29.480 --> 15:32.240
in these giant genome-wide studies.

15:32.240 --> 15:37.360
And we're starting to find some very small, significant effects.

15:37.360 --> 15:42.560
So but not enough, not enough to account for schizophrenia, depression.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.560
And so it begs the question, well, what else is there?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.000
And this is where epigenetics comes in.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.840
And so to tie back to what we're talking about, okay, so mom's, you know, state of mind when

15:52.840 --> 15:56.080
she's pregnant, can affect the baby.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.080
And how does this happen?

15:57.080 --> 16:00.720
Well, it turns out, and this is sort of a new area, and a number of publications have

16:00.720 --> 16:03.280
been coming out in the last couple years, really.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.920
It's really in its infancy.

16:04.920 --> 16:12.080
But if mom is anxious, this actually correlates with epigenetic changes in key regions of

16:12.080 --> 16:16.560
our stress response genes, but not ours, in babies, babies stress response genes, as

16:16.560 --> 16:23.280
well as a number of sort of early measures like, you know, baby's cortisol response,

16:23.280 --> 16:27.720
or this methylation mark, this epigenetic mark, and these genes.

16:27.720 --> 16:32.320
And so it's a really compelling argument that, hey, maybe the reason we're seeing heritability,

16:32.320 --> 16:36.960
maybe the reason where we're seeing these traits inherited is because, let's say, mom

16:36.960 --> 16:42.800
is depressed, and then she becomes pregnant, and then this is going to affect the baby's

16:42.800 --> 16:51.320
stress response, or stress axis, the HPA axis, and this is a major risk factor for subsequent

16:51.320 --> 16:52.840
psychiatric comorbidities.

16:52.840 --> 17:00.200
And so we're really passing a trait not necessarily through the sperm and through the egg, although

17:00.200 --> 17:04.720
it's a possibility, a controversial possibility, but what is not as controversial as this

17:04.720 --> 17:12.680
idea that it is being passed through what we call a generational epigenetic effect, as

17:12.680 --> 17:16.160
opposed to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance?

17:16.160 --> 17:21.600
And I think, you know, that's something that makes the study of epigenetics very compelling.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.280
I also did read an interesting study.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.360
So why do you call it epigenetic effect?

17:25.360 --> 17:26.360
I'm not understanding.

17:26.360 --> 17:32.600
If it doesn't have to do with modifications, then why is it epigenetic?

17:32.600 --> 17:35.400
Well, so I think it's called an epigenetic effect.

17:35.400 --> 17:45.480
So I think Emma Whitelaw, who was one of the first labs to find one of these famous inherited

17:45.480 --> 17:52.160
epigenetic phenotypes in this mouse strain, the agouti mouse, it's a classical mouse example

17:52.160 --> 17:58.680
where an epigenetic difference, a DNA methylation difference, sometimes I'll say epigenetic,

17:58.680 --> 18:03.320
sometimes DNA methylation, DNA methylation can compact a DNA, it acts like a light switch,

18:03.320 --> 18:08.080
and it turned off this gene that caused the mouse coat color to change.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.800
And what's really interesting about this example, and I'm digressing for a minute, but I'll

18:12.800 --> 18:18.520
get back to it, is that this effect was passed on to the offspring.

18:18.520 --> 18:23.400
You could also drive the effect with different nutritional factors when the mother was pregnant,

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
which was interesting.

18:24.400 --> 18:34.280
But anyway, Emma Whitelaw was saying she needs a terminology to distinguish between these

18:34.280 --> 18:38.800
passed on traits that go through the germline, which she was saying is transgenerational

18:38.800 --> 18:44.360
epigenetic inheritance, versus those that are passed, for example, through stresses

18:44.360 --> 18:50.600
to a mom when she's pregnant, or possibly behavioral changes that a mother may confer

18:50.600 --> 18:57.160
or bother a stressful environment when a child is in a critical stage like when their baby

18:57.160 --> 19:03.640
through things like maternal neglect, possibly postpartum depression, abuse, these sorts

19:03.640 --> 19:04.800
of things.

19:04.800 --> 19:11.400
So I think it's really just a terminology to try to distinguish those two.

19:11.400 --> 19:16.160
But it's actually very interesting because you mentioned, Emma Whitelaw has very strong

19:16.160 --> 19:19.040
opinions on the use of the term inheritance.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.480
So with very constrained views on when it should be used.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.200
And you outline exactly why she's done that.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.480
But we have a much looser use of the term.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.520
You can inherit money, and you don't have to be biologically related to the individual.

19:32.520 --> 19:39.200
But you know, and so rather than thinking of, you know, transmission, which could entail

19:39.200 --> 19:47.000
any mechanism, inheritance is really much about this kind of biological material around

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
the DNA being transmitted.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.760
In a way, I had understood it.

19:49.760 --> 19:56.160
Maybe my understanding is already 15 years old was that epigenetic had to do with what

19:56.160 --> 19:59.080
you said, DNA methylation.

19:59.080 --> 20:06.400
So that's why if there is a DNA, something on the side of the DNA that is methylated,

20:06.400 --> 20:10.440
isn't that what epigenetic transfer means that goes there for?

20:10.440 --> 20:11.440
Yeah.

20:11.440 --> 20:18.440
So the modifications, either DNA modifications or some histone proteins, which are associated

20:18.440 --> 20:26.200
with DNA, so these modifications can change the structure of the counting, the DNA structures.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.840
So through that, it can affect the gene expression.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.240
They even turn down the gene or turn off the genes.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.240
So that's through the...

20:35.240 --> 20:37.680
Well, isn't that inheritance?

20:37.680 --> 20:43.280
It depends if you're going through the germ line and through meiosis, or whether you're

20:43.280 --> 20:46.600
just going through cell division and mitosis.

20:46.600 --> 20:51.400
That is not really inheritance, but it's still epigenetic if you're going through mitosis.

20:51.400 --> 20:59.120
Or if the environment in utero is affecting the growing baby, that is not inheritance

20:59.120 --> 21:04.640
because it's going through the cell cycle as well.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.400
So epigenetics is a broad word.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.320
So I'll go back a little bit.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.400
Why nature need epigenetics?

21:13.400 --> 21:18.960
So the genetics based on the DNA sequence, you change on the DNA, but epigenetics based

21:18.960 --> 21:27.040
on the modification of the proteins, histones, like a DNA modification.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.520
So why they need this system?

21:30.520 --> 21:39.000
One thing, I think your change DNA is difficult, it's a long term, but epigenetics code is

21:39.000 --> 21:44.560
more diverse and flexible and also reversible.

21:44.560 --> 21:50.560
And I think that both way the biological organisms response to environment, they take either

21:50.560 --> 21:54.080
genetics and the epigenetics pathways.

21:54.080 --> 22:02.320
I mean, have these advantages to response quickly and this phenomenon can be reversed also.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.080
There's an example I like to use for that.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.960
Why would maternal stress be good ultimately?

22:09.960 --> 22:14.760
Let's say we're a caveman and there's all sorts of dinosaurs around, right?

22:14.760 --> 22:19.000
That's accurate, right?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.760
And it's a very dangerous environment.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.680
Well, what do our genes want?

22:22.680 --> 22:25.800
Our genes want us to survive long enough to reproduce.

22:25.800 --> 22:29.480
Okay, they don't care if you live forever and ultimately get depression.

22:29.480 --> 22:35.240
They just want you to live into your 20s or maybe earlier in caveman times and reproduce.

22:35.240 --> 22:39.840
And so if it's a very dangerous time, you want your offspring to be jumpy.

22:39.840 --> 22:44.760
And so if mom is jumpy and you're having a baby and the baby is not going to go down

22:44.760 --> 22:52.040
to the water hole and just start being lax a day school, you want them to respond to twigs

22:52.040 --> 22:53.400
and so they stay alive.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.480
And this makes a lot of sense.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.240
That is exactly how epigenetics can help us.

22:57.240 --> 23:04.720
But of course in a society like ours where we're obviously not necessarily adapted in

23:04.720 --> 23:09.520
the same way, we may see some deleterious consequences of that.

23:09.520 --> 23:14.840
I did want to return to one aspect and we were talking about what is epigenetics and molecular

23:14.840 --> 23:15.840
marks.

23:15.840 --> 23:20.560
I did and I admit to not reading in detail, but this is sort of a bullet point from a review

23:20.560 --> 23:26.080
paper I was reading talking about what are some of those possible molecular marks that

23:26.080 --> 23:31.960
could cause an epigenetic effect or an epigenetic phenomenon to be inherited.

23:31.960 --> 23:40.320
And what's really interesting was when they took microRNA from sperm of fathers that were

23:40.320 --> 23:46.600
exposed to stress and injected the microRNA into the fertilized oocyte, they were able

23:46.600 --> 23:51.920
to create the same behavioral effect in the offspring.

23:51.920 --> 23:59.000
And there's epigeneticists who will say, oh, microRNA is or is not epigenetic.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.360
But I think the key is that it's not necessarily just written on the DNA.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.560
It's supposed to be a DNA sequence independent effect.

24:10.560 --> 24:17.040
So are we going to cut microRNA some slack and allow it to confer inheritance if the

24:17.040 --> 24:18.880
evidence goes that way?

24:18.880 --> 24:19.880
Then maybe.

24:19.880 --> 24:26.680
But I throw it out there as something interesting I read as a possible mechanism through which

24:26.680 --> 24:28.720
we might confer inheritance.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.560
And this is of course important because the typical ones and something that we haven't

24:32.560 --> 24:35.280
really stressed is that they get erased.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.320
And that's why we think that's why it's controversial.

24:38.320 --> 24:45.320
Because when sperm are developing and the eggs are developing, meiosis, and when we have

24:45.320 --> 24:50.160
fertilization, we have these massive erasures of our DNA methylation and our histone marks.

24:50.160 --> 24:54.520
And so the simple answer is that, oh, that takes care of everything.

24:54.520 --> 24:59.520
Well, then why are we seeing traits passed on in this way?

24:59.520 --> 25:04.720
And so I think it's important to point out that that's one of the reasons it's controversial.

25:04.720 --> 25:10.240
Yeah, absolutely, but the RNA, the small RNAs that that's talking about, there's evidence

25:10.240 --> 25:14.440
that the RNAs direct DNA methylation.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.160
So there's RNA dependent DNA methylation.

25:17.160 --> 25:24.120
So the RNAs, if they're inherited, they could help reestablish the methylation patterns,

25:24.120 --> 25:29.720
which then themselves affect the chromatin structure, which affects gene expression.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.720
I agree.

25:30.720 --> 25:38.040
So evidence in fishing yeast, in selgens, even plant, is this small RNA, a play very important

25:38.040 --> 25:39.040
role.

25:39.040 --> 25:45.000
So they can inherit it to next generations, then guide it to the DNA methylations, his

25:45.000 --> 25:50.560
modifications to ensure the inheritance of the same epigenetic information.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
Yeah.

25:51.560 --> 25:59.480
What's interesting about the erasure assumption is that it is based on studies that were conducted

25:59.480 --> 26:01.120
quite a long time ago.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.600
So it's become a dogma in the field that there's complete erasure.

26:05.600 --> 26:11.720
And certainly there's no doubt that there is genome-wide reprogramming.

26:11.720 --> 26:19.360
But I'm curious now with the tools that we have available to us, where we can look more

26:19.360 --> 26:24.920
than just at a gross level of whether DNA methylation levels dive down, but actually

26:24.920 --> 26:33.720
look at a single base resolution to see whether, in fact, even if 1% of the DNA methylation

26:33.720 --> 26:39.480
was retained, that'd be quite a lot of DNA methylation still retained in the genome.

26:39.480 --> 26:44.800
But it would seem like most, if 99% of it's gone, it seems like it's been completely erased.

26:44.800 --> 26:49.480
But I think that's something that we need to really explore in more detail.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
And you're right.

26:50.480 --> 26:58.120
And there was two recent studies done in mice primordial germ cells, which did exactly

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
that.

26:59.120 --> 27:06.000
They did detailed DNA sequencing, a DNA methylation sequencing across the whole genome.

27:06.000 --> 27:12.600
And they actually found there was about 4,000 loci that did not lose the DNA methylation.

27:12.600 --> 27:16.320
And most of these loci were transposable elements.

27:16.320 --> 27:22.840
So actually, most of the human genome is made up of transposable elements that are usually

27:22.840 --> 27:26.720
kept silent all the time.

27:26.720 --> 27:33.240
And there's a few of them that are not silent, and they can still move around the genome.

27:33.240 --> 27:38.800
And when these are pieces of DNA, when they move around the genome, they're actually introducing

27:38.800 --> 27:41.240
mutations into the genome.

27:41.240 --> 27:47.640
And amazingly enough, where the methylation was retained was on these transposable elements.

27:47.640 --> 27:53.280
So there seems to be some mechanism that we have no idea yet how it works at the molecular

27:53.280 --> 28:00.400
level, whether they're being protected from this global erasure of the methylation marks.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.160
So that would be really exciting to figure out that mechanism.

28:04.160 --> 28:11.240
And there were some early studies as well doing cross-species pro-nuclei transfers, so taking

28:11.240 --> 28:15.000
nuclei, putting it in another oocyte of a different species.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
And depending on the oocyte context, you get less or more erasure.

28:20.000 --> 28:25.400
So there's probably a lot of oocyte factors that are directing the degree of erasure of

28:25.400 --> 28:26.560
these imprints.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.560
And so that's a really interesting source of individual variation and whether these marks

28:30.560 --> 28:31.560
actually persist.

28:31.560 --> 28:38.560
And it could well be these small RNAs because transposable elements generate pi RNAs.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.560
Right?

28:39.560 --> 28:41.080
Right, I think so.

28:41.080 --> 28:47.320
Yeah, this cluster of, you know, I've been read about them for a year or two, but yes,

28:47.320 --> 28:52.120
something that they're basically designed to silence these elements.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
Indeed.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.120
Sorry.

28:54.120 --> 28:58.680
Yeah, I've also heard about that during the Golden Conference.

28:58.680 --> 29:02.320
You know, in the sperm, keystone usually replaced by protonium.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.320
That's right.

29:03.320 --> 29:08.120
But now you realize that at least some are still there, like 5%, and some even still

29:08.120 --> 29:13.320
maintained the keystone marks for the previous generations.

29:13.320 --> 29:18.120
So that also, as you said, could play a role in the generational inheritance.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.000
Yeah, and so it was interesting.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.240
So one of the studies that focused on histones and their role in transmission looked at cocaine

29:25.240 --> 29:31.640
exposure in males, and their findings were exclusively in histones where you see this

29:31.640 --> 29:33.600
retention as you say.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.120
Although I wonder whether it's being retained or reapplied.

29:37.120 --> 29:42.280
I mean, that's, I guess the question is that there's a lot of area that we don't know

29:42.280 --> 29:46.440
from when we go from one generation to the next, but what exactly is going on?

29:46.440 --> 29:49.640
But certainly if you look at multiple generations, you'll see the mark.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.200
It's whether it's staying there or whether it's just being reapplied.

29:53.200 --> 29:54.200
That's the question.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.200
Yeah.

29:55.200 --> 30:03.000
So I read one study where various histone variants had been tagged, and they did show

30:03.000 --> 30:08.760
that they were retained at least up to the first cell division after fertilization.

30:08.760 --> 30:15.840
But I think it is a compelling, you know, source of possibility that histone variants

30:15.840 --> 30:21.240
that are retained and not replaced by protomines could confer some information.

30:21.240 --> 30:27.320
It's important to keep in mind that the 10 to 17% that people have detected is enough

30:27.320 --> 30:29.640
to account for the entire coding genome.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.720
So I mean, there's enough information in there in theory.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.880
But it's also important to keep in mind, why don't we have these answers yet?

30:36.880 --> 30:42.200
And it's hard to study this because, you know, it's sort of like the wave particle

30:42.200 --> 30:45.280
duality in quantum physics.

30:45.280 --> 30:49.920
Once you look at that, once you take that sperm and egg that was going to become that

30:49.920 --> 30:50.920
mouse.

30:50.920 --> 30:55.440
You no longer get to test the mouse later on because you've looked at the sperm and

30:55.440 --> 30:56.440
egg level.

30:56.440 --> 31:02.480
So then, you know, it's really hard to look at the exact cells that are going to eventually

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
develop.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
And I think that's one of the challenges.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.640
So we're faced with these averages.

31:05.640 --> 31:11.600
We have to take 10,000 sperm or a million and sort of infer what's happening.

31:11.600 --> 31:18.080
And the only way to get experimentally at this process involves embryo transfer and

31:18.080 --> 31:23.800
vitro fertilization, which are all very artificial in their process and how that

31:23.800 --> 31:26.440
epigenetic effects in it of themselves.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.720
So this is one of the issues that we come across when we do these studies in the lab.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.840
We can show it through embryo transfer.

31:33.840 --> 31:40.200
But you've done something that's completely unrelated to the natural process of reproduction

31:40.200 --> 31:42.720
and whether it's relevant.

31:42.720 --> 31:50.760
I think that you can kind of expand that kind of concern to, okay, perhaps we would be able

31:50.760 --> 31:57.000
to show epigenetic inheritance in the lab in species that are short-lived.

31:57.000 --> 32:03.520
But would it be relevant on a wide-scale process, you know, in society, in natural environments

32:03.520 --> 32:08.160
where you have long-lived species that need to adapt to changing environments all the

32:08.160 --> 32:09.160
time.

32:09.160 --> 32:14.600
So when people start talking about epigenetic inheritance in response to the quality of

32:14.600 --> 32:19.360
the social environment, I thought, well, why would you want your social environment to

32:19.360 --> 32:21.640
be inherited through your germline?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.960
That seems nonsensical in terms of adaptation.

32:24.960 --> 32:30.400
You should respond to the social environment which you're in and adapt accordingly because

32:30.400 --> 32:34.160
that's the best predictor of the world that you live in.

32:34.160 --> 32:40.960
But I still think it's possible, but I think we need to think about whether these would

32:40.960 --> 32:44.080
actually play out in the real world.

32:44.080 --> 32:47.560
When you say social environment, I mean, I'm a molecular biologist.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.640
What do you mean exactly?

32:49.640 --> 32:56.320
Anything from the quality of mother-infant interactions to peer interactions to, you

32:56.320 --> 33:02.360
know, adults' social interactions, so whether you're socially isolated or interacting with

33:02.360 --> 33:03.360
groups.

33:03.360 --> 33:09.200
The problem, I guess, is that you can never separate social interactions from stress reactivity.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.520
And so stress may be transducing the information.

33:12.520 --> 33:16.960
Certainly we think in the case of mother-infant interactions, it's not that, let's say, that

33:16.960 --> 33:23.440
the pure sociality of it, but rather the physical aspects of mother-infant interactions that

33:23.440 --> 33:26.480
are transducing the epigenetic marks.

33:26.480 --> 33:33.000
So are you saying that social interactions of a mother can affect the social interactions

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
of the offspring?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.240
Well, they certainly can, yes.

33:35.240 --> 33:40.640
Well, I know the nurturing studies, but older, because then how do you separate nurture from

33:40.640 --> 33:42.400
nature?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.720
In what, be more specific?

33:44.720 --> 33:48.240
So what's the nature element of it?

33:48.240 --> 33:53.640
Like you're around a mother who never interacts with anyone.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
Oh, right.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.080
So in, I work in rodents, right?

33:57.080 --> 33:59.920
So we have control over nature.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.360
Everyone's got the same genome.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.360
But yes.

34:03.360 --> 34:09.040
So the issue, and I think this is really important in the context of these discussions, is that

34:09.040 --> 34:11.880
in humans you have genetic variation.

34:11.880 --> 34:16.200
And you have a lot of what can be called many things, but niche selection.

34:16.200 --> 34:22.320
So people find themselves in environments because of biological drives that may be driven by

34:22.320 --> 34:24.040
DNA sequence.

34:24.040 --> 34:28.000
So it is almost impossible to separate out these questions.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.400
There's some really interesting work now in humans, now that artificial reproductive

34:33.400 --> 34:39.120
technology is so widespread in its use to look at egg donors and embryo transfer and

34:39.120 --> 34:44.240
all, you know, where mothers are caring offspring that are not genetically related to them and

34:44.240 --> 34:45.600
all these various combinations.

34:45.600 --> 34:53.160
And it does suggest that there are some later life characteristics, psychiatric illnesses

34:53.160 --> 34:58.520
that are driven by, you know, matches or mismatches between the genetic characteristics of the

34:58.520 --> 35:04.960
mother and genetic characteristics of the offspring or something about the in utero environment.

35:04.960 --> 35:13.160
A lot of the studies now that are focused on human analyses of epigenetics really are

35:13.160 --> 35:17.920
highlighting that you need to look at both the genetic variation and epigenetic variation

35:17.920 --> 35:18.920
together.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.080
So they're not separate entities.

35:21.080 --> 35:25.360
Only in the lab we treat them like that, but we're working with organisms that don't have

35:25.360 --> 35:26.600
genetic variability.

35:26.600 --> 35:32.120
But there are gene environment interactions at the level of epigenetic changes is, you

35:32.120 --> 35:33.120
know, widespread.

35:33.120 --> 35:39.640
And I think you can't, you probably won't be able to predict very well later life phenotypes

35:39.640 --> 35:42.920
solely based on epigenetic variation in humans.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.480
You'll need to know the code.

35:45.480 --> 35:52.880
Also, I think how's the epigenetics implication to evolution?

35:52.880 --> 35:58.120
So this landmark theory, what do you have the idea?

35:58.120 --> 35:59.120
You know, it's interesting.

35:59.120 --> 36:08.360
So, you know, in some ways I don't have any strong views on the role of epigenetics in

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
evolution.

36:09.360 --> 36:16.360
I think it's probably a great mechanism for conferring adaptation as Zach was discussing.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.800
So we have genomes.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.200
They're fairly stable over generations.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.160
They evolve, but it takes typically long periods of time to evolve.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.560
But we need to adapt to rapidly changing environments.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.640
So it confers that.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.160
That means we survive, we pass on our genes.

36:32.160 --> 36:38.080
So I would predict that genes that confer epigenetic plasticity would be highly selected

36:38.080 --> 36:42.160
for because they would allow us to adapt.

36:42.160 --> 36:48.160
But you know, then I think we get more into kind of theoretical philosophical musings

36:48.160 --> 36:52.760
about how this plays out in evolution.

36:52.760 --> 36:58.080
Certainly there's some suggestion that, you know, we're talking about retrotransposons.

36:58.080 --> 37:04.880
Areas of epigenetic variability or, you know, or stability may be areas where there's also

37:04.880 --> 37:07.040
likelihood of genetic variation.

37:07.040 --> 37:12.520
So, you know, there may be a process where if there's a lot of epigenetic variation going

37:12.520 --> 37:19.480
on, you know, between or within generations perhaps that will stabilize into the genome

37:19.480 --> 37:23.000
somehow through genetic variation.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.880
But I don't have a lot of strong views on it.

37:24.880 --> 37:31.080
I think it doesn't have to play out in evolution in the way that genes do.

37:31.080 --> 37:37.000
I think it should be its own entity as it should be within the discussions of inheritance.

37:37.000 --> 37:45.240
So I'm more of an inclusive inheritance thinker when it comes to the term and the mechanisms

37:45.240 --> 37:46.240
of inheritance.

37:46.240 --> 37:51.880
We can transmit information in a number of ways through social, through parental effects,

37:51.880 --> 37:54.200
through genes, through epigenetics.

37:54.200 --> 37:58.360
They're all different mechanisms working together to confer inheritance.

37:58.360 --> 38:04.000
But of course inheritance is just a mechanism that's important for the evolutionary process.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.960
It's not the only one.

38:05.960 --> 38:11.120
I'd like to add to that that I think, you know, if, you know, the standard image of

38:11.120 --> 38:17.000
Lamarckian inheritance is this, you know, pseudo giraffe animal that isn't yet a giraffe,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.480
and then the giraffe stretches, tries to stretch its neck.

38:20.480 --> 38:26.880
And then over time its efforts to change itself, you know, have resulted in changing its genome.

38:26.880 --> 38:32.040
And I think, you know, we have to be careful to think that, you know, anything could, you

38:32.040 --> 38:36.480
know, let's assume for a moment that epigenetic inheritance does exist, all right?

38:36.480 --> 38:40.560
You know, the studies have been done 10 years from now and turns out things are passed through

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
the germline.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.680
It's not going to be everything that we do.

38:43.680 --> 38:48.000
It's going to be factors that we know reprogram the epigenome.

38:48.000 --> 38:55.280
So we, you know, things that affect us like stress, like other hormonal exposures.

38:55.280 --> 39:00.040
You know, why do we have this, you know, okay, I'm in the psychiatry department.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.800
So most of my examples will be psychiatry related.

39:03.800 --> 39:09.400
But why do we get these on sets of schizophrenia right after puberty, and why do we have sex

39:09.400 --> 39:11.440
differences in depression?

39:11.440 --> 39:14.000
Well, you know, and what is it with stress?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.880
What we have are hormones.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.480
We have these factors.

39:18.480 --> 39:23.040
And this is just one example, but we have steroid hormones, and these steroid hormones

39:23.040 --> 39:28.680
bind a particular type of receptor that recruit epigenetic modifiers.

39:28.680 --> 39:37.320
And so it is not that far-fetched to understand why these would reprogram the epigenome molecular

39:37.320 --> 39:43.360
biologists will be able to name all the various co-factors that are recruited, your NCORS

39:43.360 --> 39:48.680
and P300s, and there's many more that I'm ignorant of.

39:48.680 --> 39:53.160
But it's important to keep in mind that if we do have this passage through the germline,

39:53.160 --> 39:57.160
it's going to be in distinct areas and not necessarily everything.

39:57.160 --> 40:01.440
And so as we learn more about what changes our epigenome, what specific environmental

40:01.440 --> 40:07.600
factors, cocaine or smoking or alcohol, we'll be able to understand exactly what's getting

40:07.600 --> 40:11.680
passed and why, what type of psychological experiences and why.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.200
Oh, this abuse caused a bolus of stress hormone response at this particular developmental

40:17.200 --> 40:18.200
time.

40:18.200 --> 40:22.880
That's going to get passed on, but it's not going to be stretching the giraffe neck or

40:22.880 --> 40:25.520
practicing real-hearted basketball to get a scholarship.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.560
And now my kids are going to be great at basketball.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.240
That's not necessarily going to be it.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.360
Exercise could cause endorphins, which may affect these systems.

40:32.360 --> 40:38.920
And then, you know, our children may have different stress responses in the brain, but

40:38.920 --> 40:40.840
it's not going to be everything that's inherited.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.200
And I think that that's important to keep in mind.

40:43.200 --> 40:49.800
And Lamarck was, you know, very careful in his theorizing, if you actually read what he

40:49.800 --> 40:56.360
does, you will have had to have had exposure to an environment for many, many generations

40:56.360 --> 40:59.400
before it becomes propagated through inheritance.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.600
Both parents would have to be exposed.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.400
So you couldn't just have one parent.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
It would have to be both.

41:05.400 --> 41:12.040
And what was being propagated had to confer some sort of adaptation to the individual inheriting.

41:12.040 --> 41:18.480
So, you know, and we don't use any of those criteria when we're testing these hypothesis.

41:18.480 --> 41:24.640
And also, when it comes to Lamarck, the prevailing theory of inheritance at the time was pangenesis,

41:24.640 --> 41:28.880
which was this idea that little particles of every cell in your body would break off

41:28.880 --> 41:32.360
into your gametes and be transmitted directly to offspring.

41:32.360 --> 41:38.680
Now, maybe microRNA are a good, you know, part of that story reemerging.

41:38.680 --> 41:42.280
But it's certainly a very different way of thinking about inheritance in general than

41:42.280 --> 41:43.280
we do now.

41:43.280 --> 41:48.760
And I think, you know, I think there's room for Lamarckian ideas.

41:48.760 --> 41:53.680
At least epigenetics provide a potential mechanism for all the marks, the theory.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.680
Yeah.

41:54.680 --> 42:00.040
You can inherit it through these epigenetic marks rather than changing the DNA sequence

42:00.040 --> 42:02.080
of like a classic Darwinism.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.080
Right.

42:03.080 --> 42:11.200
You mentioned in terms of offspring two situations, one is, let's say, the mother who gets depressed

42:11.200 --> 42:15.720
during pregnancy or is depressed and gets pregnant.

42:15.720 --> 42:20.800
But another is a mother who gets depressed after the baby is born.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.280
Is there a difference?

42:22.280 --> 42:23.280
Yeah.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.840
So that's a good question.

42:24.840 --> 42:30.000
And so we know, for example, if we look at the children of women who have postpartum

42:30.000 --> 42:32.440
depression, they have a lot of problems.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.800
They have developmental delays.

42:34.800 --> 42:39.640
They have dysregulated stress responses themselves, a higher chance for psychiatric

42:39.640 --> 42:41.480
home morbidities.

42:41.480 --> 42:49.680
And this has a lot to do with Francis' work that has to do with maternal offspring bonding

42:49.680 --> 42:57.920
and how this can ultimately affect stress systems through epigenetic reprogramming.

42:57.920 --> 43:03.760
So there may be other mechanisms at play, but I think, you know, that's the most highly

43:03.760 --> 43:06.000
studied and well known.

43:06.000 --> 43:13.600
And what happens during pregnancy is less well studied, but it looks like some of the

43:13.600 --> 43:17.320
same gene pathways are being affected.

43:17.320 --> 43:21.920
You know, I think that the reason we know that is because we had the targets to look

43:21.920 --> 43:22.920
at first.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.680
It's like, well, where should we look at this?

43:24.680 --> 43:28.960
You know, well, let's look where we know what happens in the postnatal environment.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.360
Oh, we see an effect there.

43:30.360 --> 43:31.360
Okay.

43:31.360 --> 43:36.520
And that's necessarily the only place that we're going to see this effect.

43:36.520 --> 43:42.560
But I think, you know, we're basically the messages very similar that both periods could

43:42.560 --> 43:45.880
be a risk period.

43:45.880 --> 43:50.800
And I think with prenatal depression, there is an assumption, though, you know, that a

43:50.800 --> 43:56.320
lot of work needs to be done to test whether this is true, that the signal, the depression,

43:56.320 --> 44:01.040
is transduced to the baby through stress hormones and other physiological changes during the

44:01.040 --> 44:02.040
pregnancy.

44:02.040 --> 44:06.520
We're currently looking at the placenta as something that might be modulated by depression

44:06.520 --> 44:09.800
and actually modulate the way the offspring is developing.

44:09.800 --> 44:15.240
When it gets to the postnatal period, as Zach mentioned, it's probably more about the dyadic

44:15.240 --> 44:16.920
interactions between the mothers.

44:16.920 --> 44:22.800
So depressed mothers will engage in less positive affect towards the baby that will increase

44:22.800 --> 44:24.680
stress reactivity.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.120
And they'll engage in less nurturing care.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.120
And so...

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
We don't have epigenetic?

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
Yes.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Yeah.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.720
So, I mean, presumed because in humans, this has been certainly less studied.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.720
Although there's some interesting work looking at stroking.

44:38.720 --> 44:43.240
So tactile stimulation, that's the kind of rat equivalent of what we look at when we

44:43.240 --> 44:44.520
look at maternal care.

44:44.520 --> 44:49.640
But, you know, certainly depressed mothers engage in less tactile stimulation of their

44:49.640 --> 44:50.640
infants.

44:50.640 --> 44:56.480
If you give human infants tactile stimulation, it does modulate epigenetics in the infants.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.880
So certainly a possibility.

44:58.880 --> 45:06.440
And have there been studies of, let's say, post-traumatic disorders, fathers or mothers

45:06.440 --> 45:09.000
who then have children?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.720
And what happens?

45:10.720 --> 45:18.520
There's been some recent studies of PTSD and in the context of Holocaust survivors and

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
their children.

45:19.520 --> 45:25.440
And I think they are seeing certainly epigenetic signatures in offspring and grand offspring

45:25.440 --> 45:28.960
as a consequence of a prior generation's trauma.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.360
So it does seem that you see the epigenetic mark.

45:31.360 --> 45:36.760
One hand, on the one hand, the way you said it implies that this is proven.

45:36.760 --> 45:42.800
But then it seems that there was some question about this kind of inheritance.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.800
Ah.

45:43.800 --> 45:48.880
So there's proof of an association.

45:48.880 --> 45:54.800
There's not proof that the epigenetic mark has been laid down by the trauma in the first

45:54.800 --> 46:00.080
generation and be transmitted like DNA is transmitted to subsequent generations.

46:00.080 --> 46:05.480
But the multi-generational correlation in, let's say, characteristics that might be

46:05.480 --> 46:10.360
associated with trauma in a previous generation, there's certainly a lot of epidemiological

46:10.360 --> 46:12.720
data to support that.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.520
But that's not proof of mechanism.

46:14.520 --> 46:17.880
It's simply proof of phenomenon.

46:17.880 --> 46:25.760
And in terms of cancer, what is the relationship of cancer with epigenetics?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.120
Cancer and epigenetics.

46:28.120 --> 46:35.880
So many cancers are sporadic, meaning they happen in your body as your body ages.

46:35.880 --> 46:39.680
There's, most of them are not genetic per se.

46:39.680 --> 46:44.920
There are certain subsets of breast cancer and ovarian cancer that is genetic.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.280
But most of them are sporadic.

46:46.280 --> 46:54.080
So that means it's not inheritance in the real term of inheritance.

46:54.080 --> 47:01.760
But as far as the role of epigenetics in cancer, meaning changes in the histones, changes in

47:01.760 --> 47:07.600
the DNA methylation, which in turn changed the chromatin structure and the whole relevance

47:07.600 --> 47:13.760
of changing the chromatin structure is the result is you change gene expression.

47:13.760 --> 47:18.200
So DNA, genetics information, is just information.

47:18.200 --> 47:22.080
DNA doesn't do anything other than carry information.

47:22.080 --> 47:28.880
It's the proteins and the RNAs that are copied from that information that are important,

47:28.880 --> 47:32.200
that will make you healthy, will make you sick.

47:32.200 --> 47:39.240
And so when the epigenetic information changes from what should be normally going on, that

47:39.240 --> 47:41.280
is what will cause disease.

47:41.280 --> 47:48.840
So there's clear evidence now that known tumor suppressors like P53, there are thousands

47:48.840 --> 47:55.440
and thousands of labs that study P53 and P53 mutation.

47:55.440 --> 48:03.280
There's clear evidence now that, so the mutation kills the function of the P53 protein, which

48:03.280 --> 48:06.680
normally stops cells dividing out of control.

48:06.680 --> 48:10.080
So now it's mutant, the cells will divide out of control.

48:10.080 --> 48:19.200
But there's evidence that the P53 gene product is inactivated just as frequently by epigenetic

48:19.200 --> 48:22.120
changes, not mutation.

48:22.120 --> 48:27.280
And there's growing evidence that that's the case with other important genes that are

48:27.280 --> 48:30.480
needed for protection from getting cancer.

48:30.480 --> 48:37.280
There's epigenetic changes that stop those genes from being expressed.

48:37.280 --> 48:38.880
And it's the harder thing to study.

48:38.880 --> 48:45.520
I mean, DNA sequencing is a lot easier than mapping epigenetic profiles.

48:45.520 --> 48:52.800
But I think there's a subset of cancer researchers that now believe that epigenetic changes could

48:52.800 --> 49:01.240
be the first changes that allow a subset of cells to divide more quickly.

49:01.240 --> 49:06.320
If you divide more quickly, you're more prone to DNA mutations.

49:06.320 --> 49:14.880
So some of us think that the epigenetic changes will lead to or provide a pool of cells that

49:14.880 --> 49:18.880
are selected for developing into cancer.

49:18.880 --> 49:24.880
And I think of evolution in a very similar way that I think these epigenetic changes

49:24.880 --> 49:33.920
that can happen quite rapidly as an environment changes allows us all to fit a certain niche.

49:33.920 --> 49:42.360
And then you have a population that is now more prone to a mutation that will stabilize

49:42.360 --> 49:46.200
that change in phenotype or behavior.

49:46.200 --> 49:53.200
So I think there's a lot of parallels between cancer and evolution.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.200
And also aging.

49:54.200 --> 49:57.320
I mean, our cells change as we age.

49:57.320 --> 50:02.160
And age is the largest risk factor for most cancers.

50:02.160 --> 50:08.600
So many of us are trying to understand the process of aging, to try and understand predisposition

50:08.600 --> 50:12.800
or delaying the onset of cancer.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.400
So yeah, it's a really hot area.

50:15.400 --> 50:22.960
And what's really exciting about epigenetic changes is that unlike genetic changes, so

50:22.960 --> 50:28.360
changes to your DNA, when your DNA changes, it's pretty much permanent.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.840
It cannot be reversed.

50:30.840 --> 50:38.120
The technologies are not available for us in the laboratory to reverse genetic changes,

50:38.120 --> 50:41.840
although that is likely to change pretty soon.

50:41.840 --> 50:50.960
But epigenetic changes, because their epigenetic information is put there by enzymes.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.760
So you're adding a chemical group by an enzyme.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.880
You're removing a chemical group by an enzyme.

50:56.880 --> 51:05.040
Our enzymes can be easily inhibited by designing small molecules or chemicals to block the

51:05.040 --> 51:07.160
active site of an enzyme.

51:07.160 --> 51:11.640
So there are many drugs that are out there and being developed by all the big pharma

51:11.640 --> 51:19.560
companies to block epigenetic enzymes in order to reverse these epigenetic changes.

51:19.560 --> 51:26.680
So the idea is you can now give these drugs to a cancer patient and now turn on the expression

51:26.680 --> 51:32.160
of the tumor suppressor gene to stop the cancer cells dividing out of control.

51:32.160 --> 51:40.080
So it's a huge area developing epigenetic drugs and also looking at the epigenetic signature

51:40.080 --> 51:49.120
to see if you can predict outcome of how bad the disease would be and predict which treatments

51:49.120 --> 51:55.480
would be more effective depending on not only the DNA sequence, but also the epigenetic

51:55.480 --> 51:57.800
information.

51:57.800 --> 52:03.880
Another way epigenetics is through regulating chromatin structure.

52:03.880 --> 52:12.320
For example, the chromosome organizes distinct domains, one important domain called the centromere.

52:12.320 --> 52:18.240
Centromere is important for chromosome segregation during mitosis.

52:18.240 --> 52:23.160
If it's misregulate the centromere, they also could cause cancer.

52:23.160 --> 52:28.040
And you get aneuploidy, that's when you gain extra chromosomes.

52:28.040 --> 52:34.080
I should have said actually the centromere that this gentleman studies is actually the

52:34.080 --> 52:43.040
only clear evidence of inheritance of a chromatin structure through cell divisions.

52:43.040 --> 52:47.720
It's a really interesting and unusual mechanism.

52:47.720 --> 52:54.720
Yeah, I wanted to return to the issue you just brought up of essentially personalized

52:54.720 --> 53:01.240
medicine and the hope that epigenetics brings to this aspect of things.

53:01.240 --> 53:06.880
So it's a little bit farther away from inheritance, but I mean you could think of it that if

53:06.880 --> 53:16.240
we do inherit some risk for a disease, we may also inherit the ability to better metabolize

53:16.240 --> 53:18.720
a particular type of antidepressant or not.

53:18.720 --> 53:25.400
We know that some genetic factors allow this to happen, but it's definitely a hot topic

53:25.400 --> 53:34.080
that if we find an epigenetic signature of responders to this SSRI or non-responders

53:34.080 --> 53:40.600
to this particular SNRI, we may be able to tailor what medications to give it.

53:40.600 --> 53:45.960
And again in psychiatry, this is very important because essentially there's a lot of trial

53:45.960 --> 53:49.840
and error that's done to find what medications will work.

53:49.840 --> 53:56.440
And of course skilled psychiatrists can often do a great job of getting there quickly, but

53:56.440 --> 54:02.000
I think with more and more antidepressants being prescribed by general practitioners,

54:02.000 --> 54:09.000
having epigenetics as a tool to personalize these treatments to people could ultimately

54:09.000 --> 54:11.800
lead to a lot less suffering in the future.

54:11.800 --> 54:21.360
And I think, you know, I know the FDA has before it some proposals regarding the reevaluation

54:21.360 --> 54:26.280
of all of their approved drugs to determine whether there are in fact germline effects.

54:26.280 --> 54:31.960
And that's a question we don't know about most of the drugs we take, whether they, you

54:31.960 --> 54:37.000
know, we have some indication whether they would be dangerous to take during pregnancy,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.960
but even in that case there's a lot of question marks.

54:41.960 --> 54:48.240
But there's, that's not routinely part of their testing and that would be next to near

54:48.240 --> 54:54.600
impossible in humans, although they could certainly look at whether germ cells are affected,

54:54.600 --> 54:56.120
but not whether it would continue.

54:56.120 --> 55:00.200
They can certainly look in animal models to see whether there's a transmission.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.640
Yeah, that's a great point.

55:01.640 --> 55:09.160
I mean, one of the known antidepressants monomine oxidase inhibitor is actually, you know, we

55:09.160 --> 55:17.160
know that it blocks various monomine oxidases and keeps dopamine in the synapse, but it

55:17.160 --> 55:24.600
also is a lysine demethylase inhibitor, which acts specifically on the histone code on these

55:24.600 --> 55:28.720
nucleosome marks that can compact or relax DNA.

55:28.720 --> 55:34.840
And so, you know, the question is, well, when we give these drugs, we know that we're increasing

55:34.840 --> 55:39.640
the neurotransmitters in the synapse almost immediately, and yet it takes about a month

55:39.640 --> 55:40.640
to work.

55:40.640 --> 55:41.640
Why?

55:41.640 --> 55:42.640
Right?

55:42.640 --> 55:48.240
So it could be that the efficaciousness of these medications could be due to transcriptional

55:48.240 --> 55:52.960
factors, could be due to how long it takes them to modify the epigenome and really get

55:52.960 --> 55:57.880
that transcriptional machinery in the neurons in the cells to change things and really change

55:57.880 --> 56:00.040
the underlying makeup of what's going on.

56:00.040 --> 56:03.400
But it does bring up that issue of, okay, you know, I'm taking antidepressants, it's

56:03.400 --> 56:09.040
working on my brain, that's good, but what is it doing to the sperm or to the eggs?

56:09.040 --> 56:10.240
And does that matter?

56:10.240 --> 56:11.920
And what are the consequences?

56:11.920 --> 56:16.760
And we don't know.

56:16.760 --> 56:17.760
Okay.

56:17.760 --> 56:18.760
Questions?

56:18.760 --> 56:28.760
Yeah, go ahead.

56:28.760 --> 56:50.520
I'm using microphone that would be at the same.

56:50.520 --> 56:55.360
You know, one interesting aspect of genetics is that IQ is inherited.

56:55.360 --> 56:58.880
So I think it was Stephen Pinker who said that if you look at a population of children,

56:58.880 --> 57:04.560
you can compare them to the parents, you can describe 50% of the genetic, 50% of the IQ

57:04.560 --> 57:06.400
variation is being genetic.

57:06.400 --> 57:10.280
Now a lot of studies seem to have indicated that during the course of your life you can

57:10.280 --> 57:12.240
do things which improve your IQ.

57:12.240 --> 57:17.720
So the question is, over generations can you do changes which can improve the IQ of, you

57:17.720 --> 57:20.480
know, your grandchildren as compared to the grandparents?

57:20.480 --> 57:24.000
Or is it something that is completely genetic?

57:24.000 --> 57:25.560
That's if you want it.

57:25.560 --> 57:26.560
I'm sorry?

57:26.560 --> 57:31.760
That's if you want them to be more intelligent.

57:31.760 --> 57:33.440
That's a solution.

57:33.440 --> 57:39.080
I'm more concerned about doing the reverse to my children, reducing their IQ.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.960
But maybe you can know most about this.

57:41.960 --> 57:45.040
Oh, well, I mean, it's a great question.

57:45.040 --> 57:51.280
I mean, I think, so, yeah, that's sort of one of those Lamarckian, it brings us back

57:51.280 --> 57:56.240
to the Lamarckian issue of can we make our son a good basketball player and then pass

57:56.240 --> 57:57.400
that on?

57:57.400 --> 57:59.600
And I don't know.

57:59.600 --> 58:08.280
I mean, I guess if you, if a lot of the IQ factors, the genes that influence IQ are

58:08.280 --> 58:13.800
inherited by the DNA sequence, I could imagine that something you're doing might be, could

58:13.800 --> 58:19.080
potentially free up those genes in an inheritance way.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.480
But I don't know, it's quite speculative.

58:22.480 --> 58:28.120
I would also assume that it would be difficult to discern the factors that have caused you

58:28.120 --> 58:37.080
to improve your IQ as well because you're going to impart through your environment this

58:37.080 --> 58:38.240
intelligence to your children.

58:38.240 --> 58:40.040
You're going to use bigger words.

58:40.040 --> 58:47.360
You're going to probably focus on school a lot for them because you've come to value

58:47.360 --> 58:48.360
intelligence.

58:48.360 --> 58:56.200
I mean, it's tough to imagine what specific molecular mechanism that would work through.

58:56.200 --> 59:02.000
But also, is IQ, I mean, IQ is based on certain questions that you answered.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.000
It's not the...

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Right.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
Right.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.440
You could be trained to answer those kind of questions better.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.280
But it's an interesting question.

59:10.280 --> 59:16.560
And the problem with human studies is personally usually not allowed to do them.

59:16.560 --> 59:21.760
So it's just observation of what's normally going on in the population.

59:21.760 --> 59:24.960
And they are really, really slow.

59:24.960 --> 59:31.040
I mean, people don't live long enough to do a study on someone else's offspring and their

59:31.040 --> 59:32.040
offspring.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.840
So we're going to have to wait.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.080
It's a great question.

59:35.080 --> 59:37.960
And I'm sure the future will answer it.

59:37.960 --> 59:42.120
But when, you know, going back to points you were making earlier about the twin study.

59:42.120 --> 59:47.520
There are concept of heritability is based on, you know, the models of twin studies that

59:47.520 --> 59:49.640
have been conducted historically.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.480
We don't usually use that approach anymore.

59:51.480 --> 59:56.560
In fact, twin studies are now mostly epigenetic analyses because it's great because now you've

59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.440
got individuals who are monozygotic and then you can look at how they deviate in their epigenetic

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.240
code over their lifespan.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:08.720
But I think the more people are learning about epigenetics and environmentally induced

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.360
changes in gene activity.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:18.600
The more that I think we should question the basis for heritability estimates and the assumptions

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.880
underlying those estimates because certainly monozygotic twins share more similar environment

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.960
than we've been able to characterize.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:32.560
And if environment is laying down these epigenetic codes we have to keep that in mind.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.520
And it's hard to quantify.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.040
But I think it's something that we should kind of think about in the back of our mind.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.080
Certainly, as you mentioned, genes don't do anything unless they're instructed.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.200
And so that is what these gene regulatory mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms do.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.960
And so though we may inherit genes that will increase reaction time and, you know, the

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.160
way in which we perceive, interact with the world, we can layer in more information on

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.800
that which leaves room for the epigenetic enhancement or decrement.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.560
I'd like to just make it a little bit more confusing with the twin studies.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.920
One interesting aspect when it comes to epigenetics that is rarely ever taken into consideration

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.840
is the issue of coreanicity.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:24.440
That has to do with when the twinning occurred.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.760
So if a twinning occurs very early then everyone gets their own placenta and amniotic sac and

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760
everything.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760
And we call these dichorionic twins.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:38.080
But if it occurs, 70% of twins occur after day four and then we get a shared placenta

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.680
and we get these shared connections.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:46.480
And this makes everything really confusing because the twins share stem cells to a degree,

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.160
which means that if we study the blood of those twins, they're going to have been swapping

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.440
and so it makes it harder.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:00.600
And so if any of these factors were conferred into the later phenotype, then this is going

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.560
to mess with the heritability estimates.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:09.280
It's if something in the interuterine environment influences that IQ that we're looking at heritability

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.600
for then this is going to mess with things.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:18.000
Also just sharing doesn't make it simple because they also don't share evenly.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.600
So in extreme cases we'll get what's called a twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome where

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.800
one twin will be very nutritionally deprived and the genetically identical twins come out

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.960
very different because they haven't had equal blood flow.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.480
And so these factors, the coreanicity, is never taken into account in twin studies and

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.920
can greatly influence heritability.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.920
And epigenetic changes in those situations?

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920
Yeah.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:53.520
So we showed a few years ago in 2009 that the monochoreonic twins, the twins that share

01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.440
the blood stem cells are more epigenetically similar in blood because they share.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:05.320
But if you look at other cells like buckle cells, they're much more epigenetically different

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.520
probably because of these nutritional effects.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.080
And this was then replicated by four other groups or so.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:20.160
So it's a very robust finding that twins that share these blood connections are very unequal

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.520
in the amount of epigenetic reprogramming that they ultimately end up with.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.400
So does this mean that if you twin later you're going to have more discordance for schizophrenia

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.040
or depression or metabolic syndromes maybe.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.200
But it's never quantified.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.400
People don't quantify the placenta.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.400
So we should.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400
Just a question.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:55.080
This has been studied with Lamarck and non-Lamarck and that it's what took so long to get to

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.080
this point.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.280
I think it's for the epigenetic field we just started like 30, 40 years ago.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.480
Just realized this new mechanism.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.000
Why not in the 1870s?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
19 years.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.520
Well, I think Darwin's theory also included some of Lamarckian's ideas.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:26.880
Just I think people like to kind of take out of someone's theory the bit they like.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:33.760
And Darwin support the ideas of acquired bio-cutery that can be inherited.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760
Absolutely.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:42.680
If pan-genesis is your theory of inheritance then the cells are modified by life and they

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.120
shed particles and they're inherited.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.840
It's interesting to think about the sociological factors at the time that led to the dismissal

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.320
of Lamarck.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:01.040
Now, certainly August Wiseman is usually attributed with that because he did an experiment rather

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:06.440
than give example after example after example of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440
He did a study.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.000
He chopped the tails off mice.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.160
The offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.040
The grand offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.320
The great grand offspring of those mice did not have short tails.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.440
And he kept chopping each generation.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.920
So he tried.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:29.800
And in fact, one experiment well-characterized was seemed to be enough at the time.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:34.360
So that suggests that there are other sociological factors at the time that were probably swaying

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.960
people away from the Lamarckian view.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.920
And also August Wiseman presented the idea of the Wiseman barrier whereby the germ cells

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.280
were special and protected.

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:50.240
And we still have that assumption that the germ cells are protected.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.640
They are different cells.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.760
They are certainly different cells from the rest of the body.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.920
But we have this assumption in the back of our mind that what goes on with our other

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.920
cells could not possibly affect those cells.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.440
And so that stayed in as a dogma.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.520
And I think still kind of influences the way people think about sperm and eggs.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:17.520
And I think really you need the molecular tools to be able to divine these changes.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:24.040
So when you have dogmas come into science, you need proof and very strong proof to get

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.800
rid of them, not just philosophical ideas.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:34.600
So I think part of why now is because now there are studies that are believable that

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:42.200
do support these ideas, at least for passing on to several generations like studies that

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.840
Francis has done.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:51.960
So now there is evidence that is convincing, at least for short term, Lamarckian inheritance.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.240
Another is technology improvement.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:01.800
Like 100 years ago we don't know how to delete genes and to look at what is happening in

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800
the cell.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.960
Now we have advanced technology just analyzing all these phenomena in the molecular and

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.240
cellular levels.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.240
To help understand to this phenomenon.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:20.040
Maybe we are getting smarter.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.720
So I have two questions.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.880
The first one is more simple.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.920
Is the evidence showing that it is easier to turn on genes or is it easier to turn off

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:35.800
genes or is it one harder than other or is it pretty much?

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:40.240
Depends on the state of the gene that you are trying to turn on or off.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.320
Okay.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:52.400
If it is solidly in a very tight chromatin structure then it is very hard to turn on.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:08:00.400
So I guess to answer your question, repressive states are easier to inherit than active states.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.480
So repressive states are more permanent in general.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.040
That is what I was getting at.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:10.800
The other question pertains to horn mises.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.840
I don't know how familiar people are with horn mises.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.520
Just homeopathy and things of that nature when you have a low exposure to toxins and

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.520
stresses.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:26.080
I am thinking from a chronic point of view, for example, of someone running and causing

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:29.280
information in the body.

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.120
Much good comes from that as well.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.040
So I am just thinking as far as horn mises, if anyone does know about the subject as it

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:42.520
pertains to our health, how does that tie into epigenetics?

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:49.200
I am enthused by the subject because I have been to many health conferences where they

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.760
speak very favorably of horn mises but I am sitting through the panel.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:01.880
I am thinking to myself perhaps you can have damages that pass on to the next generation.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:08.440
Is that specific to inflammation?

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.640
I am not familiar with it.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.800
Or did you mention environmental toxins?

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800
Just homeopathy.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.800
Are you familiar with that field?

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:24.040
Just the idea that a certain degree of stress on systems tend to evoke the imperative conditions.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.680
Low doses and then over the course of a life, not just one instance.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.560
This is more a health related question.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:40.480
We know that things like exercise are good for depression and cognition and they promote

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:47.880
brain-derived neurotrophic factors that ultimately result in synaptogenesis in the hippocampus

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.000
and basically are very pro-good mood.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.960
And so that one mechanism that comes to mind is if you have pro-good mood then you are

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.600
not going to have these high cortisol levels that will be passed.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:09.520
So I don't know if the endorphins or epinephrine that you are generating are going to reprogram

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:14.240
or pass the placenta in the same way that people are studying cortisol because people

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.480
are studying cortisol and they are not studying that.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.240
But in theory they could or they will at least reduce that and that is one way that you may

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.920
pass your good mood on to your kids.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:31.920
As a final note I feel as if the very near future will discover how we are looking at

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:39.160
how, you know, I feel like just on the subject of running for example it is perhaps a double

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:44.560
edged sword where they will see, they are studying all the good that comes from it and

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:50.000
then oh wait a second, 15, 20 years, not running perhaps with just other subjects.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.520
We didn't see that there was also this negative that was simultaneously happening with all

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520
the positive concurrence.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.520
I love this field.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.520
Thanks.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.520
Sure.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:02.520
Those cytokines that you are creating could if they epigenetically program.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.960
And good and bad is so contextually dependent.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:10.880
So something can be good in one context but very bad in another.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:17.040
And even low levels of maternal care which we would say are bad.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.320
Programs offspring to engage in less care which we would say is bad but it also enhances

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.520
sexual reactivity.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:29.320
If you have teenage daughters you probably think that's bad too but if you are a rodent

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.680
and you are trying to propagate offspring in a stressful environment it is a very good

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.680
thing.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.840
So you know really you know thinking in terms of the way our body adapts we adapt to the

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:47.120
context we are in that allows us to survive and propagate in that environment.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.720
Some of the characteristics we might see might seem maladaptive but often that is in another

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720
context.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.120
So PTSD for example is a good example.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:05.320
Having being vigilant not being able to sleep and being very anxious is not great if you

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.400
are living in a lovely, wonderful, stress-free suburb but probably very good if you are

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.080
in a traumatized war zone.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.800
So that's another thought.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.000
I was curious how we read the epigenetic marks.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.120
Does the standard gene sequencing machinery give you the epigenome?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.760
That's my basic question.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:32.400
And the second question is my epigenome constant throughout my body.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.800
So I will answer the second one first.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.960
Is your epigenome constant absolutely not?

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.080
Every single one of our cells has the identical DNA information.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.840
The identical genetic code in every cell.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.520
The only reason why our cells are different like why some look like a hair cell, some

01:12:53.520 --> 01:13:00.320
look like a you know a skin cell is because of the edge of the genetic information.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.400
And that's because the epigenetic information changes the chromatin structure, changes the

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400
chromosomes.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:13.160
It even makes them more open or more closed, inaccessible in a very local manner.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:19.720
So some genes can be accessed by the machinery that copies the information and some genes

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
cannot.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.800
So it's where those marks are along the genome that's critical.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:30.040
So then it sounds like there's a, the marks appear to give the, to differentiate the cells.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.040
Absolutely.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.880
But the environment changes on top of that.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880
Yes.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.880
Is that right?

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880
Yes.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880
Exactly.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.360
So if I wanted to know my epigenome, I would have to look at each cell type throughout

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360
my body.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
Yes.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:47.240
And even in individual cells, that's the technology that is now being developed.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.720
And then how would you read it?

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.760
Let's say we took a skin cell of mine.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:51.760
Yes.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.000
So it depends what you want to read.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.040
If you want to read DNA methylation, there's a really clever trick where you just add a

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.600
chemical called biculfite and it changed, I always get this wrong.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.000
It even changes the methyl C's to a U or a C-O-M-Methyl.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.720
Actually it converts any modified C's.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.240
It could be methyl, but it could be other groups to U.

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240
U.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.160
And then when you run PCR, it converts to a T.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.040
So when you sequence, you get a C to T conversion.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.560
If there's no methyl, and it won't convert if it's methyl.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.800
So that's really easy.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.760
Measuring histone modifications is a lot more difficult.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:41.440
You have to have an antibody that is specific to that particular histone modification.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:49.840
By modification, I mean a phosphate, an acetyl, a methyl group, but small chemicals or small

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:52.040
elements.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.400
The antibody has to recognize that mark.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.720
And then you do a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation where you shatter the

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.920
genome into tiny fragments of about 500 base pairs.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:12.120
And then you immunoprecipitate, you pull down with a immobilized molecule.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:18.840
The antibody and whatever chromatin is bound to it, and then you sequence that piece of

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840
DNA.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.480
So that is a lot more challenging, a lot more expensive, but I was talking to someone recently

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:31.000
at Mass General that is developing that technique on a single cell basis.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.840
I mean it's amazingly cutting edge, probably shouldn't have said that.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:45.000
The issue of the cell differences in epigenome in response to the environment is a huge one

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.160
when it comes to doing human studies.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:52.800
So especially if you're interested in behavior in a more psychological state, because we're

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.600
often interested in what's going on epigenetically in the brain, but we can't access that tissue.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.760
So we rely on blood and buckle cells.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:08.240
The animal work suggests that for some epigenetic modifications you might expect to see concordance

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.400
between brain and blood or buckle cells, but for many other genes you won't.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:20.160
So it's really constrained the translation of a lot of the basic science to human studies.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.200
Yeah, and you're also going to get just a very brief point.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.560
You're going to get a soup of cells.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.000
If you're taking the brain you're going to get some dopaminergic neurons, some serid

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.040
allergic neurons, you're going to get a lot of glia and some oligobendrocytes, and you're

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:38.040
going to get this one number representative of all of that, based on looking at one position.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.240
So it takes a little bit of a look at the way it will go in future.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.240
Yeah, a single cell.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.240
Yeah.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240
Very expensive.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240
I'm sure.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:52.520
Hi, is there a relationship between epigenetics and character development?

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.920
In what development?

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.360
Is there a relationship between epigenetics and character development?

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360
Character.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.040
Not just personal, but collective as well.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.880
So I could say yes, but that's, you know.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.080
I mean you elaborate on that.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:22.160
So what you're asking is to go from the level of a molecular modification in a cell to the

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.520
way in which someone interacts with their environment on a regular basis.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.520
That's what you're talking about.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:30.160
We're talking about character or personality.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.440
And you know, certainly the way in which, you know, your brain functions and your cell

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:40.920
function is going to be determined by the gene regulatory mechanisms, epigenetic mechanisms

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.440
in the cell.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.920
We don't know how you get from that to these kind of broader states.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.080
Certainly there's effects on stress hormone systems that have global effects on the way

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.120
in which we behave in our personality.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:59.360
There will be effects on certain neuron populations in the brain that might affect your anxiety

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:06.680
levels and depression or your risk taking, let's say, as another character.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.880
But we have a long way to go before we build in, you know, figure out the pathway where

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.280
we get from one to the other, even in animal models.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.120
It's very challenging to do.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.120
Unless we look at a very simple behavioral output, it's challenging.

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.960
Yeah, just to add on to that, I think it relates back to the last point is that it's hard to

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.240
study the brain.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.840
And so we know that, you know, character is going to be based in the brain, but, you

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.520
know, we can do postmortem studies in humans and then we're looking at these soups of

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:40.880
cells or we could look at the blood, but are the blood cells going to relate to different

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.120
personality metrics.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:47.720
So you can assess personality metrics with psychiatric scales in live humans, but you

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.640
can't look at their brain epigenome.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:57.200
And so we may get there eventually, but the challenges of likening the epigenome to behavior

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:03.840
now are limited to where we can look at behaviors that a mouse might or rat may exhibit.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.840
Did I hear you correctly?

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840
You localized character?

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.960
You say it's in the brain?

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:15.280
There are various psychological scales to assess, you know, psychiatry is always trying

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.240
to quantify, you know, how much someone is extroverted versus introverted.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:25.880
These are sort of, I guess, it depends on how you quantify character, but I may be using

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.720
a definition slightly different from yours.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:36.720
But any psychological state may be assumed, perhaps, to be coming from the brain and as

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.160
such, it's a challenge at least to study that aspect of it.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.160
Okay.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.160
Thank you.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.160
Go ahead.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.160
We're all so smart.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:55.720
As a practicing physician, I'm very interested in maximizing the health of my patients.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:02.320
What I really try to do is help them outsmart their genes, so to speak, and live the best

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:06.680
healthiest lives they can in preventing chronic disease and illness, both in the mind and

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680
body.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.240
Wondering where you think environmentally, we can get the most bang for our buck?

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.920
Is it food, which is biochemical, exercise, meditation?

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.240
There's so much research out there.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.640
I'd love to hear from each of you, if you would, where we can really focus our attention

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.800
in this fabulous field of actually influencing our own health.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.800
Thank you.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.800
All right.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.160
I'll start, I guess.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:41.280
So there's been a lot of work on the effects of various types of mindfulness-based meditation

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:49.640
on depression, for example, and it's very, very efficacious for that based on meta-analysis.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.800
I don't know that people have necessarily looked at its effects on the epigenome so much,

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.920
although using the transitive property of logic, we know that it will reduce your stress hormones

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:05.760
and other endocrine factors that may reprogram your epigenome in positive ways.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.960
So I know that that's good, but I can't answer the question of what's best.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.360
I mean, I think that if you're generally healthy and you're also going to, I mentioned earlier

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:18.720
that exercise and endorphins can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor in these

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:23.800
sort of mood positive factors that influence the brain in positive ways.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.280
I can't say whether that's better than meditation or not.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.080
I like to do both, I think it helps.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:37.120
And I know less about diet other than sort of what's known from the amount of methylation

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:44.040
co-factors or full-8 B12 B vitamins that can sort of, those act as the bricks that the

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:48.120
building blocks that your methylating machinery uses to methylate DNA.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.720
So if you're like grabbing for methyl groups and you're out of them, you're not going

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720
to be methylated.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:22:00.440
And those dietary factors are going to be important if you don't have them, then this

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.160
could, in theory, cause problems.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:07.400
I mean, I think all those factors will influence the epigenome and they're good, but to quantify

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400
them is difficult.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.480
Yeah, I agree.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:15.760
I think that the environment factors definitely play a key role in the epigenomes.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.760
So we have a study on diet.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.960
We, for example, look at the vitamin folate.

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.440
She hates affecting histone marks.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.520
We look at the yeast and the human cells.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:35.040
We show the strong correlations that the folate can affect the epigenetic marks, the histone

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.520
modifications.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:43.680
So we believe, yeah, if you have a proper diet, it's definitely well, you know, can help the

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:47.360
health of the patients.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
And this is terrible.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:53.320
I don't remember the details, but I do have colleagues in Houston that this is all they

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.440
study is certain types of sprouts.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:01.720
They're not bean sprouts, but something similar to bean sprouts.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:13.280
And they see clear changes, beneficial changes in the methylation profiles and also protection

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.800
against cancer.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.480
So you don't have to take folate pills.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:26.040
There are definite sources of food that are beneficial.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:32.960
And if you'd like later, if you give me your email, I can put you in touch with people.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:41.480
So I've always, because I work with mothers and their children, I'm a really strong advocate

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:47.960
of social support as a way of modulating stress, reactivity, enhancing mother infant interactions

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.760
and thus modifying the epigenome.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:54.840
And so I think social support in general is probably really essential.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:00.600
But that's more of a kind of a group level intervention rather than individual.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:06.360
So at an individual level, I'd probably be most influenced by the Columbia Center for

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.920
Children's Environmental Health work, where they look at various pollutants in Manhattan

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:17.840
and how they affect the brain, especially when they're experienced by mothers who are pregnant,

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.760
but certainly not limited to that level of exposure.

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:28.040
So one of the toxins we study is bisphenol A, BPA, that's made and it's used in the manufacture

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.040
of plastics.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.800
So whenever you drink at a plastic bottle, you get BPA in your system.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.800
So I would try and reduce exposure as much as possible to that.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.720
It's an endocrine disrupting chemical.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.520
You get it when you touch grocery store receipts and it has epigenetic effects.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:51.840
So certainly and I think now they're certainly looking a lot more at thalates and other exposures

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:58.120
as well that come from the various chemicals that we unfortunately are exposed to in New

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.120
York.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120
Okay.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.280
Oh, there's one more.

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:13.680
Yeah, this has to do with Mother Infant Diads, a question about infant observational research.

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:20.720
And much of the language that has been used that could apply at that macro level has used

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.520
the word stress.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:27.400
And yet there are much more subtle sort of relationships that go on in the Mother Infant

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.840
Diad then stress would seem to account for.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:39.640
So for example, in something called the social referencing paradigm at six months of age,

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.520
you put a child on a visual cliff, that is it's a glass and there's a drop, but you can

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.840
crawl across because there's a glass.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:54.880
And the mother stands at one end, the infant is allowed to crawl and the infant starts

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.680
to crawl, gets to the cliff, what looks like a cliff.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.600
And then we'll crawl forward or not depending on the mother.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.120
In each case, the mother's asked to, asked the kid to keep crawling toward her.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:17.800
And some infants will look at the mother, be calmed by her expression, her encouragement

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:22.480
and will continue across, will feel confident in her confidence.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.480
Her fears won't look or will look and will be too afraid to continue.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480
That's at six months.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:36.120
A year later, there's a correlation between those six month old who followed their mother's

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:44.200
instructions, trusted them enough to continue crawling and what's called secure attachment,

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.600
which is I'm sure you know that's been measured in a variety of different ways.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.400
The same mothers, if they had been tested on the adult attachment inventory, that whole

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:03.560
group of mothers at six months of pregnancy, we would have been able to predict from their

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:09.440
responses on that inventory, which asks questions about their early relationships, we would

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:16.720
have been able to predict what their 12-month-old children would be like on a measure of their

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.320
security of attachment to the mother.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.960
So there are a number, and this is just skimming the surface, there are a number of very important

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:30.320
findings in the infant observational research that pertain to the mother infant diet and

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:34.960
the nature of the bond, really the individual difference in the bond.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.160
And somehow stress doesn't capture the subtleties of that.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:44.960
You guys are definitely talking about the biological mechanisms that underpin the kind

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.920
of behavioral differences that are being seen in this kind of research, but is there something

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.920
else that you could name besides stress?

01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:00.480
Is there some other, or do you find some way of translating stress into these subtle

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.800
interactional differences in mothers and infants?

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:13.160
Yeah, I think the bias in what we study and what has been studied in the field is based

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:17.120
on what you can do in the lab and experimentally.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:24.000
And you can't look at these attachment relationships in the basic science models that we use in

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.680
the lab.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.000
That said, there's probably, you know, what you're describing is the transmission of attachment

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.680
security from one generation to the next.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.560
So there's probably some correlate to that, and certainly we see that the degree and reliability

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.720
of mother infant interactions does transmit from mothers to daughters and rodent models,

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.280
but we don't assess it obviously in the same way.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.440
We're looking at something that we can quantify the level of tactile stimulation.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.440
Right, but you look at licking and sucking and wrap pups.

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.440
Exactly.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.720
So, you know, when we talk about stress, it's because it's something that is comparable.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.400
You know, we know about stress physiology, and in this model we know a little bit about

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:08.240
it in humans.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:14.240
Whether what we're studying in these basic models can be applied, I mean, I certainly

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.240
it could.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.040
It's just be operationalizing.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:23.520
What is it that we think is driving the epigenetic change in both generations and getting our

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.200
hand handle on that?

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.480
I think, you know, it's just the field is moving extraordinarily fast, you know, when

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.120
you think of it comparative to other fields, but it's still very early doors, I think,

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:41.520
for applying what we know in terms of the basic science to extrapolating to these kind

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.680
of real social interactions in humans.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:49.800
But what you were saying about bringing in support, being helpful, really does translate

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:54.720
to the macro level of certain kinds of interventions that you can do with these mother infant

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:59.080
diets that have correlates at the biological level.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.080
Yeah.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.240
