01:00.000 --> 01:16.300
DeGenevieve did a very oldytale unless he picked the

01:16.300 --> 01:23.300
Just pull them in.

01:46.300 --> 01:58.420
Welcome to today's program. I'm Ed Nersesien, the Director of the Center. Before introducing

01:58.420 --> 02:04.020
the participants for today's program on fake knowledge, knowing and the illusion of knowing,

02:04.020 --> 02:12.700
I'd like to announce the next programs. On November 18, we have a roundtable on American

02:12.700 --> 02:19.300
poetry today that was organized by Anne Marie LeBien and the participants in that are Patricia

02:19.300 --> 02:27.020
Carlin, Selby Davidov, Amy Holman, Paolo Znhabier and Stefan Massimila.

02:27.020 --> 02:37.540
Then the first weekend of December, December 1 to 3, we have a weekend of programs on the

02:37.540 --> 02:47.100
subject of art and science, the two cultures converging. In addition to the roundtables,

02:47.100 --> 02:57.900
there will be also other programs during these two days, including videos and other performances.

02:57.900 --> 03:05.660
This particular program on the science and art is organized with another group, the Art

03:05.660 --> 03:20.500
and Science Centers, SIRs. As far as the program today, I'd like to introduce the various

03:20.500 --> 03:26.380
participants and I will do it on alphabetical order so you may have to raise your hand

03:26.380 --> 03:34.420
so people know who you are. Paul Bogosian is the Silver Professor of Philosophy at NYU,

03:34.420 --> 03:39.500
Director of its New York Institute and Philosophy and member of the American Academy of Arts

03:39.500 --> 03:46.460
and Sciences. I am going to make the bios very short if you want more information there

03:46.460 --> 03:52.500
on the website. Daniel Kahneman is Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Public Affairs

03:52.500 --> 04:04.380
at Princeton. He won the Nobel Prize in 2002 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.

04:04.380 --> 04:14.900
His work on decision making and human judgment was done with participation of Amos Torsky.

04:14.900 --> 04:21.100
Eric Candel is Professor of University, Professor at Columbia University and Cavalier, Professor

04:21.100 --> 04:29.580
and Director of the Cavalier Institute for Brain Science. He has received many, many awards

04:29.580 --> 04:35.540
and he received the Nobel Prize in Psychology and Medicine in 2000.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.540
Physiology.

04:37.540 --> 04:43.580
Close enough. Physiology. Not psychology.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.580
It's close enough. Physiology.

04:46.580 --> 04:59.540
Mark Mitten is a magician and one of the most curious minds I have ever encountered.

04:59.540 --> 05:12.300
His specialty is Physical Misdirection. Daphna Shomani is Professor of Psychology at Columbia

05:12.300 --> 05:17.980
University's Mind, Brain, Behavior Institute and Department of Psychology and she is also

05:17.980 --> 05:22.700
a member of the Cavalier Institute for Brain Science.

05:22.700 --> 05:28.340
And then Steven Sloman is Professor of Cognitive Linguistic and Psychological Sciences at Brown

05:28.340 --> 05:35.260
University. He is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cognition and it's in reading his recent

05:35.260 --> 05:41.940
book with Phil Fernbach, The Knowledge Illusion, Why We Never Think Alone, that I developed

05:41.940 --> 05:46.460
the idea of doing this round table.

05:46.460 --> 05:51.980
Before they start, I'd like to say that after the conversation, there will be a period of

05:51.980 --> 05:58.260
question and answer. I would very much appreciate if those who come up here come with a question

05:58.260 --> 06:05.260
and just focus on one question and get the answer to that question. Thank you.

06:05.260 --> 06:18.300
So the format is one of the participants. We'll start the discussion and I think Steve wanted

06:18.300 --> 06:21.260
to get going.

06:21.260 --> 06:29.740
I'm happy to start. I'm probably not the right person to give this distinguished group, but

06:29.740 --> 06:35.220
I didn't know that you brought us together by virtue of having read our book and so I'm

06:35.220 --> 06:41.540
really pleased by that. And let me spend two minutes describing what the book's about.

06:41.540 --> 06:47.020
The book has two ideas. It's about ignorance and the community of knowledge and the idea

06:47.020 --> 06:55.300
is that people think they know more than they do. So people are relatively ignorant, which

06:55.300 --> 07:01.460
is a claim I would defend, although that's not really the point. The point is that people

07:01.460 --> 07:08.820
think they understand simple everyday objects as well as deep important ideas as well as

07:08.820 --> 07:16.220
political policies when in fact it turns out they don't understand them so well.

07:16.220 --> 07:22.380
And so the second part of the book is an attempt to explain why that's the case. Why is it

07:22.380 --> 07:29.100
that we think we understand more than we do? And the answer we offer is that people confuse

07:29.100 --> 07:35.860
what other people know with what they know. So we live in a community of knowledge. Knowledge

07:35.860 --> 07:42.180
is something that exists across people. Most thinking does not occur inside the head, but

07:42.180 --> 07:48.620
it rather occurs within a community and that's sort of the storehouse of knowledge. We outsource

07:48.620 --> 07:56.780
most of our thinking. And thus we think we understand things because it's not so important

07:56.780 --> 08:04.340
to identify the source of knowledge. What's more important is to gain access to the knowledge.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.060
That's the main idea.

08:06.060 --> 08:12.500
I must say the scientists I know don't quite share that view. Most of us think we're quite

08:12.500 --> 08:17.380
ignorant and don't think we know more than we know. I wonder whether this is your share

08:17.380 --> 08:18.380
feeling.

08:18.380 --> 08:26.420
Well, that's scientists. But I think that when you talk about the psychology of the public

08:26.420 --> 08:33.460
or people in general, or scientists when they are not acting a scientist, then the situation

08:33.460 --> 08:41.180
is completely different. And people do believe they know things that they have no idea about.

08:41.180 --> 08:47.340
And what I find most striking and perhaps you explain it in your book is that when you

08:47.340 --> 08:55.100
ask somebody why they believe something, they always have something to say. And they seem

08:55.100 --> 09:00.660
to think that what they have to say, the reasons that come to their mind are the cause of their

09:00.660 --> 09:08.220
belief, which is nonsense. The beliefs are the cause of what they say. So the belief comes

09:08.220 --> 09:15.700
first and reasons come to mind when asked, when required. And the striking thing to me

09:15.700 --> 09:24.060
that introspectively that's not available. I was running an introspective exercise this

09:24.060 --> 09:29.740
morning and it, you know, fake news did remind me of Donald Trump. So we're not going to

09:29.740 --> 09:37.660
avoid Donald Trump completely. But I was very struck by the fact that I can, you know,

09:37.660 --> 09:44.260
I can hear the arguments of Trump supporters. And I don't believe for a moment that's,

09:44.260 --> 09:49.540
that what they say is the reason that they believe what they believe. They conclude.

09:49.540 --> 09:56.380
And I tried to convince myself that the same was true of me. And I found it terribly difficult.

09:56.380 --> 10:06.660
I found that, you know, I believe what I believe because it's true. They believe. They believe.

10:06.660 --> 10:12.220
The direct access to the truth. Absolutely. But every one of us has direct access to

10:12.220 --> 10:18.940
the truth because the experience of truth is, you know, what we have in perception. We see

10:18.940 --> 10:26.340
the world as it is. And we suppress alternatives as we go. And the experience of truth is true.

10:26.340 --> 10:32.100
It's simply that you can't imagine an alternative to what it is that you see or you think. That's

10:32.100 --> 10:36.580
what's true. So that's, you know, we're blessed with truth all the time.

10:36.580 --> 10:41.660
I mean, two, two things about that. One of them is we hold beliefs with different levels

10:41.660 --> 10:45.780
of confidence. So perceptual things, things that are right in front of our eyes, we're

10:45.780 --> 10:50.620
very confident about. But other things we infer on the basis of the evidence and there

10:50.620 --> 10:54.220
the inference may be shakier and we're aware of that. I think even ordinary people are

10:54.220 --> 10:58.820
aware that their prediction about who will win the Super Bowl, you know, even if they

10:58.820 --> 11:03.180
believe something about that. This is a shakier than saying that there is a table in front

11:03.180 --> 11:09.220
of us. But the important point you were making about the difference between the preferred

11:09.220 --> 11:16.140
reason, the reason that we give for believing something versus the actual cause of the belief.

11:16.140 --> 11:21.980
It's an important distinction. However, you know, it has to be united with the fact that

11:21.980 --> 11:27.420
there is a distinction between the onset of a belief and the maintenance of the belief.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.260
So we believe something, we come to believe something at a given time and then that's

11:31.260 --> 11:36.220
maintained. Now when I ask you right now, why you believe that, I don't battle of Hastings,

11:36.220 --> 11:41.340
was 10, 16. Now there may have been a cause for that a long time ago, but the reason you

11:41.340 --> 11:46.060
offer now may be the reason for which you maintain that belief. So in fact, I don't believe there's

11:46.060 --> 11:52.420
necessarily a huge gap between what maintains the belief right now and what your reason

11:52.420 --> 11:57.620
is. It's clear that you're much more of an optimist about what you want to mind than

11:57.620 --> 12:02.500
I am. I like to believe. Yeah, no, I'm on Danny's side on this one. I mean, let me bring

12:02.500 --> 12:07.540
some data to bear on the issue. It turns out there are beliefs and then there are beliefs

12:07.540 --> 12:10.220
and then there are beliefs, right? I'm not sure we're all talking about the same kind

12:10.220 --> 12:15.980
of belief. But when it comes to political beliefs, it turns out the people who feel the most

12:15.980 --> 12:21.300
strongly about things turn out to be the most ignorant about those things, right? I like

12:21.300 --> 12:26.300
to say it took me decades to learn how little I know. Well, that's a further issue because

12:26.300 --> 12:31.380
the ignorance, the question of truth has to do with the reliability of the belief. And

12:31.380 --> 12:36.380
so one of the things that really is very important to do is to distinguish between the truth

12:36.380 --> 12:39.980
of what you believe and the evidence or the reasons that you're out for believing that.

12:39.980 --> 12:43.220
I thought he was making a point about the reasons, the justification that we are for

12:43.220 --> 12:47.860
believing something. You know, at the end of the day, especially when it comes to complicated

12:47.860 --> 12:52.700
beliefs, beliefs that are not about perceptual things in the environment, the most important

12:52.700 --> 12:58.340
thing you can aim for is not truth itself, but reasonable belief. What you want to do

12:58.340 --> 13:02.260
is make sure that you believe things that are as close to the evidence that's available

13:02.260 --> 13:08.260
to you as you can make them. And if you're lucky, that will also lead to true belief.

13:08.260 --> 13:13.180
I think there's something so interesting about these sort of two perspectives because it really

13:13.180 --> 13:17.260
sort of highlights the difference between philosophers' optimistic perspective and a

13:17.260 --> 13:22.140
psychological empirical perspective that says, yes, maybe we can and should be bringing these

13:22.140 --> 13:28.500
things closer together. But de facto, people have false confidence that is separate from

13:28.500 --> 13:33.180
the reliability or the truth. I think it's that discrepancy that you're highlighting

13:33.180 --> 13:37.420
that's so fascinating and that we can't, and that even knowing about that discrepancy doesn't

13:37.420 --> 13:39.860
make us any less vulnerable to it.

13:39.860 --> 13:43.860
It's because we can't imagine alternatives very easily.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.860
But there's a very different difference between...

13:46.860 --> 13:58.860
And having an idea of yourself, it seems to me if you come up with an idea, you are more

13:58.860 --> 14:02.860
convinced of it than if you read something.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.860
Here's the mic, Adam.

14:05.860 --> 14:07.860
No?

14:07.860 --> 14:18.860
I'm not sure that people are always sure of ideas because they came up with them.

14:18.860 --> 14:21.860
I don't think that's amazing.

14:21.860 --> 14:28.860
I think it's often it's the other way around that actually ideas come out of doubt.

14:28.860 --> 14:35.860
But when we're talking, as we, the title, invited us to talk about fake knowledge and

14:35.860 --> 14:42.860
knowing, then we're in a different territory.

14:42.860 --> 14:50.860
When you could admit that what you're presenting is an idea of how the reasonable man or woman

14:50.860 --> 14:59.060
or human should believe and should think. What we're presenting here is sort of the more

14:59.060 --> 15:05.460
empirical of course, how people think they know.

15:05.460 --> 15:09.460
Of course, it's a completely different thing from how they know.

15:09.460 --> 15:13.460
We're completely agreed and there is, of course, a fascinating and it's an empirical question.

15:13.460 --> 15:18.460
Philosophers, we're very good at sitting in our armchairs.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.460
But we are very well aware of what the boundaries are of what you can get from the outcher.

15:22.460 --> 15:28.460
If you're interested, as you say, in the psychology or the error-proneness of people in general,

15:28.460 --> 15:32.460
then that's heavy empirical work and it needs to be...

15:32.460 --> 15:36.460
It's actually very hard to do, I would think. People do it the base of these surveys,

15:36.460 --> 15:39.460
which I find to be quite bad science a lot of the time.

15:39.460 --> 15:44.460
But the key thing is to bring enough distinctions to bear when you're doing that empirical study

15:44.460 --> 15:49.460
so that truth is not being run with reasonable opinion.

15:49.460 --> 15:53.460
A cause of a belief is not being run with how it's maintained and so on and so forth.

15:53.460 --> 15:59.460
I might offer cheap magic tricks as a way to think about both from a practical standpoint.

15:59.460 --> 16:04.460
Namely, one thing I hear people doing is conflating and basically taking all knowledge

16:04.460 --> 16:08.460
and conflating it into what's measurable and verbal.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.460
But the moment you say that, chances are you're already in a cognitive context

16:12.460 --> 16:15.460
and you've already dismissed physical information

16:15.460 --> 16:20.460
and the way that a practitioner goes about crafting wood or writing a bicycle

16:20.460 --> 16:28.460
or sharing knowledge in a spiritual community or in a psychological, you know, self-help group.

16:28.460 --> 16:33.460
So basically, whether you want to call it mind, body and spirit, which is very out of vogue

16:33.460 --> 16:38.460
or cognitive, you know, sensory motor and social,

16:38.460 --> 16:44.460
certainly we have to account for different kinds of ways of knowing in these different kinds of information.

16:44.460 --> 16:51.460
And I'm not including autonomic and automatic information that, you know, we can have the best idea in the world,

16:51.460 --> 16:56.460
but if suddenly we have to go to the bathroom, we might not be able to express it to the group.

16:56.460 --> 17:00.460
You know, so there's all these different kinds of information and it's important to think about

17:00.460 --> 17:04.460
how we have those ideas and verify and confirm those ideas.

17:07.460 --> 17:15.460
So one important distinction, I think, is between knowledge that's justified by understanding

17:15.460 --> 17:20.460
the consequences of that knowledge as opposed to knowledge that's based on basic values,

17:20.460 --> 17:23.460
protected values or sacred values.

17:23.460 --> 17:28.460
So the motivating experiment for the study was one for the book,

17:28.460 --> 17:35.460
was one done by Frank Kyle in which he asked people how well they understood basic common objects,

17:35.460 --> 17:39.460
like ballpoint pens and people felt they had a sense how they were.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.460
So he said, okay, how do they work? Explain in detail.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.460
And actually people couldn't generate anything.

17:47.460 --> 17:50.460
I mean, people had no idea how they were.

17:50.460 --> 17:57.460
Most experiments were done with drawing and were they able to isolate the problem of 2D to 3D transfer?

17:57.460 --> 18:03.460
Actually, there's a person sitting very close to us who's an expert in this about the way that the mind is able to take three-dimensional information.

18:03.460 --> 18:10.460
So a friend of mine who's an art teacher, he said it's counterintuitive, but it's much easier for people to sculpt than to draw,

18:10.460 --> 18:13.460
because there's less of a transfer going on.

18:13.460 --> 18:18.460
So, and then also in those bicycle experiments, when they had to draw bikes, they might not have known where the handlebars are

18:18.460 --> 18:24.460
in relationship to the pedals, but you could have also tested them by, for instance, just the practical problem of,

18:24.460 --> 18:28.460
you know, are they able to fix a bike? Are they able to win a bike race?

18:28.460 --> 18:32.460
When the chain's off, can they put it back on or not?

18:32.460 --> 18:37.460
In other words, there's other ways that, and also if other people are, if they're on a bike race with other people,

18:37.460 --> 18:44.460
I'm getting at the social, so I went through the physical, and then socially, you know, if other people's bikes are breaking down, do they care?

18:44.460 --> 18:53.460
So you can go into the same territory, but look at very different issues, and if it's only being, you know, represented in a, like a one to seven scale,

18:53.460 --> 18:59.460
you know, which is also kind of an abstract compared to people who work with their hands and do something practical.

18:59.460 --> 19:12.460
I like to consider a specific case in which a perspective was held with strong support, and over a period of time, weakened.

19:12.460 --> 19:25.460
So when I was a house officer at the Mass Metal Health Center in 1960, you couldn't get a job as chairman of the Department of Psychiatry unless you were a psychoanalyst.

19:25.460 --> 19:29.460
This was the standard, particularly in the East Coast and the West Coast.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.460
There were some places in between, they were still skeptical.

19:32.460 --> 19:35.460
In psychoanalysis was the dominant mode.

19:35.460 --> 19:46.460
You know, at Harvard, the general feeling was that the reason we were not treating hypertension asthma successfully,

19:46.460 --> 19:52.460
a lot of the diseases for which there was no treatment at the time, was that these people needed analysis.

19:52.460 --> 19:54.460
These were all psychosomatic illnesses.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.460
And psychoanalysis was the rage in the United States.

19:57.460 --> 20:02.460
It was the Chris Hartman-Lowenstein generation at that time.

20:02.460 --> 20:07.460
You look at the same universe now, and no one talks about this.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.460
You can't become a chairman of the Department of Psychiatry for your psychoanalyst.

20:10.460 --> 20:15.460
You've got to be a geneticist or something like that, and justifiably so, I must say.

20:15.460 --> 20:23.460
And yet it's amazing how this has lost the imagination of the scientific community.

20:23.460 --> 20:31.460
So I think there is something like, you know, empirical knowledge, which is important in order to support the growth of a discipline.

20:31.460 --> 20:37.460
And psychoanalysis lacked it sufficiently to continue to capture people's imagination.

20:37.460 --> 20:41.460
But what I was saying that Danny didn't agree with my client.

20:41.460 --> 20:53.460
What I was saying that he didn't agree with is that if a psychoanalyst said, I think that asthma is caused by some difficulty you have in your relationship with your mother.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.460
He believed that.

20:54.460 --> 20:55.460
Yeah.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.460
He knows it.

20:57.460 --> 21:01.460
So, grab a paper.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.460
Somebody else told it to him.

21:03.460 --> 21:05.460
He may question it more.

21:05.460 --> 21:09.460
But if the idea occurs to him, it seems to have more of a power.

21:09.460 --> 21:14.460
I mean, that's interesting because I would have thought it's almost backward.

21:14.460 --> 21:18.460
That you believe in things because you believe in the people.

21:18.460 --> 21:22.460
You trust and love the people who believe in the same thing.

21:22.460 --> 21:27.460
So I don't think that you invented psychoanalysis for yourself.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.460
I mean, you got it from somewhere.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.460
And you got it from people you trusted.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.460
This is true.

21:33.460 --> 21:39.460
At Harvard, great at being had a tremendous influence on people in academic medicine.

21:39.460 --> 21:44.460
And she would have tea for them once a week on Fridays.

21:44.460 --> 21:51.460
And she would come over and she'd convince them that most of the patients that you're treating that don't respond to the therapies available have.

21:51.460 --> 21:54.460
Or psychosomatic illnesses of various kinds.

21:54.460 --> 21:56.460
And they would respond to psychoanalysis.

21:56.460 --> 22:00.460
And the internists sent their patients into analysis.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.460
And ten years later, they said nothing happened.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.460
And boom.

22:04.460 --> 22:07.460
Their reputation of psychoanalysis dropped spectacularly.

22:07.460 --> 22:12.460
So there is an interaction between empirical data and theoretical speculation.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.460
Yeah.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.460
You know, but I...

22:15.460 --> 22:18.460
Somebody said not disappear that fast.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.460
No, no, not everything disappears.

22:20.460 --> 22:25.460
But I must tell you, in my academic life, this is amazing the change.

22:25.460 --> 22:26.460
Yeah.

22:26.460 --> 22:27.460
Amazing it.

22:27.460 --> 22:31.460
I just want to report an experience I had yesterday driving from Princeton.

22:31.460 --> 22:37.460
There is a big sign that says Jesus lives beyond reasonable doubt.

22:37.460 --> 22:42.460
It's not true.

22:42.460 --> 22:47.460
I saw it.

22:47.460 --> 22:56.460
But... so I agree that, you know, we rely enormously on what we call testimony.

22:56.460 --> 23:03.460
So, instruction by others, you know, so much of what we believe, we believe because...

23:03.460 --> 23:05.460
And I agree with Danny that, you know, often there's a...

23:05.460 --> 23:10.460
If you're reading somebody listening to somebody very credentialed or reading something really credentialed,

23:10.460 --> 23:13.460
and they say something, you might have much greater confidence in that

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
than if you came up with that on your own.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.460
You didn't have the supporting evidence.

23:17.460 --> 23:22.460
So... but there is an interesting question here about where things bottom out.

23:22.460 --> 23:27.460
And there is the suggestion, and I think this seems to be part of the theme of your book that I haven't read it,

23:27.460 --> 23:32.460
that somehow things bottom out in something called collective knowledge rather than individual knowledge.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.460
And though that's a very important and interesting issue.

23:35.460 --> 23:36.460
It has to be well defined.

23:36.460 --> 23:44.460
But... so far, the fact that we rely on people, the fact that we rely for 90% of what we know on people, other people,

23:44.460 --> 23:52.460
doesn't mean that things don't bottom out in some individual decision about who is trustworthy and who isn't.

23:52.460 --> 23:53.460
Okay.

23:53.460 --> 24:00.460
At the end of the day, you have a lot of people clamoring for your attention, okay, and a lot of them are posing as experts.

24:00.460 --> 24:05.460
You have to make a decision about who you are going to trust.

24:05.460 --> 24:11.460
Now, of course, there is the actual role of empirical evidence which can come and smash up even the most...

24:11.460 --> 24:12.460
I like empirical evidence.

24:12.460 --> 24:14.460
That's very important.

24:14.460 --> 24:18.460
But to the extent to which you are relying on people in your community,

24:18.460 --> 24:25.460
there is a sense in which the fundamental contribution is still made by an individual judgement about who is to be trusted.

24:25.460 --> 24:36.460
I have a question for Steve really about this, which is... we know empirically that we entertain false memories or connected memories

24:36.460 --> 24:39.460
in our own mind that have nothing to do with other people.

24:39.460 --> 24:45.460
Seeing Eric here, I saw Eric last week, I'm going to associate those events and create a rich kind of network of memories

24:45.460 --> 24:49.460
without relying on anybody else's knowledge.

24:49.460 --> 24:57.460
Do you think that that mechanism, that that process that happens in an individual's experience is the basis

24:57.460 --> 25:00.460
and the same kind of process that happens when it's other people,

25:00.460 --> 25:06.460
or do you really think that the collective knowledge socially is a completely different kind of beast?

25:06.460 --> 25:17.460
So, Danny wrote a book about two kinds of thinking, and I actually think that you're pointing to exactly the difference

25:17.460 --> 25:20.460
between those two kinds of thinking, right?

25:20.460 --> 25:27.460
So, on one hand, we have these intuitions which come very quickly and naturally, and our brain clearly produces those.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.460
I mean, those are internal. Those are properties of our heads.

25:32.460 --> 25:37.460
When I say we think as a community, I'm referring to a deliberative process, right?

25:37.460 --> 25:40.460
I love the word deliberation because it has these two meanings.

25:40.460 --> 25:47.460
One meaning is that we're thinking things through slowly, but the more common meaning is the sense of a jury

25:47.460 --> 25:49.460
deliberating, right? A group of people.

25:49.460 --> 25:56.460
So, I would argue that right now there are thoughts that are being produced by this group of people collaboratively

25:56.460 --> 25:59.460
that no individual brain would be able to produce.

25:59.460 --> 26:07.460
And even in the domain of memory, right, our memories are shaped by our schema as any good cognitive psychologist knows.

26:07.460 --> 26:12.460
And those schema are social entities, I think, to a large degree.

26:12.460 --> 26:18.460
I'm struck with the fact that in this context, you know, the New York Psycho-Atlantic Institute,

26:18.460 --> 26:23.460
1940, the highest of the high, we're having this kind of discussion.

26:23.460 --> 26:32.460
It seems to me the more appropriate discussion for the Atlantic Institute is why didn't we try to base this on an empirical level?

26:32.460 --> 26:40.460
Why didn't we go to the trouble as, in fact, the American Psycho-Analysts before the European Evasion of Arpurn, Chris and Lowensley were about to do,

26:40.460 --> 26:44.460
Larry, Cuba, et cetera, to try to test some of these ideas?

26:44.460 --> 26:52.460
How come psychoanalysis has been so ineffective in trying to test these ideas in a more rigorous way?

26:52.460 --> 27:00.460
Why isn't an imaging facility associated with every analytic institute, why isn't there a full-time research program associated with each institute?

27:00.460 --> 27:07.460
Here a great institute, like the New York Psycho-Analysts Institute, doesn't have a full-time research effort going on.

27:07.460 --> 27:20.460
I spoke here about ten years ago and I made a comment like this and he said, you must realize every person who's trained here must spend at least two hours a week learning about imaging.

27:20.460 --> 27:29.460
But you know what, they can learn in two hours a week about imaging, but I know about Greek philosophy, even less.

27:29.460 --> 27:32.460
Yes, well, I'm asking you.

27:32.460 --> 27:36.460
This three of us are collecting data on this issue.

27:36.460 --> 27:38.460
Knowledge in the concrete context.

27:38.460 --> 27:46.460
I'm not here as a representative of the New York Psycho-Analysts, so I can't answer it as the way New York Psycho-Analytics would do,

27:46.460 --> 27:54.460
but I would say that 30 years ago, nobody would have invited you to give you a talk to the ten years ago.

27:54.460 --> 28:06.460
Because 30 years ago, there was a conviction that what we thought and how we saw our theory explained everything, or at least explained the problems we were talking about.

28:06.460 --> 28:09.460
I didn't for a moment, 30 years ago think so.

28:09.460 --> 28:10.460
Who didn't?

28:10.460 --> 28:11.460
I didn't.

28:11.460 --> 28:12.460
No, I'm sure you didn't.

28:12.460 --> 28:13.460
I'm not sure.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.460
I'm not sure.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.460
I'm not sure.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.460
So what we did was we did the psychoanalysts.

28:17.460 --> 28:29.460
So when I was training here, there was no question that what the teachers told us, and then we developed our connected ideas about that, that we had a lot of answers.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.460
And that's how we work with the patients.

28:31.460 --> 28:42.460
I think the question for psychoanalysis that is relevant is if some of that knowledge, some of that those findings from Freud on,

28:42.460 --> 28:45.220
what Freud said came from his head. There was no...

28:45.220 --> 28:45.940
Most of it.

28:45.940 --> 28:46.860
Right.

28:46.860 --> 28:51.380
So, if that wasn't right,

28:51.380 --> 28:55.860
or if that now is proven to not fit the data,

28:55.860 --> 28:58.340
how come our patients are doing well?

28:58.340 --> 29:01.460
Psychoanalysis has helped a lot of patients.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.540
So, what is it that makes it,

29:03.540 --> 29:05.740
and that's the question I have for myself,

29:05.740 --> 29:10.020
is what is the therapeutic action of what we do?

29:10.020 --> 29:10.860
It's not...

29:10.860 --> 29:11.700
You don't know that.

29:11.700 --> 29:12.540
No.

29:12.540 --> 29:14.060
You don't know what is related to interpretation.

29:14.060 --> 29:16.700
You don't know whether it's just being present with a person.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.140
I mean, there are so many variables that are involved here.

29:20.140 --> 29:20.780
You know...

29:20.780 --> 29:21.580
But it's certainly...

29:21.580 --> 29:23.660
Mary and Rudolph Goldberg are always telling me recently

29:23.660 --> 29:27.020
she's trying out a situation which, in an analytic situation,

29:27.020 --> 29:28.500
rather than sitting behind the patient,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.540
she's sitting in front of the patient.

29:30.540 --> 29:32.460
Finds it in some circumstance, it works better.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.980
There's so many things that haven't been looked at.

29:34.980 --> 29:37.460
It's a surprisingly...

29:37.460 --> 29:40.860
unquestioning field.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.860
Aren't you flogging a dead horse here?

29:42.860 --> 29:43.700
I'm sorry.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.620
Aren't you flogging a dead horse?

29:44.620 --> 29:46.380
I mean, haven't we all moved on to that?

29:46.380 --> 29:50.620
Well, maybe it can be resuscitated if we rethink it.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.100
But I think we learn a great deal

29:53.100 --> 29:55.780
by seeing why did people turn away from that?

29:55.780 --> 29:59.020
Why did they do what was clear to so many of us?

29:59.020 --> 30:01.220
And that is to ask them direct questions.

30:03.660 --> 30:09.340
I think, Eric, there is a certain arrogance of scientists

30:09.340 --> 30:14.260
that the scientific way to know is the only way.

30:14.260 --> 30:16.660
There is evidence, and then you know the truth.

30:16.660 --> 30:19.780
I happen to be a scientist, so I share that.

30:19.780 --> 30:25.620
We should know that the concept of knowing is contested.

30:25.620 --> 30:29.020
There are many people who know that Jesus lives

30:29.020 --> 30:31.180
beyond a reasonable doubt.

30:31.180 --> 30:33.260
And so there are just other ways.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.540
There is revelation and transmission

30:35.540 --> 30:38.060
and many other ways of knowing.

30:38.060 --> 30:40.100
And science is one religion.

30:40.100 --> 30:42.700
I happen to be part of it.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.140
But we should really not...

30:45.140 --> 30:48.060
But don't you think one of our functions

30:48.060 --> 30:51.540
is to help people see and what circumstances.

30:51.540 --> 30:54.380
Science might be helpful to moving them further.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.140
I mean, certainly the science...

30:57.140 --> 31:00.220
So you have Eric coming along and saying,

31:00.220 --> 31:03.260
I've discovered cognitive behavior therapy.

31:03.260 --> 31:06.740
It's so much more useful in these circumstances.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.500
Why not do a systematic study to see

31:08.500 --> 31:10.860
in what circumstances cognitive behavior?

31:10.860 --> 31:14.420
I mean, you're not asking me because, of course, I agree with you.

31:14.420 --> 31:16.740
At the point, I think...

31:16.740 --> 31:18.820
LAUGHTER

31:18.820 --> 31:20.140
The point?

31:20.140 --> 31:21.740
I mean...

31:21.740 --> 31:23.860
That's it. That's it.

31:23.860 --> 31:25.140
It's not.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.660
Because most people know things differently,

31:28.660 --> 31:30.100
and they think they know.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.300
How far is this?

31:31.300 --> 31:32.980
As academics.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.340
Is to help people see...

31:34.340 --> 31:34.900
I mean, you're not...

31:34.900 --> 31:37.260
What is the better way to go?

31:37.260 --> 31:39.660
What I'm suggesting, actually,

31:39.660 --> 31:44.980
is that if the function of academics is to convince people

31:44.980 --> 31:49.060
of the value of science and to help them see the value of science,

31:49.060 --> 31:52.020
then it would be a good idea to have some empathy

31:52.020 --> 31:55.060
for what people think they know now

31:55.060 --> 31:56.980
in different ways of know.

31:56.980 --> 32:00.180
We have to start from an attempt to understand

32:00.180 --> 32:02.980
and to empathize with other ways of knowing.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.540
I'd add to that, it's great, I think what you're saying,

32:05.540 --> 32:09.140
if I'm understanding correctly, is A, have empathy for that,

32:09.140 --> 32:11.460
but also have a scientific understanding

32:11.460 --> 32:14.820
of what gives us that subjective feeling of knowledge.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.580
Absolutely. And how to help people

32:16.580 --> 32:19.300
move from their current position to another one.

32:19.300 --> 32:23.060
So this is a topic close to my heart.

32:23.060 --> 32:25.540
I wrote a book some 10 years ago called Fear of Knowledge,

32:25.540 --> 32:26.100
which discusses...

32:26.100 --> 32:26.660
Fear of what?

32:26.660 --> 32:27.700
Fear of knowledge.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.180
Knowledge. Fear of knowledge.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.380
LAUGHTER

32:31.380 --> 32:32.820
Fear of knowledge.

32:32.820 --> 32:38.260
Which was precisely about, so you just said something.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.780
You did actually a classic maneuver,

32:39.780 --> 32:43.860
which you said something extremely radical.

32:43.860 --> 32:46.980
And then you backpedaled to something much more innocuous

32:46.980 --> 32:48.100
that everybody could accept.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.900
And Stanley Fish, by the way, does exactly the same thing.

32:50.900 --> 32:52.820
I wouldn't have thought you would be in that company.

32:52.820 --> 32:59.380
But the radical remark is science is just one religion among many.

32:59.380 --> 33:02.780
OK. This is an amazing thing.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.700
OK. It's not even ultimately a coherent view,

33:05.700 --> 33:09.380
because if you say, well, you know, I happen to be a scientist,

33:09.380 --> 33:10.820
you know, that's my favorite method.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.100
But other people have other methods.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.140
For instance, they use tea leaves,

33:14.140 --> 33:17.740
or they use alleged divine revelation,

33:17.740 --> 33:19.860
and so forth to find out what's true.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.420
That's, of course, perfectly fine.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.180
That's their method.

33:22.180 --> 33:23.620
I mean, did I say that's perfectly fine?

33:23.620 --> 33:25.140
Well, you said science.

33:25.140 --> 33:26.140
You said science.

33:26.140 --> 33:26.700
You said science.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.300
I did not imply.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.620
Science is one religion among many.

33:30.620 --> 33:31.220
Yes.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.820
Yes, I did say that.

33:32.820 --> 33:38.100
The way we treat religions, because we don't treat them

33:38.100 --> 33:40.900
necessarily as a source of truth, is we say people

33:40.900 --> 33:43.620
are entitled to their faith, to their religious beliefs.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.620
OK.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.540
I, OK.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.580
The innocuous remark is, no, look.

33:49.580 --> 33:52.300
Of course, this is a privileged way of figuring out

33:52.300 --> 33:53.100
what's true.

33:53.100 --> 33:55.860
But in order to bring other people around,

33:55.860 --> 33:56.900
you have to have empathy.

33:56.900 --> 34:00.220
You have to understand what shoes they're walking in.

34:00.220 --> 34:04.580
You have to see something essential, which

34:04.580 --> 34:06.620
is that from the point of view of somebody

34:06.620 --> 34:09.140
who doesn't believe in science, and that's

34:09.140 --> 34:13.220
at least 30% of Americans, if not more,

34:13.220 --> 34:16.980
from their point of view, science is just another religion.

34:16.980 --> 34:20.420
And it's useful to understand that when we are talking

34:20.420 --> 34:24.860
to people who do not share our basic beliefs about what

34:24.860 --> 34:27.500
is true and how to acquire truth, we better

34:27.500 --> 34:29.540
try to understand who we're talking to.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.220
Empathy is no question.

34:31.220 --> 34:34.340
But leveling it all out by saying it's just one religion.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.860
No, I mean, I wasn't leveling it all out.

34:36.860 --> 34:39.420
I was really trying to tell you that there

34:39.420 --> 34:41.020
is another perspective.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.620
Of course, there's no other perspective.

34:42.620 --> 34:45.300
Other perspective, science is a religion.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.060
Like, no.

34:46.060 --> 34:47.060
No.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.060
No.

34:48.060 --> 34:49.060
No.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.260
What is the definition of that?

34:50.260 --> 34:51.900
A miracle.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.180
And science, what definition is a miracle.

34:53.180 --> 34:55.300
It's a system of belief.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.900
But there are different systems of belief.

34:57.900 --> 35:00.260
I keep expecting you to ask them to explain this.

35:00.260 --> 35:01.260
Yes.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.060
That's right.

35:03.060 --> 35:04.860
It's a strong belief.

35:04.860 --> 35:06.700
It's too much fun.

35:06.700 --> 35:07.900
And I doubt that they could.

35:11.100 --> 35:15.100
But humans aren't the only species

35:15.100 --> 35:18.220
that have false confidence and false knowledge.

35:18.220 --> 35:19.900
So we have to also take into account

35:19.900 --> 35:22.180
that much of this is probably emerging

35:22.180 --> 35:24.380
from basic biological mechanisms.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.900
We see you can get animals to have false confidence

35:26.900 --> 35:28.180
and false beliefs as well.

35:28.180 --> 35:30.700
I don't know how much is known about the social sharing

35:30.700 --> 35:31.900
of knowledge.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.500
But certainly, there are studies showing

35:33.500 --> 35:36.340
these sort of phenomena emerge in non-humans as well.

35:36.340 --> 35:38.540
I think that's a really important aspect

35:38.540 --> 35:40.180
in terms of understanding what I think,

35:40.180 --> 35:41.220
partly what you were referring to,

35:41.220 --> 35:45.660
is the physical and biological manifestations and mechanisms.

35:45.660 --> 35:47.100
And there's a big danger there if you

35:47.100 --> 35:50.740
take the rational context of, I have rational information,

35:50.740 --> 35:53.540
so I'm going to understand that.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.020
The most beautiful way I ever heard this expressed,

35:56.020 --> 35:57.820
I spent a lot of time talking to Gerald Edelman

35:57.820 --> 36:01.340
about selective systems in nature.

36:01.340 --> 36:03.900
And we believe it or not, we compared.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.420
He first talked about his mind theory.

36:07.420 --> 36:10.420
But I said, can we go back to something empirical?

36:10.420 --> 36:13.980
And can we go to your work on immune response?

36:13.980 --> 36:16.660
Because he had found the structure of the antibody.

36:16.660 --> 36:19.260
And so we had these great talks about comparing a magician

36:19.260 --> 36:23.900
and his audience doing tricks that could adapt, not stage tricks,

36:23.900 --> 36:26.180
but tricks where you're adapting very quickly,

36:26.180 --> 36:29.020
almost like three card monty on the street.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.620
So there's a very feedback and feedback for the response.

36:32.620 --> 36:35.780
So I was trying to explain this concept of selective processes

36:35.780 --> 36:39.900
in nature and at a Mind Science Foundation conference.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.940
And there's a philosopher and a cognitive psychologist.

36:42.940 --> 36:44.220
And it wasn't happening.

36:44.220 --> 36:47.380
And then a wonderful woman, the Secretary of the Mind Science

36:47.380 --> 36:50.340
Foundation, she came by and I said,

36:50.340 --> 36:52.660
well, let's put it in terms of nightclubs.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.820
So this is getting into how does this information

36:54.820 --> 36:56.220
get specific, right?

36:56.220 --> 36:58.860
So if you're thinking about, does it have to be rational?

36:58.860 --> 37:01.380
So I said, well, let's think about nightclubs

37:01.380 --> 37:03.980
because at the time I was working at a big nightclub in New York.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.980
And I said, so if you walked into nightclubs,

37:05.980 --> 37:07.220
she was in her 20s.

37:07.220 --> 37:09.500
And I said, if you walked into a nightclub, you'd ignore me.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.340
And she said, no.

37:10.340 --> 37:13.220
I'd find out if you were an owner or a friend of the owner.

37:13.220 --> 37:16.180
And if you weren't, then I'd ignore you.

37:16.180 --> 37:20.660
So I said, OK, this is the level of reality I want to address.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.540
So then I tried to explain this idea of selection

37:22.540 --> 37:24.260
of the selection of processes in nature.

37:24.260 --> 37:26.860
And she said, it's so obvious what he's saying.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.180
And the other people got it.

37:28.180 --> 37:29.020
What are you talking about?

37:29.020 --> 37:32.740
Because they kept on trying to fit it into a rational construct.

37:32.740 --> 37:35.300
And she said, listen, when I go to a nightclub

37:35.300 --> 37:38.780
at the beginning of the night, I know exactly who I'm looking

37:38.780 --> 37:40.060
for.

37:40.060 --> 37:41.700
I'm looking for Mr. Wright.

37:41.700 --> 37:44.460
But by the end of the night, when it's closing time,

37:44.460 --> 37:46.820
I'm looking for Mr. Wright now.

37:46.820 --> 37:53.380
And all he's saying is that nature can never choose.

37:53.380 --> 37:54.540
It can't deliberate.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.140
It can only select, in terms of natural selection.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.180
She didn't say that a minute, a minute.

37:59.180 --> 38:01.020
The Mr. Wright now.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.780
So once we shift from these areas of cognitive constructs,

38:04.780 --> 38:07.820
of cognitive information, and go to this animal stuff,

38:07.820 --> 38:10.220
it's good to think about ourselves in different contexts

38:10.220 --> 38:12.300
where we can appreciate selective processes

38:12.300 --> 38:14.940
and nature a little more easily.

38:14.940 --> 38:16.860
Yeah, no, I'm sure that's right.

38:16.860 --> 38:20.660
But I do think that there's a special status

38:20.660 --> 38:23.180
given to certain kinds of constructs

38:23.180 --> 38:25.340
that only humans are capable of.

38:25.340 --> 38:28.340
Yvall Harari has this great thought experiment.

38:28.340 --> 38:32.380
He asks you to imagine 50,000 chimpanzees

38:32.380 --> 38:35.940
sitting in the stadium watching a soccer match.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.540
Pure chaos, right?

38:37.540 --> 38:38.660
Complete chaos.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.140
You'd have animals jumping all over each other.

38:41.140 --> 38:43.980
There's something that humans are capable of.

38:43.980 --> 38:47.820
There's a way that humans can interact with other humans

38:47.820 --> 38:50.340
that no other, I'll go this far,

38:50.340 --> 38:53.700
that no other cognitive mechanism is capable of.

38:53.700 --> 38:56.460
My joke, my quick response is I say,

38:56.460 --> 38:58.380
we've come into a point in society

38:58.380 --> 39:02.340
where we really believe that Mr. Spock must run the enterprise.

39:02.340 --> 39:06.700
And in, because in other words,

39:06.700 --> 39:08.780
the sense of reason must lead.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.380
And then we forget the reason why a morality play

39:11.380 --> 39:12.900
called Star Trek was written

39:12.900 --> 39:15.100
to show the importance of our humanity.

39:15.100 --> 39:17.540
So all I'm saying is it's really, it's,

39:17.540 --> 39:20.540
I was not saying that we are led by reason.

39:20.540 --> 39:24.260
I was saying that we are able to collaborate

39:24.260 --> 39:27.940
as a group, as a community,

39:27.940 --> 39:32.460
in a way that no other cognitive systems can.

39:32.460 --> 39:33.540
That's the claim.

39:33.540 --> 39:37.380
So one thing we can do is share each other's intentionality.

39:37.380 --> 39:39.820
And Mike Thomasella has great arguments

39:39.820 --> 39:42.460
showing that no other animal, no other machine

39:42.460 --> 39:45.460
is capable of sharing intentionality with others.

39:45.460 --> 39:47.820
And that is the whole Captain Kirk point, right?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.660
If you can build a collective group

39:49.660 --> 39:52.540
that can do things beyond individual capacity.

39:54.540 --> 39:55.860
Steve, I had a question.

39:55.860 --> 40:00.140
When you wrote your book, I'm sure, before Trump's election.

40:00.140 --> 40:00.980
Yes.

40:02.780 --> 40:04.420
The idea of a community,

40:04.420 --> 40:07.540
could there be two communities that do not communicate

40:07.540 --> 40:08.380
with each other?

40:08.380 --> 40:11.100
I mean, would you be writing the same book today?

40:12.060 --> 40:16.100
Oh, well, I'd have a lot more examples

40:16.100 --> 40:17.380
if I were writing it today.

40:17.380 --> 40:20.220
But yes, the ideas would be the same.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.940
So one of our ideas is this notion

40:21.940 --> 40:23.460
of contagious understanding, right?

40:23.460 --> 40:27.020
We run experiments showing that when other people

40:27.020 --> 40:30.820
feel they understand, then you feel you understand more, right?

40:30.820 --> 40:32.700
Understanding's a bit like a disease.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.340
It's sort of, it's contagious.

40:35.340 --> 40:39.900
And as a result of that, you can have ideological communities

40:39.900 --> 40:42.500
where individuals think they understand

40:42.500 --> 40:44.180
because the people around them understand,

40:44.180 --> 40:45.540
but everybody else understands

40:45.540 --> 40:47.460
because the people around them understand

40:47.460 --> 40:49.840
and there's no actual understanding.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.180
So when you have that kind of dynamic,

40:54.180 --> 40:56.540
you can certainly have multiple different

40:56.540 --> 40:59.220
ideological communities arising, right?

40:59.220 --> 41:00.140
Absolutely.

41:00.140 --> 41:02.580
I mean, there are a lot of questions

41:02.580 --> 41:04.580
about what forms your community

41:04.580 --> 41:07.460
and presumably we're all members of multiple communities

41:07.460 --> 41:08.300
and there's an asking of...

41:08.300 --> 41:10.620
You call them communities of knowledge?

41:10.620 --> 41:11.460
Yeah.

41:11.460 --> 41:12.380
You don't like that?

41:12.380 --> 41:13.300
No, no one.

41:13.300 --> 41:14.220
I like it a lot.

41:14.220 --> 41:18.980
But you're using the word knowledge in a very different way

41:18.980 --> 41:20.700
than it's being used by others.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.700
If those are communities of knowledge.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.260
That's one thing worth mentioning

41:24.260 --> 41:27.660
just in order to calibrate the terminology.

41:27.660 --> 41:32.300
So typically we use words like knowing,

41:32.300 --> 41:33.620
understanding,

41:34.620 --> 41:38.180
and factive senses so that when you know

41:38.180 --> 41:39.740
what you know has to be true

41:39.740 --> 41:42.340
and when you understand what you understand,

41:42.340 --> 41:44.820
you really understand the principles

41:44.820 --> 41:45.940
by which the thing works.

41:45.940 --> 41:47.980
I think you just identified the difference

41:47.980 --> 41:49.620
between philosophers and psychosocialists.

41:49.620 --> 41:50.980
No, but you know, this really ought not to be

41:50.980 --> 41:52.060
because this is terminology.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.660
Unless you get, you just agree on the terminology,

41:54.660 --> 41:56.300
we'll just end up confusing one another.

41:56.300 --> 41:57.140
So this is...

41:57.140 --> 41:58.580
I mean, you're talking about knowing

41:58.580 --> 42:00.580
and we psychologists are talking about

42:00.580 --> 42:01.900
feeling that you know.

42:01.900 --> 42:02.820
Well, that's it.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.260
So you see that in his little speech

42:05.260 --> 42:08.220
just now, I don't mean to be the semantic police here,

42:08.220 --> 42:10.940
but in the speech, there was constant sliding

42:10.940 --> 42:13.420
between feeling you understand and understanding.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.020
So is understanding contagious

42:15.020 --> 42:17.060
or is the feeling of understanding contagious?

42:17.060 --> 42:19.100
What you showed is the feeling of understanding

42:19.100 --> 42:21.100
is contagious because you then wanted to say

42:21.100 --> 42:22.740
there was no real understanding.

42:22.740 --> 42:23.580
That's true.

42:23.580 --> 42:25.940
I think this explains why biologists

42:25.940 --> 42:28.820
so often take a reductionist approach.

42:28.820 --> 42:30.660
Why so much of the genetic code

42:30.660 --> 42:32.060
was worked out on simple animals

42:32.060 --> 42:34.420
because I could do the experiment today,

42:34.420 --> 42:37.660
show you the results and you can replicate it tomorrow.

42:37.660 --> 42:41.060
So there is a level of science in certain areas

42:41.060 --> 42:43.780
in which we can show each other exactly what we do.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.540
The procedure is straightforward

42:46.540 --> 42:50.500
and anyone else can do it and get very much the same result.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
So that has to be distinguished

42:52.500 --> 42:54.620
from the kinds of philosophical speculations

42:54.620 --> 42:56.980
we're talking about in which you can have your belief

42:56.980 --> 42:57.820
and I have my belief

42:57.820 --> 43:00.580
and we don't necessarily have to have coincidence of that.

43:00.580 --> 43:03.660
But there is hard science that is a prototype

43:03.660 --> 43:05.780
of what ultimately wants to accomplish

43:05.780 --> 43:07.260
in a number of different areas.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.180
But I think Steve's book, for example,

43:10.180 --> 43:12.420
is based on that sort of hard science

43:12.420 --> 43:15.180
about human subjective sense of knowing.

43:15.180 --> 43:16.180
Right.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.900
Series of studies replicated

43:17.900 --> 43:20.540
and it's not molecular science,

43:20.540 --> 43:21.740
it's behavioral science.

43:21.740 --> 43:26.740
With the same things working for it.

43:28.140 --> 43:31.220
And it seems like, I've reduced to say in other meanings

43:31.220 --> 43:33.260
that this book is especially important

43:33.260 --> 43:37.940
for cognitive psychologists that can get information.

43:37.940 --> 43:40.420
Like I'm thinking the historical note of when

43:42.100 --> 43:45.540
Oricneizer was trying to reframe cognitive psychology

43:45.540 --> 43:46.740
and kind of misunderstood,

43:46.740 --> 43:50.020
but he specifically brought up this kind of physical information

43:50.020 --> 43:54.180
as described by the Gibson's and social schematas

43:54.180 --> 43:56.220
as described by Frederick Bartlett.

43:56.220 --> 43:58.220
And it seems like you go into a similar territory

43:58.220 --> 44:00.340
and remind people that you need to open it up

44:00.340 --> 44:02.060
from just the pure cognitive.

44:02.060 --> 44:05.260
So one of the ideas is that as human beings

44:05.260 --> 44:07.020
we're foragers for knowledge

44:07.020 --> 44:10.180
and we don't retain a lot of it in our brains.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.140
We retain some of it in our bodies.

44:12.140 --> 44:14.540
We use the world all the time, right?

44:14.540 --> 44:17.660
Like I don't know exactly where that bottle of water is,

44:17.660 --> 44:20.260
but I can look and see and reach for it.

44:20.260 --> 44:23.060
But more than anything, we use other people.

44:23.060 --> 44:24.980
And these days of course we use Google,

44:24.980 --> 44:26.960
which is a great source of knowledge.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.260
So this notion of embodiment,

44:30.260 --> 44:32.100
which I think you're referring to, right?

44:32.100 --> 44:35.260
That we use our bodies as part of the process of thought.

44:35.260 --> 44:37.460
We're sort of trying to generalize that to say

44:37.460 --> 44:40.700
we use other people as part of the process of thought as well.

44:40.700 --> 44:42.980
Let me make this a little bit more concrete.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.980
So we have these gifted people all around here.

44:45.980 --> 44:48.660
I'm gonna give you a task.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.660
If we wanna put psychoanalysis,

44:50.660 --> 44:54.820
psychoanalysis theory on an empirical basis,

44:54.820 --> 44:55.900
how would we proceed?

44:55.900 --> 44:58.060
What would you suggest to the first steps?

45:00.380 --> 45:01.740
Then if you want to do it?

45:01.740 --> 45:02.900
I don't want to do that.

45:02.900 --> 45:03.740
Yeah, I know.

45:03.740 --> 45:04.580
I know.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.420
I know.

45:05.420 --> 45:06.740
I know.

45:06.740 --> 45:08.060
Thank you.

45:08.060 --> 45:09.820
You didn't know about price to it.

45:09.820 --> 45:10.660
I know.

45:10.660 --> 45:11.500
I know.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.340
I know.

45:12.340 --> 45:13.180
I know.

45:13.180 --> 45:14.020
I know.

45:14.020 --> 45:15.780
I didn't get to know about price per se.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.100
You just wanted to do that.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.380
You gotta do it what he did.

45:19.380 --> 45:20.780
Selection is a point.

45:21.860 --> 45:23.420
Yes.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.620
People have tried, right?

45:24.620 --> 45:26.140
I mean, there are all sorts of studies

45:26.140 --> 45:28.940
looking at the effectiveness of psychoanalytic theory,

45:28.940 --> 45:30.820
of psychoanalysis.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.100
There are relatively few,

45:32.100 --> 45:34.900
when you consider how long the theory has been around,

45:34.900 --> 45:36.380
that they've been competing theories

45:36.380 --> 45:38.620
that have been surprisingly few.

45:38.620 --> 45:39.460
Okay.

45:39.460 --> 45:40.900
Do you have an idea?

45:40.900 --> 45:44.340
Like a step by step, like the next 10 years?

45:44.340 --> 45:45.740
I do, you gotta have to think it through.

45:45.740 --> 45:47.180
But just for example,

45:47.180 --> 45:50.740
under what circumstances is cognitive behavior therapy,

45:50.740 --> 45:53.540
more advantageous compared to analytic therapy,

45:53.540 --> 45:55.420
that's something that's easily,

45:55.420 --> 45:57.220
I would easily stupid word,

45:57.220 --> 45:59.180
but should be possible to say.

45:59.180 --> 46:00.540
It has been studied.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.380
Yeah, it has been studied.

46:01.380 --> 46:03.380
Not extensively, not in a minute.

46:03.380 --> 46:06.820
Enough to show that one is far superior to the other.

46:06.820 --> 46:11.820
I'd like to say something that perhaps is completely obvious

46:13.540 --> 46:14.380
here, right?

46:14.380 --> 46:17.220
Which is that, and several of you have said

46:17.220 --> 46:19.420
in many contexts before,

46:19.420 --> 46:22.460
but might be worth reminding ourselves,

46:22.460 --> 46:24.100
which is, and it really comes from the perspective

46:24.100 --> 46:25.620
of this thinking about, you know,

46:25.620 --> 46:28.140
as everybody does, but my own work on memory,

46:28.140 --> 46:30.100
and how we have to use memories

46:30.100 --> 46:33.380
to guide our behavior all the time.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.980
We have to make fast decisions all the time,

46:35.980 --> 46:38.300
and that sense of confidence,

46:38.300 --> 46:40.620
the subjective sense of knowing that we know something,

46:40.620 --> 46:42.820
regardless of how that's influenced by other people,

46:42.820 --> 46:45.220
we couldn't act without that, right?

46:45.220 --> 46:47.380
This is, it's not like it's in our way,

46:47.380 --> 46:49.380
and just leading us to make mistakes,

46:49.380 --> 46:53.620
and really, you know, in the spirit of Danny and Amos's work.

46:53.620 --> 46:57.260
This is a fundamental necessity for survival,

46:57.260 --> 46:59.300
is that subjective sense of belief,

46:59.300 --> 47:02.100
and without too much deliberation, right?

47:02.100 --> 47:03.780
So, you know, in many ways,

47:03.780 --> 47:07.500
it's framed here as sort of something that's an illusion,

47:07.500 --> 47:12.020
but it's an illusion that serves us very well.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.260
The illusion of knowledge that we don't,

47:14.260 --> 47:18.300
we can't possibly always know in depth everything

47:18.300 --> 47:20.340
we think we need to know to act.

47:20.340 --> 47:24.060
I mean, a fundamental psychological result, I think,

47:24.060 --> 47:27.380
is that the experience of knowing it the same,

47:27.380 --> 47:29.820
whether your knowledge is true or not.

47:29.820 --> 47:32.780
So, and you know, what we are concerned with here,

47:32.780 --> 47:36.860
is the experience of knowledge, of knowing,

47:36.860 --> 47:39.460
and it's a powerful experience associated

47:39.460 --> 47:41.900
with a powerful sense of confidence,

47:41.900 --> 47:46.900
and the fact that it doesn't necessarily correlate

47:47.500 --> 47:50.980
with truth is a very, very important fact,

47:50.980 --> 47:52.900
that we are taking as a fact.

47:52.900 --> 47:56.140
So, I don't think there is terminology for confusion.

47:56.140 --> 48:00.460
I think we're really arguing about knowing as a state of mind,

48:00.460 --> 48:03.700
which, you know, can be in reality something else,

48:03.700 --> 48:06.820
and it can be connected or disconnected from reality.

48:07.820 --> 48:10.700
Well, I'm offending you.

48:10.700 --> 48:13.140
No, no, look, it's, it's,

48:14.340 --> 48:17.860
we can agree on the terminology is easy to agree on.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.100
I mean, put it this way.

48:19.100 --> 48:22.860
So, the way we usually think is knowing consists in part

48:22.860 --> 48:26.820
of the subjective aspect, which is believing with confidence

48:26.820 --> 48:30.780
and backed up probably by some reasons.

48:30.780 --> 48:33.540
And then the truth component, which is something we,

48:33.540 --> 48:36.620
is not in our head, and either obtains or doesn't obtain.

48:36.620 --> 48:39.260
So, from a psychological point of view,

48:39.260 --> 48:40.940
though this is contested in some portals,

48:40.940 --> 48:43.420
but we can surely agree on this,

48:43.420 --> 48:46.300
what matters for the explanation of behavior

48:46.300 --> 48:48.500
is the strongly held belief,

48:48.500 --> 48:50.340
the belief held with confidence, that's it,

48:50.340 --> 48:53.020
whether it actually has the real dyadic relational aspect

48:53.020 --> 48:57.220
or the truth or not, won't matter to how you behave.

48:57.220 --> 49:00.940
And so that's, but we can reserve the term knowing

49:00.940 --> 49:03.260
for something that has the truth component,

49:03.260 --> 49:06.020
and reserve the term reasonable or strongly held belief

49:06.020 --> 49:07.580
for the state of mind.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.380
Well, when you're at a restaurant and ordering from a menu,

49:12.380 --> 49:15.420
you're not gonna say, I'll have the spaghetti

49:15.420 --> 49:18.300
because I have some reasonably, you know,

49:18.300 --> 49:20.860
reasonable suspicion that that may be better.

49:20.860 --> 49:23.460
And you'll respond quickly and you'll place your order.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.820
That's a preference rather than a belief.

49:25.820 --> 49:28.860
I mean, it's a belief about the outcome of the choice.

49:30.860 --> 49:34.100
You do think, well, what is going to satisfy me at this moment

49:34.100 --> 49:35.860
and then you make a selection based on that?

49:35.860 --> 49:37.500
So that's based on reasons.

49:37.500 --> 49:40.140
That's a belief about your own, what will make you happy.

49:40.140 --> 49:40.980
Yes.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.660
I think it's very similar in many ways,

49:43.660 --> 49:45.180
in the sense that you're making a prediction

49:45.180 --> 49:47.140
about the future based on something you're feeling,

49:47.140 --> 49:48.340
but you feel strongly about it,

49:48.340 --> 49:51.980
even though it's almost by definition kind of based on

49:51.980 --> 49:52.820
reasons.

49:52.820 --> 49:54.020
I don't see any dispute here.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.100
Okay.

49:55.100 --> 49:57.740
I tell you what is interesting is there's something that,

49:57.740 --> 49:59.140
well, I'd, I'd turn.

49:59.140 --> 50:02.540
Well, let me just quickly make a point that may be obvious.

50:02.540 --> 50:04.460
You know, if I'm at a restaurant,

50:04.460 --> 50:07.460
often what I do is ask the waitress or the waiter,

50:08.460 --> 50:10.500
would you take the spaghetti?

50:10.500 --> 50:13.140
And if they say yes, then I'll go with it.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.100
And in general,

50:15.100 --> 50:20.100
in general, I think many of our, many of our decisions

50:20.900 --> 50:24.060
are made out of habit and many of our decisions are made

50:24.060 --> 50:26.580
because, you know, I was at a faculty meeting recently

50:26.580 --> 50:30.060
and we were deciding whether to promote someone.

50:30.060 --> 50:32.260
And this colleague of mine said, you know,

50:32.260 --> 50:34.820
I didn't think this person should be promoted.

50:34.820 --> 50:36.140
I was right on the knife set.

50:36.140 --> 50:39.180
So I sat there and waited to see how other people voted.

50:39.180 --> 50:41.460
And I just went with the majority.

50:41.460 --> 50:45.420
And I actually think people do that all the time, right?

50:45.420 --> 50:46.660
Is this the norm?

50:46.660 --> 50:49.580
Is this what people do in this situation?

50:49.580 --> 50:51.860
That's the question we often ask ourselves.

50:51.860 --> 50:54.220
And so often we don't have reasons.

50:54.220 --> 50:58.340
Our reason is this is what the community's doing.

50:58.340 --> 50:59.180
Well, not to reason.

50:59.180 --> 51:00.180
But the big difference with your colleague

51:00.180 --> 51:03.020
is that your colleague knew they didn't know.

51:03.020 --> 51:06.460
And right in many ways, that's one of the most interesting

51:06.460 --> 51:10.420
phenomena is when people think they know and don't, right?

51:10.420 --> 51:12.620
As, you know, now quoting you to you.

51:12.620 --> 51:16.740
And implicit in what you're saying, I think,

51:16.740 --> 51:19.580
is trust in the community.

51:19.580 --> 51:23.540
But, you know, I can't help looking around.

51:23.540 --> 51:27.900
And there are communities that are not talking to each other.

51:27.900 --> 51:31.700
And they're at equal level of self-confidence.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.100
But communication is broken down.

51:34.100 --> 51:37.020
So there is no community of knowledge.

51:37.020 --> 51:40.140
And there is, you know, science is not

51:40.140 --> 51:43.460
universally accepted.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.460
And we're all living in communities of knowledge.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.540
It's just that there's more than one of them, right?

51:47.540 --> 51:48.460
I look around.

51:48.460 --> 51:52.860
I look to scientists and experts and people in this room.

51:52.860 --> 51:56.260
And there are other people in America who look elsewhere.

51:56.260 --> 51:58.380
It's actually an interesting question where they look,

51:58.380 --> 51:59.820
because it's not at all obvious.

52:05.140 --> 52:07.620
You've had another point you wanted to make.

52:07.620 --> 52:11.500
I wanted to draw you out on this idea that exactly what

52:11.500 --> 52:15.660
the dependence is on the community in knowing or thinking.

52:15.660 --> 52:22.660
Because, again, there is one fairly familiar description

52:22.660 --> 52:25.620
of that that we started out with, where we rely on other people's

52:25.620 --> 52:26.060
knowledge.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.260
We accept what they say.

52:27.260 --> 52:28.860
We accept what they say.

52:28.860 --> 52:31.140
It's an interesting question on what basis.

52:31.140 --> 52:34.540
But in an ideal situation, you would

52:34.540 --> 52:36.620
have some reason for trusting that source

52:36.620 --> 52:40.180
and trusted for that reason, except what they have to say.

52:40.180 --> 52:48.260
But you wanted something that's more a sexier thesis,

52:48.260 --> 52:51.060
that somehow the thinking itself is distributed.

52:51.060 --> 52:54.540
The thinking process is communally distributed.

52:54.540 --> 52:56.260
Did I understand you correctly?

52:56.260 --> 52:57.540
The reasoning is distributed.

52:57.540 --> 53:01.140
Now, that's a very, I mean, the picture I described,

53:01.140 --> 53:03.740
we're individuals, we're reasoning for ourselves.

53:03.740 --> 53:06.580
Sometimes we outsource because we don't know everything

53:06.580 --> 53:07.420
we want to rely on.

53:07.420 --> 53:08.740
Other people's thinking.

53:08.740 --> 53:10.700
But that thinking itself is conceived of

53:10.700 --> 53:13.820
as an individualistic thing, which may have been borrowed

53:13.820 --> 53:14.460
from others.

53:14.460 --> 53:17.100
But what is this idea of a distributed thinking?

53:17.100 --> 53:21.900
So the idea comes, essentially, from a colleague of yours,

53:21.900 --> 53:24.420
Hillary Putnam, the philosopher, who talked about this

53:24.420 --> 53:26.460
in the domain of language.

53:26.460 --> 53:29.180
And he pointed out, often we use words,

53:29.180 --> 53:31.620
even though we don't know what they mean.

53:31.620 --> 53:34.900
So I might say something like, I hope one day to see

53:34.900 --> 53:37.060
a piece of molybdenum.

53:37.060 --> 53:39.460
And that's a perfectly good sentence, right?

53:39.460 --> 53:42.380
Even though I have no idea what molybdenum is.

53:42.380 --> 53:45.260
I just believe there are experts in the community

53:45.260 --> 53:48.300
who could identify this.

53:48.300 --> 53:52.540
And I think we use words like that all the time, organic.

53:52.540 --> 53:54.220
What does it, this apple is organic.

53:54.220 --> 53:55.700
What does that really mean?

53:55.700 --> 53:58.580
It means that we think there are people out there too.

53:58.580 --> 53:59.580
Right?

53:59.580 --> 54:03.540
You could identify some lack of something.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.140
So it's more expensive.

54:05.140 --> 54:06.260
It just works better.

54:06.260 --> 54:08.020
That's true.

54:08.020 --> 54:12.340
But that seems to fit with the less sexy model,

54:12.340 --> 54:14.740
you see, because that's a case where what I am doing

54:14.740 --> 54:17.020
is I am deferring to a bunch of experts who really

54:17.020 --> 54:19.620
have criteria for identifying molybdenum

54:19.620 --> 54:21.060
or organic or something.

54:21.060 --> 54:24.540
And according to him, the way the attribution of concepts

54:24.540 --> 54:26.540
works in the community is provided

54:26.540 --> 54:29.220
you are willing to defer to these experts.

54:29.220 --> 54:32.340
We attribute to you the full concept that they have.

54:32.340 --> 54:34.060
Not the full understanding of that concept,

54:34.060 --> 54:35.940
but the concept itself.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.140
But that looks like it's not as though my reasoning

54:38.140 --> 54:41.500
is distributed over theirs, but rather I get to say

54:41.500 --> 54:44.980
I am nolybdenum, but I am nolybdenum because I defer.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.460
But you wanted something else.

54:46.460 --> 54:49.180
Look, I think I'm mostly happy with that.

54:49.180 --> 54:51.820
And if it's not sexy then, no, I'm not sexy.

54:51.820 --> 54:53.700
What can I say?

54:53.700 --> 54:57.140
But I do think that there's a division of cognitive labor.

54:57.140 --> 54:59.740
So whenever we do almost anything,

54:59.740 --> 55:03.060
including crossing the street, there

55:03.060 --> 55:06.580
are different jobs that are associated with different people.

55:06.580 --> 55:09.900
And our perspective and our knowledge base is tiny.

55:09.900 --> 55:12.340
And yet things get done.

55:12.340 --> 55:16.140
We build communities like psychoanalytic communities,

55:16.140 --> 55:18.300
and we build iPhones, and we get to the moon

55:18.300 --> 55:21.380
because there's a lot of different expertise that's

55:21.380 --> 55:24.100
brought to bear on all the things that we do.

55:24.100 --> 55:26.180
So that's really the idea.

55:26.180 --> 55:29.540
And it would be useful to think about people like craftspeople

55:29.540 --> 55:32.260
in addition to people that work on ideas and groups,

55:32.260 --> 55:35.700
like even specific laboratory techniques

55:35.700 --> 55:37.580
or specific music techniques.

55:37.580 --> 55:42.140
Or because I spent five years with a great master

55:42.140 --> 55:44.580
and the physical misdirection.

55:44.580 --> 55:47.140
And there was no way to learn those ideas quickly.

55:47.140 --> 55:49.500
And now what's really strange is because of YouTube,

55:49.500 --> 55:51.820
people assume that they can learn that kind of physical stuff

55:51.820 --> 55:52.780
faster.

55:52.780 --> 55:56.940
And it actually did take five years of rigorous training.

55:56.940 --> 56:00.900
And then several years just contemplating that.

56:00.900 --> 56:03.540
So it seems like there's different levels

56:03.540 --> 56:05.580
of those communities of knowledge.

56:05.580 --> 56:09.540
And it seems like you could, as you did in the book,

56:09.540 --> 56:13.700
but there's also you could find more extremes.

56:13.700 --> 56:17.180
One of my favorite examples is a guy, George Bassaco,

56:17.180 --> 56:19.260
who's been on previous panels, who

56:19.260 --> 56:22.260
is a master panel conservator at the Met.

56:22.260 --> 56:24.420
And he did a 12-year apprenticeship

56:24.420 --> 56:26.060
under very interesting circumstances.

56:26.060 --> 56:29.860
And the knowledge that he has is just extraordinary.

56:29.860 --> 56:31.700
His sense, a whole sense of time has changed.

56:34.300 --> 56:35.580
I'm dying to see an example.

56:39.340 --> 56:40.340
One quick example?

56:40.340 --> 56:41.420
Oh, he is.

56:41.420 --> 56:41.940
All right.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.020
A quick turn.

56:43.020 --> 56:43.940
All right.

56:43.940 --> 56:45.540
We have a little paper bag here.

56:45.540 --> 56:50.380
So the idea is, how do we confirm ideas

56:50.380 --> 56:52.540
that when we're talking together,

56:52.540 --> 56:53.860
just like we're talking right now,

56:53.860 --> 56:56.980
we confirm or not confirm ideas that we're sharing.

56:56.980 --> 56:58.900
But when we're in a physical space,

56:58.900 --> 57:01.340
we actually start, oh, have a few?

57:01.340 --> 57:02.180
That's right.

57:02.180 --> 57:04.140
Ah.

57:04.140 --> 57:06.820
So I just wanted to teach you a quick magic trick

57:06.820 --> 57:10.820
so that you can feel these different ways of confirming.

57:10.820 --> 57:14.060
So specifically, I'll be focusing on not the ideas

57:14.060 --> 57:16.900
as we're confirming and not confirming here,

57:16.900 --> 57:19.740
but just a simple physical exercise.

57:19.740 --> 57:26.540
So the simple idea, this will look strange from certain angles,

57:26.540 --> 57:28.900
but we're, so I'm going to explain it,

57:28.900 --> 57:30.620
and then I'd love you to try it.

57:30.620 --> 57:35.180
The idea, so in any magic trick, there

57:35.180 --> 57:38.580
is basically a causal pattern that we want the audience to see

57:38.580 --> 57:41.540
and a causal pattern that we don't want the audience to see.

57:41.540 --> 57:43.060
And they might be apparent.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.860
They might be real.

57:44.860 --> 57:46.540
And because they're not all real,

57:46.540 --> 57:49.900
that means we can shift time in very interesting ways.

57:49.900 --> 57:52.820
So this is such a little experiment,

57:52.820 --> 57:55.380
and I'm going to expose this trick completely.

57:55.380 --> 57:57.260
It's a great clown trick, and it's something

57:57.260 --> 58:00.500
you can all do for your friends and relatives.

58:00.500 --> 58:01.020
You snap.

58:01.020 --> 58:02.300
If you can snap, it's easier.

58:02.300 --> 58:04.420
I can show you a method without that.

58:04.420 --> 58:06.620
And just wait one second.

58:06.620 --> 58:08.660
So what we're going to do is take a ball,

58:08.660 --> 58:12.180
throw it into the air, and catch the ball.

58:12.180 --> 58:14.740
So the whole idea is that we throw it up,

58:14.740 --> 58:17.140
but it's stand up quickly so you can.

58:17.140 --> 58:18.140
OK.

58:18.140 --> 58:19.140
OK.

58:19.140 --> 58:20.140
Like this?

58:20.140 --> 58:21.140
Like that?

58:21.140 --> 58:22.140
And.

58:22.140 --> 58:23.140
And like this?

58:23.140 --> 58:24.140
Right?

58:24.140 --> 58:25.140
Or like this?

58:25.140 --> 58:26.140
Or you can do it.

58:26.140 --> 58:27.140
And if you can.

58:27.140 --> 58:28.140
OK.

58:28.140 --> 58:31.140
And I really, I just try to get that.

58:31.140 --> 58:32.140
Right.

58:32.140 --> 58:38.140
So just try that for about 30 seconds, and try to catch the ball.

58:38.140 --> 58:45.140
In the bag so that it looks and feels right.

58:45.140 --> 58:46.140
I can't get a good snap.

58:46.140 --> 58:47.140
You can.

58:47.140 --> 58:48.140
I don't think I'm going to do this for a while.

58:48.140 --> 58:49.140
Sorry.

58:49.140 --> 58:50.140
You don't snap?

58:50.140 --> 58:51.140
OK.

58:51.140 --> 58:52.140
Sorry.

58:52.140 --> 58:53.140
I'm not.

58:53.140 --> 58:54.140
I'm not.

58:54.140 --> 58:55.140
I'm not.

58:55.140 --> 58:56.140
I'm not.

58:56.140 --> 58:57.140
I'm not.

58:57.140 --> 58:58.140
I'm not.

58:58.140 --> 58:59.140
I'm not.

58:59.140 --> 59:00.140
I'm not.

59:00.140 --> 59:01.140
I'm not.

59:01.140 --> 59:02.140
I'm not.

59:02.140 --> 59:03.140
I'm not.

59:03.140 --> 59:04.140
I'm not.

59:04.140 --> 59:05.140
I'm not.

59:05.140 --> 59:06.140
I'm not.

59:06.140 --> 59:07.140
I'm not.

59:07.140 --> 59:09.140
I'm not going to do this.

59:09.140 --> 59:10.140
You're feeling.

59:10.140 --> 59:11.140
You been it.

59:11.140 --> 59:12.140
That's good.

59:12.140 --> 59:13.140
That's that's good.

59:13.140 --> 59:14.140
I see.

59:14.140 --> 59:15.140
You figured it out.

59:15.140 --> 59:16.140
I figured it out.

59:16.140 --> 59:17.140
I figured it out.

59:17.140 --> 59:18.140
I had a.

59:18.140 --> 59:19.140
Find that amygdala.

59:19.140 --> 59:20.140
I see.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.140
Just like that.

59:21.140 --> 59:22.140
Give it a good shot.

59:22.140 --> 59:23.140
I see.

59:23.140 --> 59:24.140
You throw the ball at it.

59:24.140 --> 59:25.140
And then, you can't do it.

59:25.140 --> 59:26.140
Then throw the amygdala.

59:26.140 --> 59:27.660
That sounds like the ball land.

59:27.660 --> 59:28.660
OK.

59:28.660 --> 59:29.620
So that's the first step.

59:29.620 --> 59:33.420
Did anybody have the feeling that they didn't do that so well?

59:33.420 --> 59:34.460
OK.

59:34.460 --> 59:36.460
And this is an amazing thing.

59:36.460 --> 59:38.460
When we're in the physical world,

59:38.460 --> 59:40.460
we have different ways of confirming.

59:40.460 --> 59:43.460
So we have ideas about what it should look like,

59:43.460 --> 59:44.460
and you can all feel that.

59:44.460 --> 59:46.460
It might not even be verbal.

59:46.460 --> 59:48.460
You might not be able to put all the details

59:48.460 --> 59:50.460
into a drawing for a researcher.

59:50.460 --> 59:52.460
But when it's right,

59:52.460 --> 59:55.460
how many of you got, when you nailed it a couple times,

59:55.460 --> 59:59.460
you get that feeling of that felt good, that felt right?

59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.460
And we're like machines.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:03.460
We have these incredible powers of making it like,

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.460
I'd love to see you work in the lab on the Epleasure,

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.460
like back when you were like digging in.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.460
Because when we get into that physical space,

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.460
we're actually in a different part of ourselves

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.460
that's really hard to remember in these conversations.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.460
So then we're going to do one more step,

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.460
and then go back to the other kind of confirmation.

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.460
But now I want you to confirm socially.

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.460
So turn to the person next to you,

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.460
and then throw a ball to them,

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460
and then have them throw the ball back to you.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:34.460
Share a ball, an invisible ball, with your neighbor.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.460
Okay, just try to figure out.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.460
Learn something.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.460
I'm going to catch some of it.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.460
I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo, and I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.460
I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo, and I'm going to do a yuck-a-doo.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.460
Okay.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.460
Now, just keep it from being all that good.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.460
Yeah, I'm going to grab it and try to make it.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.460
I can say it's too unashinkful.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.460
You're going to go home to see it.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.460
No, no, no.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.460
Good.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.460
I'm going to do a reason for the opposite.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.460
Exactly.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.460
Excellent.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.460
All right.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.460
All right.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.460
You've done it.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.460
All right.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.460
Okay.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.460
Oh!

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.460
Oh!

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.460
Oh!

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.460
What's that?

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.460
No.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.460
I, I, I, I failed.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:16.460
So that's just, that's an example of,

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.460
of different kinds that we can...

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.460
I've been a lot.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:21.460
I've been a lot.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.460
I've been a lot.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460
I've been a lot on B.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.460
I've been a lot on B.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.460
I like to apologize to the entire panel.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.460
Well, and we're learning something.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.460
The other thing that we're learning is,

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.460
when we engage physically and socially,

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.460
it's really fun.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.460
I was just at Columbia, walking down the street,

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:47.460
and there's a new game store where you go in and people are playing games.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460
It's electric.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.460
You go in and you just see what we just all felt.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.460
When we play together, we bond and we have this kind of collective knowledge,

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.460
and it's almost instant.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.460
It's, it's amazing.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.460
We don't death to instantiate this in all kinds of verbal description,

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.460
but you can feel it almost immediately.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.460
Anyway, that's the idea.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.460
Nice.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.460
Thank you.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460
You have another?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.460
Yeah.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.460
What is this?

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.460
Another example.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:16.460
Sure, whatever you want.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.460
Dandy was having fun.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.460
Okay.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.460
You're a chip.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.460
Quick card trick.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:22.460
No.

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.460
Okay.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.460
Okay.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:25.460
Okay.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.460
Opening for questions.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:29.460
Okay.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:38.460
You just have to vote in the speaker.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.460
Just ask your question.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.460
Yes.

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.460
I would like your comments on pluralistic ignorance.

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.460
I think it's relevant here.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.460
If you want me to read a definition, I can.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460
Okay.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:52.460
It's in social psychology.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:57.460
Pluralistic ignorance is a situation where a majority of group members privately reject

01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:03.460
a norm, but incorrectly assume that most others accept it and therefore go along with it.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:08.460
It's also described as no one believes, but everyone thinks that everyone believes.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:13.460
In short, it's a bias about a social group held by a social group.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.460
I'd like to comment about the ignorance that's going to be relevant.

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.460
It is relevant.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:25.460
It's a powerful phenomenon, especially these days.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:32.460
I really believe that it falls right out of the kind of analysis I was proposing earlier,

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:38.460
where people sense of understanding comes from the sense of understanding that others have.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:45.460
If there's this norm that says, we as a group believe x, then even if most of the group

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:50.460
believe x, you're going to have this sense of understanding that x is true.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.460
And people don't know about it.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.460
And people don't know about it.

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:54.460
Right.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:59.460
So the only way to know about it is to sort of have a vote, is to have a public open discussion

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.460
about whether people do in fact accept x.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:12.460
And that's why the liberty of forums are so important, right?

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:17.460
And that's why we bring this kind of knowledge to make it public.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.460
I think people are afraid to go against the norm, and therefore don't know about what's going to be the debate.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:23.460
Absolutely.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.460
I couldn't agree more.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.460
Go ahead.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:33.460
My question is, why did people evolve this way with the seemingly error-prone system?

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:40.460
And what does the panel think of the argument of theory of reasoning that says that the reason

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:45.460
is that reasoning wasn't developed to be right, but was to win arguments?

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:52.460
So you're referring to the Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber theory of argumentation.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.460
Good.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:05:00.460
I mean, I think it makes a lot of sense.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.460
Why?

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.460
We evolved in groups, right?

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.460
And there's always been a division of cognitive labor.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:14.460
We have our own little specialties, and we take positions, and by virtue of having group discussion,

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:17.460
you're going to have multiple positions put forward.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:23.460
I think the one thing that that theory gets wrong is the notion that we spend a lot of time arguing.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:30.460
I think philosophers spend a lot of time arguing, but I think most people spend their time telling stories.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:41.460
I think we live in a really perilous time where we have these communities of experts that are

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.460
driven and we're not speaking to each other.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:50.460
And to some extent, I wonder to what extent you believe that the sort of post-modern concept of truth

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:55.460
that we all studied in college, I certainly did, but everything is socially constructed,

01:05:55.460 --> 01:06:04.460
and that there's no way to get between language and its object, and that in essence, truth is malleable,

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:13.460
has contributed to the world we're living in today, which we can call post-truth, where there is no reality testing.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:19.460
That's a very important observation and question.

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:28.460
One of the things I keep telling some of my journalist friends is I'd really like them to study where Kalya and Conway went to school,

01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:34.460
and what courses she took, because I find it very hard to believe that somebody could get on national TV

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:44.460
and use the notion of an alternative fact without this having been validated for her by various post-modernist professors coming down the line.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:52.460
This thing you have to understand, this idea that there is no such thing as the truth, but the truth is only perspectival,

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.460
and so there can be alternate truths and alternate facts.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:01.460
This is something before it was championed by the extreme right, was championed by the left,

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:07.460
and it's been orthodoxy in universities and social sciences and the humanities for the last 40 years.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:15.460
There is no doubt that this has had a follow-on effect, because these kids go, they graduate, they go into civil service,

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:26.460
they go into government, and suddenly you're seeing them use it in some of the most dangerous possible ways to rebut

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:35.460
climate change science, to rebut even size of an inauguration crowd, by simply appealing to the idea that everybody has their own truth.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:42.460
So I completely agree with you, I think this has been the root of a lot of evil, and it originated with the left,

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:48.460
and is migrated to the right for obvious reasons, and that is that relativism about truth is symmetric.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:56.460
If it can be used by the left, as it were to insulate people from criticisms from the right, it can also be turned around and used the other way.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.460
So...

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:06.460
I'm a psychiatrist with a particular interest in the science of spirituality, and I wanted to ask you today,

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:12.460
we're talking about cognitive illusions, and how by virtue of being human we often fall prey to these cognitive illusions.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:19.460
And I wanted your thoughts in particular on the idea of consciousness, because there's a paradigm shift happening very slowly

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:26.460
from the materials point of view where the brain creates consciousness to a point of view where consciousness creates the brain,

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:31.460
where consciousness is primary, and I'm curious what the points of view are on that.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:45.460
I think several of us just don't accept your premise that things are developing that way.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.460
I've nothing to say.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:09:00.460
I mean, I think people are starting to start to understand that I was trying to study now,

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:07.460
under what circumstances material becomes conscious, and you can easily imagine experiments that were allowed to explore the...

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:14.460
I take an image of view and show it to Daphne very tangently.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.460
She will perceive it on some level, but she won't be consciously aware of it.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.460
If I show the same image for a longer period of time, she will be aware of it.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:33.460
If you now do imaging experiments under those two circumstances, you see with the brief exposure, only the temporal lobe is activated,

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:41.460
and that with a longer exposure, the information propagates the other areas of the brain and is utilized effectively by it.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:48.460
So one component of moving from unconscious consciousness is the information becomes available to large areas of the brain.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:54.460
They can then use it effectively, but this is a very early primitive understanding of a component of consciousness.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.460
Simple example.

01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:05.460
And I also think thinking more clearly about selectional processes in nature is helpful, so that it doesn't fit into this either or category.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:15.460
And I also really love some of the experiments by Olaf Blanka at EPFL, where in terms of social consciousness approach that you might like.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:23.460
One of the really interesting things that has been, you know, around since Freud, and Ernst Chris was very much interested is

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.460
to what degree there is easy communication between unconscious and conscious processes.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:36.460
You know, Chris's idea of regression in the service of the ego that is part of creativity is having easy access to one's unconscious processes.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.460
And to some degree, I don't know whether this is what you were talking about before you go home and you think about something and boom,

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:49.460
or all of a sudden it comes to you in a moment of relaxation. So that may involve something like that. It will be very interesting to understand exactly how that occurs.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.460
Thank you.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:11:03.460
So my question is, is there a clear distinction between what we believe and what we know, and if there is, then what is it?

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:07.460
You may ask him, he has the answer to that one.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:11.460
That's it.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:12.460
Any?

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:18.460
You know, it really depends whether you're a psychologist or a philosopher. I mean, I...

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:23.460
No.

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:32.460
You know, we use the word knowledge for a belief that happens to be true. You know, that's the condition for the use of the word.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:43.460
If you want to be precise about the terminology, the belief itself as we seem to be agreeing around the table, the belief is the subjective state is actually the same.

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:49.460
And the question that separates belief from knowledge is whether it's true or not.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:12:00.460
Yeah, I mean, I would also add the component of justification. So, you know, you can have a belief that's based on a punch, or guess,

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:08.460
which may or may not be true. So, but we wouldn't call that knowledge. You know, suppose you think, I'm going to win the lottery.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:15.460
You know, and then you blow and blow, you do win the lottery, but you had zero reason to believe that. It's not like it was rigged in your favor.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:19.460
We wouldn't say he knew that he was going to win the lottery, you know, or if you do...

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.460
Sometimes we do so. Subscript it. Subscript it.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:30.460
All of this is just... It really is terminology. That is, we can... We know how to make the distinctions between the notions that we think are important,

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:40.460
and then we use the words to make sure that we express ourselves. So, there's belief, there is justified belief, belief that is really based on some good evidence that you're aware of.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:47.460
And then there is justified belief that have also true. We reserve the term knowledge for the thing that has all three properties.

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:55.460
So, I can believe that there may be extraterrestrial beings, but I can't say that I know that there are.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:00.460
Right. You can't because there may be, but you can't say it because you don't have evidence.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.460
That's what he said. So, yeah. Okay, thank you.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:08.460
So, let me... That is clearly how philosophers make the distinction.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:18.460
Let me hypothesize that psychologists use a more sort of ordinary language while making the distinction, which is really just a degree of consensus.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:25.460
Right. So, if there are very few people who also have that thing, then we call it a belief.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.460
Whereas if everybody agrees, then we call it knowledge.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:35.460
You know, the most... This is known as the notion of a widely accepted claim.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:41.460
Okay. It's widely accepted within the community. And in fact, most people, they don't only conflate that with knowledge.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:46.460
They conflate it with truth. So, you know, people say...

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.460
Right. So, that's why you get...

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.460
That's all we have.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.460
Even in journalism, yes. This is a crucial error.

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:59.460
This is why you get in journalists, for instance, they say, is evolution a fact or is it just a theory?

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:06.460
Now, that's a very weird question for a philosopher, but it's not if you think by fact you mean widely accepted claim.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.460
So, you're asking, is this a widely accepted claim or is it just an opinion that some people have?

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:20.460
That makes sense. But there are very strong reasons for not conflating widely accepted claim with truth and widely accepted claim with knowledge.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:24.460
Okay. I can give you the reasons, but...

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:31.460
As I say, at the end of the day, this is merely keeping the terminology clear. We know the distinctions.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:40.460
The word intuition is interesting in this context because the word intuition is frequently defined as knowing without knowing why you know.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.460
Right.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:49.460
You know, that's the standard definition of intuition that you find. And I, you know, I find that very difficult to accept.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:15:01.460
And I suppose this is true for everybody around the table, but it is a very widely accepted notion that you can know without knowing what you know.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:08.460
And that there is a subjective state of knowing without knowing what you know.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:13.460
And this is very common in everyday language. And it's quite powerful.

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:26.460
And in part, when psychologists use the terminology that you were objecting to, I think, when we use that terminology, it's influenced by that.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:31.460
That knowing is really a subjective state.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.460
So, I hope my question will be a good follow-up on this.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:40.460
Because the thing I think you didn't really mention is that it fascinates me.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:54.460
It's the human's capacity to actually sort between what you, I mean, what you describe as like concrete empirical knowledge and that other domain of knowledge where you extrapolate, project, trust others.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:16:09.460
I find it fascinating, for instance, that the member of a tribe who knows that there are spirits behind any leaf or tree or river, when they want to make a boat, they know they have to carve a tree a particular way

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.460
so that it floats. They don't confuse the two domains.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:22.460
Those who build the cathedral, who believe that angel were holding the world, they knew the equation so that the walls of the cathedral would stand.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:36.460
And even today, the people who think that the Trump supporters who think that a wall is going to start Mexican rapists to enter the United States, they know when their car breaks that they have to operate on a different mode.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:53.460
So, behind those two domains of knowing that seems to be pretty universal, don't you think there is a human capacity to actually, in most cases, orient ourselves in a pretty accurate way?

01:16:53.460 --> 01:17:03.460
For one thing, if you're in the physical world and you make a boat that doesn't float, you find out really quickly it doesn't float.

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:22.460
What you're pointing out, and again, this will be controversial among the psychologists, is that there is a much greater use of reason, operative guiding people, than sometimes they're given credit with.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:35.460
And this shows up in these small ways. It shows up in countless ways in which we navigate the world, including reaching for the bottle in the right way, because that's part of knowledge, it's part of perceptual knowledge.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:39.460
And then, of course, your boat example is a more sophisticated example of the same thing.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:49.460
So, you're absolutely right, there are huge domains of behavior that's simply taken for granted, where people operate in completely rational ways.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:18:01.460
And then, they sort of quarantined that off from areas which are less constrained by evidence, where they believe what they wish to believe, rather than what is justified.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:07.460
My question specifically was, do you think there is a psychological function? Like I'm like really talking science here.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.460
Oh, I guess it seems to me that...

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.460
Oh, the psychological function is obvious.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:16.460
Because I say you'll drown if you build the boat the wrong way. So...

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:30.460
So, I understood your last question differently. I thought you were asking whether it's possible to be accurate, whether you can always know whether your theories about what's going on are right or wrong.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:42.460
In these two domains, there is a surprising wisdom behind where people know actually when they can afford one domain of knowledge and audio.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.460
So, can I just make a quick observation about that?

01:18:45.460 --> 01:19:11.460
George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Preface to His Play St. Joan in 1924. He argued that the people who followed Joan of Arc because of her ability to speak to archangels and prophets, that those people were no less rational and no less correct in their behavior than the soldiers who followed the generals in World War I.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:20.460
Because in both cases, people were operating based on faith. Faith that the people who were leading them knew what they were doing.

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:32.460
That the weapons that they had constructed were going to work. That there was at the time and even more so today, a science that we can't possibly understand.

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:41.460
So, when people are pressing buttons to shoot people or drop bombs today, they don't understand the technology. Very few people understand the technology.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:49.460
So invariably, we have to rely on faith. And invariably, I think, therefore, there's going to be a kind of uncertainty.

01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:53.460
This is very dangerous. This is very dangerous.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:20:03.460
Well, I don't know if it's dangerous. I think it's accurate.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:07.460
I interpreted the question in a slightly different way.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:25.460
It's about different ways of knowing and that they can coexist. And very simply from my neuroscience perspective, cognitive neuroscience perspective on this, that's true. We know scientifically that we know things in a lot of different ways.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:39.460
And our assumption from our discipline is that the reason for it, if there is one, is that you need to know things in many different ways and that ultimately an action will be driven by one system or presentation rather than another.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:46.460
But that's important because you don't know in the moment what kind of knowledge will be the most useful.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:58.460
But what that does create is a system of sort of parallels, slightly misaligned kinds of ways of knowing that might add robustness and resilience, but of course, add complication as well.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:05.460
Definitely. Maybe you can elaborate on the separation between cognitive knowledge and motor knowledge.

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.460
Right. That's such a good example of a book that is trying to be.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:22.460
So one of the kind of famous well-known examples in the brain are the different separate circuits for remembering what Eric and I spoke about at our last meeting last week.

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:34.460
And there's a very separate way of knowing what remembering what, let's say, the content of the information and its flavor and a separate way of knowing how to open the door when someone comes to visit you.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.460
And those are so separated out that you can have patience with damage to different parts of the brain.

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.460
And each of those different ways of knowing can either be independently impaired or intact.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:52.460
Right. So these are kind of everyday examples of this multiplicity of systems of knowledge.

01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.460
Thank you, Danny.

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.460
Hi.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:01.460
I'm a bit shorter.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:10.460
My question has to do with before earlier when all of you were talking about kind of where we get our knowledge from.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.460
How do we decide what can be trusted?

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:30.460
So I was wondering if any of you could comment on kind of the trustworthiness of or how much trust can we put in empirical knowledge when so much of our empirical studies are so to speak weird.

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:36.460
So Western educated industrialized.

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:44.460
Can't remember what the other one is, but Democratic and oh, wealthy, well rich.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:51.460
Yeah.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:23:02.460
Just a comment on the question in a sense. I think there are two. I thought you were headed one place and then you ended up somewhere else, but I think they're both maybe relevant.

01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:12.460
And one is first amongst us. We assume that the empirical message of scientific inquiry is the way forward and it has to be done well.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:20.460
And I think really the rest of your question was, well, how do we know we're doing it well and that it's relevant for understanding humanity more broadly given the constraints that we're doing.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:26.460
The constraints of the research people like us do. Is that correct?

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:31.460
Yeah. Well, because you guys were just commenting on thinking you know.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:44.460
And how do we get our actual empirical evidence to truly reflect not just what we think we know and not just necessarily reconfirming what we already know, but actually taking it a step further.

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:55.460
Yeah. So, you know, I don't think I don't think maybe others have something more interesting to say. I think I can say we do the best we can with the science we do and we can be doing better and their efforts towards that.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.460
I don't know if Danny's.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:07.460
I mean, you know, we think there's not a consensus in the scientific community. So, you know, one of us may come up with some idea. Somebody else in the field may have an opposite idea may challenge you.

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:16.460
So there are challenges going on in the scientific community all the time to give you certain more confidence in certain ways of thinking than others.

01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:36.460
I had a recent experience that I think is relevant to the question. I was, I got an email from two scientists who wanted to talk to me about climate change and how to educate people on the truth of climate change.

01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:47.460
And we arranged for lunch and we met for lunch. And one of them is a member of the National Academy. Another one with the head of the New York Academy of Sciences.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:58.460
And their climate change deniers, which just never occurred to me. And they want to find ways of educating people in the truth.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:12.460
They can. And what would happen, you know, was that I was challenged. It's actually quite interesting in terms of the science, what you would advise people like those to do.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:23.460
And, you know, I suggested that they published what we call an adversarial collaboration, that they tried to have a conversation, public conversation with opponents.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:34.460
But, but I was challenged by is why do I believe in climate change? And of course, I believe in climate change for exactly the same reason that many other people don't believe in climate change.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:41.460
Because I believe in people who believe in climate change. And that's, that's it. There's really nothing beyond that.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:57.460
I don't even, you know, the sense that I understand climate change. I know that I don't understand enough to win an argument with somebody who doesn't believe. Like those two scientists who are telling me that carbon dioxide is a beautiful thing.

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:05.460
But is it really, is it really as circular as that, you know, that I believe in climate change because I believe in people who believe in climate change?

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:12.460
I mean, there are, no, I hope that there are some people at the end of the chain who know what they're doing.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:24.460
I understand I'm saying even in your own case, is it quite as vacuous as that? Isn't it that they, the people that you trust have other qualities that make you trust them more?

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:28.460
And therefore, since they're trustworthy in general, they're also trustworthy on this particular topic.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:35.460
That's completely circular. I mean, I trust people who engage these and members of the National Academy.

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:43.460
I believe basically in climate change, if we ask ourselves, because the National Academy of Sciences in its majority believes in climate change.

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:51.460
And I believe in the National Academy of Sciences. You know, that's, this is not a very strong argument for believing climate change.

01:26:51.460 --> 01:27:00.460
You can believe in the notion of things. I don't think that's right, because those are, you know, you can keep pushing the question further and further back.

01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:05.460
Suppose somebody were as skeptic about admission to the National Academy and so on and so forth.

01:27:05.460 --> 01:27:08.460
Suppose one were as skeptic about empirical method in general. I agree.

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:12.460
Once they've pushed it that far, you may have trouble giving answers.

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:21.460
But the proximate reason why you believe in climate change or why you believe that smoking causes cancer, why you believe any of these things that you yourself haven't done studies for,

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:27.460
is you have good reason to trust the people you trust and not nearly because of their views about that particular topic.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:32.460
It's a much more general reason to be trusting of that particular body.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.460
That's true on the other side as well.

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:38.460
And that's true in communist, that's true in totalitarian societies.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:43.460
What is believed that the end of the train isn't true?

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:55.460
That's a very radical skepticism, which means that if you keep pushing it back, you will reach a point where your answers are circular, but it does matter where they get to be circular.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:28:07.460
I mean, I take Paul to be saying that you believe that members of the National Academy of Science are telling the truth about climate change because they also were able to send people to the ground.

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:10.460
They were able to send people to the moon, right?

01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:15.460
And they were also able to build incredible electronic equipment, etc.

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:24.460
So there's a network of knowledge that they accept and are part of, and that's good reason to believe them, even if you don't know anything about climate change.

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.460
But you can still be skeptical, I guess.

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.460
Yes, I mean, skepticism.

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:37.460
I made those two scientists for lunch, and it didn't change my belief about climate change at all.

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:44.460
And you know, it's not that I was shaken because here are two reputable scientists who don't believe in climate change.

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:49.460
I stayed with my belief, and that I think is very common.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:56.460
Sure, because we now 97% of scientists believe in climate change.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:00.460
I think my question may follow on this one.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:15.460
We are at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in society, and it would seem from the discussion so far that everybody has accepted the notion that Dr. Candel, that psychoanalysis is simply passé and unscientific.

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.460
No, no, no, no, no.

01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:21.460
I'm saying that question is never been examined.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.460
Well, I would like to challenge you on that.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:30.460
First of all, my dissertation over 50 years ago was an empirical study using subliminal...

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:39.460
I'm a psychologist using subliminal perception into kistoscopes, and we found results, but it's not just from 50 some odd years ago.

01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:48.460
If you Google psychoanalytic empirical research, you will get over 500,000 hits, not all of them of the same quality.

01:29:48.460 --> 01:30:00.460
But the late Benjamin Blatt at Yale, Howard Chevron at Michigan, and others I can aim, have been doing long-term studies and at your own university.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:10.460
There are studies going on that are empirical studies that seem to support the idea that I like you.

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:20.460
I'm a scientific person, I believe, in the scientific values that have been discussed here, but not in the exclusion of psychoanalysis,

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:30.460
nor in the diminution of the empirical... non-clinical empirical research efforts that have supported it for over 50 years,

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:36.460
not in any way conclusively and showing many limitations, but it's a science.

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.460
I guess that's more of a statement than a question.

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.460
Statement of faith.

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:50.460
I don't have a question per se, but I do...

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.460
Quick comment.

01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:02.460
In terms of the use of religion, religion is defined in the dictionary as belief in the transcendental or metaphysical being.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:16.460
I think the way the word was thrown around here was inappropriate or misused, and I just wanted to make that comment.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:31.460
The other thing about animal sentience, there have been over 2,500 studies to date on the fact that many animals from elephants at the high end to fish,

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:40.460
certain fish at the low end, if there is a low end, have indeed...

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.460
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:51.460
That sentience has been found unequivocally amongst non-human beings.

01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:53.460
That's all I have.

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.460
Sentience has been found in animals.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:02.460
No disagreements.

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:15.460
I'm a general internist, and I was thinking as you were talking about how we know things about a case that I was confronted with,

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:21.460
and what I really wanted to ask about is how do we communicate between each other when knowledge...

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:29.460
...when what we know is different, and I saw a patient, she was 19, and she had something called conversion disorder, at least I think,

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:33.460
where she knew she couldn't move her arm.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:40.460
And I can take some pictures and look, and I know, at least I think, that she can't move her arm.

01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:48.460
And what I think we're all confronted with now, and I think she can move her arm and she thinks she can't move her arm,

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:51.460
is, well, now what do we do to? How do we speak to each other?

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.460
How do we try to bridge that gap?

01:32:53.460 --> 01:33:02.460
And I think that... I wonder what the thoughts are of this group of how do we bridge that gap and talk to each other.

01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:06.460
Good morning, I'm sorry for analysis.

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:08.460
So can I probe you a little bit?

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:09.460
Yes, sir.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:13.460
So did you engage with her and try to use the scientific method?

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:20.460
So I did what I think many of us would do, and I went to my mentor, and I said, you have more experience with this than I do?

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.460
What do I do with this person?

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:30.460
And he told me, he said, and I guess maybe this is another type of religion, it became one of my religions, sort of, was to say,

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:34.460
just tell her, you think it's going to get better.

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:36.460
You don't have to run.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.460
I see.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:45.460
The different belief systems that are causing this block between you and say, I don't know why you can't move your arm exactly.

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.460
I can't see on a picture, but I think it could get better.

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:51.460
And so that's what I did, and it didn't get better.

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:52.460
I see.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.460
But as I noticed...

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.460
So you didn't try showing her a video of herself moving her arm?

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.460
I did not.

01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:00.460
Or ask her to pick up a glass of water...

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:05.460
This gets to a little bit of the point that was raised before that I'm trying to have empathy.

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:09.460
To say, yes, I understand that you're having this problem.

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:14.460
And I believe that you believe that you can't move your arm.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:18.460
And so maybe we can move beyond it and talk about something else.

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.460
I don't know, but it wasn't solving the problem.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.460
It certainly wasn't solving the problem.

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:23.460
Thank you.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.460
You can tell a lot about a person by asking what's your favorite joke.

01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:33.460
Here's my favorite joke.

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:35.460
The rabbi is sitting in the kitchen...

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:37.460
Who's the leader's table?

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:42.460
And his wife is making soup.

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.460
There's a knock at the door.

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.460
The rabbi says, come in.

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.460
Who men come in?

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:48.460
They say, we have a business dispute.

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:49.460
Could you solve it?

01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:51.460
The rabbi says, sit down.

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:53.460
First man gives his story.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:56.460
The rabbi says, you're right.

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.460
Turns the second man.

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.460
Second man gives his story.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:01.460
You're right.

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:07.460
His wife throws down the soup spoon and says, how can he be right and he be right?

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:09.460
The rabbi says, you're right too.

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:22.460
So I've been doing analysis for, you know, 45 years in this hallowed institution.

01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:30.460
And when I was taught, originally, I was taught by people who did feel they had the revealed

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.460
truth.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:39.460
I think for the last 25 years, what I have been teaching is different.

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:42.460
And here's an example of a case.

01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:45.460
Ten years ago, a man came to see me.

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:47.460
He couldn't get a date.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:49.460
He couldn't hold down a job.

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:54.460
And he was really depressed about this.

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:57.460
Ten years later, he's married.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.460
Empirical fact.

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:05.460
I saw the birth, the marriage certificate.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:07.460
He's got two children.

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:08.460
Empirical fact.

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:11.460
I've seen pictures of them.

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:19.460
And he's got a job because that's how he can pay me at my exorbitant rate every month.

01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:26.460
So what I know is that all those changes have taken place.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:34.460
What I do not know and confess to this ignorance is how did it happen?

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:40.460
Is it because I thoroughly analyzed his edible complex, which I did?

01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:45.460
Is it because I analyzed his masochism, which I did?

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:53.460
Is it because I've treated him in a respectful, interested way for ten years, which I did?

01:36:53.460 --> 01:37:01.460
Is it some communication between our mutual unconsciousness that neither of us knows anything

01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:02.460
about?

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.460
So what I know is that the process works.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.460
And I have forty instances like this.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:17.460
What I don't know is how and why it works.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.460
How would one study that?

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.460
Sir, don't leave.

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.460
How do you know it works?

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.460
How would one study that?

01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:28.460
I don't know it works.

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.460
The process of therapy.

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:33.460
How would one study why it works?

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:36.460
I think it would be really hard.

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:40.460
I think you could study that it works.

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:49.460
One of the reasons I think that cognitive behavioral therapy works is the quality of the relationship

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:56.460
between the patient and the physician, because some people, they can do it and it really

01:37:56.460 --> 01:38:00.460
works, and other people, it falls flat on its face.

01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:09.460
I know an instance where a little girl was sent to a CBT after having had a dynamic therapist,

01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:16.460
and after about half a dozen sessions, she turned to the therapist and said, could we

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.460
talk about my family?

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:22.460
I think that's where the problem is.

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:29.460
I'd like to draw one distinction between CBT and what you described, that CBT is based

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:35.460
on controlled trials, where you take patients and some of them get treatment and others

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:40.460
don't get treatment, and you look at the level of improvement after a while.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:45.460
What you did not tell us, what you did not examine, were the possibility that the person

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:50.460
success in life and children and job and so on had nothing to do with you.

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:57.460
All the hypotheses that you mentioned were hypotheses that assumed that your interaction

01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:03.460
caused the changes in that person's life, and it's that assumption that many people question.

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.460
You're right, Toby.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.460
Thank you.

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:18.460
Thank you.

01:39:18.460 --> 01:39:28.460
Hi, I'm an undergrad studying neuroscience and philosophy at Columbia University, and my

01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:31.460
question concerns imagination.

01:39:31.460 --> 01:39:36.460
So Einstein, for example, when he was coming up with his theory of relativity, he had

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:41.460
this assumption that gravitational waves exist, and this was only proven, I mean, we only

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:45.460
detected gravitational waves a few years ago, and there was this leap of faith involved,

01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:51.460
and there was this imagination, he pushed boundaries, he pushed, he questioned and challenged

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:56.460
the scientific paradigms of his time, and my question is what is the role of imagination

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:02.460
and his knowledge, because I'm sure he knew that that was, the theory of relativity was

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:08.460
how the universe was worked or how the universe was composed.

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:15.460
Well, you know, first of all, he tried to publish a paper proving that gravitational

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:21.460
waves don't exist in the 1930s, so it was a consequence of his theory that they exist,

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:26.460
but in fact he thought it was a bad consequence that he tried to try to have a fallacious

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.460
argument for trying to show that didn't follow.

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:34.460
But the real, the question you're asking, I mean, there are these incredible creative

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:40.460
breakthroughs, and creativity in general is a very, very difficult thing to understand,

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:46.460
because what we understand, the way we understand things is to see what the principles are that

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:51.460
operate and how, when those principles are, when the mechanism is working correctly,

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:57.460
things follow from that, but creative breakthroughs precisely are things that break the rules,

01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:03.460
and so it is, I don't know if a theory, the psychologist should tell us what the latest

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:08.460
thinking is about creativity, but as far as I know, we're very much in the dark about that.

01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:15.460
I think this is an extreme example in any way, and a very beautiful one that I think of how we all do this all the time.

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.460
I think in many ways it's really kind of the essence of part of this conversation and very relevant,

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:25.460
which is both in the scientific realm, but in general, here we are talking about doubts and

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:31.460
suspicion and empirical data, we all feel very strongly about some of our ideas, right?

01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:38.460
And we have to get through the next grant cycle and study, and all the obstacles we face as scientists,

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:46.460
we have to feel strongly and have a lot of confidence in those ideas, and yet simultaneously we have to know that that's a little bit of an illusion

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:52.460
and keep pushing for it, and I think something that everybody has to do all the time,

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:57.460
to get up in the morning and to work hard at anything requires a strong sense of belief and confidence,

01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:05.460
and yet to do it in a way that's intelligent and cautious requires at the same time knowing that we might be wrong,

01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:10.460
and I really guess that this idea of multiple representations happening simultaneously.

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:16.460
Also, as time you have the feeling that this has worked before, this line of thought,

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:19.460
so it's likely to work again in the future if I run additional control,

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:25.460
so you have a little historical background with it, it gives you confidence in the fact that you're moving in the right direction.

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:32.460
But just one little historical correction, the confirmation for general relativity didn't just come now with the discovery of gravitational waves,

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:44.460
it came 1917 with the observation, the bending of, yeah, so it's not as though we've had this great confidence in general relativity for 80 years,

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:49.460
and suddenly with some slight confirmation, the confirmation came early on.

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:50.460
Thank you.

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:52.460
This question is a question.

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.460
Shirley Mueller, neurologist.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:43:01.460
A few questions ago, someone asked a question, and several of you interpreted it differently.

01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:04.460
This question was the same.

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:13.460
So this would be because of genetics, education, environment, how you interpreted the context, and so on.

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:19.460
Would this not get down to organism as you suggested?

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:30.460
And is not the real grain of salt, and what we're talking about today, which is fake knowledge versus illusion of knowing,

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:36.460
having to do basically with the organism in our brain processes?

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:42.460
You're looking at one of the neuroscientists on the panel, but I don't think anybody else would disagree.

01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:50.460
Even the psychoanalysts, right, it all comes down to brain mechanisms in the sense that it involves brain mechanisms,

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.460
not that that necessarily explains it.

01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:58.460
But I'd like to hear you discuss it more, because to me that was what was missing today, this concrete information.

01:43:58.460 --> 01:44:00.460
That's what I'm asking for.

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:04.460
Well, I could say a lot about the brain.

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:09.460
I'm not sure, I know how to answer that, and maybe Eric.

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:19.460
Well, I think one of the things that I think would benefit to feel the great deal, if there was more of a bridge between brain science and psychoanalysts.

01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:25.460
As I give you an example, there's a woman called Helen Mayberg, who's a neurologist actually.

01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:31.460
She's been interested in depression, and she's been able to localize regions with imaging that involve depression,

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:41.460
and then see to what degree there's a loss of those abnormalities when patients respond therapeutically, and she has tried different therapies.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.460
So there are beginnings in this direction.

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:51.460
So to take various kinds of psychiatric illnesses begin to identify the neuroanatomical substance, it's a very difficult problem.

01:44:51.460 --> 01:45:00.460
But to begin to do that, and to see which change with which kind of therapeutic approaches is clearly the next step in our field for the next 15, 20 years.

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:12.460
I think in addition to that, there's certainly a good amount of evidence into what's happening in the brain when you're creating some false memories, for example.

01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:21.460
So we actually know how that plays out, and it's only us from the outside who would call these things false memories, but connecting memories to each other.

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:29.460
We know more or less how the brain does that, how the brain sort of creates associations, and those are things, as we mentioned earlier, that are necessary for many aspects of behavior.

01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:42.460
I think this is just sort of one several examples of extreme consequences, but I think we actually know a fair amount about what's happening in the brain, and I think there's this very interesting disconnect between that level of understanding,

01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:48.460
and really being able to explain these phenomena at the level of society and know what to do about them.

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:50.460
So there's a lot of tension.

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:53.460
There were actually some cases in which one is beginning to do that.

01:45:53.460 --> 01:46:12.460
In the last 10 years, it's emerged that when people age, in addition to being susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, there's a milder form of memory disorder called euphemistically age-related memory loss, which is quite different from Alzheimer's and involves different regions of the brain.

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:21.460
You can develop animal models of that as well, and you can see where this occurs, and actually find that there are certain therapeutic approaches to it.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:43.460
For example, there is a hormone released from bone called osteocalcin, and osteocalcin reverses age-related memory loss, and you can show in an experimental animal that as they have age-related memory loss, if you now exercise them more, if you have them work their bones more by walking more, you can reverse that, and that's related to the amount of osteocalcin's produced.

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:53.460
And this may contributes to why people who exercise a lot as continued exercises age tend to do better in terms of their cognitive performance.

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:59.460
So we're beginning to get some clues from these combination of approaches that are useful.

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:02.460
You want to do a quick part trick?

01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:05.460
OK, sure.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:14.460
OK, one big... so... here we go.

01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:17.460
I want to learn how to do this. I want to leave today.

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:19.460
You should do it.

01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:20.460
No, no, no.

01:47:20.460 --> 01:47:22.460
I just happened to have a card to do that.

01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:31.460
Hold the cards in your hand, and if you would be so kind to just think of a card, and then change your mind a couple times.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:35.460
And think of another card. So this way you don't speak to him.

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460
Yeah, absolutely.

01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.460
Yeah, if you were.

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:41.460
Right? So think of one card and then change your mind a couple times to get past all bias.

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:47.460
And... we'll see if this works.

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:50.460
And then say the card out loud so we can all hear it.

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:51.460
Acesbade.

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:53.460
Exactly what I thought.

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:54.460
Seriously.

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.460
I swear.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:57.460
I really need that.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:47:58.460
I can do this.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.460
I can do this.

01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:01.460
I can do this.

01:48:01.460 --> 01:48:02.460
I can do this.

01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:03.460
I can do this.

01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:07.460
Boy, we'll go card it.

01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:12.460
By highest scientific accomplishment reading your mind.

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:14.460
Wait, it gets better.

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.460
Could you deal out cards right here?

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.460
And just... could you spell connemon?

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:21.460
Right?

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:22.460
With these cards.

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:25.460
So put a card down and it goes K.

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:29.460
So put a card down over there and spell K.

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:30.460
Or face down.

01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:33.460
It makes them more dramatic.

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:37.460
That's K. And then A.

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:41.460
H.

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.460
N.

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:48.460
E.

01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:49.460
M.

01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:50.460
M.

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:54.460
A.

01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:56.460
M.

01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.460
M.

01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:01.460
A.

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.460
M.

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:06.460
A.

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:09.460
M.

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:12.460
A.

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:15.460
M.

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.460
A.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:20.460
M.

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.460
A.

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.460
M.

01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:27.460
A.

01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:30.460
M.

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:38.460
A.

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.460
M.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460
A.

01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:44.460
A.

01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:46.460
M.

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:49.460
A.

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:52.460
A.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.460
I love Chinese artists, but I think you can also work with Marc.

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.460
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what things.

01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:30.460
How is he good?

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.460
I'm very good at stuff.

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.460
I have an idea.

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:38.460
I'm not wrong with the art.

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:40.460
Can we just say the class of hot?

01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.460
No, no, no.

01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.460
I think you can avoid your dessert play.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:47.460
Right down the park.

01:50:47.460 --> 01:50:50.460
So, there's a conference in the West,

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:52.460
it's like I'm in the older than I'm wearing.

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:54.460
Yeah, I'm myself.

01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:58.460
Either way, I was talking about you.

01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.460
How do you still go?

01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:02.460
Very good?

01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.460
I don't want to say the right way.
