00:06.320 --> 00:12.880
I introduce today's participants, let me tell you we'll be going from fear to

00:12.880 --> 00:21.080
happiness as of September 24th. Watch for further announcements on our website

00:21.080 --> 00:27.120

01:11.080 --> 01:17.920
Sorry, how are you gonna? No, I'm just gonna wait for you to say something. Go ahead.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.840
Okay, well I guess I'll start. So you know as a psychologist, turned into a

01:23.840 --> 01:29.280
neuroscientist of sorts. I think any kind of psychological question, whether

01:29.280 --> 01:35.360
you're approaching it in the brain or in behavior, always has to start from our

01:35.360 --> 01:39.800
introspections. I mean that's our only access to our mental processes and

01:39.800 --> 01:46.280
internal states and so forth. So you know without being able to introspect

01:46.280 --> 01:51.280
and formulate the idea that we have a line that we have something called

01:51.280 --> 01:58.600
consciousness, we couldn't possibly study that. So there's no way that an

01:58.600 --> 02:03.440
organism that doesn't have that capacity to look inside its own brain and have

02:03.440 --> 02:10.280
its own ideas and formulate those especially in verbal questions, statements

02:10.280 --> 02:16.880
like this that allows us to say okay I'm aware that I have a psychology, a mind,

02:16.880 --> 02:22.920
and that's somehow related to my body but also seems to have some kind of

02:22.920 --> 02:29.960
separate existence. All of that is only possible because of the kind of brain

02:29.960 --> 02:34.160
that we have and we don't know which other animals obviously have that because no

02:34.160 --> 02:39.680
other animal can tell us about this. So from the point of view of fear, we look

02:39.680 --> 02:44.680
into our brains and our minds and we say what is fear? How are we gonna study

02:44.680 --> 02:52.240
that in an animal or another person? And what we come up with is that you know we

02:52.240 --> 02:57.360
fear is a kind of experience we have that we're in danger. So therefore we can

02:57.360 --> 03:02.560
study what happens when an organism is in danger and learn something about fear.

03:02.560 --> 03:10.000
Now the way we observe scientifically the fear of another organism so to speak

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
is through its behavior or other reactions or responses. Obviously we

03:16.000 --> 03:23.080
can't go inside another person or another animal's mind. So when I study a rat and

03:23.080 --> 03:31.400
the rat is exposed to a threatening stimulus and it freezes, the question is

03:31.400 --> 03:38.840
what do we call that? For the last 30-something years, many of my colleagues

03:38.840 --> 03:45.400
have called that fear. But when I was talking about fear and many my colleagues

03:45.400 --> 03:50.240
as well, we weren't talking about fear as the conscious experience. We're talking

03:50.240 --> 03:55.040
about it as a kind of inner motivational state that connects

03:55.040 --> 03:59.760
stimuli with responses so that a rat is freezing or a human jumps back from a

03:59.760 --> 04:04.000
bus that's flying by before there where the bus is there and so forth. And when

04:04.000 --> 04:08.920
that happens we have these non-conscious systems that allow us to do this. At the

04:08.920 --> 04:13.880
same time when we look into our minds we both see ourselves jumping back and

04:13.880 --> 04:19.720
feeling afraid. So it all seems to be bundled together as one thing and that's

04:19.720 --> 04:24.360
why the most common idea about how fear is represented in the brain is that you

04:24.360 --> 04:28.560
have a kind of fear circuit or fear center that we've inherited from animals

04:28.560 --> 04:33.960
aside. There goes back to Darwin and perhaps even older and through the

04:33.960 --> 04:39.040
operation of that circuit we both respond to danger and feel fear. I mean

04:39.040 --> 04:43.600
that's the natural way to think about it. But as we begin to take these things

04:43.600 --> 04:47.360
apart, not so much in animal brains because we can't really make the

04:47.360 --> 04:53.520
distinction. But in the human brain we can begin to see that when we can create a

04:53.520 --> 04:59.360
threat by a conditioning process is expose the person to that threat and the

04:59.360 --> 05:04.040
person will then respond to the threat. But if we present that and the person

05:04.040 --> 05:07.280
will know the threat is there and so forth. But if we present that stimulus in a way

05:07.280 --> 05:12.200
that the person doesn't have conscious access to the stimulus, the person will

05:12.200 --> 05:16.240
still respond to the threat. So the heart will raise, the palms will sweat and so

05:16.240 --> 05:21.000
forth even though the person never saw the stimulus and claims to feel no fear.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.080
So fear can't be what's driving these responses that are controlled by this

05:27.080 --> 05:31.480
part of the brain that I work on called the amygdala. Fear is what happens when

05:31.480 --> 05:35.200
we become aware that our brain is responding in this kind of way and a

05:35.200 --> 05:41.560
lot of other things go into the creation of the fear as well. So this and you can

05:41.560 --> 05:45.840
study patients who have what's called blind sight where they're blind in the

05:45.840 --> 05:50.080
left side of space. You can present a threat there. You don't have to use any

05:50.080 --> 05:53.680
tricks or anything where it's presented very briefly. You can just present a

05:53.680 --> 05:58.880
threat to the rough visual field and if you're imaging the person the amygdala

05:58.880 --> 06:03.200
will be activated and the responses will be present but the person won't know the

06:03.200 --> 06:07.360
stimulus is there and won't feel anything. So and I'll cut it short now.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.840
So because of this kind, this and many other kinds of pieces of information, I

06:11.840 --> 06:17.720
come to the conclusion that it was really inappropriate to talk about fear

06:17.720 --> 06:22.280
when I was studying the rats' responses to threats. What I'd been studying is the

06:22.280 --> 06:27.080
operation of the defensive survival circuit that allows the rat or any

06:27.080 --> 06:32.520
other organism to detect and respond to danger and that can contribute to the

06:32.520 --> 06:36.560
feeling of fear but that is not one and the same as the feeling of fear. The

06:36.560 --> 06:41.000
feeling of fear instead I think is more of a kind of cortical process,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.040
neocortical process where information about the present stimulus, memories

06:46.040 --> 06:49.720
about what that stimulus is and what it means, schemas about what kinds of

06:49.720 --> 06:53.640
emotions those are associated with and so forth are integrated with the fact

06:53.640 --> 06:58.040
that say the amygdala is already being responding to the stimulus and all kinds

06:58.040 --> 07:01.800
of feedback is coming within the brain arousal and body feedback and so forth

07:01.800 --> 07:05.720
and all of that is integrated in working memory to give rise to the feeling of

07:05.720 --> 07:10.440
fear. So that's my view of things. What's the value of making that distinction?

07:10.440 --> 07:14.200
Well the value is that this is going to take you some more time is that okay?

07:14.200 --> 07:23.800
So the value of what it is for the past 50 years the pharmaceutical industry has

07:23.800 --> 07:30.920
been attempting to develop and anti-anxiety drugs and in 2010 last

07:30.920 --> 07:35.880
post-SmithKline and a couple of others began saying we can't do it. Nothing

07:35.880 --> 07:41.320
is happening. You know we're testing rats and mice in these chambers and giving

07:41.320 --> 07:46.120
them drugs that make them less timid, less behaviorally inhibited but when we

07:46.120 --> 07:49.960
give them to people it doesn't make them feel less fearful or anxious or not

07:49.960 --> 07:54.680
reliably or consistently. So what's wrong? Well the person that's a person

07:54.680 --> 08:01.400
with a social anxiety disorder on a SSRI is more likely to go to the party

08:01.400 --> 08:05.880
but still feel bad when they're there because it's not reducing the fear and

08:05.880 --> 08:10.200
anxiety at the party is just changing the inhibitory behavior about going to the

08:10.200 --> 08:13.720
party. So if we make this broad distinction between

08:13.720 --> 08:17.880
circuits that control these behavioral responses and circuits that generate

08:17.880 --> 08:24.200
these kinds of subjective feelings we can begin to ask questions about

08:24.200 --> 08:29.400
therapy and how it can be approached in a way that's more consistent with at

08:29.400 --> 08:33.560
least the way I think about how the brain is organized.

08:33.560 --> 08:39.720
Joe I think what you said is really crucial and delighted to hear you say it

08:39.720 --> 08:44.360
because being an analyst I believe the mind can be studied

08:44.360 --> 08:48.360
and also that the cerebral cortex in evolution

08:48.360 --> 08:54.280
is crucial and you have just outlined that salient fact

08:54.280 --> 08:58.840
that the brain in humans is complicated it's layered

08:58.840 --> 09:02.840
their levels their connections and many of the most

09:02.840 --> 09:09.240
interesting things about mental function are probably widely distributed circuits

09:09.240 --> 09:15.720
maybe even whole brain and that's crucial because it may allow us to begin to

09:15.720 --> 09:22.520
correlate cerebral neurophysiology with what analysts call meaning

09:22.520 --> 09:25.720
and meaning is a tricky thing because one it's mind

09:25.720 --> 09:28.840
number two it may be unconscious as well as conscious

09:28.840 --> 09:34.280
number three big point it's symbolically presented

09:34.280 --> 09:38.360
it's symbolically represented and when that happens

09:38.360 --> 09:41.880
something's happening in the brain both in word presentations and thing

09:41.880 --> 09:46.120
presentations that stores this meaning for us

09:46.120 --> 09:52.120
but it isn't mind it is brain and as analysts we deal with very

09:52.120 --> 09:57.080
paradoxical fear which is called usually anxiety

09:57.080 --> 10:00.040
fear being something that has happened or about to happen

10:00.040 --> 10:04.440
anxiety being something you worry about that it might happen

10:04.440 --> 10:08.840
and the anxieties that we look at as analysts may be unconscious in their

10:08.840 --> 10:14.280
contents are often paradoxical patient fear what is not

10:14.280 --> 10:18.520
not just for most people or even more so they fear

10:18.520 --> 10:22.200
what is positively reinforcing for most people

10:22.200 --> 10:26.760
and so we have to understand not the fear or the

10:26.760 --> 10:31.640
or the the um the affect generated but the affect meaning the affect

10:31.640 --> 10:37.160
contents mark solm's is here which takes me back to

10:37.160 --> 10:43.480
makali makarly and hobsan who when i was a young tad just as a a new

10:43.480 --> 10:47.720
attending out of residency they gave a grand rounds at psychiatric

10:47.720 --> 10:51.640
institute big news the dream has no meaning why

10:51.640 --> 10:55.640
because the generator of the dream is in the midbrain

10:55.640 --> 10:59.640
i got up and dared to say you know now three years old i saw my first movie

10:59.640 --> 11:03.560
snow white in the seven doors in the movie i turned to my mom and said mommy

11:03.560 --> 11:07.480
what was that and a kindly usher says come here get out show you

11:07.480 --> 11:12.920
takes me upstairs in the back shows me the projector it says that's the movie

11:12.920 --> 11:21.160
i say wow that's the movie and i thought man i'll never understand grownups

11:21.640 --> 11:25.560
this man over there said you know what they're actually rolling about the

11:25.560 --> 11:30.200
physiology of the dream and began to show that higher

11:30.200 --> 11:34.840
cortical function is intimately involved in the dream

11:34.840 --> 11:39.640
and that brought meaning back into the study of neurophysiology

11:39.640 --> 11:44.280
it's a very tricky study because mind is not the same as brain

11:44.280 --> 11:48.840
there are carlots but the qualitative experience of mind

11:48.840 --> 11:52.680
is probably a whole brain experience consciousness is probably a whole

11:52.680 --> 11:56.120
brain experience doesn't mean that we can't have very useful

11:56.120 --> 12:00.600
correlations but it does mean that as an analyst i study

12:00.600 --> 12:08.520
mind and qualitative experience not only event occurrences and quantitative

12:08.520 --> 12:18.200
experiences what would you say

12:18.200 --> 12:21.880
how fear and anxiety are expressed in the brain when i do

12:21.880 --> 12:24.920
imaging of that and and that of course is a very

12:24.920 --> 12:29.720
artificial settings because what what we do is we put people in big machines

12:29.720 --> 12:32.760
that make a lot of noise and and we show them stimuli

12:32.760 --> 12:36.040
and they know that's nothing is going to jump on them and attack them or anything

12:36.040 --> 12:40.120
like that but still we do see circuitry that

12:40.120 --> 12:44.920
that gets activated for certain things i was very privileged to once image

12:44.920 --> 12:50.840
this famous blind side patient gy who was so we were first asking him what do

12:50.840 --> 12:52.920
you see it's nice nothing i said but just guess

12:52.920 --> 12:56.920
decides press left or right whether it's this or that he said okay i'll do it if

12:56.920 --> 13:00.120
you want me to do it but i really see nothing

13:00.120 --> 13:04.360
but his guesses were better than chance he was it was actually really

13:04.360 --> 13:07.880
he was without being conscious of what he was saying he was

13:07.880 --> 13:11.400
saying it the interesting thing is it was it was not only fear it was saying

13:11.400 --> 13:14.120
which was also happiness actually it was reacting to

13:14.120 --> 13:19.960
happy stimuli as well and um and so it was really amazing to see that

13:19.960 --> 13:23.560
somebody who was not conscious of something that he was perceiving was

13:23.560 --> 13:27.320
still able to show brain activation in all this

13:27.320 --> 13:33.080
circuitry that we that we know that are involved in in in the perception of

13:33.080 --> 13:36.120
so you're saying that his perceptual circuits were lighting up

13:36.120 --> 13:40.200
yes yeah and the cortex prefrontal cortex that stuff so no so not the

13:40.200 --> 13:43.560
prefrontal cortex that's the interesting part is that it was the

13:43.560 --> 13:46.680
earlier visual areas and and motion areas and sort of

13:46.680 --> 13:51.400
mimicry even areas that were being involved but not the prefrontal and

13:51.400 --> 13:54.360
not the parietal in in his case so that was

13:54.360 --> 13:59.080
and i think the prefrontal in the parietal cortex are essential for the

13:59.080 --> 14:06.520
experiential feeling of the emotion so to follow up on Joe's point then

14:06.520 --> 14:10.200
in your human or imaging studies i study mainly

14:10.200 --> 14:17.160
mouse threat circuitry so have you found based on what Joe has

14:17.160 --> 14:21.960
laid out it would seem that we should find new areas in the human brain that

14:21.960 --> 14:25.480
have not been yet figured out by optogenetics or other

14:25.480 --> 14:30.440
things within the rodent brain that are related to fear

14:30.440 --> 14:35.480
have you based on your sort of i know very laboratory based still sort of

14:35.480 --> 14:38.520
paradigms have you found other areas that

14:38.520 --> 14:43.720
have not yet been found in rodent brains i guess all the mirroring areas are

14:43.720 --> 14:47.800
not definitely i i i don't know much about rodents i have to say i've always

14:47.800 --> 14:49.880
been you know i don't think it has to do with areas

14:49.880 --> 14:52.840
we can talk about circuits that you can pick up

14:52.840 --> 14:56.680
you know in an imaging situation and certainly the

14:56.680 --> 15:01.560
you know the rat or mouse prefrontal cortex is very different very

15:01.560 --> 15:05.400
different um you know other primates have much more similar

15:05.400 --> 15:10.760
prefrontal cortex but even in the even the differences between

15:10.760 --> 15:13.560
humans and non-human primates exist in terms of

15:13.560 --> 15:18.280
you know connectivity patterns and and other kind of subtle connection

15:18.280 --> 15:21.800
and other things that that wouldn't necessarily be

15:21.800 --> 15:24.680
you know that imaging wouldn't be sensitive to

15:24.680 --> 15:27.800
or i mean some of them are like the connectivity but you know it's

15:27.800 --> 15:32.760
there's i i agree with what you said that may mean my whole

15:32.760 --> 15:38.200
position has long been my starting position as many of our

15:38.200 --> 15:43.320
starting positions is probably from our graduate student days and i studied

15:43.320 --> 15:47.160
as a graduate student conscious experience in split brain

15:47.160 --> 15:50.360
patients and how information presented to the right

15:50.360 --> 15:52.920
hemisphere couldn't be accessed by the left

15:52.920 --> 15:56.760
hemisphere but the left hemisphere could you know respond to the behaviors

15:56.760 --> 16:00.280
being produced by the right hemisphere and was always generating these

16:00.280 --> 16:04.200
complex explanations of why the behavior is being produced even though it had

16:04.200 --> 16:07.640
no idea and so this led gazanaga and i to the

16:07.640 --> 16:10.760
this idea that part of the role of consciousness is to

16:10.760 --> 16:14.280
kind of tell a story about ourselves that that

16:14.280 --> 16:18.040
sort of glues together all these random behaviors coming from all these

16:18.040 --> 16:21.960
unconscious processes including so-called emotional behaviors and in

16:21.960 --> 16:25.720
this Freud said the of the consciousness is the tip of the iceberg most of what

16:25.720 --> 16:32.120
the brain is doing is under the radar can i push a little bit on that so

16:32.120 --> 16:35.960
if you take the research that you were talking about at gsk so one way to read

16:35.960 --> 16:39.160
what you're saying is not only is that research

16:39.160 --> 16:43.320
not going not in fact helping us understand how to suppress

16:43.320 --> 16:46.280
the feeling of anxiety this sort of phenomenology

16:46.280 --> 16:49.880
phenomenology of it but one one way to take what you're saying is

16:49.880 --> 16:53.320
they can't in principle because the thing that we do in

16:53.320 --> 16:56.840
sort of as phenomenological beings as humans is this going to turn out to be

16:56.840 --> 17:00.760
different right but i would say can't directly inform

17:00.760 --> 17:06.280
feelings but obviously in a in a real emotional situation unlike what we can

17:06.280 --> 17:12.360
do in humans and laboratory the feedback from all of this stuff so

17:12.360 --> 17:15.080
you know there are lots of things going on let's put it in terms of three

17:15.080 --> 17:18.120
consequences of a make-it-all activation that would

17:18.120 --> 17:20.680
impact say working memory and its ability to

17:20.680 --> 17:23.320
synthesize all of this information one would be

17:23.320 --> 17:26.680
direct connections from the amygdala to cortical areas

17:26.680 --> 17:31.240
another would be outputs of the amygdala to and i'm just using a make-it-allist

17:31.240 --> 17:33.880
example not necessarily see how that's answered everything

17:33.880 --> 17:36.600
the second would be connections from the amygdala

17:36.600 --> 17:40.520
to arousal circuits in the brainstem that are going to you know light up the

17:40.520 --> 17:43.560
brain and say something important's happened and cause

17:43.560 --> 17:47.560
attention to begin monitoring the environment seeking an explanation

17:47.560 --> 17:50.680
as in the old shactor and singer experiments where they aroused the

17:50.680 --> 17:54.120
people put them in a situation where things were

17:54.120 --> 17:56.760
happy or sad going on and the people adopted the

17:56.760 --> 18:00.600
the emotional tone of the the context because what you're in a

18:00.600 --> 18:04.520
in a row situation you know cognitive dissonance why am i aroused why am i

18:04.520 --> 18:07.480
feeling this kind of tension in my brain and body

18:07.480 --> 18:12.040
and so you seek an explanation for that so arousal is very important but also

18:12.040 --> 18:14.600
then there's the feedback from the body which is the key to

18:14.600 --> 18:18.760
demosios theory i think that's one part of it but not the entire explanation

18:18.760 --> 18:22.120
of where our feelings come from and then there's a fourth one right

18:22.120 --> 18:26.280
show inhibitory tracks from the prefrontal cortex

18:26.280 --> 18:29.400
down to the amygdala right okay uh well the

18:29.400 --> 18:32.120
darsalato prefrontal cortex and the new reports

18:32.120 --> 18:36.360
don't have any connectivity with the amygdala it's very very crucial point

18:36.360 --> 18:39.720
right but it's the higher levels that do well that's pretty high

18:39.720 --> 18:44.840
or yeah well prefrontal but darsalato prefrontal yeah no connection to the

18:44.840 --> 18:49.480
mimic are there inhibitory tracks somewhere up there

18:49.480 --> 18:53.720
back down to the mimic so darsalato and other prefrontal areas connected to

18:53.720 --> 18:58.200
medial prefrontal areas which do in fact connect the amygdala so okay

18:58.200 --> 19:02.840
yeah so the the you know the consequences of activating one of these

19:02.840 --> 19:07.320
defensive survival circuits whether it's you know a threat circuit or a

19:07.320 --> 19:11.640
feeding circuit or anything else uh is that changes take place widely in the

19:11.640 --> 19:14.200
brain it creates a global organismic state within the

19:14.200 --> 19:17.000
brain and body that the body and brain then have to

19:17.000 --> 19:20.680
brain test a deal with now you know one of the reasons that

19:20.680 --> 19:24.760
has moved me to this more cognitive view of fear

19:24.760 --> 19:28.920
is and other emotions is the fact if we just stick with fear

19:28.920 --> 19:32.760
you know we have to be able to not just account for fear as a defensive

19:32.760 --> 19:36.440
survival response so we can be afraid of a snake at our feet

19:36.440 --> 19:42.200
but we can also be afraid of starving to death and that would not be

19:42.200 --> 19:45.640
part of the defensive survival circuit that would be a homeostatic mechanism

19:45.640 --> 19:51.320
involving low energy supplies or dying of dehydration so we begin to worry

19:51.320 --> 19:56.120
about that because our hypotherlamic fluid balance

19:56.120 --> 20:00.040
circuits are out of culture or are freezing to death in the sense of

20:00.040 --> 20:04.120
failure of thermal regulation so these are not traditional

20:04.120 --> 20:08.120
threat circuits but yet their activity can cause us to be afraid

20:08.120 --> 20:13.000
and we can even move beyond that to broader fear such as the fear of

20:13.000 --> 20:17.480
anxiety of not leading a meaningful life or of the

20:17.480 --> 20:22.120
eventuality of death an existential kind of threat

20:22.120 --> 20:26.360
so a circuit you know if you say fear the amygdala is the brain's fear center is

20:26.360 --> 20:30.600
as is often said you can't possibly get to an explanation of both

20:30.600 --> 20:34.840
existential fear and the fear of a snake in one explanation

20:34.840 --> 20:38.520
so it's there's only one way you can do that it's through a cortical processing

20:38.520 --> 20:41.880
of all these various kinds of inputs fear is a

20:41.880 --> 20:45.640
kind of construction or an assembly or an emergent property

20:45.640 --> 20:49.080
of a lot of ingredients that happen below the surface

20:49.080 --> 20:53.720
yeah now Joe you you have taken fear and applied it

20:53.720 --> 20:59.000
to the fear of not leading a happy or satisfactory life

20:59.000 --> 21:02.040
an analyst would say no that's anxiety actually

21:02.040 --> 21:05.400
no that's I said fear or anxiety okay no my

21:05.400 --> 21:09.720
I think that whole discussion about fear anxiety is not settled because I

21:09.720 --> 21:13.320
still no matter how much I look into it I can't see what exactly

21:13.320 --> 21:18.120
differentiates one from the other but that's another matter you were

21:18.120 --> 21:21.800
going to say well right sorry I do I do wonder a little bit about these 10 to

21:21.800 --> 21:24.920
which these are semantic issues and 20 center content

21:24.920 --> 21:30.280
so for example it seems like it could be that when we talk about the fear of

21:30.280 --> 21:33.560
not eating a meaningful life and the fear of getting hit by a train

21:33.560 --> 21:37.800
that we're using the same word but in fact it's not it's going to turn out

21:37.800 --> 21:40.600
that it's sort of a nervous to tell you in sense we haven't carved nature I

21:40.600 --> 21:43.480
just joined properly in the natural language

21:43.480 --> 21:47.240
and so my bias scientifically is always as a splitter as opposed to a

21:47.240 --> 21:51.240
bumper and so it seems to me as that it could plausibly be that there's

21:51.240 --> 21:54.040
lots of systems which if you kind of went down they kind of look like they're

21:54.040 --> 21:57.560
doing more or less the same kind of thing keeping us from doing it so for

21:57.560 --> 22:00.600
example you know getting us to eat when we're hungry or

22:00.600 --> 22:04.840
worrying about the fact that we might not but that would all of a sudden done

22:04.840 --> 22:07.240
when we're all done with our work whether we're talking about the cognitive

22:07.240 --> 22:10.280
level or the neurophysiological level we're going to look at these things where

22:10.280 --> 22:13.160
you see oh I actually turned out that those things were of a family and the

22:13.160 --> 22:17.400
Eleanor Ross sense of family resemblance but they weren't exactly the same thing

22:17.400 --> 22:21.640
right and so and so I have a fear that my microphone just dimmed

22:21.640 --> 22:31.640
I agree with that and but the the point is that so the field has been so

22:31.640 --> 22:35.640
narrowly focused on fear I'm saying let's consider all the options and

22:35.640 --> 22:39.240
whittle back from there rather than you know kind of just being stuck in this

22:39.240 --> 22:43.720
defensive mode where you know a snake is the canonical form of fear

22:43.720 --> 22:47.320
when we know that people never encounter snakes in New York City and that they're

22:47.320 --> 22:52.920
a lot of fearful and anxious people when you are so maybe including fearful about

22:52.920 --> 22:56.760
snakes that they have never seen exactly well they're also human snakes

22:56.760 --> 23:06.920
editing much more frightening so an analyst would say look if you want to

23:06.920 --> 23:12.680
study brain physiology about human fear and anxiety you have to look at the

23:12.680 --> 23:16.920
neurophysiology of meaning and probably that means you have to look at the

23:16.920 --> 23:20.840
neurophysiology of representation

23:22.920 --> 23:27.160
I'm not sure I completely agree with what you say because I think in some cases

23:27.160 --> 23:33.000
you can put people in a state chemically that will make them experience anxiety

23:33.000 --> 23:37.400
even if they have no reason to experience anxiety so if you flow your system for

23:37.400 --> 23:41.320
example with thyroid hormones your blood pressure is going up your heart is

23:41.320 --> 23:44.760
beating you have all these symptoms that are normally present when you

23:44.760 --> 23:49.720
experience fear except there is no stimulus that would provoke fear and yes

23:49.720 --> 23:54.040
you feel anxious you have the deep feeling of being anxious even if you

23:54.040 --> 23:58.040
know there is no reason to be so so I think that there is no meaning there but

23:58.040 --> 24:03.400
the body is still sending a signal and makes us interpret whatever the signal

24:03.400 --> 24:08.360
is as inviting those people who have panic attacks say I feel like I'm going to

24:08.360 --> 24:10.600
die

24:10.600 --> 24:15.320
yes but but they have that's different because they have a

24:15.320 --> 24:19.720
condition that makes them have panic attacks but I'm telling you is if you

24:19.720 --> 24:26.120
do that to a perfectly you know normally if there is a person a healthy person

24:26.120 --> 24:30.680
who is feeling well you give them this medicine and then suddenly they will have

24:30.680 --> 24:35.320
this huge surge of anxiety and that I think is interesting because because

24:35.320 --> 24:40.520
it also shows that things can just arise from body signals into the

24:40.520 --> 24:46.360
absolutely fear-promised actoma but often either it's true free-floating

24:46.360 --> 24:50.520
anxiety which is rare or the person even though they know it's physical

24:50.520 --> 24:54.520
has a mental experience of it it has a representation to it

24:54.520 --> 24:58.760
they can say or what does that feel like feels like I'm going to die

24:58.760 --> 25:02.280
feels like I'm suffocating feels like I'm falling

25:02.280 --> 25:06.920
no but what does that tell you what that tells you and it

25:06.920 --> 25:10.600
means you could say anything wait a minute you could say anything at your

25:10.600 --> 25:14.760
analyst yes you could say anything but what you do say

25:14.760 --> 25:19.320
may be actually influenced by who you are right

25:19.320 --> 25:23.320
and the question maybe so maybe what you heard

25:23.320 --> 25:26.840
maybe you heard people who are panic attacks think they're dying so when you

25:26.840 --> 25:30.360
have a panic I think I'm going to be dying they don't necessarily think

25:30.360 --> 25:34.840
they're dying they say it feels like they're dying right but maybe you have

25:34.840 --> 25:38.120
you know especially in this as you go on the internet it says people who are

25:38.120 --> 25:40.600
panic attacks they think it feels like dying

25:40.600 --> 25:44.280
it doesn't matter if they say it's another one would be like a lollipop

25:44.280 --> 25:47.960
that's fine we're not talking about the content the specific content

25:47.960 --> 25:52.760
but only that affect in human beings tends to have a content

25:52.760 --> 25:55.720
and that if you want to understand the human experience

25:55.720 --> 25:59.960
of affect you have to understand what Joe has already said

25:59.960 --> 26:04.520
that there are links between cognition and affect and physiology

26:04.520 --> 26:10.040
that the package deal in humans tends to be represented

26:10.040 --> 26:15.480
in that package deal and they will express it we call that package deal in

26:15.480 --> 26:19.080
human beings meaning the meaning of the affect

26:19.080 --> 26:23.080
Prancing or psychiatrist and the neuroscientist what are you like

26:23.240 --> 26:27.080
it's hard to say because I'm actually a neuroscientist I've actually it's much

26:27.080 --> 26:30.200
easier for me to think about what I was actually thinking about as you were

26:30.200 --> 26:34.680
saying this was actually about there's a certain group of patients that were

26:34.680 --> 26:39.160
studied at the University of Iowa who basically had congenital lesions of

26:39.160 --> 26:42.040
their amygdala you're familiar with these courses

26:42.040 --> 26:45.960
and and that recently there was a paper that came out a couple years ago that

26:45.960 --> 26:51.320
if they were given some type of carbon dioxide sort of

26:51.320 --> 26:55.800
inhalation they actually felt for the first time a fearful response

26:55.800 --> 27:00.120
we would or at least they had what looked like a physician's first time

27:00.120 --> 27:03.880
so it wasn't there no that it was just showing that they could feel

27:03.880 --> 27:07.000
they could have a physiological response too

27:07.000 --> 27:10.760
but did you look for those people they still have

27:10.760 --> 27:15.320
they still felt fear in some on other things like as you said

27:15.320 --> 27:19.320
these are great subjects because they have thoughts that they probably have

27:19.320 --> 27:23.160
fears that their life has no meaning or various other things

27:23.160 --> 27:26.200
you know but I mean that's part of my argument against the idea that they

27:26.200 --> 27:28.920
make the lives of fearsome exactly these people can have fear

27:28.920 --> 27:31.560
without them a mingle walk exactly even though they don't they don't have the

27:31.560 --> 27:35.720
physiological response of whatever if you put them in the laboratory and

27:35.720 --> 27:38.520
shock them and put a yellow square in front of their face

27:38.520 --> 27:42.760
you know and they won't freeze or have a physiological response to that

27:42.760 --> 27:47.320
mingle is the key to the output yes those to the circumstances

27:47.320 --> 27:50.520
that's a tremendous response but if you interview them they will actually say

27:50.520 --> 27:54.520
right if i mean list felt actually um is it

27:54.520 --> 27:59.160
my you showed this and with Adam Anderson i think in 2002

27:59.160 --> 28:03.800
it didn't get as much attention as the the Iowa paper more recently but it's

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
the same the fact that you can have the amygdala is not involved in the

28:07.000 --> 28:11.880
experience of these emotional responses i mean these emotional states but

28:11.880 --> 28:17.000
only in the expression but i actually prefer to think of their mingle as a

28:17.000 --> 28:19.800
relevance the factor as has been proposed by some people

28:19.800 --> 28:24.440
because i think it's it's been it's present in a lot of tests that i do

28:24.440 --> 28:28.360
for them if i just show neutral faces versus objects

28:28.360 --> 28:32.680
faces are more relevant to us because the biological stimuli i get a mingle

28:32.680 --> 28:35.960
activation even if there is no fear involved in those things

28:35.960 --> 28:39.880
so i think it's it's we we need to broaden our view that we were talking

28:39.880 --> 28:43.960
about fear so we talk about the amygdala but there's a dozen parts of the

28:43.960 --> 28:47.160
amygdala take only the lateral nucleus of the

28:47.160 --> 28:50.360
amygdala that we can divide into three parts

28:50.360 --> 28:54.680
uh one that is involved in plasticity and learning another that's

28:54.680 --> 28:58.200
involved in the transmission to other amygdala errors and so forth

28:58.200 --> 29:02.840
so the circuitry is i mean in an imaging study

29:02.840 --> 29:06.600
you can see you know positive and negative and all of that and in the

29:06.600 --> 29:09.880
blob called the amygdala but when we get into the detail and that's why the

29:09.880 --> 29:12.440
animal studies are important we can see the circuitry

29:12.440 --> 29:16.040
cells that will respond to positive but not negative and so forth so at a

29:16.040 --> 29:19.720
subtle level of micro wiring there are these

29:19.720 --> 29:23.960
distinctions so you know what what it is is

29:23.960 --> 29:27.000
you know we i think what we have to think about is

29:27.000 --> 29:35.720
a circuit that is detecting threats by predators versus

29:35.720 --> 29:40.200
circuits that are responding to positive incentives

29:40.200 --> 29:43.720
versus circuits that are responding to uh

29:43.720 --> 29:47.320
dehydration or changes in temperature all of those are going to

29:47.320 --> 29:50.200
you know may overlap but they're also going to be criss-crossing

29:50.200 --> 29:52.440
and you're not going to be able to pick that up through uh

29:52.440 --> 29:55.960
through you know crude imaging technology

29:55.960 --> 30:01.400
crude where it is today but you know i think the

30:01.400 --> 30:03.960
i mean it's less crucial it's less crucial

30:03.960 --> 30:08.280
the usual idea is that you can the ultimate resolution of the magnet will

30:08.280 --> 30:10.760
be somewhere along with the idea of a cubic millimeter right?

30:10.760 --> 30:13.800
yeah and having that is a very tricky part because you have all kind of things

30:13.800 --> 30:18.760
around that that makes it difficult yeah like one of the early studies of

30:18.760 --> 30:21.800
mark reichl's that implicate the amygdala turned out to be jaw muscle

30:21.800 --> 30:25.080
never rather than the amygdala i believe i got to know you're

30:25.080 --> 30:28.520
saying something so important which is the complexity even of the

30:28.520 --> 30:31.560
amygdala right the complexity of the brain and how its

30:31.560 --> 30:34.040
function is over determined and multi-determined

30:34.040 --> 30:38.280
which is an analytic concept well they're based on froid

30:38.280 --> 30:44.600
and it's a basic physiological fact about the human brain

30:44.600 --> 30:45.560
and how it functions

30:50.040 --> 30:54.520
i wanted to ask you something Joe you said that

30:54.520 --> 31:01.160
people take the tranquilizers and it doesn't

31:01.160 --> 31:05.800
take away their anxiety SSRI it's even more interested i didn't say

31:05.800 --> 31:09.880
tranquilizer it's an anti-frantic look i said SSRI's

31:09.880 --> 31:13.560
so what about when you take actual tranquilizer

31:13.560 --> 31:17.560
anti-anxiety medication so okay i mean we get it now we get into the

31:17.560 --> 31:22.680
details so there are receptors for benzodiazepines and

31:22.680 --> 31:25.880
prefrontal areas as well as the amygdala all over the brain

31:25.880 --> 31:29.720
so the question is two questions i guess one is

31:29.720 --> 31:35.000
when a person is feeling less anxious on the benzodiazepine

31:35.000 --> 31:38.920
is that because one the benzodiazepine has

31:38.920 --> 31:43.480
specifically reduced anxiety or is there a more general

31:43.480 --> 31:49.080
change of emotional processing and if it's

31:49.080 --> 31:52.520
uh a second question would be is it because

31:52.520 --> 31:55.400
you've changed emotional processing per se

31:55.400 --> 31:58.360
or because you've changed the cognitive underpinnings

31:58.360 --> 32:02.280
of that emotional processing by blunning activity you know

32:02.280 --> 32:05.800
benzodiazepines or GABA agonists so they blunt

32:05.800 --> 32:09.880
activity wherever they bind so if you blunt cognitive processes that are

32:09.880 --> 32:13.960
involved in the assembly of higher thoughts or even

32:13.960 --> 32:18.360
fears and anxieties and prefrontal cortex then you're going to feel less

32:18.360 --> 32:21.240
fearful anxious but have you done that by directly

32:21.240 --> 32:23.960
changing anxiety you might say okay as a

32:23.960 --> 32:27.560
therapist it doesn't matter you know if it works it works that's great

32:27.560 --> 32:29.960
but as a scientist you want to know why it's working

32:29.960 --> 32:33.880
and is it doing what you say it does because that's what's led to

32:33.880 --> 32:38.040
billions of dollars being spent trying to make animals less

32:38.040 --> 32:42.680
timid in these behavioral situations to find drugs that can make people less

32:42.680 --> 32:45.800
people less fearful or anxious you think prance is a bad

32:45.800 --> 32:49.080
i still am amazed as a as a psychiatrist and as an

32:49.080 --> 32:52.040
nurse scientist that we don't actually know where

32:52.040 --> 32:57.240
where the site of or what circuit or what network is being affected by the

32:57.240 --> 33:00.200
events of the as we've been giving them for decades

33:00.200 --> 33:03.160
and you would think that we would there would have been a conditional receptor

33:03.160 --> 33:05.800
knockout mouse that would have been done at some point

33:05.800 --> 33:08.840
but for some reason that has not been because it was

33:08.840 --> 33:12.680
I mean the pharmaceutical industry moves in the direction of

33:12.680 --> 33:15.400
okay we've got this drug yes let's get the next one

33:15.400 --> 33:18.280
with you know tweak to it they'll make more money right yeah

33:18.280 --> 33:20.360
so they're not going to figure it out they're not going to figure it out

33:20.360 --> 33:24.680
so scientists have to do that and but look at it you'll have a certain piece of

33:24.680 --> 33:28.680
data for you I took once a benzo librarium for a

33:28.680 --> 33:32.200
plane flight yes my brother met me he said to my

33:32.200 --> 33:37.560
wife the plane landed at noon eric landed at one

33:37.560 --> 33:42.120
well it wasn't only fear of us the fear it was a wow

33:42.120 --> 33:45.800
a really good feeling well we're on the subject of ethics for

33:45.800 --> 33:49.400
example giving people drugs we don't really know how they work for the last

33:49.400 --> 33:53.880
decades and we used to give people aspirin

33:53.880 --> 33:57.640
and on this note of social anxiety I don't often have the chance to talk to

33:57.640 --> 34:01.240
people in the clinical world so I'm interested in this story for example

34:01.240 --> 34:05.800
about the introvert who we medicate so that they go to parties which they

34:05.800 --> 34:10.440
subsequently presumably are you know are very difficult for them

34:10.440 --> 34:13.080
right because they're introverts so they actually don't really like

34:13.080 --> 34:16.840
going to these sort of social events right and one way to read introversion

34:16.840 --> 34:20.200
is that's Darwin's way of saying you know what you should maybe devote your

34:20.200 --> 34:23.720
attention to the non-social stuff because whatever the social stuff is doing for

34:23.720 --> 34:26.680
you it was really not working out so there might be other ways

34:26.680 --> 34:30.600
should we should we be suppressing anxiety at the point where we get people

34:30.600 --> 34:33.480
into situations which are subsequently going to be

34:33.480 --> 34:37.560
unpleasant even if i may maladaptive for them

34:37.560 --> 34:40.520
is this something that we do in the clinical community i i was not aware

34:40.520 --> 34:43.480
other than yeah i was aware that we give people all the time medications which

34:43.480 --> 34:47.480
we don't understand how they work that's cool with that it's called

34:47.480 --> 34:50.360
being a doctor yeah

34:50.360 --> 34:53.800
i know i've always i've always been impressed with my friends over the

34:53.800 --> 34:55.800
medical community it's even if they go to they are to

34:55.800 --> 34:59.160
empiricism we haven't even known to ask that question because it's all

34:59.160 --> 35:02.920
seemed like one thing in the brain you know fear and anxiety like

35:02.920 --> 35:06.840
fear center anxiety center happiness but there are some things that

35:06.840 --> 35:10.520
are a touch more specific i don't know how they work

35:10.520 --> 35:15.560
but people who have stage fright they respond to in the raves

35:15.560 --> 35:19.240
i think that has not become uh solid as it used to be

35:19.240 --> 35:22.680
and also what response does that mean the subsequent studies have not been

35:22.680 --> 35:25.560
this clear and the question is what response to enduro

35:25.560 --> 35:29.560
the tachycardia the sweating that response the tremor

35:29.560 --> 35:34.440
that response to enduro they then have to say if they can

35:34.440 --> 35:39.240
wow nobody can now see that i'm anxious and the anxiety may

35:39.240 --> 35:43.320
in certain people fade because of that

35:43.320 --> 35:47.240
or maybe because you don't get this body response you feel better because you

35:47.240 --> 35:50.840
don't get those signals but that's the key

35:50.840 --> 35:55.240
that's the previous understanding what you're saying that there's new

35:55.240 --> 35:59.560
sort of doubt right that this is why i actually think that enduro does work

35:59.560 --> 36:02.440
because did you take some deploy

36:02.440 --> 36:08.920
no but if we have um if we condition rats in a certain way

36:08.920 --> 36:15.320
that make them avoid situations um we find that there's a group

36:15.320 --> 36:20.680
of about 20 that never acquire the response but if we inject

36:20.680 --> 36:24.440
propanolol and enduro directly into their central amygdala which controls the

36:24.440 --> 36:28.200
outputs to the freezing and all that the animals stop freezing

36:28.200 --> 36:32.840
and start performing the response so they can now approach the threats and

36:32.840 --> 36:37.560
and so forth so it has this in the traditional sense an anti-

36:37.560 --> 36:41.640
anxiety effect in terms of behavior right but i wouldn't call that

36:41.640 --> 36:45.400
anxiety we call that reduced uh defensive behavior reduced

36:45.400 --> 36:51.880
behavioral inhibition um so the you could i mean that would be

36:51.880 --> 36:54.280
consistent with the effects of enduro given to people

36:54.280 --> 36:56.680
you give it to them and they're more willing to go

36:56.680 --> 37:02.680
on stage and and perform so whether they i mean in and the the body feedback and

37:02.680 --> 37:06.120
all of that that's suppressed would indirectly

37:06.120 --> 37:09.640
make you feel less anxious even if the enduro itself is not directly

37:09.640 --> 37:13.560
reducing your anxiety all right i wanted to get your opinion

37:13.560 --> 37:16.280
what did you think of the recent study that came out

37:16.280 --> 37:19.720
about giving instance we're talking about enduro where they did where they

37:19.720 --> 37:23.080
were conditioning humans who had a spider phobia

37:23.080 --> 37:26.120
too and then they sort of brought up they

37:26.120 --> 37:29.320
did essentially a reconciliation type experiment

37:29.320 --> 37:32.440
where they gave the enduro during that window did you actually

37:32.440 --> 37:35.320
we were a window was this the uh Dutch study?

37:35.320 --> 37:40.200
yes exactly i'm not going to comment on that

37:40.200 --> 37:44.200
i mean that there's some issues i don't want to go

37:44.200 --> 37:47.080
the experience in terms of experimental design

37:47.080 --> 37:50.120
in general yeah okay

37:51.640 --> 37:55.960
but a couple of drugs we don't know how they work and and why they work

37:55.960 --> 37:59.400
have you seen this study that showed that paracetamol

37:59.400 --> 38:02.360
which is something you'll take for pain actually

38:02.360 --> 38:05.400
alleviate social pain in these games where you

38:05.400 --> 38:08.680
you know give the ball to people and ignore them and so forth and i thought

38:08.680 --> 38:12.520
i was also something that's interesting in terms of

38:12.520 --> 38:17.560
circuitry is interacting and and responding because who would think of

38:17.560 --> 38:22.440
paracetamol as a things i already think do they know how it works or

38:22.440 --> 38:25.400
we don't know how i mean it's a cop's two inhibitor it's an interesting

38:25.400 --> 38:30.840
but but it's nobody really completely understand how paracetamol works i think

38:30.840 --> 38:35.000
yeah currently at Cornell we're doing a there's a clinical trial which we're

38:35.000 --> 38:37.560
doing i'm a sort of a very small member of this

38:37.560 --> 38:40.280
clinical trial but it essentially is looking at

38:40.280 --> 38:43.880
people with post-traumatic stress disorder and this was a

38:43.880 --> 38:48.440
an anti-tuberculous drug called desyclocirian it had gone by the trade

38:48.440 --> 38:52.280
named ceramysin and it had previously been thought of

38:52.280 --> 38:56.840
by serendipity to be actually opening up the the glutamate

38:56.840 --> 39:01.000
and mda channel but what people have found is that it can be given a short

39:01.000 --> 39:04.200
time periods as a cognitive enhancer and so what

39:04.200 --> 39:06.920
what the trial we're doing is we're actually giving them

39:06.920 --> 39:10.680
about 45 minutes or an hour before their cognitive behavioral exposure

39:10.680 --> 39:14.440
treatment they get this drug and or a placebo

39:14.440 --> 39:17.800
and then they do their exposure treatment so we're actually going to see

39:17.800 --> 39:20.280
whether this works this has been all been very well

39:20.280 --> 39:24.360
worked up by mike davis a researcher at Emory University

39:24.360 --> 39:28.840
in rats but this is one that had been initially been worked by karaa wrestler

39:28.840 --> 39:34.280
to decrease phobias of fear of heights but now we're going to do something

39:34.280 --> 39:37.160
much more complicated in looking at something that is

39:37.160 --> 39:40.440
even even though post-traumatic stress disorder is considered to be

39:40.440 --> 39:43.160
something that has elements of fear and anxiety

39:43.160 --> 39:46.600
it's so much more complicated than that and i think we're going to see whether

39:46.600 --> 39:49.800
or not this at least helps the it's not the it's not

39:49.800 --> 39:54.520
model therapy for the PTSD but it's actually going to be used in conjunction

39:54.520 --> 39:57.720
with exposure therapy i think the and there's been a few meta

39:57.720 --> 40:00.760
analysis recently that suggests the effects they're like

40:00.760 --> 40:03.640
many things you get an effect in the first study right then the biggest

40:03.640 --> 40:06.440
effect now it's uh start a fall start a fall

40:06.440 --> 40:09.480
apart so that'd be interesting let's see what you

40:09.480 --> 40:13.640
get on the meta analysis in the voted models or in the humans i know in

40:13.640 --> 40:17.720
humans uh a lot of um stuff on hoffman and uh mike

40:17.720 --> 40:21.320
mike lotto at the uh have done a lot of that

40:21.320 --> 40:24.440
it seems that the things that don't work for

40:24.440 --> 40:28.440
desyclic serine are things like snake phobias like if you

40:28.440 --> 40:33.000
if you have a if you have some type of certain phobias are not as amenable

40:33.000 --> 40:36.280
to this but again we don't actually know where this

40:36.280 --> 40:39.000
works there have been some studies that suggested

40:39.000 --> 40:44.040
effects both the amygdala it's whatever firing rates in both the amygdala and

40:44.040 --> 40:46.680
also the prefrontal cortex i don't think it's been

40:46.680 --> 40:49.960
as clearly mapped out unless i've missed some paper

40:49.960 --> 40:53.240
yeah but that would go along with representation

40:53.240 --> 40:57.800
right meaning the significance of yes that's according to a

40:57.800 --> 41:01.240
prefrontal concept or i can still say that because i'm arguing against that

41:01.240 --> 41:04.200
whole concept yeah so i'm just going to take a

41:04.200 --> 41:06.760
moment and i have a new book out called anxious

41:06.760 --> 41:12.200
uh little promotion in the in the book um one of the things i

41:12.200 --> 41:17.560
propose is that you know that because the if in fact the

41:17.560 --> 41:20.840
conscious experience of fear is distinct from these more basic

41:20.840 --> 41:24.920
threat processing circuits um we might

41:24.920 --> 41:30.920
profitably approach exposure therapy by directly attacking the amygdala

41:30.920 --> 41:33.960
independent of conscious awareness by using subliminal

41:33.960 --> 41:39.560
presentations of the cs of the the spider the snake or whatever

41:39.560 --> 41:43.240
and reducing amygdala's response is outside of consciousness

41:43.240 --> 41:47.240
then do conscious exposure therapy and then do

41:47.240 --> 41:51.320
psychotherapy to help the person cope with the situation kind of a three-point

41:51.320 --> 41:55.400
plan what do you think of that it's uh but look i think that's potentially

41:55.400 --> 41:59.640
terrific and analyst would either after you're done or before

41:59.640 --> 42:07.000
or instead of ask the question why is this person afraid of spiders

42:07.000 --> 42:11.240
do they have a traumatic history with spiders many don't but what do spiders

42:11.240 --> 42:15.800
mean to them if you will what is the what activates

42:15.800 --> 42:19.480
the affect circuit what's the affect meaning

42:19.480 --> 42:23.160
and then get the story of that so that the person themselves

42:23.160 --> 42:26.760
in a certain other circuit cognitive more cognitive circuit

42:26.760 --> 42:32.040
understand something about the symbolic representation spider

42:32.040 --> 42:36.360
and may deal with the actual elements of what they are afraid of behind the

42:36.360 --> 42:44.040
spider image that is crucial suggestion is a very very powerful tool so

42:44.040 --> 42:48.120
you can change things by suggestion is the equivalent of placebo

42:48.120 --> 42:52.040
so and i think it's always a very powerful thing you can see it in the

42:52.040 --> 42:55.800
brain you're changing the terms of the discussion from is there meaning

42:55.800 --> 42:59.320
to how do you know the meaning and does the meaning work i was addressing

42:59.320 --> 43:02.520
only that there is a symbolic representation well

43:02.520 --> 43:09.000
that's all but if you take anybody any student that comes and you

43:09.000 --> 43:12.760
put them in a magnet and you show them subliminal images of snakes

43:12.760 --> 43:15.720
you'll see they're all fear circuitry that lights up

43:15.720 --> 43:19.640
it's has the meaning to them do you think

43:19.640 --> 43:23.560
the snakes the fear of snake it's coming because of a meaning

43:23.560 --> 43:27.560
or do you think it's just yeah don't you think that that people feel oh my god

43:27.560 --> 43:30.440
the snake might bite me or get inside me or they don't know it's there

43:30.440 --> 43:34.360
no you rapidly show it okay now we're talking about the analyst view of the

43:34.360 --> 43:37.720
unconscious they don't know it's there yes that's right

43:37.720 --> 43:43.800
the whole analytic theory of human mental function and neurodic pathology

43:43.800 --> 43:47.640
is that there are aspects of meaning of it of which we're not aware

43:47.640 --> 43:51.560
and all of the analytical literature on techniques it talks about how to make

43:51.560 --> 43:55.240
that unconscious conscious maybe it's baloney maybe it doesn't work maybe it's

43:55.240 --> 44:00.120
just placebo different question the idea however the analytic idea

44:00.120 --> 44:04.920
is human meaning is there and maybe unconscious

44:04.920 --> 44:10.040
sorry my point is not that I might show you show snakes to anybody

44:10.040 --> 44:13.480
and anybody will have these reactions because of the meaning of snakes

44:13.480 --> 44:16.680
so you mean that you think everybody has a problem with snakes because of their

44:16.680 --> 44:20.200
history no no no no everybody's afraid of falling

44:20.200 --> 44:24.280
but the falling is conceived of representationally

44:24.280 --> 44:28.280
it's not just stimulus reflex that's all i'm saying but what i

44:28.280 --> 44:33.000
understood this to be would be that joe was throwing out that there should be

44:33.000 --> 44:38.440
a clinical trial where you do treatment as usual or to add on top of it

44:38.440 --> 44:41.720
this type of subliminal

44:41.720 --> 44:45.720
it's a normal reaction that's that's we evolved

44:45.720 --> 44:49.480
of course representation of things that are dangerous for us

44:49.480 --> 44:54.120
snakes spiders hides etc so i think that's that's a normal thing to have a

44:54.120 --> 44:58.520
reaction to when it becomes a problem that interferes with your daily action

44:58.520 --> 45:01.720
then it's a problem that you need to solve but but otherwise i think it's a

45:01.720 --> 45:04.760
normal thing that we have it's like we see faces everywhere

45:04.760 --> 45:09.080
we are we we can see objects that look like a face

45:09.080 --> 45:13.720
and in 170 milliseconds you will activate the areas of your brain that

45:13.720 --> 45:17.880
normally sees real faces because you treat

45:17.880 --> 45:24.520
yes that's why that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying that's the design

45:24.520 --> 45:29.160
yeah you can and and that's why babies orient to faces after just a few

45:29.160 --> 45:31.880
minutes of life because we have this sub-particle system

45:31.880 --> 45:35.080
that orientes us two things that are important for evolution

45:35.080 --> 45:39.640
and and i think that's something that doesn't need to have extra

45:39.640 --> 45:42.920
you know meaning no i think we're saying the same thing

45:42.920 --> 45:46.120
meaning is innate to human beings that's what i was saying i think you need to be

45:46.120 --> 45:49.400
careful to put meaning to some of these things

45:49.400 --> 45:52.760
i think you but the way you are saying it you are

45:52.760 --> 45:56.840
putting meaning to everything but you don't need meaning

45:56.840 --> 46:01.160
in other words the person who has the fear that the who goes under these

46:01.160 --> 46:04.280
imagings and they all respond to snake fear

46:04.280 --> 46:08.280
that don't have to the snakes don't have to have any other meaning for them there's

46:08.280 --> 46:12.040
no unconscious meaning to it the only meaning is

46:12.040 --> 46:17.480
that evolutionary we are going to have to guard ourselves

46:17.480 --> 46:22.040
against snakes okay add your now reducing meaning to its minimalist

46:22.040 --> 46:25.320
significance which is fine but now you want to take a step further and say it

46:25.320 --> 46:28.440
has no meaning at all snake doesn't even mean snake

46:28.440 --> 46:32.920
it's no no a snake okay so snake has a mean that's only because we have given it

46:32.920 --> 46:37.640
the name excuse me it has meaning the name is given in a name

46:37.640 --> 46:40.440
i mean in terms of meaning if if it has meaning

46:40.440 --> 46:45.320
then you're really the same we have to protect ourselves

46:45.320 --> 46:48.440
so i would just go back to one of the things you said to kind of

46:48.440 --> 46:53.160
tie it into the things like the um you said the job of the amylist is to make

46:53.160 --> 46:56.520
the unconscious conscious but if the meaning is wired in to

46:56.520 --> 47:00.840
say the amygdala yeah there's no way to make that conscious

47:00.840 --> 47:04.600
i mean there's the circuitry because the prefrontal cortex can't

47:04.600 --> 47:07.560
look at the amygdala and see what it's doing you know there's certain things

47:07.560 --> 47:11.000
that are unconscious but in this thing yeah certain things that are unconscious

47:11.000 --> 47:14.360
because of wiring not because of repression oh no that's right

47:14.360 --> 47:19.480
but there are actual fibers from the amygdala to the pre-chortex we

47:19.480 --> 47:23.800
like i asked you about that right and their actual fibers back then again

47:23.800 --> 47:27.160
no and so but right but not well okay i mean

47:27.160 --> 47:30.760
one could inhibit one's and make all the responses we do it all the time yes

47:30.760 --> 47:34.680
we're good at inhibiting yeah but less good at uh i'm sorry

47:34.680 --> 47:39.400
every the other way the other way yeah i mean it's

47:39.400 --> 47:43.960
um it's very well i mean the the asymmetry there is that it's very easy

47:43.960 --> 47:50.600
for the arousal of these emotions whatever you want to call them to

47:50.600 --> 47:55.640
uh affect our conscious experiences yeah but less easy for our conscious

47:55.640 --> 47:59.320
experience to change our emotions as we all know that's why you are in business

47:59.320 --> 48:06.440
right

48:07.720 --> 48:11.800
you're thinking well no i would just add to that so i i mean again i feel like

48:11.800 --> 48:15.880
this notion of meaning ironically enough can have to be a semantic issue so

48:15.880 --> 48:19.160
uh it might be helpful for some of us to understand

48:19.160 --> 48:22.440
what it would look like for something not to have meaning because the examples

48:22.440 --> 48:27.320
that i think i'm accustomed to seem intelligible in this kind of

48:27.320 --> 48:30.840
Darwinian context without needing any of them additional

48:30.840 --> 48:35.320
but on this on this note about consciousness and so forth i think most of us

48:35.320 --> 48:39.240
sort of take a view that um it's interesting i feel like all of the

48:39.240 --> 48:44.360
discussion about the fear of dehydration has led to this moment right here

48:47.480 --> 48:51.240
you know that one that i think that most people would agree that a signal

48:51.240 --> 48:54.280
feature of the mind and this goes all the way back to the early work on

48:54.280 --> 48:57.320
split brain patients and so on is that there's modularity that is there are

48:57.320 --> 49:01.480
systems that are isolated from each other again not in virtue of a suppression

49:01.480 --> 49:05.480
you know sort of uh but the fact is that you know there's lots of stuff going on

49:05.480 --> 49:08.200
our heads and they just do the little things

49:08.200 --> 49:11.640
behind the you know behind the veil and it's just fine that they do those sorts

49:11.640 --> 49:15.000
of things and i i take it but that's why you get many of the effects that you do

49:15.000 --> 49:17.720
and another way is just to bring this back to the very top of the conversation

49:17.720 --> 49:20.200
which is you know if you sort of take that view

49:20.200 --> 49:24.600
then the question of what consciousness is doing now maybe it's a narrator along

49:24.600 --> 49:28.280
the lines of kazanagans and so on that's here to tell us stories

49:28.280 --> 49:31.320
but that does bring me back to the point about rodents which is that if you

49:31.320 --> 49:34.760
think that what's going on in terms of phenomenology and consciousness has to

49:34.760 --> 49:37.080
do with telling stories in the social world

49:37.080 --> 49:40.360
then critters that don't really talk to each other which is you know every

49:40.360 --> 49:43.640
other species more or less roughly and these with natural language

49:43.640 --> 49:48.040
they wouldn't need that and which so one one direction that does sort of

49:48.040 --> 49:51.480
point you is it to make it makes you think a little bit about if phenomenology

49:51.480 --> 49:55.320
has to do with the narrator then maybe it's something unique

49:55.320 --> 49:58.600
which again would then go all the way back at the discussion of what the

49:58.600 --> 50:00.680
animal research is telling us on this topic

50:00.680 --> 50:04.120
yeah i mean i'm reluctant to say it's unique

50:04.120 --> 50:08.040
because we don't know but i would say that if it

50:08.040 --> 50:12.520
if animals have phenomenology it can't be anything like what we have with

50:12.520 --> 50:15.800
language i mean as soon as we as soon as an experience

50:15.800 --> 50:20.600
begins to develop we are labeling it and defining it and giving it meaning through

50:20.600 --> 50:23.640
our words and our history and our experiences

50:23.640 --> 50:28.520
so um you know we have 37 words in english for

50:28.520 --> 50:34.280
variance of fear and anxiety and it must be that must be an

50:34.280 --> 50:37.000
important kind of emotion for us because we have so many

50:37.000 --> 50:46.440
words for it just like that many words for snout too right

50:46.440 --> 50:50.840
and to go back to your um not understanding the difference between

50:50.840 --> 50:55.400
fear and anxiety or not accepting it um i mean so

50:55.400 --> 51:00.120
i think the the usual view i'll state stated as i know it

51:00.120 --> 51:04.200
uh which is that fear is an emotion that you experience

51:04.200 --> 51:07.960
when the threat is present or expected in imminent

51:07.960 --> 51:11.640
whereas anxiety is a worry about something that hasn't yet happened and

51:11.640 --> 51:17.640
may never happen right well i know i mean

51:17.640 --> 51:21.480
once you start digging deeper into any of these

51:21.480 --> 51:26.760
distinctions you find holes in them so where what are the holes

51:26.760 --> 51:40.680
well if i uh i recently saw that uh the you can have people uh

51:40.680 --> 51:47.160
subliminally do something and where they could cheat or not cheat

51:47.160 --> 51:53.960
and subliminally effect their views about right or wrong and religion

51:53.960 --> 51:59.240
and uh if you put in the ideas about religion

51:59.240 --> 52:05.640
they are more liable not to cheat right now is that anxiety or is that fear

52:05.640 --> 52:09.160
because what the idea is has to do with the notion of god

52:09.160 --> 52:14.280
i was just neither god is watching either no so god is watching you

52:14.280 --> 52:21.000
and god wants you to do the right thing so uh is that fear or is that anxiety

52:21.000 --> 52:24.600
why but i mean are you saying only the religious people

52:24.600 --> 52:30.680
when in that direction the people know when they introduced religious ideas

52:30.680 --> 52:35.720
and the subliminally the people cheated less

52:35.720 --> 52:39.480
because of the notion of right or wrong and the fear of god

52:39.480 --> 52:44.040
than when they didn't so let me give you a change in the example

52:44.040 --> 52:47.400
no but hey you're not going to know unless you ask the person

52:47.400 --> 52:53.160
no you want that one made that we're back to the movie projector in the

52:53.160 --> 52:59.480
movie yet no we're no no no if you if you think about fear

52:59.480 --> 53:03.720
of anxiety you yourself i like when you think about it

53:03.720 --> 53:07.400
that's the point when you when you speak about it

53:07.400 --> 53:12.280
mental when you speak about it you're going to use in certain situations

53:12.280 --> 53:16.440
the word fear when in fact with the definition that

53:16.440 --> 53:19.480
joe gave you should be using anxiety necessarily

53:19.480 --> 53:25.400
how to ask the person no that's not important okay

53:25.400 --> 53:30.120
an analyst said ask the person how they experience that

53:30.120 --> 53:33.560
some people experience god as a living presence

53:33.560 --> 53:35.640
now i'm going to go back to the experiment not

53:35.640 --> 53:38.760
what we are recruiting to so let's go back to the experiment so i can give you

53:38.760 --> 53:41.880
a very similar experiment that has nothing to do with god

53:41.880 --> 53:46.200
um john barge who's uh used to be at NYU now at yale

53:46.200 --> 53:49.960
that studies at NYU where he brought in

53:49.960 --> 53:54.280
participants in the study and had them unscramble

53:54.280 --> 53:58.920
um the blocks of war you know had the reassembled words

53:58.920 --> 54:03.000
and sentences from blocks and so there were two kinds of

54:03.000 --> 54:08.600
sentences that were scrambled like this one kind had to do with uh

54:08.600 --> 54:12.680
you know sentences about old age and another kind had to do with

54:12.680 --> 54:16.680
just random things nothing about old age and the these were all undergraduate

54:16.680 --> 54:19.640
students and so the students who unscramble sentences about

54:19.640 --> 54:23.160
old age took longer to walk down the hall afterwards

54:23.160 --> 54:26.520
just as a sign i would call that fear inside it's

54:26.520 --> 54:30.760
it's activating in non-conscious but that's an uncomfortable

54:30.760 --> 54:35.400
good let's finish let me just finish with that so the

54:35.400 --> 54:40.920
you know you had in your study they were responding to they were

54:40.920 --> 54:43.880
being jic what would they extemulate in

54:43.880 --> 54:48.040
i don't remember the details i tried this some time ago but it had to do with

54:48.040 --> 54:53.960
when they were when they subliminally introduced ideas

54:53.960 --> 55:00.360
religious right ideas then the cheating was less so we have these

55:00.360 --> 55:04.360
non-conscious schema that are kind of sitting there where they would classify

55:04.360 --> 55:07.800
information that comes in for and reaches consciousness so you can

55:07.800 --> 55:12.600
activate these schema with probes or primes like religion

55:12.600 --> 55:17.160
old age blah blah blah and then that becomes part of your conscious thought

55:17.160 --> 55:20.360
process because you've been primed to do this the classic priming thing which

55:20.360 --> 55:24.120
happens unconsciously that leads into the consciousness i don't think it has to

55:24.120 --> 55:28.040
do with fear joe's talking about unconscious schemas which we call

55:28.040 --> 55:31.400
representation he's got a much more complicated you with the mind than you

55:31.400 --> 55:35.240
do right now no that's not that that doesn't solve the

55:35.240 --> 55:38.520
the problem of the distinction between fear of anxiety

55:38.520 --> 55:42.680
but that was a sidetrack that's a good representation

55:42.680 --> 55:46.360
nobody's saying that's not the issue right it's more complicated than that

55:46.360 --> 55:50.120
that's not not i don't know what you mean by more complicated

55:50.120 --> 55:54.680
what i'm saying is there are many definitions and many attempts at

55:54.680 --> 55:58.920
distinguishing fear and anxiety and i don't find

55:58.920 --> 56:01.960
that there are any of them that are foolproof because you're looking at the

56:01.960 --> 56:05.960
definition when you were talking about it before you set fear and anxiety

56:05.960 --> 56:10.200
because if it were possible to make as clear a

56:10.200 --> 56:13.880
distinction as between fear and something else

56:13.880 --> 56:17.560
we wouldn't have this discussion so obviously a fuzzy there is something

56:17.560 --> 56:23.080
fuzzy about that distinction it's not important in psychoanalysis but it's

56:23.080 --> 56:26.600
not a question of definition you won't find the answers in words and in

56:26.600 --> 56:30.840
epistemology you have to find the answer in the mental experience

56:30.840 --> 56:36.120
and joe has shown in the brain of course you have to find it okay so you can't

56:36.120 --> 56:41.000
argue that any definition has holes in it because that's not the point of course

56:41.000 --> 56:45.640
any definition of anything that's it's the mental experience and it's neurophysiology

56:45.640 --> 56:49.720
you're totally misunderstanding because we work backwards from the concept

56:49.720 --> 56:53.880
talking about definitions and that way work backwards from where you are

56:53.880 --> 56:58.600
happening what about fear of being in the putes and

56:58.600 --> 57:01.720
anxiety being more chronic that's one of the other

57:01.720 --> 57:05.640
that's the same thing that we're talking about that fear is a response to an

57:05.640 --> 57:09.320
immediately present seems anxiety is a worry about the future but suppose we

57:09.320 --> 57:13.800
start with worry and say that the threats that we worry about

57:13.800 --> 57:18.280
are anxiety but when the threat is present it's fear

57:18.280 --> 57:21.240
no so let's say you are sitting alone at home yeah

57:21.240 --> 57:25.080
and you suddenly start thinking what if i'm alone

57:25.080 --> 57:29.000
and somebody breaks in yeah that's anxiety and then you go and you check

57:29.000 --> 57:32.040
the door double make sure it's double locked and so on

57:32.040 --> 57:36.200
is that fear or exactly sorry so for you the temporal element is

57:36.200 --> 57:40.120
is free so i so on this kind of view i can't

57:40.120 --> 57:44.200
fear that something is about to happen me i can be anxious about it

57:44.200 --> 57:49.320
if it's imminent so if you see for example a rat in a box

57:49.320 --> 57:56.360
well let's forget rats so to say that you every time you

57:56.360 --> 58:01.400
touch this bottle you get an electric shock so

58:03.160 --> 58:06.360
even though you're not touching it you know you're going to get shocked

58:06.360 --> 58:10.280
so you're you know you would say that you're afraid because it's there

58:10.280 --> 58:15.480
um whereas anxiety would be you're the next time you come here you're worried

58:15.480 --> 58:18.280
that there might be a bottle that will shock you if you come in

58:18.280 --> 58:21.400
can't we just settle this by fiat right so we're scientists right don't we get

58:21.400 --> 58:25.320
to decide what words mean yeah well i think

58:25.320 --> 58:29.000
the problem with that is that we get when we do that i mean that's what my

58:29.000 --> 58:32.280
field did a long time ago it decided fear was a

58:32.280 --> 58:35.160
non-conscious or non-subjective state motivational

58:35.160 --> 58:40.200
physiological state that connects threatening events with responses

58:40.200 --> 58:44.600
um but they called it fear and they use it to try and help people

58:44.600 --> 58:47.960
feel less fearful or anxious and explain fear and anxiety in people

58:47.960 --> 58:51.400
so when as soon as you do that you're out of the non-subjective and into the

58:51.400 --> 58:54.200
subjective and nobody makes a difference so

58:54.200 --> 58:57.880
people will go to society for neuroscience as a thousand posters on

58:57.880 --> 59:01.240
freezing rats and talking about curing anxiety

59:01.240 --> 59:05.880
in people right so i think we have to be very careful when we redefine things

59:05.880 --> 59:09.400
scientifically when we take common language words and redefine them

59:09.400 --> 59:12.840
scientifically because our cell we open ourselves in the trouble when we're

59:12.840 --> 59:15.800
talking about things that every day people experience

59:15.800 --> 59:19.960
and let me ask you my terms then so again as a as a Darwinian guy

59:19.960 --> 59:22.680
my guess is that where you're really ultimately going to be pointing to our

59:22.680 --> 59:25.960
systems that have different functions so one function might be you know what

59:25.960 --> 59:28.520
i need to incubate about something that might happen because that's going to

59:28.520 --> 59:31.080
help me down the road so i think you all agree that a certain amount of

59:31.080 --> 59:34.120
anxiety isn't such a bad idea because it

59:34.120 --> 59:37.240
potentiates planning for those virtualities are supposed threats

59:37.240 --> 59:41.240
so one kind of a system would be a a forward-looking system that maybe

59:41.240 --> 59:43.880
simulate something which might be threatening another one is

59:43.880 --> 59:48.360
a system that's designed to take appropriate evasive action

59:48.360 --> 59:50.680
given what has happened in the past and that of course fits with some of the

59:50.680 --> 59:54.120
learning stuff right so so if we start to carve the

59:54.120 --> 59:58.520
world in terms of functions instead of by fiat do you feel like that might get

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.160
us in a productive direction would that satisfy your friends at the

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.040
site? Well that is anxiety is a byproduct of the

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.720
fact that we have a brand that can imagine the future

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.680
and so you don't think it's you see a byproduct so in my

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.200
world this is what I've got semantics on my world that means you think it doesn't

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.560
have a function that it's sort of non-functional

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.600
it doesn't have a function what does it exist i mean

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.800
but the reason it's not there in virtue of the fact that it did some particular

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.960
job that I'm saying anxiety i think it's really

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.040
good

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.400
i mean i find that remarkably unlikely but you know well so you know your

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:39.960
ability to imagine how to build a building is not that

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.000
different from your building ability to imagine

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.640
that that building is going to fall down on you

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:48.920
mm-hmm well maybe it is maybe it isn't uh

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.280
i mean it seems to me uh we could have we could have the ability for this kind

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.040
of planning with respect to building in terms of

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.840
that could be an artifact manipulation system like that's working memory

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.240
allows me to think hey what if i strongly bow this way

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.760
um whereas but i mean it could be a different system although it makes use

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.720
of some of the same components where i think about what are all the things

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.440
that might go wrong that maybe i should plan for so for example maybe i should

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.160
make my building with stuff that makes the most dangerous or

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.640
unlikely that whatever um so it seems like certain kinds of anxiety seems to

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.680
me uh like you wouldn't want to suppress all kind of anxiety so

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.600
Randy Nessey who's the only psychiatrist i sort of know lives in my world and he

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.800
has this example where you know if you're a mouse and you have

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.320
any if you get anxious every time you smell you know feline urine

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.000
then so you scurry away that's kind of a good that's kind of a good thing i would

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.280
want to say i'm not anxious the math so he's not anxious at all

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.320
we should see but he's certainly one one of these

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.480
having a threat response right yeah yeah yeah i mean how would you distinguish

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.960
his behavior from the subjective state i mean the only way we can do that in

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.000
people is to ask them but yeah but yeah people can

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
lie they can but you know at least we and they can in fact your

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.640
work shows they can be wrong right so all this but framework that's not the

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.040
point the point is that in humans we're all operating with the same

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.080
kind of brain but when we go to another animal they're operating with a

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.040
different kind of brain and the way the human brain is different

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.720
isn't exactly the circuits and so forth that

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.160
allow us to experience our world they put a different way if you could

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.600
get eliminate everybody's anxiety about everything

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.920
would you do that no well absolutely not anxiety is

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.600
you know it again it allows us to anticipate the future which can be

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.760
very useful to us in many ways and that's the value of anxiety because

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.840
it allows us to uh try to charge the brain up a bit

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.240
and work on the future in a way that makes it

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.680
important rather than just oh something is going to happen in the future

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.320
yeah that's i mean that's sort of what i think too but i would say that that's

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.880
why we have in the first place now you and i can disagree about how it's

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.400
about but it's just saying that how it came about may be a spandrel

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:55.320
maybe so that you have the capacity to imagine the future

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:00.360
and when that is associated with brain arousal and other things like that

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.640
that becomes worry and what about pathology then so if it's true that

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.480
the system by and large is a pretty good job can't we can we think about

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.200
cases of pathology of social anxiety fear pights and

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.400
spiders so for example all these things you should sort of have some of that

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.360
i mean you can hear New York City right you know to be against what the

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.000
snakes do you don't want to have something that will

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.720
actually make you stay in your apartment yeah right so that's

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:27.000
me that's getting us so there's like a setting that gets slightly altered right

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.440
well maybe again maybe should stay near where i mean i'm not in your cities

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.120
oh i just ran into it i just ran into red small corner here

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.080
um so it seems like the pathology then is do something that's

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.560
useful but to set to kind of a higher to low level okay

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.960
yeah yeah but it was but psychiatrists are very simple-minded people so all we

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.640
know we if they don't leave the apartment we know something's wrong if they can't

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.440
go to a job we know something so it's a very simple bar of if it's gone to the

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.200
level where you can no longer function in society or it's significantly

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:01.960
limit your ability that's something that it does not

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.760
simply be giving you any evolutionary advantage

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.600
and that's when you try to give some medication it was my

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:17.240
kind of a of action we don't understand to that person

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:25.240
so are you saying to have anxiety as opposed to fear

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.160
you have to have cognitive function or you are saying it's true of both

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.320
i think cognitive functions are required for both exactly

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.760
but of a threat is the matter whether the threat is present or worried about

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.320
in the future but a response to a threat does not

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:48.440
require that no exactly just my opinion so that in essence

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:55.640
what your work is saying is that you can still

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:02.280
respond and protect yourself without having the cognitive component of it

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.560
exactly and that the 50 years of work done in

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:09.480
roaded models in particular have been studying that type of threat

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.800
defense of research and that's important because it's part of

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.920
it you know if this is correct we need to treat

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.000
different systems in the brain differently we have to have to have

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.360
road psychiatry from the point of view the way the brain is wired

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.840
and so it's important to have drugs that will change behavioral

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.720
inhibition i mean behavioral inhibition is often

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.000
equated with things i and i think that's you know part of the problem we use

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.760
these words and the semantics of it gets kind of lost in space and

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:37.960
to confuse things by using the same words for different things

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.560
but you're in what you're getting back to what you were saying in the future

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.600
if you could develop either a behavioral probe or some

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.880
magical nanoparticle that would just go straight to

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.680
getting to the threat and tamp down a person who is psychiatric patient who

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:59.480
had an overactive threat response system then you might then it will allow

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.520
that person to actually go to into psychotherapy for example and then

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.600
work on the yeah but that probe would probably affect the same circuit she

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.600
was asking about they're involved in positive responses to signal

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.240
yes exactly but through behavioral interactions with

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.640
the patient like through exposure specific stimuli you could be more

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.200
specific i think that you know that psychiatry has much more to gain

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.880
through behavioral than pharmaceutical approaches it's

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.160
sort of stunning that our pharmaceutical agents have worked at all

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.560
yes yeah we've given us with serotonin reuptaken hip

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.440
which are that essentially blocks all serotonin

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.600
reuptaken the entire body there's some studies that show that it doesn't

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:49.240
actually work yeah close to placebo yeah well

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.040
actually as my and my colleagues he's a he's also a psychiatrist but also a

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.080
neuroscientist at Stanford he goes psychiatrists have

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.040
used the placebo effect to maximal benefit whenever we give it

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.400
the great thing it doesn't if it doesn't have side effect like most of these drugs

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.240
have i mean i thought i have people be cured with you know sugar pills

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.640
as a placebo then with these things that have all these

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.280
personal side effects exactly exactly there's some of these really that do

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.720
work though right like maybe no i think

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.200
well my colleagues i conceptualize is that 30 years ago 40 years ago when they

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.160
were first introduced the people who had the most

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:34.360
severe untreated depression these probably did these were you got huge

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:38.120
effect sizes and then what you notice is that the effect size is kept on getting

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.000
smaller but so that there is some subset of the depression syndrome at least

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.160
that that responds to these but then we don't have those patients anymore because

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.800
they're all on these drugs so that's true

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.840
everybody's on drugs i last one more thing before we go to the

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.080
audience eric had mentioned panic attacks before

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:05.720
so panic attacks are attacks that have to do with anxiety or with fear

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:09.240
well so you know there's a specific stimulus like an

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.920
inter-aceptive stimulus stretching in the chest or

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.920
chest pain so you would say that that's a stimulus that

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.400
is probably then making you anxious and then that's causing a feed forward

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.720
loop that's if they don't always exist that that what you just said is

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.480
involved in that case and i mean that you know that the

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:36.360
truth is that let's just accept that for the purpose of this

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.080
except what i had described is fear and anxiety

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.760
but as soon as you're afraid it more thinned anxiety right so

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.000
this is snake at your feet so you have first your your fear of the snake but

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.640
immediately you begin to worry about is its poisonous will it bite me

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.240
can i get to the hospital will they have the antidote if i die will my family be

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.280
okay on and on so that's where i draw the distinction

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.520
the snake is there you have that rapid autonomic nervous system response

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.880
and then you kick into worry and that takes you forward

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.200
it will be very hard to make that distinction in

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:18.920
in to to somebody who has the snake immediately their thoughts goes those

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.160
ways right so it's inevitable in a way in those situations for one and the

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.480
other to coexist but you could also start with a

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:34.120
you know with anxiety and that you know perhaps could

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.240
how could more fit to feel that could more interfere

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.400
sure and so somebody who's anxious of crossing a bridge you take their hand

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.200
and you go towards the bridge they start getting pretty afraid

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.600
but next thing to know they leave your hand and run the other way

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.840
Ed also gave an example where anxiety morphs into fear maybe

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.960
did i lock the door not then the person gets up to check whether they lock the

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.880
door not

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.960
i don't want to go up at the event but something i've done very interesting

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.560
you talk about the pharmaceutical approaches and you talk about

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.680
maybe more of the kind of homological approaches are experiential

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.640
when you talk about drugs like all those visions don't seem to combine both of

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:22.360
those properties throughout biologicals and they're

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.760
seemingly very intense and experiential

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.960
um does this interest any of you or um how that's

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.840
it's how these drugs both combine these experiences and yet

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.320
they're not steady as often as you think it's a lot of work now on the

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.880
one yeah yeah who is new to us and it's due that came out in the last two weeks

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:51.240
yeah yeah well yeah what about the whole brain

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.800
connectivity under LSD but as a therapeutic tool to a lot of

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.400
yeah stuff it's happening i don't know it mentioned LSD

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.120
i did

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.240
you recommended it and also um there is a

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.960
one a decade ago we would not be having this conversation but that

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:19.320
now one of the most important or most highly studied drugs for depression

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.320
is ketamine because it is and that in order and the idea

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.000
for the way ketamine works is that there is the belief that you have to

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.760
actually have this sort of dissociative experience

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.680
in order for it to be effective so this pharmaceutical industry have made

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.360
ketamine like drugs that don't have this dissociative experience

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.040
which have fewer side effect profiles and now them work as well

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.160
there's something that they think is magical about

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:48.440
there's some big news on ketamine this week that just came out and you study

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.000
showing that its effects are due to some metabolic

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.880
so the glutamate so the metabolites of ketamine that was actually

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.800
yeah and the idea that the main target for ketamine had always been thought of

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.200
one glutamate receptor subtype called the NMDA receptor and now they think it's

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.520
the other subtype called the AMPA so the metabolite might be the active

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.480
version of it but you know but these are all grad studies

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.760
we know one has yet there are the human studies are

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.880
ongoing right now so it's not clear whether or not

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.480
that causes the metabolite might not cause a dissociative effect

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.200
that's the key actually I um there's this

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.840
there was a studies going on about NYU and Johns Hopkins and at least

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.160
I read about it last spring on psilocybin where

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:41.960
and I don't know if you're familiar with that but with people who are

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.520
in people with cancer who are dying and have

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:51.240
death anxiety they've been taking they've been taken on psilocybin

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.400
trips and the images that they've been encountering

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.720
help eliminate the anxiety and apparently the anxiety after six months is still

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.000
not there so I don't know if you're familiar with that study but it just

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.960
goes to the other questioner thank you

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.480
so first of all I just want to say mr. Lidue you got a little Matthew McConaughey

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.960
in your voice

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.720
I'm from Louisiana I think that's what

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.200
Texas is saying

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:30.200
so did you talk about the you know the circle thing

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:34.120
the thing that I have a question about is and maybe this isn't the appropriate

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:38.840
way to ask it and maybe it's a simplistic way to view the mind

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:45.240
but my question is whether or not minds that are considered creative or

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:51.800
logical have different effects in the feeling of anxiety and fear

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.680
for example somebody who might be considered more creative

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:59.160
a creative thinker having more experience of anxiety

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.280
than fear in a logical thinker because of the

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.360
eminent threat right going on the definition of time

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.080
having the effects right in front of them so I just I just be or the the

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.560
threat right in front of them so I'm just curious

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.160
about your perspective on the kind of the the duality of the brain in that

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.000
sense and its effects on fear and anxiety

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.200
I may say conceptually it seems right that the person who is more creative

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.400
and more imaginative and you know doing all these kind of

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.000
anticipatory things are separated the other not necessarily out there in the

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.600
present world would perhaps be more prone to anxiety

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.960
I don't know if that's actually the case

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.280
okay is that is that would you I mean is that

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.560
a good way to look at it or do you think it's flawed in in that sense I mean is

01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:01.240
it flawed to to think with this topic right or

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.760
and left brain or logical I think that's right right left brain

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:13.720
I mean that you know the the brain right and left comes from primarily from

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.600
what the split brain work and there you have left and right for sure but the

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.920
in the normal brain everything is connected and

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:24.760
crossing and integrated and so while it's not

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.320
appropriate to think about our hemispheres controlling different aspects of

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.560
personality this that doesn't mean that we don't

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.880
some people want more logical and others more spatial and imaginative or so

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.720
forth in their personality traits it's just not perhaps not

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.520
separated so neatly in terms of the brain but maybe the way you can think

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.560
about it is that if an anxious person manages to help their anxiety by

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.240
being creative that's a good way to deal with it

01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:02.920
and constructive way to transform the anxiety into a positive thing

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:08.200
didn't got a nigga didn't got a nigga feel there were things from the right

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:14.200
brain and from the left brain in non separated laws

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.080
we have to grow up and separate from our parents

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.720
isn't language still a little bit

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.240
language not a lot of language has he changed has he changed his position

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.760
he's not so left right I mean he's still you know he's got a little bit of

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.720
connection to that but he's not as strong as you will

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.720
I mean some functions are more left or more right I think face perception is

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.240
more in the right having sphere language for in the left but doesn't mean

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.320
but because the causal connection are so huge and efficient and everything

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.240
it's there is never anything that only happens in the one side and stays there

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:53.720
hi thanks a lot for this talk it's been really educated

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.720
the the the the discussion that you guys were having about

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.680
fear and anxiety that's been going on in the literature for a long time

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.880
I you know and I know that you've been talking a lot about clarifying terminology

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:13.080
I wonder if it wouldn't be better to talk about this rather as a stress

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:19.000
response system and to look at it temporarily because of the fact that

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.800
we're really what we're talking about is you know the urgency of response

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.600
and what level of the nervous system is going to trigger that response so

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.880
if you're in a dark alley and somebody touches you in the back

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.160
there is going to be an immediate response and the representation that's

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.400
going to be this there is going to be a very low level reflex

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.360
and then the next level would be perhaps at the habit system if you're

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.240
a karate guy you know and you have developed these skills over the years

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.800
then you would have more sophisticated representation of your response

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.080
to that situation and then you know if you're watching a movie of somebody being

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:06.040
robbed then you're you're able to access a higher level of representation

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.840
and abstraction and you might ask whether he had a good relationship with his mother

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:16.600
you know that he's you know robbing things. I think the analysis you

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.120
described is dead on but I wouldn't call it a stress system because that's a

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.720
whole other part of you know my pile of baggage and well I

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.400
I'm sure that people have more sophisticated or

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:32.040
very specific way of talking about stress but when you're talking about like the

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:36.120
amygdala and stuff like that you know so much literature has been devoted to

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.040
you know the fear response and things like that but the amygdala is also

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.360
has positive valence as well as negative valence

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:51.960
and when you connect the amygdala with and the extended amygdala with the

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.640
the peri-actyl-so-gray and the hippocampus

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.120
then you're you've got a system that is

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:06.680
addressing different stimuli and classifying that and evaluating

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.680
and and then creating responses according to those schemes. Right my

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.960
solution to that is to talk about defensive survival circuits. Survival

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.520
circuits one of which is defense others are

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.760
dealing with other kinds of biologically significant activities so

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:24.360
but I think you know we're on the same page

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:32.280
all right my question

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:38.200
thank you yes would you mention the typical examples of

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.480
spiders and snakes in eliciting fear and or anxiety

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.720
and wouldn't possibly be an altering factor be

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.200
an expertise and knowledge and be able to differentiate which ones are lethal

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:55.400
and which ones aren't lethal affect your reaction to it because only a small

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.880
percentage of snakes are in fact you know venomous

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:04.040
and and and those are aren't that are dangerous

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:09.320
you know maybe the large constrictors and spiders all of them technically have

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.360
venom but only if you are potent enough to

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.960
affect us and then I know if it's out by now if I saw a

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.320
black widow spider or brown recluse from the pattern I would know

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.920
you know that there were bad news when it's ranchola if it bit me I'd probably

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.840
experience something like a beast thing rather than that

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.440
but so I'm spider I don't think I wouldn't think twice about it

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:34.520
so I guess that he was with that could that alter someone's response or

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.280
you know I mean that the as you guys can say better than me but

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.840
the phobias are not sensitive to information and logic

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.680
so there's no amount of reasoning so this is not dangerous and this is is going

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.720
to change the response to the snake and he says I understand right I was

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.440
saying it's medically encoded like in never doubles that you're going to be

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.600
panic if you see something in a broader classification even though it's not

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.120
venom even though it's not dangerous it's a better to react

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:06.120
too many times than to miss one time so so it's very to react to a known venomous

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:10.280
snake than then thing oh yeah well maybe not and you know so

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.040
so we are we are primed to have quick reactions to

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.040
things of a category that are potentially I just don't want to squander it on

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.080
those are like the reserve it for those things they could actually

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.360
harm me yeah and that way not waste that way

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.720
anxiety on something that's uh the time but we we talking about things that

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.480
are happening in in less than a hundred milliseconds you don't have time to do

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:34.280
all these you know thinking analysis that you have a cross

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.560
on it or not the thing of knowledge is accumulate over a period time that you

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:42.280
could recognize instantly uh in less than a hundred milliseconds

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.160
yeah it's also not that simple because there's lots of

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.280
mimicry among poisonous critters in nature right so

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.600
apismatic coloring right so that just means that

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.280
if i'm a non-poisonous snake and there's a poisonous snake that kind

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.480
looks like me selection is going to favor me looking even more like the

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:00.280
poisonous guy because the benefits i get from other critters being afraid of

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.240
me so it's actually so there's two things one is

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.080
there's a problem of maximizing expected value which means false you know

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.120
you do a lot of false positives and try to avoid misses

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.240
but the other one is mimicry really undermines these systems and they move

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:16.040
faster than uh we probably do in terms of the

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.400
selective history it's a problem but he does have a point

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:25.080
about education helping with fear and that's basic to human learning

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:35.080
um i have a question which may be a slight detour um but uh

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.960
um speaking as a layperson and particularly a layperson in terms of the

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.760
way in which most of the question is being addressed in terms of remedy

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.560
um cause and remedy and um so my question is really about

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:54.840
fear as not what happens to create fear but what happens

01:22:54.840 --> 01:23:01.880
when we have fear and is so various questions related questions

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:07.720
about that what is that what's it doing what does it do is it bad

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:13.320
when is it good can it be used what happens when conflicting fears

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:17.880
come together what does that feel like and what does that makers do

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:23.720
and um also thinking about uh this is uh i had a

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.120
sidetracked to the sidetracked um talking about fear is temporal

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.600
i'm thinking we can imagine the present too we can be in a present situation

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.920
and obviously we don't necessarily know everything about situation that we're

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.680
in and it may be an ongoing situation or situation that's not like

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.960
a appearance of snakes can be something that goes on for

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.200
half an hour or an a half whatever um and so

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.800
what's our imagination about a situation that we're actually in

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:56.040
which is not necessarily a bad thing um and i'm not again not talking about

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.240
necessarily the remedial

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:07.240
speechless

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:12.440
i think probably we agree with what you're saying that there's a complex series

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.800
uh that one can't substitute for another we got into that discussion

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:23.320
about the snake automatically triggering the neurophysiology very rapidly of

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.600
fear but whether that is fear or what we mean by fear and the higher

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.840
cortical representation of that uh which doesn't mean that that doesn't

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.800
happen uh and it doesn't always mean that that happens

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:37.640
they're actually related but different and so when you're describing different

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:42.120
categories of complexity essentially i think most of us

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.680
sitting here would say right on but i think maybe the essence of my

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:51.880
question is about whether fear can be good and what we can do for example

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:55.720
about going inside fear rather than necessarily

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.640
going to the solution of getting rid of it yes i think i think

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.000
all of us would agree from the adaptive to the psychoanalytic

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.600
right i mean from an evolutionary perspective i mean yeah i mean if you

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.960
imagine what it would be like for our ancestors who felt no fear they were

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.520
not our ancestors because they're dead they got

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.440
they got bitten by snakes they got the snake or they were sticking their

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.480
hand in the fire whatever they were doing if they work out so well so

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:23.880
there's no doubt uh at least not in my mind um that fear is a very functional

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.240
part of the architecture we need our fear yeah right um

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.800
and not just that but it's got to be complicated because there's lots of

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.600
things that are threatening to people uh there's pathogens and there's other

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:37.000
people and there's big cats and uh you know where we're at evolutionary time

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.800
there were lots of ways that you could come to an end i mean we're really

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.280
complicated the thing about complicated things is

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.840
if you just perturbed them a little bit they become damaged and no longer able to

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.240
work right so to keep us healthy you got to do all this

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:52.200
cool stuff but to disable it's all i need is a little ice

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.920
peck and i'm done i mean it's really simple to disorder

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:59.320
very and you know complicated systems so fear is basically the way to say look

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.600
here's a thing in the world that could damage me could harm my fitness

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:06.040
interests and then motivate me to take appropriate action

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.480
now for some reason we have phenomenology associated with that

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.840
maybe we don't need that but at least insofar as the

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.360
reactions to the stimuli those are definitely good for us and

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.560
yes if you were insufficiently afraid then you would be in in big trouble

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.760
and the other way too right so some of the clinical friends can tell us about

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.160
the dangers of being too afraid of the world so that you stay in your

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:32.840
apartment which here i'm understanding i was very small

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.200
which is a great reason for everyone to move to Philadelphia anyway

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.960
um so so sure and then if you're asking about the

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:43.320
phenomenology i mean i i think that's a hard question

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:47.160
why does it feel like something to be afraid i i think you could ask that of

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.640
why does it feel like something to be anything

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.240
and that's that's hard i think you know some of the things that we've heard

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.480
here especially joe and others work has spoken

01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.400
that a little bit no okay i'm still uh here in the

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.200
remedial even inside the embracing of the fear but

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.400
okay thank

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.480
hi thanks for letting us listen in um i have a question that i i hope kind of

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:20.440
ties things together because it has a couple of components and

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:25.400
things that have come up and one of them is um let's say last night i had a dream

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.400
of falling and one of the things that we talked about

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.080
was mice and one of the things we talked about was humans

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.520
but we didn't really talk about the in between very much in terms of the

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.360
complexity of brains and processes that can happen

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.120
my understanding or at least i think that there's some question that that

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:48.120
dream of falling comes from great ancestors back in the day

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.400
and to me that would seem like something that's anxious

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.440
and so i wonder about anxiety and fear and primates and things that are more

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.800
advanced though they don't have a clear language

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.480
but they have some form of communication how much information has been garnered

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:09.640
from that kind of study well because we can't ask them we

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.080
have to just go on their behavior and so when we're

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.720
looking at behavior if depending on how close we want to stick to the data we

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:23.320
can describe it in terms of their threat responses or the responses to danger

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.320
and uh leave it at that or we can speculate about things that we can't

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:30.200
prove which would be to say that there's a state of fear that

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.040
intervenes between processing of the threat

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:38.520
and the control of the responses so at this point it's a matter of

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.120
where what your comfort level with is and what your approach to the science of

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:46.280
it is whether you want to put that subjective experience in the middle

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.280
of the responses when we know from human studies that

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.840
you don't need that experience in order to get some of these responses

01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:00.600
the dream of falling comes into the dream i mean it's like a very

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.840
cognitively up there sort of thing and so to me

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.480
i do think that that's something that you know animals i mean i watch my

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:15.240
pet's dream and they twitch and whine and i imagine they have anxiety

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.400
when that happens and fear i just it's so i don't want to try to

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.360
separate it so i go home every day i pet my cat and he

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:26.600
hers and i think he's feeling good and so we're good together and that's fun

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.200
but when i'm in the lab i can't allow myself that kind of

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.640
supposition so you can feel whatever you want about

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:38.040
the interesting thing about animal dreams is you know that these studies

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:42.520
where they would cut the thing that's when you dream you're paralyzed

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:47.240
when you and and you can but but if you cut that and you let the motor

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.080
system work in cats you can see that their cats is rehearsing everything

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:53.960
that makes a cat a cat i mean they attack the he's

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:58.040
the they've made they have all these dreams that that

01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:03.720
sort of reinforce all the circuitry that that is important for their

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.800
species so i think that's animals do dream it but i think it's rehearsal

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.320
of of of things that happen in the day

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:16.120
is that also true of humans i don't think and the IRB has approved that

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.560
experiment but wait there's a separate question

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.000
the question is do you think that that one function of human dream name i

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.040
very well be to practice the sort of things that we as humans yes if you

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:29.560
ask people what they dream about that's a significant proportion

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:33.800
mark here we get your influence

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:39.080
as you say we can't make the same cut in humans

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.160
severing locus through lius from

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:46.200
motor neurons there is a naturally occurring condition

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:50.440
rim behavior disorder which is due to a degenerative process in the

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.320
midbrain which is sort of roughly the same area

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.400
and so we do have humans who act out their dreams

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:01.480
and the interesting thing is if you go with your statement that what the cats

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.760
do is everything that makes them a cat

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.040
what humans do is mostly aggressive

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.160
very very aggressive but to the point that it is

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:17.480
quite dangerous to your sleeping partner if you have rim behavior disorder

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:24.040
it's better if you're single than maybe it makes you aggressive to have

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:29.080
rim behavior disorders or maybe we come from an evolutionary history that

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.880
turn on a lot of aggression among our species

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.840
oh there's more questions i didn't realize

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:38.760
yeah um i think we've pretty much resolved the issue that

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:44.920
anxiety is a necessary part of human mental experience and we would be in

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:50.040
bad shape if we didn't have it um one thing that also is specifically

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.440
human is super ego anxiety so i'm wondering if there's been

01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.520
any attempt to study what circuitry might be involved when some kind of

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.080
stimulus that stimulates super ego anxiety

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.240
supposed to just something like a snake can you describe what that would be

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.240
yes what Ed said about the religion being

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:15.160
you know religion and then you don't write it was Ed's question that actually

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:18.840
got me thinking about this whether there would be some way to

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:24.360
elicit that kind of response by showing a stimulus that has to do with

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.840
something that would arouse a super ego response like seeing something like

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:32.440
torture right um i'm just wondering if there's been

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:38.840
any study of pathways that would be so specifically human

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:44.440
that would have to do with anxiety um i don't know anything but it could

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.480
be there the only thing that i know that's getting

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.400
slightly close to that is an experiment that we've done and it's not published

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:56.360
but we had uh mip student taken oath and then

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.960
have an experiment do an experiment where they could cheat or not

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:03.560
and they would make money and those who were

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:07.000
under oath and it was not to a god or anything it was to the to their

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.600
university and uh first they cheated less and when they were losing money

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.080
because they were telling the truth the whole actually reward system was

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:23.560
going up so it was rewarding to lose lose because you were under oath and

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:29.080
your heads were not to cheat so that's the thing that can get

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.640
that that's a good thing about some humans

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:44.040
well you folks succeeded in arousing quite a number of thoughts and

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:48.680
questions in my mind but let me start with

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:53.000
thought experiment can you imagine that you are

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.760
new and that you are migrating in the searingeti in africa

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:04.760
and suddenly you look around and you see many other news are running like crazy

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:10.200
so you you're joined and run now uh you have not been

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:14.840
not been frightened by a snake uh you have not been told

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:20.280
something as dangerous as no communication nobody has said anything

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.160
so uh and another matter about it is that these

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:30.200
news although they may be uh especially if they're old and wounded

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:34.520
uh they may be susceptible to being attacked by lions or other

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:41.240
things but they have probably survived many more generations because they

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:45.240
don't live as long as humans but quite a long time

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.400
without speech and without fear and without anxiety or at least if they

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:55.400
have it that we don't know about and as a matter of fact there are other

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.280
species which have been around much longer than that

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.440
like turtles turtles have been around for a long long time

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:10.520
so the question of what is the use of consciousness and fear and anxiety and

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.800
all the attempts we make to make distinctions

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.080
uh what what good is it that's uh that's one thing

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:28.600
uh second the second point is about uh the placebo effect

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.000
now uh what do we know about the placebo effect

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.440
uh when i was a fellow and after my psychiatrist residency

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.560
i worked with the with more riser it was a period when

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:49.960
uh psychosomatics was changing from being explained by Freudian concepts

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:54.440
like an ulcer is what happens when you incorporate your mother

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.880
and she's biting in the stomach and it changed to

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.080
what are the physiological accomodiments of

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.360
hypertension and so on and we did a little funky experiment

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:15.640
uh which uh was that we we just got some

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:20.760
subjects and we put them on a couch and we had them look at a light

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.160
that flashed a subliminal flat just so that you know that there was

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:29.160
flashed there was nothing in it other people were trying to

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:35.560
describe how uh let's say a rebus uh in in such a thing could

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.360
stimulate thoughts fantasies and so forth we just asked these people

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.600
to close their eyes after they hadn't seen this light

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:49.000
and let's let something come to mind so picture come to mind

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.840
then they could draw it and then they could tell give it a title

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.280
and we came to a conclusion which is not so

01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.080
remarkable that the main effect of the experiment had to do with how they

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.360
conceived of it and what their relationship was

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.560
to the experimenter and some people well the activation

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.800
uh was i think kept me out of the army and that at the time of the

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:19.800
Vietnamese war because i think that the CIA this had something to do with

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.960
a lie detector test because we we used skin resistance among other

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.440
things and you could chart this and then you could compare

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.720
with what they imaged and what they drew and one very impressive person

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:38.520
at least i was very impressed drew a picture of Don Drysdale throwing a ball

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.760
and it was coming right to him and this was going boom boom boom

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:48.200
boom and then after after a few minutes

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:53.080
everything calmed down and when we asked if he could remember what he

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.000
what he had done that was left out he forgot he was a sort of a

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.080
went into a doves after we were very curious about this

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.240
but we couldn't get refunded so i gave up

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:11.640
the thing but uh you know that this is that there is a negative

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:17.400
aspect of placebo effect also and uh it's also

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.560
it's been very very interesting to me that people say

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.680
that we have to compensate for the for the placebo effect because

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:31.000
it may give a beneficial result when the drug isn't doing it and so on so

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.760
forth but it also depends on how the experiment is set up i would

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:39.320
think and how the person responds to it whether it's positive or negative

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.680
and it's very important of course and but it also goes back to the other

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:50.760
point about the the new the ganoo's uh there is so much

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.080
communication between animals and between humans

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.800
which is not on a verbal level but which has

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:02.920
obviously got complicated content and communications

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:11.960
uh and how we can really learn by just depending on the words what the

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:17.320
report is of something now the last week or a week before i had a

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:21.080
tia and i was sitting in a meeting with some other

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.760
some colleagues and psych psychoanalysts from france

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.160
and i was uh having a happy conversation with one of these people when it

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.440
came about that i couldn't talk i couldn't make words i couldn't think of

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:37.400
how to speak and i just had to sit there

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:42.440
uh but i'm and i must but i must tell you if you asked me how that felt was i

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:46.840
fearful was i i wasn't fearful and i was an anxious

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.680
after it went away and i started going to doctors

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.840
and they were going through all kinds of possible diagnoses and this and that

01:39:54.840 --> 01:40:00.200
they're like not anxious okay uh in retrospect

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.240
i knew that it was uh you know somehow hazardous

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.680
but i mean all of this is uh churning around in my mind that i thank you

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.040
for it maybe i'll do something thank you

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.760
last question so um also want to add my voice to come

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.480
but in a lot of these i've been a lot of these sessions this was one of the

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:29.640
best i've ever been to this was i think a really really terrific

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.920
discussion and i i treat PTSD for a living so

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.760
um nevertheless i found that you were able to

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:39.720
uh manage to interest me as well as people who were

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:43.480
in all different levels there were two just two very simple clinical

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:45.400
observations i i don't feel comfortable

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:48.280
uh leading this discussion without making the point that the

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.680
it's very common right now to talk about the placebo effective SSRIs

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:55.720
and i have to completely agree with friends as both from my clinical

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.400
experience with about 10 000 severely depressed in patients over a course

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.680
of a lifetime and my own recurrent severe depressions

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:07.720
that SSRIs are incredibly effective when that and it's really dangerous

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.680
um if we don't make that clear to people on the outside

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.120
um that what's happened is diagnostic creep so that there are a lot of people

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:17.880
who are on SSRIs who maybe it wouldn't be but for severe depression

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.840
i don't think there's i've just seen it too many times seen it with other

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.880
peace people and in myself it's a light switch and it makes a huge

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.280
difference life saving difference and i think

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:30.040
within the scientific discourse about about that we have to be clear because

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:32.840
there's already too much resistance to taking medication when people with

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:38.600
severe depression point one um so uh second point point point is

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.880
that in treating lots and lots of PTSD patients i found that one of the most

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.000
i do exposure therapy and things but one of the most effective things

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.800
that i've done is that it just sort of stumbled on this is at the beginning of

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:53.400
the whole treatment process i will say to the patient and usually these have

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.400
been non-sophisticated uh psychologically non-sophisticated

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:04.280
people cops firemen metal workers other 9-11 exposed people will say you know

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.840
the issue here is that um your life your feelings and your behavior are run by

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.000
a committee inside of your head and you are not invited to committee

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.880
meetings and the goal of this is to get you invited to give many meetings

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:22.440
it's a very simple metaphor but it's the metaphor about the non unity of mind

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.520
which i think we have such an evolutionarily powerful drive to have a sense of

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.200
unity of mind um that when you tell this to people it's an

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.280
incredible sense of relief and an incredible new model for them thank you

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:54.200
bravo
