WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
A Madner Session Director of the Healing Center.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
Today's program is on French Surrealism, a revolution of the mind.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
It was organized by Anne-Marie Levine, who is sitting there,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
and who's also agreed to take charge of the program

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
we will be developing during the next year, which will be more oriented

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
towards literature and the humanities in addition to the usual science programs that we do.

00:29.000 --> 00:37.000
Just a few words, I would say, but Anne-Marie, before she introduces the rest of the panelists,

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
Anne-Marie is a poet and visual artist who began writing while touring as a concert pianist.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
She's the author of three books of poetry, Uphobia, Bosphrite to a Blue Movie and Oral History

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
and is working on an artist's book called Rekulep of Musote.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
Her work also appears in various journals and anthologies such as poetry after 9-11,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
literature as meaning and literature after 9-11.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
She's published essays on Gertrude Stein's politics on trauma and art,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
and on context, and has received grants from the NYFA,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Puffin and Woga Stein Foundations for her work.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
She occasionally performs solo theater pieces based on her poems.

01:24.000 --> 01:33.000
She's as well a maker of box art, miniature paintings on wood and digital prints exhibited throughout the country.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Thank you, Anne-Marie.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Thank you.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Anne, welcome.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
We're going to each talk for 10 to 15 minutes, and then we'll have some conversation amongst ourselves,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
and then we'll open it up to questions from the audience.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And I'm going to start with the sort of introduction.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
It seems to me my task today is to provide some historical background, context,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
the names you'll be hearing, and some sense of the meaning of the surrealist movement,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
the Rezon D'Etcla for our choice of subject today.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
The ability to remain in a state of expectation and openness to chance

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
is the cine quanon of the surrealist poetic experience.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
And the second quote says that the central project of surrealism

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
is the resolution of the contradiction between dream and reality.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
The movement called surrealism is 90 years old this year.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
It emerged in 1924 out of French poet Angléville-Tones first manifesto

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
and became arguably the most important artistic movement of the 20th century,

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
global in its reach and becoming, I think, part of our collective unconscious.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
It has influenced advertising, images, features of our daily life

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
that we don't even realize reach back to the surrealist aesthetic.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
More about this during the program.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Perhaps the best indication of surrealism's influence

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
is the fact that the word itself has become part of everyday language.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
In the visual arts, in particular, all one has to do to gauge surrealism's impact

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
is list the names of those who are directly involved in or deeply influenced by surrealism.

03:14.000 --> 03:22.000
Georgia DeCurico, Francis Picabia, Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, Hans Arpe,

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Andre Masson, Max Ernst, Man Ray, Salvador Dally, Juan Miro, Luis Bonuel,

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
Alberto Giacometti, your name Agritte, Henri Garcia Boson, Eve Tongi,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Arshill Gorky, and Joseph Cornell to name a few.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
You may not know, though, that surrealism began as a literary movement,

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
led by Henri Bloton, with some scorn for the visual and the oral.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
He only accepted visual arts somewhat later when he acknowledged that the visual

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
is the most powerful of the senses.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Painters from all around the world flock to join the movement

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
and are probably better known to you than the poets, the originators,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
some of whom I should thus name.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
For example, Bloton himself, always the driving force.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
Philippe Supoe, Louis Aragon, Antonio Arto, René Craville, Robert Desnos,

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Paul Elois, Michel Léres, Bezier Mapére, René Charr, and Tristan Sarra,

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
who was one of the founders of the data movement, which directly preceded the surrealist movement.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
So although based in France, surrealism was an international movement,

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
but surrealism became a movement because it pursued principles that led from the mainly destructive

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
to the constructive, from theory to practice.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
It intended to open up something buzzing or dinging?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
No.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
It intended to open up areas of thought beyond reality and reason.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Indeed, it intended to become a way of life.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
As I said, surrealism originated as a literary movement that experimented with a new mode of expression

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
called automatic writing, which sought to release the unbridled imagination of the unconscious.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Surrealism became an international, intellectual, and political movement.

05:11.000 --> 05:18.000
Porto, a trained psychiatrist along with French poets Aragon, Elois, and Supoe were influenced

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
by the psychological theories and dream studies of Sigmund Freud and the political ideas of Karl Marx.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
Using Freudian methods of free association, their poetry and prose drew upon the private world

05:30.000 --> 05:36.000
of the mind, traditionally restricted by reason and societal limitations to produce surprising

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
unexpected imagery.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
The cerebral and irrational tenets of surrealism find their ancestry in the clever and whimsical

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
disregard for tradition fostered by data as a decade earlier.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
So the organized surrealist movement in Europe dissolved with the onset of World War II,

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
Blaton, Dali, Ernst, Masson, and others, including the Chilean artist Mata, left Europe for New York.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
The movement found renewal in the United States at Peggy Guggenheim's Gallery, Art of the Century,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
and at the Grian LeVee Gallery.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
In 1940, Blaton organized the fourth international surrealist exhibition in Mexico City,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.000
which included the Mexicans Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Surrealism's surprising imagery, deep symbolism, refined painting techniques, and disdain for

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
convention influenced later generations of artists as well, including Joseph Cornell and Arsho Gorky,

06:34.000 --> 06:41.000
whose work formed a sort of link between surrealism and the later abstract expressionism.

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
Blaton's manifestos speak to the surrealist methodology, the use of techniques such as automatic writing,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
reduced hallucinations, word games like the exquisite corpse.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You may hear more about that later.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
To make manifest repressed mental activities.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
The second manifesto lays out the surrealist view of reality and expresses the surrealist desire

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
to open the vistas of the arts through the close observation of the dream state and the free play of thought.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
New vistas of artistic imagery and activity were opened up by surrealism, so much so that

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
it completely altered the popular notion of what art is.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
As I said, perhaps the best indication of surrealism's influence is simply the fact that the word itself

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
has become a part of everyday language.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
And I'll end by telling you of an event which took place in New York City way after World War II,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
probably in the 80s.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Someone put together a panel on surrealism with the title,

07:41.000 --> 07:49.000
what if anything does surrealism mean to us today or does surrealism have any relevance today,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
something like that?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
The best answer I think was American sculptor David Hairs.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
He had been associated with the French surrealist painters and poets in New York.

07:59.000 --> 08:07.000
He said, it keeps open that hole in our heads, letting in sunshine and other pleasant surprises.

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
And then I thought, I would just read you one...

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
And it's called, I've told you.

08:17.000 --> 08:26.000
I've told you for the clouds, told you for the ocean's tree, for each wave, for birds in leaves,

08:26.000 --> 08:34.000
for the small stones of sound, for the familiar hands, for the eye becoming face or landscape,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
and sleep restores color to the sky for the whole night consumed.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
For the grill work of roads, for the window opened for a forehead-beared,

08:44.000 --> 08:52.000
I've told you for your thoughts, your words, every caress, every confidence survives.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And then in French...

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
I didn't realize.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
It was about amb props to your voices,

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
and you rallied together by earning cardards in the age of 60,000 cases,

09:17.000 --> 09:45.680
and I'd like to spend a little more time talking about that.

09:45.680 --> 09:52.600
This is called the Doctor is Unconscious, Surrealism's Freudian Slips.

09:52.600 --> 09:57.960
Let's begin with an appropriately Freudian question, what does Surrealism want?

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
If you ask an American, it wants to be an avant-garde art movement.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.880
For your average Frenchman, it wants to revolutionize literature.

10:05.880 --> 10:10.800
But to Andre Breton, its founder and prime theorist, Surrealism wanted first and foremost

10:10.800 --> 10:13.000
to be a science.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.200
Notice how Breton defines Surrealism in 1924 in the first manifesto.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.960
Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express verbally by means

10:23.960 --> 10:29.680
of the written word or in any other manner the actual functioning of thought.

10:29.680 --> 10:34.000
What Breton was aiming for, in other words, was not a radical new artistic or literary

10:34.000 --> 10:38.840
technique, but nothing less than a road map of the mind.

10:38.840 --> 10:43.480
Breton poetry were not ends in themselves, but means to explore the hidden byways of human

10:43.480 --> 10:44.480
consciousness.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.800
Now let's jump back a decade.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.840
The year is 1913.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.960
Breton was 17 years old, and like most young men, he has to choose a career.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.280
His parents, like all parents, want him to choose something prestigious, naval officer

10:59.280 --> 11:01.080
or engineer.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.280
But young Andre will have none of this.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.760
So for lack of better, and because he thinks it will afford him the most free time, he

11:07.760 --> 11:13.240
helps for medical school.

11:13.240 --> 11:17.760
The following year the war comes, and Breton, on the basis of not much training at all, is

11:17.760 --> 11:22.080
sent to the front as a medical orderly.

11:22.080 --> 11:27.600
By 1916, Breton has been assigned to the neuropsychiatric center at San Dzier, and it is there that

11:27.600 --> 11:32.000
he first encounters psychiatric medicine, particularly the theories of Sigmund Freud.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.680
Now let's recall that in France at that time, Freud was considered either cutting edge or

11:36.680 --> 11:39.720
a crackpot when he was considered at all.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.240
Indeed, Freud's writings were still five years away from being translated into French,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.720
and Breton learned of them only second-hand.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.040
Nonetheless, he became a passionate admirer.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.600
In the 1924 manifesto, he went out of his way to give, quote, thanks to the discoveries

11:55.600 --> 12:02.200
of Sigmund Freud, who very rightly brought his critical faculties to bear upon the dream.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.200
The importance of this is revealed a few pages later, when Breton formulates one of

12:06.200 --> 12:11.600
Surrealism's guiding principles as, the resolution of these two states, dream and reality, which

12:11.600 --> 12:18.160
are seemingly so contradictory into a kind of absolute reality, or surreality.

12:18.160 --> 12:23.120
Medicine, in other words, and specifically psychoanalysis, were part of Surrealism's DNA

12:23.120 --> 12:26.160
from the very start.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.880
It was also in San Dzier that Breton first made the connection fundamental to Surrealism

12:30.880 --> 12:33.800
between poetry and mental illness.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.640
Breton's rounds at the psychiatric center consisted of interviewing patients suffering

12:37.640 --> 12:41.800
from that new category of wartime trauma, shell shock.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.720
This was no mere exercise.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.880
If the interviewing physician thought you were simply trying to avoid combat duty, you could

12:47.880 --> 12:50.360
be imprisoned or shot.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.920
For Breton, however, the medical legal aspects of these interviews were unimportant.

12:54.920 --> 12:59.280
What excited him were the unusual phrasings his patients used.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.760
To his friend Theodore Frankl, another medical student, he raved about the aside.

13:03.760 --> 13:08.160
Astonishing images that emerged from these conversations on a higher plane than those

13:08.160 --> 13:10.560
that would occur to us.

13:10.560 --> 13:16.200
Frankl, of a more sardonic bent, remarked that Breton, in his nutcase hospital, is moved

13:16.200 --> 13:22.080
and horrified to see patients who are better poets than he is.

13:22.080 --> 13:26.160
This is a good place to highlight one fundamental difference between the science of psychoanalysis

13:26.160 --> 13:28.760
and the protoscience of Surrealism.

13:28.760 --> 13:32.160
Where Freud and his followers look to the patient's discourse as a guide for treatment

13:32.160 --> 13:37.160
and cure, Breton's interests lay purely in the manifest content and the stranger the

13:37.160 --> 13:38.360
better.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.720
The last thing he wanted was to reintegrate the Analizand into society.

13:43.720 --> 13:47.920
We can therefore consider it a boon to patients everywhere that whatever interest Andre Breton

13:47.920 --> 13:52.600
might have had in practicing medicine ended with the war.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.440
Instead he took away from his experiences a lifelong fascination with the resources of

13:56.440 --> 14:00.520
the unconscious and with modes of expression that were unlike anything the rational mind

14:00.520 --> 14:02.440
could produce.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.760
This fascination soon led to the exploration of automatic writing or writing without conscious

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
control.

14:07.760 --> 14:11.760
Here's how Breton later described his discovery of it.

14:11.760 --> 14:16.640
Completely occupied as I still was with Freud at that time, I resolved to obtain for myself

14:16.640 --> 14:21.160
a monologue spoken as rapidly as possible without any intervention on the part of the

14:21.160 --> 14:28.440
critical faculties, which was, as closely as possible, akin to spoken thought.

14:28.440 --> 14:33.480
The first sustained automatic text was the magnetic fields which Breton wrote in collaboration

14:33.480 --> 14:36.840
with the poet Philippe Supoe in 1919.

14:36.840 --> 14:41.240
The text purports to be generated strictly without conscious intervention, though Breton,

14:41.240 --> 14:46.480
ever the writer, couldn't resist making some stylistic revisions before publication.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.360
Here's a sample.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.600
Prisoners of drops of water we are but perpetual animals.

14:52.600 --> 14:57.680
Stiff stems of Suzanne, uselessness above all, village of flavors with a lobster church.

14:57.680 --> 15:02.960
The world that writes 365 in Arabic characters has learned to multiply it by a two-figure

15:02.960 --> 15:03.960
number.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.400
God the father's will to grandeur does not in France exceed 4810 meters height above

15:08.400 --> 15:12.640
sea level.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.760
The magnetic fields is essentially a book length prose poem.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.520
Breton, however, considered it much more than volume of poetry.

15:19.520 --> 15:24.400
For him, it was a major advancement to the psychoanalytic reading of literature.

15:24.400 --> 15:29.320
He sent a signed copy to Freud and Vienna, expecting the elder analyst to hail him as

15:29.320 --> 15:34.160
a pioneering colleague, but no such response was forthcoming.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.440
Undaunted, Breton made another overture in the fall of 1921 when he and his bride traveled

15:39.440 --> 15:41.680
to Vienna for their honeymoon.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.240
Hoping to interview the father of psychoanalysis, Breton found himself turning around Freud's

15:46.240 --> 15:49.880
building for several days too shy to knock.

15:49.880 --> 15:54.600
When the interview finally did occur, it was a bitter disappointment.

15:54.600 --> 15:59.000
Freud politely confessed that he didn't really get modern poetry and didn't see what his

15:59.000 --> 16:02.200
young visitors work had to do with him.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.280
Breton's wife, Simone, recalled that he returned from the meeting so disillusioned that he

16:06.280 --> 16:08.360
refused to talk about it.

16:08.360 --> 16:13.440
Soon afterward, he vented his spleen by publishing an account of the interview in which he described

16:13.440 --> 16:18.800
Dr. Freud as a little old man with no style who receives clients in a shabby office worthy

16:18.800 --> 16:22.680
of the neighborhood GP.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.360
This was not Breton's last contact with Freud.

16:25.360 --> 16:31.440
In 1932, the two men had a minor epistolary tiff over a critique Breton had made, suggesting

16:31.440 --> 16:35.720
that Freud had appropriated someone else's discovery as his own.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.360
Over several letters, Freud meticulously explained the way the misunderstanding then ended their

16:40.360 --> 16:44.360
exchange with, and now a confession.

16:44.360 --> 16:48.240
Although I have received many testimonies of the interest you and your friends show

16:48.240 --> 16:54.080
for my research, I am not able to clarify for myself what surrealism is and what it wants.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.240
Perhaps I am not destined to understand it.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.880
I, whom I'm so distant from art.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.040
Breton later published the correspondence, showing that Freud might not have understood

17:06.040 --> 17:12.040
art, but he recognized a slight against his professional integrity when he saw it.

17:12.040 --> 17:18.040
Nor was the magnetic fields surrealism's sole engagement with the psychoanalytic discourse.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.080
Among many other examples, let me mention two.

17:21.080 --> 17:26.840
The Immaculate Conception, which Breton wrote with the surrealist poet Paul Elwara in 1930,

17:26.840 --> 17:31.440
and Salvador Dali's theory of paranoia criticism.

17:31.440 --> 17:36.080
The Immaculate Conception traces human life from conception to death, using a variety of

17:36.080 --> 17:37.920
literary conceits.

17:37.920 --> 17:42.520
In the most striking chapter, the possessions, the authors simulate various forms of mental

17:42.520 --> 17:47.440
illness, acute mania, general paralysis, dementia precocks, and so on.

17:47.440 --> 17:53.440
This in an effort, as Breton put it, to resolve the antinomy between reason and madness.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.880
Here's the first sentence of dementia precocks.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.720
The woman here with an arm on her head pebbled with pralines, which leave here without anyone

18:02.720 --> 18:06.640
having a clear idea because it is a bit more into the noon here while leaving the laughter

18:06.640 --> 18:10.840
of the teeth, which retreats across the palette of the deniodes, which I caress with my tongue,

18:10.840 --> 18:14.360
without thinking that the day of God has arrived, music forward of the little girl's weeping

18:14.360 --> 18:18.160
seeds whom one watches without seeing them weep by the hand of the graces on the fourth

18:18.160 --> 18:22.600
floor window with the cat's minionet, which the catapult took from behind on a holiday.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.080
Period.

18:26.080 --> 18:31.680
As for paranoia criticism, Salvador Dali had joined surrealism in 1929 and lost no time

18:31.680 --> 18:34.920
in establishing himself as its master showman.

18:34.920 --> 18:39.960
In 1932, recognizing that automatic writing had more or less run its course, he devised

18:39.960 --> 18:43.600
a new technique of mental exploration for the group.

18:43.600 --> 18:48.960
Early inspired by Jacques Lacan's doctoral thesis on paranoid psychosis, paranoia criticism

18:48.960 --> 18:54.440
was defined by its creator as a spontaneous method of irrational knowledge based on the

18:54.440 --> 19:00.120
critical and systematic objectification of delirious associations and interpretations.

19:00.120 --> 19:05.760
Or in non-de-li language, a means of understanding one object by freely associating it with others,

19:05.760 --> 19:08.280
no matter how unrelated.

19:08.280 --> 19:13.600
The Eureka example was an image that Dali at first thought was effaced by Picasso, but

19:13.600 --> 19:19.520
which he then realized was actually a photograph of an African hut turned sideways, the revelation

19:19.520 --> 19:26.280
being that both these realities existed in the same image, much like dream condensation.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.280
It was also Dali who gave Freud at least a partial answer to his question of what surrealism

19:30.280 --> 19:31.920
was about.

19:31.920 --> 19:37.040
In 1938, by which time Dali had been drummed out of the movement, he visited the elderly

19:37.040 --> 19:39.120
analyst in London.

19:39.120 --> 19:43.360
Hoping as had Briton, twenty years earlier, to impress Freud as a major theorist in his

19:43.360 --> 19:50.360
own right, Dali expounded his ideas on paranoia while Freud stared on in silence.

19:50.360 --> 19:55.040
Before his imperturbable indifference, Dali later wrote, my voice became involuntarily

19:55.040 --> 19:57.160
sharper and more insistent.

19:57.160 --> 20:02.040
Then continuing to stare at me with a fixity in which his whole being seemed to converge,

20:02.040 --> 20:04.680
Freud exclaimed, addressing Stiffon's vieg.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.760
I have never seen a more complete example of a Spaniard.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.240
What a fanatic!

20:12.240 --> 20:16.600
From Bertone's jealous viewpoint, the visit was bad enough, but what really ground his

20:16.600 --> 20:21.040
gears was the interest Freud finally seemed to be showing in surrealism after all his

20:21.040 --> 20:22.920
fruitless attempts.

20:22.920 --> 20:28.520
And indeed, Freud wrote to Sivag that before meeting Dali, I was inclined to look upon

20:28.520 --> 20:35.520
surrealists who have apparently chosen me as their patron saint as absolute, or let us

20:35.520 --> 20:37.440
say, 95% like alcohol, cranks.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.000
The young Spaniard, however, with his candoured, fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical

20:42.000 --> 20:46.120
mastery has made me reconsider my opinion.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.560
This was Freud's last contact with the surrealists and his final word on a movement that since

20:50.560 --> 20:55.720
its inception had pursued him like an autograph hound for his seal of approval.

20:55.720 --> 21:01.320
Still, it would be misleading to take surrealism and interactions with psychoanalysis as merely

21:01.320 --> 21:05.160
the grandiose delusions of young admirers.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.360
While surrealism's claims to being a full-fledged science might be open to debate, and its understanding

21:10.360 --> 21:15.440
of certain mental conditions a bit naive, its insights into the permeability of waking

21:15.440 --> 21:20.360
life and dreams, and its exploration of the mind's hidden language, prefigure attitudes

21:20.360 --> 21:23.520
later taken by mainstream psychiatry.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.840
Perhaps more significantly, as several have pointed out, the surrealists demonstrated

21:27.840 --> 21:32.320
a compassion for the mentally ill that was hardly common in their day, and that long

21:32.320 --> 21:36.600
predates the anti-psychiatric writings of R.D. Lang and David Cooper.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.400
And they were decades ahead of Michel Foucault in denouncing the normative and repressive

21:40.400 --> 21:44.800
aspects of psychiatry as it was sometimes practiced at the time.

21:44.800 --> 21:49.240
So while poetry and painting have taken center stage in our appreciation of surrealism, and

21:49.240 --> 21:54.480
deservedly so, we should not forget that surrealist literature and art were made possible by

21:54.480 --> 21:59.560
the movement's early, lifelong, and passionate engagement with the ever-relusive functioning

21:59.560 --> 22:00.560
of thought.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.560
Thank you.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.000
This is a narration.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.160
The young woman who just entered, we're talking about a cafe, everything takes place

22:09.160 --> 22:15.240
in the cafe, she appeared to be swathed and missed, closed in fire.

22:15.240 --> 22:20.200
Everything seemed colorless and frozen next to this complexion, imagined and perfect

22:20.200 --> 22:27.200
concord between rust and green, ancient Egypt, a tiny unforgettable fern climbing the inside

22:27.200 --> 22:32.360
wall of an ancient wall, the deepest, most somber and most extensive of all those I've

22:32.360 --> 22:34.640
ever leaned over.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.640
And this goes on.

22:35.640 --> 22:41.480
The young woman, and you notice the repetition like in the poem that Anne Marie wrote, the

22:41.480 --> 22:43.720
young woman who just entered was writing.

22:43.720 --> 22:48.640
She'd also been writing the evening before, and I'd already agreeably supposed very quickly,

22:48.640 --> 22:54.880
she might have been writing to me, and I found myself awaiting her letter, naturally, nothing.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.600
But this room, still the cafe, fully lit was free of any other presence.

22:59.600 --> 23:04.080
A last wave had swept away my friends to whom I was still talking.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.280
This young woman who just entered was just about to reappear in the street where I was

23:08.280 --> 23:13.280
waiting for her without being seen in the street, and then they're going to go to lay

23:13.280 --> 23:16.960
out of a marketplace in Paris.

23:16.960 --> 23:22.160
The face I'd feared and a frenzy never to see again was there, and so close turned toward

23:22.160 --> 23:27.960
me that it's smile and that moment leaves me even today with the memory of a squirrel

23:27.960 --> 23:34.680
holding a green hazelnut, hair and a bright downpour upon flowering chestnut trees.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.480
She tells me she's written me, this letter just now was destined for me, and she was

23:38.480 --> 23:43.080
surprised no one had given it to me, and she rapidly said farewell to me, giving me a

23:43.080 --> 23:45.400
rendezvous for that same evening at midnight.

23:45.400 --> 23:49.340
So of course it happens to be, you know, first in a cafe, then at midnight, then in the

23:49.340 --> 23:51.040
alley, two in the morning.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.600
I shall glide over the tumultuous hours that ensued.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.760
It's two in the morning when we leave the cafe of the birds.

23:57.760 --> 24:02.240
My self-confidence undergoes a peculiar crisis, and you will see in everything I'm

24:02.240 --> 24:04.920
going to read, which is mostly about love and love for them.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.920
There's always this doubt at the middle.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.360
There's always this un-embalance.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.360
What am I capable of after all?

24:13.360 --> 24:14.800
This is brutal.

24:14.800 --> 24:18.920
And what shall I do now so as not to be unworthy of such a fate?

24:18.920 --> 24:25.200
I walk ahead automatically in a great clank of gates being closed, to love, to find once

24:25.200 --> 24:29.200
more the lost grace of the first moment when one is in love.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.920
All sorts of defenses spring up around me, bright laughter springing up from the years

24:33.920 --> 24:40.400
fast to finish sobbing under the great beating of grey wings of an uncertain spring night.

24:40.400 --> 24:46.640
Who goes with me in this hour in Paris without leading me, and whom moreover I am not leading?

24:46.640 --> 24:50.880
I never remember having felt in my life such a great weakness.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.640
I almost lose sight of myself.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.520
I seem to have been carried away in my turn.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.440
Perhaps it would suddenly become impossible to take a step, perhaps without the help of

24:59.440 --> 25:04.440
an arm which has just taken my own, recalling me to real life while enlightening me with

25:04.440 --> 25:08.040
its pressure about the shape of a breast.

25:08.040 --> 25:12.200
Oh no, it's only in fairy tales that doubt cannot sneak in and see you.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.680
This is what is sneaking in now strongly.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.480
It's never a question of slipping on some fruit peeling.

25:18.480 --> 25:24.920
I see bad and good in all their native state, the bad winning out with all the ease of suffering.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.960
Life is slow and man scarcely knows how to play it.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.200
Who is going with me?

25:30.200 --> 25:32.760
Who is preceding me tonight once again?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.960
There would still be time to turn back.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.920
So he didn't turn back, but it was always plagued by doubts.

25:40.920 --> 25:45.240
I wanted to read you just one poem of Roto, which seems to me to sum up surrealism in

25:45.240 --> 25:48.080
its aesthetic sense in all the wonderful ways.

25:48.080 --> 25:54.360
I'll read it to you in English, but tell you that it's about a pun on mirror and glass,

25:54.360 --> 25:59.720
and the word mile, which means the way it sounds, mile means evil, and also means fail

25:59.720 --> 26:01.320
differently trunk.

26:01.320 --> 26:04.080
This poem is about upside downness.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.760
It's about contourries.

26:05.760 --> 26:11.240
It's about hot and cold, and it's finally a very optimistic poem because surrealism in

26:11.240 --> 26:15.320
its basic sense was optimistic despite all the doubts and love.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.640
And this is called, They Tell Me.

26:17.640 --> 26:23.560
They tell me that over there the beaches are black from the lava running to the sea, stretched

26:23.560 --> 26:30.040
out at the foot of a great peak, smoking the snow under a second sun of wild canaries.

26:30.040 --> 26:34.920
You can already hear the hiss of the waves, second sun, and then French that goes, Susan

26:34.920 --> 26:37.600
and so go so they just so as so vage.

26:37.600 --> 26:42.080
You already hear the waves coming in the lava as of course black and the beaches white

26:42.080 --> 26:43.200
and so on.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.840
So what is this far off land seeming to take its light from your life?

26:47.840 --> 26:53.240
It trembles very real at the tip of your lashes, sweet to your carnation, like an intangible

26:53.240 --> 26:57.520
linen freshly pulled from the half open trunk of the ages.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.720
Trunk of course being mile, but then you get to play on the word trunk because it's the

27:01.720 --> 27:03.600
trunk of the body.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.840
And you casting its last sombre fires between your legs, the earth of the lowest paradise,

27:09.840 --> 27:15.560
glass of shadows, mirror of love, and lower towards your arms opening on the proof by

27:15.560 --> 27:22.760
springtime of afterwards of evils not existing, all the flowering apple tree of the sea.

27:22.760 --> 27:27.960
So you feel the appleness, you know, the apple but restored somehow on the tree in the land.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.080
And that to me is the way that surrealist poetry works.

27:31.080 --> 27:36.560
I want to read you two poems by Elia and Marie Reggie one poem.

27:36.560 --> 27:40.320
I want to read you a famous one because of its first line.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.720
It's called the earth is blue like an orange.

27:42.720 --> 27:47.840
And if you've read Julia Kristeva she goes on and on about how blue and orange go together.

27:47.840 --> 27:52.520
I think that the love in all these poems undoes any problem of logic.

27:52.520 --> 27:56.520
Of course it's illogical and therefore it makes sense surrealistically.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.120
The earth is blue like an orange.

27:59.120 --> 28:03.680
Well an era, words do not lie, they no longer supply what to sing with.

28:03.680 --> 28:06.840
It's up to kisses to get along, mad ones and lovers.

28:06.840 --> 28:11.920
She, her wedding mouth, all secrets, all smiles and what indulgent clothing.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.200
She actually looks quite naked.

28:14.200 --> 28:20.240
The wasps are flowering, green, dawn is placing around its neck, its necklace of windows,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.120
wings cover up the leaves.

28:22.120 --> 28:28.520
You have all the solar joys, all sunshine on the earth, on the past of your loveliness.

28:28.520 --> 28:34.080
And one more orange poem because he was haunted by this color, enormously visual this whole

28:34.080 --> 28:35.080
movement.

28:35.080 --> 28:40.040
You'll have oranges in the emptiness of the world and the emptiness of window panes.

28:40.040 --> 28:44.440
Heavy with silence and shadow where my bare hands seek all your reflections.

28:44.440 --> 28:49.240
Illusory is the shape of your heart and your love is like my lost desire.

28:49.240 --> 28:54.160
Oh, amber sized dreams, gazes, but you've not always been with me.

28:54.160 --> 29:00.720
My memory is still darkened from having seen you come and go time, uses words like love.

29:00.720 --> 29:04.480
The stress of the monosyllables, they're very great stylists, these surrealists.

29:04.480 --> 29:09.520
I read you one last one from Elleuar called A Woman in Love.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.520
She's standing on my eyelids and her hair mingles with mine.

29:13.520 --> 29:17.360
She has the shape of my hands, she has the color of my eyes.

29:17.360 --> 29:21.200
She dissolves into my shadow like a stone against the sky.

29:21.200 --> 29:24.000
Her eyes are always open and she doesn't let me sleep.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.120
Her dreams in daylight cause the suns to drift away.

29:27.120 --> 29:31.400
Make me laugh, weep and laugh, speak when I have nothing to say.

29:31.400 --> 29:37.200
So the way the poem sort of dissolves into nothingness at the end I think is very grand.

29:37.200 --> 29:43.040
Finally, my favorite poet in the world, Colle Hanesha, who is a great resistance poet, but

29:43.040 --> 29:47.240
also a surrealist in the beginning and in a sense all the way through.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.840
This is what William Colle's William said of him.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.880
In A Woman in Love, you are a poet who believes in the power of beauty to right all wrongs.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.120
I believe it also.

29:57.120 --> 30:02.360
So I will read you two or three very short poems by Shah and then one slightly longer

30:02.360 --> 30:03.520
one.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.880
And in all the poems you see the smallness.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.160
Everything is about how the simplest things become meaningful.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.920
The basket weavers love.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.760
I loved you.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.920
I loved your face, a spring furred by storm.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.440
And the emblem of your domain in closing my kiss.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.240
Some put their trust in a round imagination.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.000
Just going is enough for me.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.840
I brought back from despair so small a basket my love they wove it a willow.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.840
And another very short one, this is about dreaming since we're in the psychoanalytic

30:36.840 --> 30:37.840
institute.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.320
I thought I had to do something about dreaming.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.480
It's a call short cut.

30:41.480 --> 30:46.560
The hill he has served so well descends torrential at his back.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.760
Poor tongue salute him.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.360
The mules and the matter will welcome him.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.760
The gullies rose he'd face turns toward him twice.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.400
The waters of its mirror.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.960
Meanness sleeps.

30:57.960 --> 31:03.280
He is as he dreamt himself to be.

31:03.280 --> 31:10.280
And this one, very, very short call unbending prayer, seems to have been very powerful.

31:10.280 --> 31:14.080
And we have a lot of friends who want to use it in their sermons and their, this and

31:14.080 --> 31:15.080
that.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.680
And it's how the small becomes infinitely large.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.560
It's called unbending prayer.

31:21.560 --> 31:27.320
Preserve for us rebellion, lightning, the illusory agreement, a laugh for the trophy slip from

31:27.320 --> 31:32.760
our hands, even the whole lengthy burden that follows whose difficulty leads us to a new

31:32.760 --> 31:34.200
rebellion.

31:34.200 --> 31:38.880
Preserve for us fate and the primrose.

31:38.880 --> 31:43.840
And the last one from wonderful honey Shah, because of whom I moved me and my whole family

31:43.840 --> 31:45.320
to France.

31:45.320 --> 31:52.920
This one is called annals fast, which means it's a sort of, it's a tradition of remembering

31:52.920 --> 31:55.400
something like a memorial always.

31:55.400 --> 32:01.640
And to me this is the height of tragic love, poetry that the surrealists are in and we're

32:01.640 --> 32:04.960
in and still are in, in my view.

32:04.960 --> 32:09.040
Summer was singing on its favorite rock when you appeared to me.

32:09.040 --> 32:14.000
Summer was singing a part as we who were silence, sympathy, sorrowful freedom.

32:14.000 --> 32:20.120
We were sea still more than the sea whose long blue spade was playing at our feet.

32:20.120 --> 32:24.000
Summer was singing and your heart swam far from it.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.800
I embraced your courage, heard your confusion, rode along the absolute of waves toward those

32:29.800 --> 32:35.120
high peaks of foam where virtues sail, murderous to hands bearing our houses.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.320
We were not credulous.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.160
We were surrounded.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.280
The years passed by.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.320
The storms died down.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.400
The world went its way.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.320
I suffered to think it was your heart which no longer perceived me.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.400
I loved you.

32:51.400 --> 32:57.240
In my absence of visage and my emptiness of joy, I loved you, changing in every way faithful

32:57.240 --> 32:58.240
to you.

32:58.240 --> 33:01.440
So you see at the end, so it's changing but faithful.

33:01.440 --> 33:07.160
That whole contrary excitement on which the realism in its aesthetics is built comes out

33:07.160 --> 33:10.160
in everything you read always.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.160
Thank you.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.160
Up to you.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.160
No?

33:17.160 --> 33:26.240
Seventh inning stretch.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.920
I was trying to learn how to be a poet and I transferred from a college that I hated to

33:30.920 --> 33:33.200
Columbia University.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.640
I was searching for something in poetry that I had only cut glimpses of.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.560
It had to do with what poets call the image.

33:41.560 --> 33:46.360
Now we know that an image is a reproduction of something that exists or the imagining

33:46.360 --> 33:49.440
of something that doesn't exist.

33:49.440 --> 33:55.520
Soon I found myself engaged in a serious private study of the images movement and Anglo-American

33:55.520 --> 33:56.880
poetry.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.400
The experiments led by T.E.

33:59.400 --> 34:05.200
Hume in London, not much of a poet but a great theoretician.

34:05.200 --> 34:10.960
Then Ezra Pound arrived in London from the US and the small group of poets clustered around

34:10.960 --> 34:17.480
Hume had a first-rate poet and theoretician who was ready to formulate their ideas, add

34:17.480 --> 34:21.360
some of his own and do battle for them.

34:21.360 --> 34:27.720
The image that the images were talking about wasn't simply what some call poetic presentation.

34:27.720 --> 34:32.120
The green car stood in the driveway.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.040
It was metaphor that they were after.

34:35.040 --> 34:43.880
The green car grew more branches and leaves every night as it sat in the driveway.

34:43.880 --> 34:50.000
The image then is a tool of transformation that creates a third reality out of the two

34:50.000 --> 34:53.040
realities that contribute to it.

34:53.040 --> 34:57.200
It is in essence a vision.

34:57.200 --> 35:02.440
In those days I was reading poetry furiously and to New York I had brought with me Dylan

35:02.440 --> 35:07.400
Thomas and his extraordinary metaphor making.

35:07.400 --> 35:15.480
I fellowed sleep who kissed me in the brain, let fall the tear of time, the sleepers eye,

35:15.480 --> 35:19.360
shifting to light turned me on like a moon.

35:19.360 --> 35:28.360
So planning healed I flew along my man and dropped on dreaming in the upward sky.

35:28.360 --> 35:34.440
I soaked myself in Thomas's recordings and much later I discovered his connections to

35:34.440 --> 35:39.800
the British surrealist movement well underway in the 1930s.

35:39.800 --> 35:44.760
And as I got to know the campus and Morningside Heights poets, one or more of them must have

35:44.760 --> 35:48.280
told me about French surrealism.

35:48.280 --> 35:53.320
My friend Michael O'Brien I suspect was the first.

35:53.320 --> 35:59.320
Poet Kenneth Koch taught at Columbia then and I was able to take a couple of his courses.

35:59.320 --> 36:07.560
I was the only GI on Saipan he later told me with a subscription to View Magazine.

36:07.560 --> 36:15.280
A surrealist magazine published in New York City from 1940 to 1947.

36:15.280 --> 36:20.520
I was also lucky enough to find mentors in Serge Guevronsky, a poet, translator and

36:20.520 --> 36:25.720
novelist at Barnard College and Leroy Bernig who taught in the Graduate Department of French

36:25.720 --> 36:28.160
at Columbia.

36:28.160 --> 36:33.200
All I could find in the Columbia library was a single anthology of surrealism but it was

36:33.200 --> 36:35.520
a start.

36:35.520 --> 36:40.960
Somewhere around then Eddissian Gallimard began to publish lovely inexpensive editions

36:40.960 --> 36:46.360
of many of the surrealist poets in paperbacks that were easy to slip into your pocket and

36:46.360 --> 36:48.480
carry anywhere.

36:48.480 --> 36:54.640
Paul Elward Robert Desnos, Andre Breton, who I learned was the leader of the movement,

36:54.640 --> 37:01.680
Louis Aragon, Benjamin Perret, Antonin Arcto and a fellanks of others, all likewise in

37:01.680 --> 37:06.920
search of images or metaphors or call them what you will that could scorch your face

37:06.920 --> 37:12.000
and shoot you to somewhere you never knew you could go.

37:12.000 --> 37:17.280
Someplace above the real or beyond it.

37:17.280 --> 37:21.000
That's what the surrealist metaphor is supposed to do.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.800
Rocket you out of your shoes toward something marvelous.

37:24.800 --> 37:30.440
And though it seems paradoxical, the marvelous can be accomplished through almost anything,

37:30.440 --> 37:36.840
the places and objects and people that we see or fail to pay attention to every day.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.840
Antonin thought that almost any two objects could be drawn together to create something

37:40.840 --> 37:42.760
extraordinary.

37:42.760 --> 37:46.520
Unlike his mentor, the poet Pierre Reverd.

37:46.520 --> 37:51.880
The two terms of the image can't be too distant, he believed, or the metaphorical connection

37:51.880 --> 37:54.520
wouldn't hold.

37:54.520 --> 37:59.160
After the horrors of the First War and out of the Dadaist movement that thumbed its nose

37:59.160 --> 38:04.000
at culture and art and reason and government and everything that seemed to contribute

38:04.000 --> 38:06.760
to the slaughter of so many.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.720
Unpositive had to be built.

38:09.720 --> 38:16.160
Only so many poems and plays and works of art can be created that say, fuck you.

38:16.160 --> 38:22.120
Breton, who is steeping himself in Freud's work at that time, came to recognize phrases

38:22.120 --> 38:28.800
and images in his dreams and saw the possibility of joining them in spoken thought, as he called

38:28.800 --> 38:30.360
it.

38:30.360 --> 38:36.120
Working together, he and a poet from the Dada group, Philip Supo, collaborated on a text

38:36.120 --> 38:42.120
that mixed poetic prose and poetry that would become the foundation stone of the new movement

38:42.120 --> 38:46.920
that rose out of the ashes of Dada to become surrealism.

38:46.920 --> 38:54.440
A term derived from a play by Guillaume Apalinaire called The Breasts of Terezius.

38:54.440 --> 39:03.640
The new text, published in 1919, or maybe in 1920, I forget, was called The Magnetic Fields.

39:03.640 --> 39:11.040
Here are some paragraphs from its first pages.

39:11.040 --> 39:15.800
Prisoners of drops of water were nothing but perpetual animals.

39:15.800 --> 39:21.680
We run in the noiseless cities and the enchanted posters don't move us anymore.

39:21.680 --> 39:28.360
What good are these great fragile enthusiasms, these desiccated jumps for joy?

39:28.360 --> 39:31.440
We don't know anything but the dead stars.

39:31.440 --> 39:35.400
We look at their faces and we sigh with pleasure.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.320
Our mouths are drier than lost shores.

39:38.320 --> 39:42.160
Our eyes turn without object, without hope.

39:42.160 --> 39:48.560
There are only those cafes where we gather to drink those cool drinks, those watery cocktails,

39:48.560 --> 39:56.240
and the tables are stickier than those sidewalks where the dead shadows of our vigil have fallen.

39:56.240 --> 40:01.760
Sometimes the wind surrounds us with its great cold hands and pins us to trees beheaded by

40:01.760 --> 40:03.320
the sun.

40:03.320 --> 40:08.400
We all laugh, we sing, but no one feels his heart beating anymore.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.520
Excitement abandons us.

40:11.520 --> 40:14.560
The marvelous stations never shelter us.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.440
Their long corridors frighten us.

40:17.440 --> 40:25.120
Then in order to live, we still have to smother these dull minutes, these centuries in rags.

40:25.120 --> 40:31.080
Once we love the suns at years and the narrow plains where our glances flowed like those

40:31.080 --> 40:37.600
impetuous rivers of our youth, there are nothing but reflections in those woods restocked

40:37.600 --> 40:42.080
with absurd animals, well-known plants.

40:42.080 --> 40:45.120
The cities we don't love anymore are dead.

40:45.120 --> 40:46.800
Look around you.

40:46.800 --> 40:53.280
There's only the sky and those great vague landscapes that will be better off to testing.

40:53.280 --> 40:58.120
With our fingers we touch those tender stars that populate our dreams.

40:58.120 --> 41:05.000
They've told us that yonder there were prodigious valleys, wagon trains lost forever in that

41:05.000 --> 41:09.640
far west as boring as a museum.

41:09.640 --> 41:15.560
When the great birds take flight, they leave with a cry and the streaked sky no longer resounds

41:15.560 --> 41:17.360
with their call.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.960
They pass above the lakes, the fertile marshes.

41:20.960 --> 41:25.040
Their wings push aside the two languid clouds.

41:25.040 --> 41:28.040
We aren't even allowed to sit down anymore.

41:28.040 --> 41:36.240
Immediately, laughter rises up and we have to scream out all our sins.

41:36.240 --> 41:41.600
That's just a little piece of that book.

41:41.600 --> 41:45.240
The Breton wrote amazing poems of his own.

41:45.240 --> 41:51.880
Luneon Libra, translated as Free Union, drew on the tradition of the blézón, a type of

41:51.880 --> 41:58.680
poem that celebrated the female body.

41:58.680 --> 41:59.680
So I'm going to read that.

41:59.680 --> 42:04.440
It's probably his most famous poem.

42:04.440 --> 42:10.720
My woman with her forest fire hair, with her heat lightning thoughts, with her hourglass

42:10.720 --> 42:17.440
waist, my woman with her otter waist in the tiger's mouth, my woman with her rosette

42:17.440 --> 42:24.160
mouth, the bouquet of stars of the brightest magnitude, with her teeth of white mouse footprints

42:24.160 --> 42:31.080
on the white earth, with her tongue of polished amber and glass, my woman with her stabbed

42:31.080 --> 42:38.440
eucharist tongue, with her tongue of a doll that opens and closes its eyes, with her tongue

42:38.440 --> 42:45.520
of incredible stone, my woman with her eyelashes in a child's handwriting, with her eyebrows

42:45.520 --> 42:52.040
the edge of a swallow's nest, my woman with her temples of a greenhouse with a slate roof

42:52.040 --> 42:58.800
and steam on the window panes, my woman with her shoulders of champagne and a dolphin-headed

42:58.800 --> 43:06.360
fountain under ice, my woman with her matchstick wrists, my woman with her lucky fingers, her

43:06.360 --> 43:13.240
ace of hearts' fingers, with her fingers of new mone hay, my woman with her armpits of

43:13.240 --> 43:21.120
martin and beach nuts, of midsummer night, of privet and angel fish nest, with her sea

43:21.120 --> 43:28.400
foam and floodgate arms, arms that mingle the wheat and the mill, my woman with rocket

43:28.400 --> 43:35.320
legs, with her movements of clockwork and despair, my woman with her calves of elder

43:35.320 --> 43:42.840
tree pith, my woman with her feet of initials, with her feet of bunches of keys, with her

43:42.840 --> 43:50.200
feet of weaver birds taking a drink, my woman with her pearl barley neck, my woman with

43:50.200 --> 43:57.800
her val door cleavage, cleavage of a rendezvous in the very bed of the mountain stream, with

43:57.800 --> 44:04.400
her breasts of night, my woman with her undersea molehill breasts, my woman with her breasts

44:04.400 --> 44:10.960
of the crucible of rubies, with her breasts of the spectre of the rose beneath the dew,

44:10.960 --> 44:18.880
my woman with her belly of the unfolding fan of days, with her giant claw belly, my woman

44:18.880 --> 44:25.040
with her back of a bird fleeing vertically, with her quick silver back, with her back

44:25.040 --> 44:32.200
of light, with her nape of rolled stone and damp chalk, and a glass and a falling glass

44:32.200 --> 44:39.200
that's just been sipped, my woman with her hips like a skiff, with her hips of a chandelier

44:39.200 --> 44:47.200
and arrow feathers, and stems of white peacock plumes, her hips, an imperceptible pair of

44:47.200 --> 44:54.200
scales, my woman with her buttocks of sandstone and asbestos, my woman with the buttocks of

44:54.200 --> 45:02.160
a swan's back, my woman with her buttocks of springtime, with her gladiolas, sex, my woman

45:02.160 --> 45:09.200
with her sex of place and platypus, my woman with her sex of seaweed and old-fashioned

45:09.200 --> 45:16.720
candies, my woman with her mirror sex, my woman with her eyes full of tears, with her

45:16.720 --> 45:24.720
eyes of violet armor and a speedometer needle, my woman with her savanna eyes, my woman with

45:24.720 --> 45:31.760
her eyes of water to drink in prison, my woman with her eyes of forests forever beneath the

45:31.760 --> 45:43.880
axe, with her eyes of sea level, air level, earth and fire.

45:43.880 --> 45:48.760
The surrealist who captured my heart, however, was Robert Desnos.

45:48.760 --> 45:54.760
Desnos was famous for his ability to speak poetry during the trance experiments that

45:54.760 --> 46:00.800
the group participated in for about a year, until some members of the group started to

46:00.800 --> 46:06.320
chase each other with knives, desnos among them.

46:06.320 --> 46:16.360
Here is one of Desnos' most beautiful poems from his poetic sequence called The Shadows,

46:16.360 --> 46:21.200
and this is called The Voice of Robert Desnos.

46:21.200 --> 46:26.200
So much like the flower and the current of air, like the waterway, like the shadows passing

46:26.200 --> 46:33.200
everywhere, like the smile glimpsed this amazing evening at midnight, so much like everything,

46:33.200 --> 46:35.440
happiness and sadness.

46:35.440 --> 46:41.760
It's yesterday's midnight lifting its naked torso above belfries and poplars.

46:41.760 --> 46:49.400
I'm calling those lost in the countryside, the old corpses, the young oaks just cut down,

46:49.400 --> 46:55.200
the shreds of fabric rotting on the ground and linen drying in farm yards.

46:55.200 --> 47:03.720
I'm calling tornadoes and hurricanes, tempests, typhoons and cyclones, riptides, earthquakes.

47:03.720 --> 47:11.160
I'm calling the smoke of volcanoes and cigarettes, the smoke rings of fancy cigars.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.920
I'm calling loves and lovers.

47:13.920 --> 47:16.720
I'm calling the living and the dead.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.200
I'm calling the grave diggers.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.000
I'm calling the murderers.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.080
I'm calling the executioners. I'm calling the pilots, the masons, the architects.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.880
I'm calling the flesh.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.200
I'm calling the one I love.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.920
I'm calling the one I love.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.720
I'm calling the one I love.

47:36.720 --> 47:42.720
Triumphant midnight unfolds its satin wings and lands on my bed.

47:42.720 --> 47:48.760
Suffries and poplars give into my desires.

47:48.760 --> 47:55.240
Those lost in the countryside find their bearings in finding me.

47:55.240 --> 47:58.960
The old corpses come back to life at my voice.

47:58.960 --> 48:03.520
The young oaks just cut down, wrapped themselves in greenery.

48:03.520 --> 48:08.920
The shreds of fabric rotting on the ground and on the ground, flap at my voice like the

48:08.920 --> 48:14.200
flag of rebellion. The linen drying in farm yards, clothes,

48:14.200 --> 48:21.800
adorable women that I don't adore, who come to me, obey my voice and adore me.

48:21.800 --> 48:24.680
The tornadoes spin around in my mouth.

48:24.680 --> 48:28.840
The hurricanes reden my lips if they can do it.

48:28.840 --> 48:31.560
The tempest snarl at my feet.

48:31.560 --> 48:35.520
The typhoons rumble my hair if they can do it.

48:35.520 --> 48:39.440
I accept the kisses of cyclone drunkenness.

48:39.440 --> 48:42.720
The riptides come to die at my feet.

48:42.720 --> 48:47.880
The earthquakes don't shake me but make everything totter at my command.

48:47.880 --> 48:54.600
The smoke of volcanoes attires me in its vapors, and cigarettes smoke perfumes me.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.480
And the smoke rings of fancy cigars crown me.

48:58.480 --> 49:03.960
The loved ones and the loved pursued for so long find shelter in me.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.200
The lovers hear my voice.

49:06.200 --> 49:09.120
The living and the dead give in and wave to me.

49:09.120 --> 49:13.200
The former, coolly, the latter intimately.

49:13.200 --> 49:18.680
The grave diggers abandon partly dug graves and announce that I am the only one who can

49:18.680 --> 49:21.320
direct their nighttime labors.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.360
The murderers greet me.

49:23.360 --> 49:26.360
The executioners invoke the revolution.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.200
Invoke my voice.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.200
Invoke my name.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.680
The pilots use my eyes to navigate.

49:33.680 --> 49:38.280
The masons are seized with vertigo, hearing me.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.960
The architects leave for the desert.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.880
The murderers bless me.

49:42.880 --> 49:46.320
The flesh quivers at my call.

49:46.320 --> 49:49.680
The one I love does not listen to me.

49:49.680 --> 49:53.160
The one I love does not hear me.

49:53.160 --> 49:57.560
The one I love does not answer me.

49:57.560 --> 50:11.000
Many of the surrealists fled to other countries during World War II, other stayed and worked

50:11.000 --> 50:16.960
for the resistance like Desnos and Paul El-Ward.

50:16.960 --> 50:21.960
Eventually Desnos was betrayed by a journalist.

50:21.960 --> 50:27.440
He died just after the liberation of Terezin, the ghetto and concentration camp in Czech

50:27.440 --> 50:30.600
oslovakia where he had been held prisoner.

50:30.600 --> 50:36.520
Two Czech students recognized him from the photographs that had appeared in Breton's

50:36.520 --> 50:42.640
book Naja and tried to help, but he was too ill with typhus to be saved.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.600
He was 45 years old.

50:45.600 --> 50:51.760
This is probably Desnos's best poem from a sequence of love poems called Ale Misterius,

50:51.760 --> 51:00.120
which I've translated as to the one of mystery.

51:00.120 --> 51:03.280
I've dreamed of you so much.

51:03.280 --> 51:08.240
I've dreamed of you so much you're losing your reality.

51:08.240 --> 51:14.360
Is there still time to reach that living body and kiss on that mouth the birth of the voice

51:14.360 --> 51:16.560
that's dear to me?

51:16.560 --> 51:22.080
I've dreamed of you so much that my arms used to crossing on my chest as I hugged your

51:22.080 --> 51:29.240
shadow couldn't fold themselves around the shape of your body, maybe.

51:29.240 --> 51:35.640
And faced with the actual appearance of what's haunted me and ruled me for days and years,

51:35.640 --> 51:39.680
I would probably turn into a shadow.

51:39.680 --> 51:44.000
Oh, what a sentimental pair of scales.

51:44.000 --> 51:49.320
I've dreamed of you so much there's probably no more time for me to wake up.

51:49.320 --> 51:56.520
I sleep standing up, my body exposed to all the appearances of life and love and you,

51:56.520 --> 52:00.880
the only thing that counts for me today.

52:00.880 --> 52:06.080
I'd probably reach for the first lips and face that came along, then your face and

52:06.080 --> 52:07.920
your lips.

52:07.920 --> 52:14.880
I've dreamed of you so much, walked so much, talked, slept with your phantom that maybe

52:14.880 --> 52:21.000
there's nothing left for me to do but be a phantom among the phantoms and a hundred

52:21.000 --> 52:27.880
times more shadow than the shadow that sturls and will go on strolling cheerfully over the

52:27.880 --> 52:34.480
sundial of your life.

52:34.480 --> 52:39.120
I am going on, aren't I, well, a couple more minutes.

52:39.120 --> 52:44.120
Breton whom the Nazis would have loved to lay their hands on fled to the United States

52:44.120 --> 52:50.160
and eked out a living as an officer, as an announcer for the office of war information.

52:50.160 --> 52:56.240
A friend of mine who worked alongside him told me that he refused to read any copy in which

52:56.240 --> 52:59.480
the pope was mentioned.

52:59.480 --> 53:04.600
Many other surrealists made it to the US as well, Max Ernst, Yves Tange, Kurt Seligman,

53:04.600 --> 53:07.000
and Andre Masson among them.

53:07.000 --> 53:12.200
And as they made their way into the American art scene and its society, their influence

53:12.200 --> 53:18.800
left behind the beginnings of the New York School of Painting that included Robert Motherwell,

53:18.800 --> 53:26.160
Jackson Pollock, Arshil Gorky, Milton Avery among others, which in turn had a marked influence

53:26.160 --> 53:34.240
on poets like Frank O'Hara, John Ashbury, Kenneth Koch, Barbara Guest, and James Schuyler.

53:34.240 --> 53:39.040
They became known as the New York School of Poetry, a group that has written its own

53:39.040 --> 53:42.600
chapter in our recent literary history.

53:42.600 --> 53:47.760
These were, and are, Ashbury is still very much alive, poets who were deeply influenced

53:47.760 --> 53:52.280
by French literary and artistic surrealism.

53:52.280 --> 53:58.880
In the 20s, surrealism spread throughout Europe, inspiring groups in Belgium, Eastern Europe,

53:58.880 --> 54:03.000
Mexico, to which Benjamin Parre had immigrated.

54:03.000 --> 54:09.160
Martinique Spain, Breton lectured in Barcelona two years before he published his manifesto

54:09.160 --> 54:12.360
of surrealism in 1924.

54:12.360 --> 54:16.360
Latin America, Egypt, and even Japan.

54:16.360 --> 54:21.800
English translations of surrealist writings began to appear in American and British literary

54:21.800 --> 54:28.880
magazines in the 20s, and by the late 50s Robert Bly the poet was beating the drum for

54:28.880 --> 54:35.160
a poetry of the unconscious, though ultimately he repudiated French surrealism in favor of

54:35.160 --> 54:41.800
Spanish language surrealism, Lorka, Neruda, Bayejo, and others.

54:41.800 --> 54:48.720
The 60s and 70s saw the creation of a Chicago group of surrealists led by Franklin Rosemont

54:48.720 --> 54:53.360
and his wife Penelope, to me their efforts seemed to be a rehash of work that the French

54:53.360 --> 54:55.280
had done.

54:55.280 --> 55:02.320
Right now there is some discussion, particularly among certain West Coast poets, of a neo-surrealism.

55:02.320 --> 55:08.920
At 16, the San Francisco poet Philip La Montia had come to New York, showed his poems to

55:08.920 --> 55:15.360
Breton, and been given a job at V.V.V.V. or V.V.V.A., a surrealist magazine published

55:15.360 --> 55:18.480
during Breton's New York years.

55:18.480 --> 55:24.760
This is a voice that rises once in 100 years, Breton said of La Montia.

55:24.760 --> 55:30.600
But La Montia published very little, and a promising surrealist poet named Pete Winslow,

55:30.600 --> 55:38.760
also based in San Francisco, died in his 30s of complications following surgery.

55:38.760 --> 55:43.560
Surrealism however had a tremendous impact on the poets of the beat generation, most notably

55:43.560 --> 55:51.080
on Alan Ginsburg, and there is a legion of beat-derived surrealists all over the planet.

55:51.080 --> 55:56.680
I wish I could tell you what neo-surrealism is, and who is in it, but it seems to include

55:56.680 --> 55:58.400
everyone.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.280
This is no surprise.

56:00.280 --> 56:07.520
In his third surrealist manifesto, written after Breton had thrown him out of the group,

56:07.520 --> 56:10.760
Robert Desnos put it this way.

56:10.760 --> 56:19.160
For surrealists, there is only one reality, complete, open to everyone.

56:19.160 --> 56:24.200
Surrealism has fallen into the public domain.

56:24.200 --> 56:29.680
Surrealist practice in poetry has made its way into American poetry for well over 80 years

56:29.680 --> 56:31.240
now.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.480
When everyone is a surrealist, no one has to be a surrealist.

56:35.480 --> 56:40.760
There are precious few groups to join, and no manifestos to sign.

56:40.760 --> 56:48.480
Poets can partake of the enormous gifts bequeathed in writing, and in all the arts by the surrealists,

56:48.480 --> 56:51.400
and that's good enough for me.

56:51.400 --> 56:52.400
Thank you.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.400
Thank you.

56:53.400 --> 56:59.440
Well, do you have no, I'll ask this question later.

56:59.440 --> 57:04.080
Does anyone have a handful of things they'd like to add to things that they've heard,

57:04.080 --> 57:07.960
or questions they'd like to answer, or like answered?

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
No?

57:08.960 --> 57:15.200
I would too, but we have a little extra time.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.520
I was going to ask the audience.

57:16.520 --> 57:21.600
I will ask the audience, but in the meantime, I thought, well, we still have the stage.

57:21.600 --> 57:26.520
Does anyone have anything to add or question about all this?

57:26.520 --> 57:27.520
No?

57:27.520 --> 57:28.520
I think it's interesting.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
Bill Sutter.

57:29.520 --> 57:36.800
We've only just read four poems out of 20,000.

57:36.800 --> 57:46.640
It's daunting to try to make such a selection, but go out there and get the books.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.080
That's an idea.

57:49.080 --> 57:50.080
Yeah.

57:50.080 --> 57:54.920
There are a lot of translations out there that are well worth reading, Mary Ann's.

57:54.920 --> 57:59.680
And there's a list outside.

57:59.680 --> 58:05.080
I think the point is, we can only possibly touch on a very small piece of it, which is

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
what we've done today.

58:06.080 --> 58:10.040
We've looked at the poetry, we've touched a little about the psychoanalysis, we've touched

58:10.040 --> 58:15.880
a tiny bit on the art, but surrealism has so many other aspects that we can't possibly

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
talk about.

58:16.880 --> 58:17.880
It's very big.

58:17.880 --> 58:18.880
Very, very big.

58:18.880 --> 58:20.680
And it's several of us have mentioned.

58:20.680 --> 58:24.840
It's now diffused itself into the current of everyday life, to the point where it means

58:24.840 --> 58:28.480
everything and nothing, but it still has a particular meaning.

58:28.480 --> 58:36.040
And it still has a corpus of writings that remain relevant and oddly enough, translate

58:36.040 --> 58:40.120
in a number of cases very well, although that's something you wouldn't think would be possible

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
for automatic writing.

58:41.120 --> 58:46.360
I mean, I guess if I have a question, I would direct it to the two eminent surrealist translators

58:46.360 --> 58:48.360
sitting right here in front of me, which is...

58:48.360 --> 58:52.000
I can argue with...one argument is the my woman.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.960
Of course, my woman brought on my farm.

58:55.960 --> 58:58.760
So we, others have translated it differently.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.840
I translated it as my beloved, so I don't go into the problem.

59:01.840 --> 59:06.000
You can't say my wife, because it was done for three different people at different times,

59:06.000 --> 59:07.760
so forget my wife.

59:07.760 --> 59:10.000
And my woman just gets right in my nerves.

59:10.000 --> 59:16.560
So I took it out of the random house of French poetry, because I didn't think my woman could

59:16.560 --> 59:17.560
work for it.

59:17.560 --> 59:27.600
I think it's interesting that I suppose it's the interwar poetry, the poetry between the

59:27.600 --> 59:29.400
First World War and the Second World War.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.800
It's so full of love poems.

59:31.800 --> 59:38.600
I mean, rather amazing for a huge movement like that, or maybe it's because it was so

59:38.600 --> 59:47.440
particularly French, but it is amazingly full of love and real love, not just love poems.

59:47.440 --> 59:48.440
And also, yeah, go ahead.

59:48.440 --> 59:50.720
No, I was just going to say I think it's full of two things.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.720
It's full of love, but it's also full of despair.

59:52.720 --> 59:56.080
I mean, I think as we listen to the poems that were read here tonight, there's this,

59:56.080 --> 59:57.080
you know, I think you mentioned that.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.080
There's this core of real desperation.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.840
She does an answer on calling out.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.760
There's, you know, no matter what it is, even there's very little happy love and surrealism.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.920
I think that there was a huge...love was valued above everything else.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:17.360
I mean, it was sort of the core driver, the core emotion, but it never seems to work

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360
out very well.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360
Well, does it?

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.360
I mean...

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360
Sometimes it happens.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.560
It seems to work out fairly well for Desmos, who had a lot of disappointments and wrote

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.080
a lot of great poems about his disappointments, but he married and seemed to have very good

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.320
marriage.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.240
And there's a heartbreaking letter that he wrote from...I don't know if it was from

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.800
Terezin or from Compiène or...

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.080
And d'Ronsie, yeah.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.520
And it's just this heartbreaking letter about how everything's going to...you know, did

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.520
you get the package?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.920
I sent you...I got your package and so forth and so on.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:03.720
What about my book that's in press now?

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:08.040
And you know, I promise you that we're going to have a wonderful life when we are able

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.080
to get back together again.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.280
And it just breaks your heart, but that was a beautiful romance.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.360
Well, love is always full of love and despair.

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:24.440
I mean, that's not unusual.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.240
It's just that as subject matter, so much of the subject matter.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.400
Also I think it's interesting that in a way it is so cheerful.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.240
It is also up.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.040
It has an up spirit to it, regardless of what it says.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.440
But it is optimistic, and that's perhaps the political situation that to begin with people

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.640
were optimistic after the first world war.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.680
I suppose it didn't last long.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.840
And there's something that makes us all laugh still when we hear some of these things.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.040
And of course it's penetrated so deeply into society that we don't think of the stuff we

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.000
do as a surrealist.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.320
But as an abstract painter, I sort of now realize surrealism has been part of the landscape

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.160
in my head since I was a child.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:21.120
If not for surrealism and my paintings are not surrealist, none of this would happen.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.120
It gave permission.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.640
And it gives a great freedom.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.120
It gives you freedom.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120
Yeah, complete freedom.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.120
Yeah.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120
Which is a question my point.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:33.320
Well, do you think also later on thinking of the beast now, you know, Kerouac discovered

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.760
what he called spontaneous boprocity.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:42.480
And it was great, great, you know, which means just going, just hitting the page and going.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.680
And Ginsburg later began to talk about first thought, best thought, although he was a big

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.840
reviser like Breton.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:56.400
And so there's a direct line from this automatic composition to just getting it on the page.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.760
You know, playing the chorus is like a tenor saxophone player.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.200
Yeah, there's a question right behind you, Marie.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Sorry.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.240
This is your presentation.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
It's fine.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:13.240
If there are going to be questions from the audience, you have to close the mic.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:19.080
Because otherwise it's not recorded and so the picture will come on the other side.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.080
Can that be passed around?

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080
Yeah, can we pass it around?

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:29.080
It's I think better if we go ahead.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:36.880
I think the idea that if surrealism is everywhere, it's nowhere or it has no meaning is not at

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:44.280
all the case because it, right, I know you didn't say it, I had no meaning, but there

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:53.880
is so much rich material coming out now that refers or in some senses longs to continue

01:03:53.880 --> 01:04:00.960
that tradition or has a great desire to feel the same ecstasy that was felt during that

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.920
period which is felt continually.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:10.960
And there are a lot of recombinant poets, I would say, and artists who do the same kind

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.560
of work without referring to that.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.760
And it's as of course as rich and real and coming from the soul.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:25.000
And you can even talk about, not the automatic writing so much, but about things that John

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.640
Cage started and Jackson McLoe and people who were doing concrete work and pulling in

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:40.400
aspects of Buddhism and aspects of jazz which was considered spontaneous and is as spontaneous

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.760
as speech or written word which actually is automatic.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.880
I mean all of our speech is automatic in the same manner.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:05:00.320
And that, and there are so many levels of kind of longing and desire for the same fulfillment

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:08.880
of love in this kind of augmented speech and augmented writing.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.280
And first of all, I have to thank you so much.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.440
The poetry was exquisite.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:22.360
I haven't heard much of this work for 30, 40 years and it just brings back the same

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.960
openness that the surrealists wanted to create.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.440
I was also in love with Breton's face.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.440
Anyhow, thank you.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:36.520
It was beautiful but it's continuing with absolutely the same level of passion now,

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.840
all around the world.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:47.680
And the fluxes people related directly, the dotted people related very directly as children

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.200
of the surrealists.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200
So.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200
Thank you.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.680
Thank you.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.680
Thank you for an interesting afternoon.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.200
It's something I'm not really familiar with.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:07.160
But I wanted to ask especially you, the painter, this question.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:14.200
About five or ten years ago, I got lucky and I ran into Young's Red Book.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:22.840
And I assume that you folks maybe ran into it also.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.440
And I wondered, the only analyst you mentioned was Freud.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.960
And I just wondered if Young had any influence on this kind of poetry.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.160
I really don't know.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.640
I know Young's Red Book.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.080
I mean, I ran into it as you said.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.920
Because I have friends who are young and analysts.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:49.680
But I haven't run across any mention of Young in my reading about the surrealist painters.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:59.040
In his huge book, I don't know how many plates there are of his paintings of his dreams.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.240
I think there are a lot of them.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.400
It's a huge book.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.280
And that's what I was thinking of.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.880
But no one mentioned his name.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.040
Well, he did a lot.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.000
He made miniature villages.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.920
He did all sorts of artistic things himself.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.640
But I don't know if he had any influence on it.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.200
Well, I think one thing, you know, Young and Freud, of course, it's split fairly early

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.200
on.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.600
And you don't really find many mentions of Young in surrealist writings.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:32.640
The Freud sort of got in there early, which I think is an important point to make.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.880
Because Bertone was somebody who, you know, brilliant as he was, as creative a mind as

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:42.840
he was, was kind of known for taking bits and pieces of the work that he read and then

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
running with it.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.840
This was the case with Freud.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.760
This was the case with Hegel, who he also claimed as a great formation, as a case with

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:49.760
Marx.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.800
But if you actually look what Bertone wrote about Freud, Hegel and Marx, it's not a deep

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.800
analysis.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.960
It's picking and choosing the bits and pieces that can serve his own purpose.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.840
His use of Freud was really fairly superficial when you get down to it.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.040
You know, Bertone was not a great Freudian scholar.

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:12.960
He was someone who had been deeply excited by the discovery of Freud's early theories

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:20.400
and especially his work with dreams and with the automatic states, which was also came,

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:28.200
which also came from, you know, some of the other early psychoanalysts, but Freud in particular.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:35.200
And I don't know that his use and analysis of psychoanalysis went so far as to penetrate

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.760
into variant forms or the other people.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.400
You know, really Freud was sort of where his focus was.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.760
And because it was where his focus was, it tended to be where the other surrealist focus

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:45.760
was.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.840
Jung is a name that comes in, I can't really even think of time-sitting.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.320
Thank you, Bertone.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.800
He did come in through Bachelorette, who was called the philosopher of surrealism.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.080
And Bachelorette was, of course, very influenced by Jung.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.760
And from that it got, and the whole Picasso young thing that is talked about is very strong.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.800
But Bachelorette was a philosopher and he was a journalist.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Yeah.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.800
But he was called the philosopher of surrealism.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800
I love that.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.000
Also, the red book was only published in the last few years.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
That's true.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
But one of those.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So nobody saw those.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.360
The family guarded that manuscript with great fervor.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:32.400
And the other question, and you'd have to go back and look at the, when did the translations

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:38.640
of Jung start appearing in French, for example, because not everybody spoke and read all of

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.400
the European languages.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:49.680
And I don't think that Freud, I don't think, excuse me, that Jung starts appearing in translation

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:56.520
until maybe the late 20s, which would be, you know, the horse was already out of the

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.000
chute in terms of Freud.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.760
But Freud was not that much earlier.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.520
Freud only started in 1920, the first French translations and then continued on through

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.520
the 20s.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520
But he had the grip on the men.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520
He had the grip on the men.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.080
I didn't read this other guy, you know.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:17.320
But in many ways, Jung is, in many ways more appropriate to surrealism.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.760
And Freud is.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.760
Yeah.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.760
Yeah.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:23.760
Are you almost sort of wise?

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.760
Yeah.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760
I agree with you.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760
Yeah.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.200
But again, those weren't available until the last few years.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200
Yeah.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.920
Again, thank you so much for your good words and your passion for this.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.440
I have a question that's more about present day.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:45.440
If like Breton was sitting in the chair right now and he could be present and say, well,

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.400
what does this mean today?

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:53.480
I'd like to just ask you, I'm very much taken by the nature of like, what is imagination?

01:10:53.480 --> 01:11:00.240
They were like Breton, a higher level of consciousness exploring human potentiality, creation, meaning.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.760
So when imagination, some people say it's a more holistic, creative, open-ended, your

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.840
brain is creating your imagination.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.480
Where else could it come from?

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.480
But it's holistic.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.480
It has a sense of innate beauty.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
You share it.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480
You include it.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.400
North of Fry, one of the few people wrote a book about it, said, imagination creates

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:23.840
a bridge that allows emotion and intelligence to form together to create meaning.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.800
So I was wondering with all the background that you have of how would you understand

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.240
or explain what is imagination as a form of consciousness?

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.360
And is there any way that you can imagine we can create some understanding to promote

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:45.960
those better ideas to get out of the locked up thinking which eliminates emotion which

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.120
you cannot create meaning without?

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:52.360
I'm just throwing it out to you, whatever you can come up with, I'd appreciate it.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.360
That's a hard one.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360
Next time.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360
Does anyone have any of these?

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.960
It's a vast subject.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.640
In terms of just to hark back to the idea of the metaphor, Pierre Revardis, one of the

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:15.480
great 20th century French poets and a kind of a mentor to Breton at least intellectually,

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:22.560
he said, the metaphor flies in on its own wings.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:28.480
And Breton has great pains to point out, you can't sit down and think up a really good

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.360
metaphor.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.600
It either comes or it doesn't.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:40.120
And in fact, you can go back and read Aristotle and this idea is right there in Aristotle.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.080
So it's a vast subject and a great one.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.040
And what is the imagination?

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.000
And I think there have been a number of answers to it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:59.800
But in the surrealist case, I think for one thing, Breton was a pure product of French,

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.360
bourgeois, rationalist society.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.600
And that was the enemy that he fought against his entire life.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.600
Was Greco-Roman logic.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.560
That was the main target.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.760
And so the entire enterprise of surrealism, whether through its brief flirtation of interest

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:21.800
and Buddhism through Toronto or psychoanalysis or whatever it might be, was to allow the

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:27.800
conditions, create the conditions for which you could open your mind to the flood of images

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.640
that would come in and not constantly try to filter or not constantly try to eliminate

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.200
the ones that didn't make sense or the ones that didn't seem to conform to some arbitrary

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.640
rule of what images should be, that all of it was valid and all of it was useful.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:50.560
It's a curious thing because surrealism itself as an entity, as a movement, was actually

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.080
heavily regulated.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:57.160
Breton himself was a great theorist of the liberty of thought, the freedom of thought

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.400
and at the same time was enormously controlled.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.640
He was a real control freak.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:07.920
And so there's a, in a way you can almost say it's the tension between the two that

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.320
actually produced that spark that allowed surrealism to last as an active movement for

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.480
something like 50 years.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.200
And it was interesting and probably not that surprising that shortly after his death in

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:26.960
1966, his hand-picked successor, who was in every way as forceful and dynamic as Breton

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.360
was, a man named Josh Eustaire, tried to keep the movement going.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:36.240
And there were two things, curiously enough, that finally put an end to it three years

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.800
later in 1969.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.360
One of them was the May 68 riots because the surrealists felt that it had actually gotten

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:50.840
out of there, it had passed them by, that the students were using surrealist ideas and

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.000
putting, scrolling surrealist slogans on the walls and they felt that this thing that

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.960
we've created has now just completely steamrolled over us.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.400
We have no further place in it.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400
That was one.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:06.600
And the other one was the fact that Schuistaire realized that without Breton there as a kind

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.320
of a force, just a personal force that could hold all the little factions together in that

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.240
group, it just fell apart.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.280
There was no one there who could keep it going anymore.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.760
There was no one there who had the force of personality.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:25.040
So on the one hand, you've got this wonderful call to freedom and to the primacy of love

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:35.920
and absolute imagination sort of cemented against or sort of laminated to this other

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.080
need and will toward real regulation.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.040
And oddly enough, that was the energy that kept it going.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:49.640
You will have one statement of Breton, the imaginary tends to become the real kind of

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.640
wonderful.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.480
I just thought you brought up in 3,000 years ago where there is no vision the people will

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480
perish.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.240
And Jung said image is everything.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.760
I mean, human potentiality is presented in the form of an image or word is just a name

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.920
for an object, it doesn't mean anything.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.040
But Jung said, and might unfortunately take 600 years for the rest of the world to catch

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040
on.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040
So thank you.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040
Thank you.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.640
Well, I was also very glad to hear all of this.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.720
I'm a painter and also art historian.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.920
And I've been interested in the subject for a long time, starting with the symbolist with

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.760
Bodleaire and Rambo and Malarmé.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.320
And I'm very interested in the relationship to the painters because earlier on, but even

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:38.440
later, Bonard and Braque and Matisse were very allied with the poets.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:46.040
There is no particularly with Braque and Robert D. And Matisse even began to speak about his

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.600
world of signs.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:53.800
And what I'd like to ask is did the poets use this word signs or was it more from the

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.640
phenomenologists and Bachellard and the philosophers of France that brought up the concept of

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:00.640
signs?

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.800
Or does it go back to Bodleaire?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.040
Because Matisse, particularly now that his cutout show is there, you can see how he

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.760
transpose this concept of signs into visual signs.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.240
So I just want to ask a little bit about that.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.640
The relationship, if you know anything about the relationship with the painters and the

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.200
word signs, does that come up in the language with the poets?

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:30.640
Well, the Mihou and the Mihou and Waton, the constellatius and Mihou and the sign, very

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.120
big there.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.440
But Mark probably can go on from.

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:43.680
No, the relationship with the painters between the painters and the poets was, historically,

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:51.320
it's actually rather interesting and rather difficult one because, as Henry pointed out,

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.880
at first there was a kind of a, Breton had actually initially begun by saying that there

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:02.640
could be no such thing as surrealist painting and sort of had eliminated the idea of a visual

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:10.480
surrealism at the very beginning of the movement and was partly pushed into having to then make

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.360
a theoretical statement, which of course became surrealism and painting, a book that he started

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:19.920
in 1928 as an essay and eventually was added to throughout the rest of his life.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:26.800
A major statement about what visual surrealism is, but oddly enough, it was sort of arm-twisted

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:36.920
a little bit into making that statement because one of the other members of the group had

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.320
actually started making statements about visual surrealism and I think that that kind of forced

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.360
him to take a stand on it.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:49.080
And also, honestly, it was a way of bringing some of the painters who he found interesting

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.800
into the group as well.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.120
You know, he'd been fascinated by Max Ernst from back in the data days.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.040
He was interested in Miro very early on.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.200
He was interested in Masson.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.360
He was interested in Picasso with someone that he courted all of his life, who never

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.360
really joined surrealism but is always kind of a friendly fellow traveler, same with Duchamp.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.600
It was a way of kind of creating a visual corpus that would be complementary to the written

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.600
corpus of surrealism.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.080
I'm not sure that that quite answers your question, but.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.600
Yeah, I just wondered too.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:26.080
Did they realize that the symbolist poets, I mean Malarmé and Bernard were good friends

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.280
and they would see each other every day and they would talk there.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:32.920
I mean, there was a lot of communication at a certain point, particularly in the late

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.440
19th century.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.260
And so I think it's a continuum really.

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:41.760
And I wondered how the surrealists saw themselves in relationship to the symbolist because they

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.520
really start a lot of this.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.960
But there are Miro and Malarmé and all of that.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.600
Miro was a huge admirer of Malarmé.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.280
And he knew Paul Valeré personally.

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.760
He was younger.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:58.360
He went to see Valeré as a young man as a kind of a guarantor and a mentor for his own

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.840
poetry.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.200
He knew of the Malarmé's gatherings.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.800
He knew a number of the symbolist poets early in the century.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.560
And in fact, his first poems are basically symbolist poems.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.680
I mean, really before the war, the earliest poems that Brittone wrote and published were

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.000
good classical symbolist poetry.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.800
And so he was very aware of the relationships between the poets and the painters.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:37.640
In fact, I think it was Malarmé's daughter when he was not as a soldier, as a medical

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640
orderly.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.880
He lived for a little while with Malarmé's daughter and her husband.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.400
And they were able to tell them all kinds of stories about the relationship with Mene

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.600
and all of that.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.320
So I mean, he was quite aware of it.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.840
And yes, the surrealists in there, the writers' dealings with the painters is very much of

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.840
a continuum in French life.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.320
They distinguished themselves from symbolism.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:04.360
And how would you call them, what is the bridge or what is the difference between, you would

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:08.000
say, surrealist poetry in the earlier symbolist movement?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.880
Well, I mean, symbolism, I think.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:13.120
You know, it was very controlled and it was very precious by nature.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.960
It really tried to pull away from life.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:24.440
And I think that there was something in that, I think that there was something in the conscious

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.200
rejection of the outside world, the Breton light.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.760
But it was also, you know, it was like hot house flowers.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.520
I mean, they're very self-contained.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.480
And then the war came along and you just couldn't do that.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:44.520
And I think that the experiences of the war and his meeting also with certain people during

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.040
the war, in particular this young man named Jacques Vashé, who's sort of one of the patron

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.960
saints of really surrealism, and who just had a completely different way of disdaining

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960
the world.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.160
It was much brasher, it was much more violent in a way.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.040
And I think that that really turned Breton's head around.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.160
And that's when you start seeing the poetry take completely different attitudes.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.440
The discovery of Rambo was another one, that there was this kind of, you know, a much more

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.120
sarcastic and sardonic way of disdaining the world.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.760
So I think that what interested him in symbolism was the fact that they had pushed the world

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.200
away, but there was a little bit of an ivory tower aspect to it.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.720
And what this did was allow you to get back into the streets, but disdain the world at

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.280
the same time in a slightly more aggressive way.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:38.120
The futures have helped push it more into the violence of contemporary life, or they have

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.120
played a role, Marionetti at all.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.000
Well, they certainly knew Marionetti, but I think there were a little bit of a rival

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.360
as well, the futurists.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.360
Yeah.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.360
Yeah.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.360
They didn't get along too well.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
No.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:54.800
That is the ask if people like Annie B. something thought for him.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:01.280
And the whole, the theosophistic movement, which was around between the words certainly

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:11.260
in this country, it will be very very critical to me, especially, to the insutes of the

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:29.600
suff discipline, to be very literary and I wonder if it was ill and I was very impressed

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:44.100
who also were influenced by the

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:46.600
black-born people and who claimed

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:48.600
connections also to various

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:51.600
young people in Paris and London

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:55.600
and Germany between the wars who

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:56.600
were who were gone.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:03.600
And what everybody else was doing.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:07.600
The Dades were, you know, from

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:11.100
Lithuania were aware of the Dades

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.100
movements in Romania and you know

01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:11.100
and all across the board they were

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:13.100
centered in Switzerland.

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.100
They were in close contact with

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:18.100
Griton and their ideas and their

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:19.100
interested psychoanalysis was

01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:20.100
enormous.

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:22.100
They always talked about it but they

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:26.100
did it through visual means.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.100
They're own sources and their own

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:34.600
needs but it was certainly done

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.600
visually as much as it was done.

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.600
And you did, I don't know if you

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.600
can choose music but there was

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:42.600
I mentioned it but he but but

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.600
don't didn't allow it.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:46.600
It's really it's incomprehensible.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:50.600
And we already had we already had

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.600
sati.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.600
And it's all there no matter what

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:58.100
you're talking about the language

01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:01.600
of walking can be a surrealist

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:01.600
language.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:05.600
It doesn't matter what form it

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:08.600
takes Ted Sean and whatever her

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:11.600
name is I can't think of his

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:13.100
partner.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:15.100
We're doing that in dance in the

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:16.100
1920s in Paris.

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:19.100
Well we all agree that it was very

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:20.100
widespread movements.

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:28.100
Just as you all have apparently

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:29.100
disavowed connection with the

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:30.100
thought forms with you know he

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:37.600
was not interested in that and a

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:39.600
lot of his,

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:44.100
I mean I'll just say very

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:44.600
quickly that you know it depends

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:45.100
on how you define the words

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:48.100
surrealist.

01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:52.140
movement and there were two things that you touched upon there that I think

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:56.020
would have been absolute anathema to Brito himself. One of them was religion or

01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.460
anything that smacks of organized religion and the other thing was music

01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:02.460
which he just personally could not stand.

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.460
What was music?

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.460
Which he personally couldn't stand. Now why?

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.460
That's four o'clock.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.460
That's four o'clock. Okay.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.460
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.460
Thank you.

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:21.460
That was fun.
