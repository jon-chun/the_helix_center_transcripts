01:24.240 --> 01:25.600
this.

01:25.600 --> 01:31.520
So on today's program, I'd like to introduce our participants.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.640

03:16.480 --> 03:22.440
research focuses on art as illustration and on children's aesthetic lives.

03:22.440 --> 03:27.680
Nathan Schanberg, today's moderator, is the Wallerstein Research Fellow in Psychoanalysis

03:27.680 --> 03:30.120
of the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis.

03:30.120 --> 03:34.720
On the faculty here at New York Psychoanalytic and formerly Freud professor of psychoanalysis

03:34.720 --> 03:39.960
at the Hebrew University, he is the author, editor of four books and one novella, educating

03:39.960 --> 03:46.080
the emotions on Bruno Betelheim's ideas, lives across time with Henry Massey, reluctant

03:46.080 --> 03:51.440
warriors, the maturation and inner lives of elite Israeli soldiers, and Sheba and Solomon's

03:51.440 --> 03:57.120
return Ethiopian children in Israel, the foundational study for today's roundtable.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.000
He studied at the University of Chicago, both undergraduate and medical school, where his

04:01.000 --> 04:04.120

04:11.760 --> 04:12.760
Nathan.

04:12.760 --> 04:19.200
Thank you to Helix, Rob, and for arranging this.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.240
When I was asked to do this, can you all hear?

04:21.240 --> 04:24.920
They put the mic on me.

04:24.920 --> 04:30.280
One of the attractions was to have Ted and Ellen be involved so that I could hear from

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
them too.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.520
So this is, I've been looking forward to this for some time.

04:34.520 --> 04:42.840
The beginning of this project came from when I was working on Sheba and Solomon's return,

04:42.840 --> 04:49.280
which was a study, a three-year study of six-year-old children, Ethiopian children, and their families

04:49.280 --> 04:53.160
in a small town near Gaza in Israel.

04:53.160 --> 04:59.280
While I was at the Hebrew University, I would drive down twice a week to work and play and

04:59.280 --> 05:02.920
do research there.

05:02.920 --> 05:09.720
And the book is a description of what I learned about the children's inner lives, nature of

05:09.720 --> 05:14.840
their attachment ties, their parents' attachment ties, and their parents' backgrounds to give

05:14.840 --> 05:16.920
you a sense of the population.

05:16.920 --> 05:23.000
All of the mothers and fathers were born in rural subsistence agricultural villages

05:23.000 --> 05:27.760
in Ethiopia, in a pre-literate society.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.520
Very few of the parents, almost none of the mothers went to school and a few of the fathers

05:32.520 --> 05:38.440
were sent to two or three grades of school, but that was a big sacrifice for them to do.

05:38.440 --> 05:45.680
And most of the kids, the parents, I'm speaking of, were doing some sort of economically meaningful

05:45.680 --> 05:47.120
activity by the age of eight.

05:47.120 --> 05:54.560
So the boys had their own goats or sheep, they were shepherds, or one boy's job was

05:54.560 --> 05:59.880
to be both a shepherd and to keep the homodrias baboons out of his house because they would

05:59.880 --> 06:02.640
raid for food.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.920
And the girls would help out with the mother in cooking.

06:05.920 --> 06:14.640
And most of the fathers were involved in growing fava beans, little plots of land with a cow,

06:14.640 --> 06:21.120
in a very lovely sort of setting, small trees in a river nearby.

06:21.120 --> 06:29.200
Many of the villages they came from were half Jewish, half not Jewish, or all Jewish.

06:29.200 --> 06:34.120
Only one of the 46 mothers came from a disababa, that is from a major city.

06:34.120 --> 06:42.120
And all of these Jews were moved, I won't describe the details, but in a rather heroic

06:42.120 --> 06:48.680
evacuation during the turmoil in Ethiopia when I think 1.3 million people were killed

06:48.680 --> 06:50.280
by the Ethiopians.

06:50.280 --> 06:55.320
They were bought from the Ethiopians by the Israeli government, and I met the daughter

06:55.320 --> 07:01.040
of the ambassador in Ethiopia at the time from Israel who did the deal, and what the

07:01.040 --> 07:05.000
generals wanted for the Jews was guns, and he said, well I can't get you guns.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.480
They said, okay, money.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.800
He said fine, so how much?

07:07.800 --> 07:12.320
And they said so many million works about $12,000 a person.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
He said yes.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.400
And then he called his government and said I need so many million, they said we don't

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
have it.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.040
They said, call the American Jews.

07:21.040 --> 07:29.400
So he got the money from some New York donors, and in a 72-hour window, cargo planes, which

07:29.400 --> 07:34.080
were completely emptied out, were flown in and flown out.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.760
And the reason for the 72-hour window, as some of you may know, is that Ethiopian government

07:38.760 --> 07:43.560
didn't want the Arab countries to know that they were exporting Jews to Israel.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.120
So it had to be done secretly and in that period of time.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.680
So the population that I lived and worked with, most of them were from that immigration in

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
91.

07:52.680 --> 07:59.960
However, us a new immigration or of the Falaschmura, of the Falasch Jews are those who were

07:59.960 --> 08:02.000
the Ethiopian Jewish Jews.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.440
The Falaschmura were forced, converted to Christianity under threat of death in the 1890s

08:08.440 --> 08:13.160
by the then emperor of Ethiopia.

08:13.160 --> 08:22.600
And they called themselves a penumbra population because they lived in the shadow of the Christian

08:22.600 --> 08:27.320
community and in the shadow of the Jewish community and felt didn't belong to either.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.120
It would be hard to marry off your daughter because the Christians thought you weren't

08:31.120 --> 08:34.640
really Christian and the Jews thought you're not really Jewish.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.920
So there was this sort of shadowy quality to this community.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.840
And they are currently coming in that with a new immigration into my town where I was

08:42.840 --> 08:46.280
working and that population actually looks quite different.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.480
I can describe that if we have time.

08:48.480 --> 08:53.080
But the fundamental question for today was when I meeting with kids, I spent three years

08:53.080 --> 08:58.200
with them and I was in this special after school program that was funded by the Wiesel

08:58.200 --> 09:00.840
family.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.080
Most of the kids were within walking distance from home started to walk home with them,

09:05.080 --> 09:06.080
spent time in the playground.

09:06.080 --> 09:10.200
All the kids invited me to their home so I could do formal assessments in the home and

09:10.200 --> 09:13.360
do attachment interviews and so on.

09:13.360 --> 09:19.360
The question is how do you, how does one learn from a kid?

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
What do you think?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.360
What do you feel?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
What do you like?

09:22.360 --> 09:23.360
Who are you?

09:23.360 --> 09:25.320
If those are our questions, tell me about yourself.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.520
It would be the short version if we spoke with an adult perhaps.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.160
So for those of us who work with children, we learn other ways to ask that question.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.320
Usually not asking that question.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.720
But watching them play or playing with them, watching them play on the playground with

09:41.720 --> 09:50.800
other friends, sibs and so on or playing with them or asking to draw pictures.

09:50.800 --> 09:56.080
And there we have, I think both Ted and Ellen will talk about this, a limit developmentally.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.280
I have a limit because I just can't draw very well.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.880
But these kids, if you ask a four-year-old to draw a picture or a four and a half or

10:03.880 --> 10:09.680
a five-year-old or a six or seven-year-old, you have different developmental capacities

10:09.680 --> 10:14.760
and there are apparently gender differences in capacities so that the acute angle that

10:14.760 --> 10:22.080
you need to draw at A or a V or a W according to Gazelle, girls learn that sort of in boys

10:22.080 --> 10:23.160
in classroom.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.600
So there are variations on that.

10:27.600 --> 10:33.720
But once the child draws something, one can look at it, but how does one learn as much

10:33.720 --> 10:36.040
as one can about what's in the picture?

10:36.040 --> 10:40.720
And that's the second part, which is to ask a child, tell me a story about the picture

10:40.720 --> 10:42.640
and to put on exactly what the child does.

10:42.640 --> 10:47.880
So that's what I did and I'll show you a few examples of this and I use these pictures.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.800
There are other ways I use to assess the children, including an attachment to academic

10:51.800 --> 10:55.120
performance using the child behavior checklist.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.360
There are many other ways that I won't approach here that I read the book.

10:59.360 --> 11:06.560
But I use these to design a liquor type instrument to compare emotional life and a brief look

11:06.560 --> 11:12.680
at their developmental capacity from their picture drawing and their stories.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.680
So I'll give you some examples.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.440
I have about 300 pictures from the 46 children.

11:17.440 --> 11:22.400
I picked a few to show you and I think I'll just show you that.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.400
Tell you some of the stories and then I'd like to hand it over to Ted and to Alan to

11:26.400 --> 11:31.640
talk about the question of how do we learn about inner lives?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.680
What's the nature of visual representation?

11:33.680 --> 11:36.680
What's the nature of narrative representation?

11:36.680 --> 11:38.000
The both.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
So here's an example.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.680
I'm going to show you first the three pictures.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.160
In the book I had to limit the number of pictures significantly here.

11:44.160 --> 11:48.120
I'll show you three pictures from the same channel, one of our healthiest kids.

11:48.120 --> 11:52.280
And she draws a picture and as in the original the kids could pick colors, she did it as

11:52.280 --> 11:55.920
pencil.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.480
And she calls this girl Rudy.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.280
She says she's going to a dancing party.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.800
She's finished with the party.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.640
Had a great time and wanted to go next week.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.720
She has a job.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.600
She's a piano and music teacher.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.640
Five days a week she's a teacher and then she's at a party.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.800
If she'll be invited by the headmaster in her office.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.920
She's 18 years old, has blonde hair and a pony haircut.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.320
Now in Israel, pony haircut has bangs.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.200
I found out.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.520
The haircut covers her eyebrows and she has blue eyes.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.560
And I asked her at some point.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.440
I said blue eyes.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.920
She says, stum.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.840
She's wearing colored lenses.

12:34.840 --> 12:40.680
So you hear you have both the picture that if you just read the narrative but I tried

12:40.680 --> 12:44.560
to read it the way she told the story with that tone.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
The next picture.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.120
I have all this as children.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.920
All children are six years old.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.560
I'm sorry.

12:50.560 --> 12:57.640
In their summer six and a half and their summer six none are younger than six.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.960
There is one who's seven, for instance, but all the kids are six years old.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.400
So I'm asking this is what's called a house tree person.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.840
I asked her to draw a person.

13:06.840 --> 13:07.840
She draws a routine.

13:07.840 --> 13:10.920
Then she draws a boy.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.600
And she says this is Rudy's headmaster.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.240
He's also 18.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.560
Everything is similar to Rudy.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.040
Blue eyes, white skin.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.240
And so does Rudy.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.640
His name is Gil.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.160
His job is to be a headmaster in a high school.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.480
And he invites Rudy to be a teacher and come to party as well.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.160
He's her friend and they like each other a lot.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.200
And he likes dancing too.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.600
Rudy teaches him piano music.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.840
She is talented.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.320
And he looks like Rudy's brother.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.880
And Rudy loves her three-year-old baby brother.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.600
Gil is the prime minister's son.

13:41.600 --> 13:47.680
And he puts glass lenses, colored lenses, so that he'll have blue eyes.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.880
He is his aunt, no, his cousin.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.240
They met that kindergarten up to fourth grade and were in high school together.

13:54.240 --> 13:58.360
And they would very much like to be together in 11th grade.

13:58.360 --> 14:04.400
And then one more picture from this girl just to give you a sense of art.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.280
What happens with stories with one child?

14:06.280 --> 14:08.960
I can't do this for all the children, but it gives you a sense.

14:08.960 --> 14:14.400
I say draw a picture of a family doing something, kinetic family drawing.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.760
And she draws this very detailed, very careful.

14:18.760 --> 14:23.240
And then she tells the following story, which I'll read through a little more quickly than

14:23.240 --> 14:24.240
I should.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.240
Yes?

14:25.240 --> 14:34.280
A baby in bed, a mother and a girl.

14:34.280 --> 14:39.240
The baby is eight months and the family, everybody has blue eyes.

14:39.240 --> 14:43.400
And the daughter, Dina, always goes to parties because she's a dancing teacher.

14:43.400 --> 14:47.040
Dina has blonde hair with orange stripes and a pony haircut.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.320
And I ask orange stripes.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.720
She says she dies it on each side.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.040
They both have heart shaped earrings and the mother has the same hair color and they have

14:57.040 --> 14:59.760
round earrings like adults have.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.040
Their house is a palace.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.600
Now I ask the word she uses in Hebrew is palace.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.560
I ask her, tell me what a palace is.

15:05.560 --> 15:12.760
And she explained, is any house with a separate entrance and steps going inside?

15:12.760 --> 15:18.760
All these kids live in, looks like Soviet style apartment buildings with peeling stucco,

15:18.760 --> 15:20.080
just to give you a sense.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.880
This is imagination in your head.

15:24.880 --> 15:30.520
And almost every one of the kids, what we would consider, and even in Israel was considered

15:30.520 --> 15:31.520
impoverished.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.800
I had one family that was what we would consider upper working class.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.640
So these were quite poor families.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.240
They work in the factory mom and dad.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.240
They have the same job.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.480
They get a lot of money.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.080
When the parents are always working, the kids feel all right.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.480
They have brown eyes, the parents.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.480
The real color of their eyes is blue.

15:51.480 --> 15:56.760
The baby has blonde hair like his father and the mother is, the baby is mothers.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.000
When the baby is asleep, he gets a pacifier and a doll and the mother returns, she gives

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
him a turnip, a baby bottle.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.880
Later he goes back to the doll and sleeps with it and he doesn't go to the daycare in

16:06.880 --> 16:10.640
the morning because mother has prepared him a surprise.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.840
You have to keep quiet so he doesn't wake up.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.800
He can fall from his playpen and hit his head.

16:15.800 --> 16:20.400
That can be prevented with a playpen that has a fence and the family bought the baby

16:20.400 --> 16:24.200
pen with a fence that can go up and down.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.240
And the story.

16:26.240 --> 16:34.200
Let me turn to an extreme, in the other end of a child that we thought was quite troubled.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.600
And I'll just show you one picture and one story.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.240
Here's this picture, same age.

16:39.240 --> 16:43.280
In his first picture, it looks like it and he describes it as a girl.

16:43.280 --> 16:47.160
This is a boy, his first picture is a girl.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.160
And the story is this.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.000
It's raining and then comes a son and then she, the girl, needs to bring her coat.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.240
She goes for a trip.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.720
She wants to still be on the trip because she has no home.

16:57.720 --> 17:01.200
Kids broke into her home with fire.

17:01.200 --> 17:05.040
It's better for her on the trip because she has no home.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.660
She's alone on the trip.

17:06.660 --> 17:09.520
Her children have homes to go back to and she doesn't.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.800
So she doesn't feel good.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.880
She wanted to burn down her house too.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.480
She did it because she wanted to go on a trip for a long time.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.320
No, she did it by mistake.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.560
She can't go inside the house because it burned down.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.080
She made her own colors and her hair because she wanted long hair.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
It's a real girl.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.080
Her name is Hannah.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.080
I know her.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.960
She's having fun.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.320
Now, this is a child on our scale.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.840
We rated the first girl someplace close to five, a very high score.

17:41.840 --> 17:46.200
This boy would be closer to one and a half, a child who we thought needed imminent treatment.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
Could you move back?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.080
Just go back to the previous one for a minute.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
Yes.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
What's happened?

17:51.080 --> 17:53.720
Just to, do you mind?

17:53.720 --> 17:57.840
Just to see the difference in the way that these children draw the figure.

17:57.840 --> 18:10.240
I want everyone to notice that the high functioning child draws the figure very much.

18:10.240 --> 18:20.960
How many people in these children's daily life actually have blonde hair and blue eyes?

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
A percentage.

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
No.

18:22.960 --> 18:23.960
Okay.

18:23.960 --> 18:24.960
Zero.

18:24.960 --> 18:25.960
So that's very interesting.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.960
It's Israel.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.880
I want to make that, I'd like everyone to be aware of that.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.280
That's a very important thing.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.760
This child is focusing on the blonde hair and the blue eyes, although the child has no

18:36.760 --> 18:39.760
actual experience of seeing people who look that way.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.440
So I think it's important to notice that.

18:41.440 --> 18:45.280
Although one of my students from the university pointed out that I have the closest thing

18:45.280 --> 18:48.480
to blue eyes that they've seen there.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.520
They have access to the larger culture.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.520
Absolutely.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.280
So they know, they're comparing themselves.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.760
This is an idealized.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
Yes.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.760
Absolutely.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.040
And one of the fathers complained to me that he doesn't raise his children.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.800
Israel culture raises his children.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.800
Okay.

19:03.800 --> 19:10.320
Just a parenthetically for those of you who may not know, testimony during Brown versus

19:10.320 --> 19:19.640
the Board of Education from Kenneth Clark, a psychologist, bore witness to the fact that

19:19.640 --> 19:27.320
black little girls preferred white baby dolls to black showing that separate but equal is

19:27.320 --> 19:29.480
not equal.

19:29.480 --> 19:37.320
So it is an interesting historical counterpart to idealizing the other rather than.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.760
It's very important to notice that the child is so young.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.280
This child is six years old.

19:43.280 --> 19:48.560
And this is nothing that was told to her by her parents.

19:48.560 --> 19:51.880
It was nothing that anybody tried to teach her.

19:51.880 --> 19:57.080
But it's something that she learned so profoundly that it's in her spontaneous story.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.080
Okay.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
Sorry for interrupting.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.840
But you're getting at the difference in the form of the figures.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.920
The drawing is here.

20:05.920 --> 20:09.480
The figure here is highly articulated.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.080
And the proportions of the figure are different.

20:12.080 --> 20:16.680
And the child is making an effort to give you some sense of the costume.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.240
Maybe Nathan, could you show the second one?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.240
Shoot to the family.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.480
I bring your mic up for one second.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.160
We have some problems with feedback.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.640
Do you want this one?

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
Yes.

20:26.640 --> 20:35.560
I think that's because I think that it's very important to see how carefully the child has

20:35.560 --> 20:44.000
made an effort to draw these figures with necks, with arms, with hands, with belts distinguishing

20:44.000 --> 20:48.960
the different sections of the body.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.080
And the sizes of the figures are articulated.

20:53.080 --> 21:05.880
And now if we go to the next child's drawing, same age.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.440
It's very primitive.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.440
Let me show you the next one.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.800
I need to show you to give you a sense of that.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.800
I mean, one of the things that...

21:11.800 --> 21:13.800
Sir, may I ask you a question?

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
Sir.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.800
Well...

21:15.800 --> 21:21.800
I think it's better that we hold the questions from the audience.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
Okay.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
Don't forget your question.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.800
Don't forget your question.

21:25.800 --> 21:31.080
But a way to begin to address what Ellen and I think Ted are pointing out in Ted will

21:31.080 --> 21:39.600
talk more about, I hope, is I used as a rough measure of looking at the form of the child

21:39.600 --> 21:44.560
gazelle score for the human figure.

21:44.560 --> 21:46.960
Here's a six-year-old boy drawing person.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.960
And you see...

21:47.960 --> 21:48.960
You see the look, right?

21:48.960 --> 21:49.960
Yes.

21:49.960 --> 21:55.280
I'll tell you the story in a moment, but just looking at it, Ellen, this is even more primitive

21:55.280 --> 21:56.280
than the previous.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.280
This is...

21:57.280 --> 22:04.400
Actually, this is very interesting what you show here because we know it's fascinating.

22:04.400 --> 22:12.080
We know that cross-culturally, the first image that a child of you gives the child the problem

22:12.080 --> 22:14.600
draw person.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.200
What happens is this.

22:16.200 --> 22:25.200
It's one closed form which represents some kind of confluence of head and body.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.680
Head is not distinguished from the body.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.800
It's one oval or circle or shape.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.960
One of which we find two eyes, sometimes...

22:34.960 --> 22:38.960
But usually eyes more than mouth.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.520
And the limbs protrude from that one shape.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.160
And the child will draw legs first.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.200
Only later will the child draw arms.

22:49.200 --> 22:55.720
But so the most primitive, earliest representation of the human form is this shape.

22:55.720 --> 23:03.560
And what's so incredibly fascinating is that the very child who draws this is the same

23:03.560 --> 23:08.800
child who, if you say to that child, what is this?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.320
The child will say ear.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.320
You say, what is this?

23:11.320 --> 23:12.760
The child will say nose.

23:12.760 --> 23:19.200
The child has the cognitive capacity to name all the parts of the body, or many, but when

23:19.200 --> 23:22.600
the child draws, the child will draw this.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.840
So we'll get into that later.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.040
I don't want to interrupt your presentation.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.040
This is fine.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.520
In the few minutes I'll show you the sequence, how that happens and so forth.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.360
These little primitive head feet think...

23:33.360 --> 23:35.920
Some people call them tadpoles.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.800
The Germans call them fuscupptions.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.800
Little footed heads.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.600
But just so...

23:45.600 --> 23:49.280
I can tell you the story it's written up there, but just so you know.

23:49.280 --> 23:55.680
That picture has one girl or two possibly, and the rest are all boys.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.000
The boys have all legs, no arms.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.440
The girl who has the crown around her, do you see her?

24:02.440 --> 24:04.720
Has arms.

24:04.720 --> 24:09.280
And the story about this, there's one other girl that's two persons over to the right.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.000
You see that with a little bit of a crown around her?

24:12.000 --> 24:17.080
So the only one figures with arms and there are women girls.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.440
And all the boys, the story he tells.

24:20.440 --> 24:26.040
So just the pictures alone we can read something from, but then listen to this boys story.

24:26.040 --> 24:31.320
And as you know, those of you who were children know, this is like a snapshot of the final

24:31.320 --> 24:32.320
product.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.960
If you watch the actual drawing of it and get a videotape, you see he's telling the story

24:35.960 --> 24:37.800
and he's drawing and drawing and drawing.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.720
As he's doing it and he says, this is a monster chasing him.

24:41.720 --> 24:45.440
That one with the girl with the arms.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.920
It's a kid, a girl, but she's a monster, a bad monster.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.760
She wants to devour someone.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.240
She eats boys and girls too.

24:53.240 --> 24:58.560
These are the roots of the monster, the stuff around the hair of the head.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.560
She has big teeth.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.560
She's angry because she hasn't eaten anything.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.840
And I ask, what happened to the boy?

25:03.840 --> 25:05.440
Because he's going to draw a boy.

25:05.440 --> 25:10.240
Oh, he ran and then a good monster came and drove her the bad monster away.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.440
Later another kid came and then another kid and ran away.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.440
Another kid.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.840
He's pulling on his tongue.

25:15.840 --> 25:21.240
He's licking his hand and he stops answering my questions and he's drawing pictures.

25:21.240 --> 25:29.880
Later at the very bottom, a big kid came and spooked the monster and she ran away.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.800
He's 27.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.960
He has courage.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.720
And later they carry him upwards.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.080
He licks his hand and he draws a lot of kids carrying the big kid because he killed the

25:40.080 --> 25:41.320
monster.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.640
That's his draw person.

25:43.640 --> 25:53.560
I'm thinking maybe I could just, I prefer to pause here and then, and here Ted and Alan

25:53.560 --> 25:54.560
take it from here.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.560
Is that okay with you?

25:55.560 --> 25:56.560
Sure.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.440
Why don't you go to my thing?

25:59.440 --> 26:08.880
I just want to tell you a bit about some studies that I did earlier on which have the developmental

26:08.880 --> 26:12.080
implications that we're talking about.

26:12.080 --> 26:20.280
That Nathan already mentioned the fact that we, can you find me?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.760
I'll go ahead.

26:21.760 --> 26:26.400
That we use drawings with children because sometimes it's easier to talk to them that

26:26.400 --> 26:28.880
way and you can talk about the drawings.

26:28.880 --> 26:34.280
We dare not take the drawings for being all there is because we want the inquiry about

26:34.280 --> 26:35.280
the drawings.

26:35.280 --> 26:39.440
We can tell from the form some things but we can't tell what the content means.

26:39.440 --> 26:44.960
It's a little bit like Freud's idea about dreams having manifest content and then latent

26:44.960 --> 26:46.160
content.

26:46.160 --> 26:51.040
You dare not use the drawing itself as the end.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.560
All it can tell you is something about the developmental process and what they're pulling

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
it from.

26:57.560 --> 27:00.720
Go to the first one.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.920
We use all these techniques to get around talking directly to kids.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.880
This is the sequence that Ellen was talking about.

27:07.880 --> 27:15.560
Another top is eyes in the circle then the little footed heads and then as you can see

27:15.560 --> 27:19.840
the arms even come off from the head and it's only later that maybe something else goes

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
on.

27:20.840 --> 27:26.000
Now what can we say about that from the standpoint of what is this the case?

27:26.000 --> 27:32.840
Why, if this is a projection and people suggest that the most important part of the head

27:32.840 --> 27:34.840
for an infant is the mouth.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.840
Why aren't the mouths there first?

27:36.840 --> 27:39.480
First of all we didn't know.

27:39.480 --> 27:47.280
I then did a study next slide which derived from the Good enough scoring method.

27:47.280 --> 27:52.280
The Good enough scoring method says that by three years of age you ought to be any of

27:52.280 --> 27:56.160
you body psychologists here can know.

27:56.160 --> 28:02.680
If you count, give a child 36 months and you count the number of features that it has you

28:02.680 --> 28:10.320
can add them all up and what three months for each item and then you add them up and

28:10.320 --> 28:14.560
you put them over their chronological age you get a rough estimate of IQ from this.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.760
So it does have developmental salience.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.240
It works up until about 12 years of age.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.840
You can get an approximation just from the form.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.440
You don't have to trust it but it correlates usually with something else.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.120
Next one please.

28:30.120 --> 28:35.400
Now along the way I and we do these little other figures that they're supposed to be

28:35.400 --> 28:37.600
able to do from two to seven.

28:37.600 --> 28:43.800
I then had a youngster who came from a very ache acidic family.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.960
He was somewhat challenged intellectually and so forth and I asked him to do a figure

28:48.960 --> 28:49.960
drawing.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.640
I wish I had the original there and he did the figure drawing which suggested that his

28:53.640 --> 28:55.800
mental age was not very good.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.920
But notice what's on his head.

28:59.920 --> 29:04.840
So now how does that fit into the developmental sequence?

29:04.840 --> 29:10.480
We have to add to all of the developmental propensities that salience in regard to the

29:10.480 --> 29:15.120
culture and what's there is also going to be added according to how much exposure they

29:15.120 --> 29:19.240
have which would be interestingly related to some of the things that he's telling you

29:19.240 --> 29:20.400
about this.

29:20.400 --> 29:26.560
I actually did a systematic study to see if indeed young children drew eyes and not mouths

29:26.560 --> 29:33.040
and sure enough it seemed to be true and we had good statistical findings.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.280
Go on.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.760
Don't bother.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.040
These are just the files.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
Okay.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.640
Now why eyes and a head from a biological vantage point?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.600
What is going on here?

29:47.600 --> 29:52.640
One of the things that Spitz showed us is developmentally at six weeks you get what

29:52.640 --> 29:54.760
they call a social smile.

29:54.760 --> 30:00.520
All you need to get a social smile is a full face and movement.

30:00.520 --> 30:06.800
You can pair that down by putting eyes on a balloon together and movement and you'll

30:06.800 --> 30:08.480
get the social smile.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.880
You mix those eyes up in different places.

30:10.880 --> 30:17.160
So what we have is a biological readiness for face recognition and social relatedness

30:17.160 --> 30:24.120
which always struck me as being a wonderful common factor in regard to three-year-olds.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.800
The three-year-olds are not projecting themselves.

30:26.800 --> 30:31.160
They're projecting the image of the other if you will at that moment.

30:31.160 --> 30:36.400
And it's only later that you begin to get the projective ideas that are being talked

30:36.400 --> 30:37.560
about here.

30:37.560 --> 30:45.520
Curiously on a biological level the representations are there are two areas of the brain which

30:45.520 --> 30:47.360
light up with face recognition.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.880
By the way, human beings are face experts.

30:50.880 --> 30:54.440
By the way, cross racially we're not very good because we don't have enough experience

30:54.440 --> 30:55.440
with it.

30:55.440 --> 31:00.000
But within racial groups, you know, that comes to the notion that people say when people

31:00.000 --> 31:03.080
of other races all look alike to them, that's not prejudice.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.840
It may indeed be something that is going on.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.560
So we're face experts.

31:09.560 --> 31:16.200
There's an area in the base of the brain called a fusiform area where this expertise is registered

31:16.200 --> 31:19.040
even at a biological level.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.760
Look at that.

31:20.760 --> 31:25.720
If you don't look at the eyes and the face as autistic children for example do not.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.000
They tend to look elsewhere.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
You realize this area is no longer used in the modular way that it was meant to for

31:34.000 --> 31:36.880
faces, for face recognition.

31:36.880 --> 31:44.520
If you get one of these kids who has obsessions as one of these Ari Klinn at Yale did, he studied

31:44.520 --> 31:48.720
a child who had a Pokemon craze.

31:48.720 --> 31:54.880
And he put Pokemon figures up there, that area lit up in the brain.

31:54.880 --> 32:02.120
So if you're a car nut, that's the area you're going to light up.

32:02.120 --> 32:09.000
So these are expertise differential areas that the brain subsumes in regard to this.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.360
Now on top of this we have all kinds of cultural issues of course once the child grows further.

32:14.360 --> 32:27.840
And we talked about the Clark study for the Brown versus the Board of Education.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.000
Go on, next one please.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.080
Now here's another area where salience becomes terribly important.

32:39.080 --> 32:45.320
This comes from a study that I did many years ago when I was at Bellevue NYU.

32:45.320 --> 32:52.320
I was asking an autistic boy who was probably eight years of age at that point to copy a

32:52.320 --> 32:54.120
square.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.680
He copied and he put those things and then he does these.

32:57.680 --> 33:04.480
The fact is in his day to day activity he was obsessed by wheels and spinning.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.480
Next one.

33:05.480 --> 33:11.440
Philip, he then incorporated it into his human figure drawings.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.000
Those are arms, those are legs.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.080
In the same way.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.720
So he didn't lose it.

33:16.720 --> 33:23.620
He kept it going because for him that was the essence of what he wanted to portray even

33:23.620 --> 33:26.880
in cooperating it into his new figure drawings.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.880
Next one.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.960
Oh, oh, there's a creative process that goes in.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.640
It's the kind of integration which goes on always.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.720
Here it is again, now he's a little more mature.

33:36.720 --> 33:40.480
Those look like pretty good stick figures and there's these circles.

33:40.480 --> 33:45.800
But notice the circles at the top very much mimic what we saw before.

33:45.800 --> 33:51.000
During the next year when his maturation was at his best and his language was beginning

33:51.000 --> 33:52.120
to get better.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.720
Next slide.

33:54.720 --> 33:55.880
This is what I got.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.920
Now these are pretty dynamic drawings if you look at it.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.480
He's doing a wheelie on his motorcycle and so forth.

34:03.480 --> 34:07.880
I just want to bring these to your attention that even though kids may be developmentally

34:07.880 --> 34:14.160
disabled or what have you, their capacity to represent themselves or others is a uniquely

34:14.160 --> 34:21.640
human situation but gets curtailed and modulated by the experiences that the child is capable

34:21.640 --> 34:28.000
of having because of some biological disability or because of some social disability.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.640
People who've studied figure drawings across nations and across cultures, if you don't

34:33.640 --> 34:41.280
have access to drawing materials, figure drawings are not a good thing to use because it isn't

34:41.280 --> 34:44.200
trained into their doing.

34:44.200 --> 34:49.680
In fact, what many parents do who have disordered kids and they realize they're doing developmental

34:49.680 --> 34:56.880
testing on them so they train them up to the task just like kids do SAT via studies and

34:56.880 --> 35:00.800
so forth which is unfortunate because that's not what this is all about.

35:00.800 --> 35:08.000
I just want to just highlight the idea of form versus function and salience in regard

35:08.000 --> 35:13.640
to content analysis in terms of what the meanings of these things may be.

35:13.640 --> 35:21.000
Here the meaning doesn't have a kind of psychodynamic but much more a developmental persistence

35:21.000 --> 35:28.000
perseverativeness from early on which they'll take this.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
There's so much pleasure in this drawing.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Imagine the child enjoying making that.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.200
The function's looks look so great in the drawing.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.400
That's another element I think we have to factor in.

35:40.400 --> 35:47.160
As we go on I will show you some other stuff that I got from a use of drawings.

35:47.160 --> 35:55.520
Two studies, one was single consultation using what Winnicott called the squiggle game when

35:55.520 --> 36:02.440
you have nonverbal children and how complex it could get in regard to interpsychic variables.

36:02.440 --> 36:09.960
And then later on another study that we did, great traumatologist Bob Pineous was a resident

36:09.960 --> 36:14.200
at Bellevue at Cornell at the time.

36:14.200 --> 36:22.480
When we did a study of we learned that children of suicidal patients in the hospital were not

36:22.480 --> 36:28.720
really ever told the facts about their parent suicide for fear of exposure but the kids

36:28.720 --> 36:29.720
knew it.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.320
I want to show you some drawings from that.

36:31.320 --> 36:39.200
So I just want to keep that in advance.

36:39.200 --> 36:49.040
I was told that we were supposed to be speaking spontaneously and not to prepare a text.

36:49.040 --> 36:55.080
So I really haven't but I do want to say a couple of things.

36:55.080 --> 37:00.320
First of all, in regard to your work, first of all I'm just thrilled to be here on this

37:00.320 --> 37:04.400
distinguished panel and I want to say for those of you who don't know Dr. Shapiro, he

37:04.400 --> 37:12.920
has made major contributions to this field and if I would be a very rich lady, if I had

37:12.920 --> 37:19.680
a dollar for every time in the past decades, I don't know how many decades, I have recommended

37:19.680 --> 37:25.520
his paper on the child age plus or minus seven.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.520
What is the exact-

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
Six plus.

37:27.520 --> 37:32.200
No, seven plus or minus one.

37:32.200 --> 37:38.440
It is, if you don't know this paper, it's absolutely marvelous and I recommend it not

37:38.440 --> 37:42.320
just to students but to teachers, parents, everyone.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.520
So I'm very thrilled to be here.

37:44.520 --> 37:54.040
I know just to go back to Nathan's presentation, it's very interesting what you did, that

37:54.040 --> 38:00.040
you had the child do the drawing and then you asked the child to tell the story after

38:00.040 --> 38:05.640
doing the drawing and the focus was very much on the story.

38:05.640 --> 38:17.640
Now how different is it we might ask ourselves for the child to do a drawing herself or himself

38:17.640 --> 38:23.720
and tell a story about the drawing that he or she has just made and to tell a story about

38:23.720 --> 38:27.920
a drawing that somebody else has made.

38:27.920 --> 38:33.760
How is that different from telling a child a story and asking a child to illustrate a

38:33.760 --> 38:40.080
story that the child has heard or to ask a child to tell a story and then do a picture

38:40.080 --> 38:42.080
related to the story.

38:42.080 --> 38:49.920
Now those questions that I'm asking, I'm asking them with malice of forethought because

38:49.920 --> 38:58.400
I think that after the drawing is made, the drawing stimulates ideas in the child that

38:58.400 --> 39:02.360
were not there when the child made the drawing.

39:02.360 --> 39:08.400
Therefore, that has to be, it seems to me, a part of the research.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.400
It's very different.

39:09.400 --> 39:14.640
The temporal sequence here is, I think, is important.

39:14.640 --> 39:21.040
I also think it's extremely important the context in which a child draws.

39:21.040 --> 39:27.560
Heidegger has a famous paper, George from the origin of the work of art in which he

39:27.560 --> 39:36.480
conceives of the work not as a drawing but as the work of the drawing, the process of

39:36.480 --> 39:37.480
the drawing.

39:37.480 --> 39:43.200
And I myself in my work am very interested in that, in the process by which the child

39:43.200 --> 39:44.200
draws.

39:44.200 --> 39:48.440
You give a child drawing implements.

39:48.440 --> 39:54.400
And you know in Darfur when there were all of the horrible genocide going on in Darfur,

39:54.400 --> 39:59.400
the human rights workers were interviewing the parents.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.360
The children were there.

40:01.360 --> 40:07.920
And just to keep the children busy and quiet, the front of the French workers gave the children

40:07.920 --> 40:10.040
some drawing materials.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.200
Children began to drop.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.160
They weren't told to do a drawing.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.480
They just drew.

40:15.480 --> 40:21.400
The drawings are stunning because the children drew the atrocities that were going on.

40:21.400 --> 40:26.480
Uninhibitedly they drew blood and death.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.920
And they even developed an iconography for it.

40:28.920 --> 40:34.720
So when you had a human being turned upside down, that was a dead person in the iconography

40:34.720 --> 40:38.800
that these children spontaneously evolved.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.440
But the children did the drawings without being told to do anything.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.440
We saw guns.

40:43.440 --> 40:49.360
We saw, I gave a lecture on this at the Sperdiss Institute in Chicago shortly after this.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.800
I got hold of this drawing.

40:53.800 --> 41:01.800
If you tell children, draw a boy or draw a girl, draw a human being, you are giving

41:01.800 --> 41:03.880
a task to the child.

41:03.880 --> 41:12.400
And part of what the child will do, I think, is to want to please the adult.

41:12.400 --> 41:16.840
In the same way that we have this problem with every kind of questionnaire that's given,

41:16.840 --> 41:24.840
where the person answering wants to please or do something appropriate or something acceptable.

41:24.840 --> 41:28.720
But I think that's very different from the child who gets something.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.160
And then we want to ask why.

41:31.160 --> 41:38.200
When you give a child drawing materials and the child starts to draw, why is the child

41:38.200 --> 41:39.200
drawing?

41:39.200 --> 41:41.640
What is the impetus for that?

41:41.640 --> 41:45.120
So in the literature, there are two schools of thought about that.

41:45.120 --> 41:50.120
The schools of thought are matching and marking.

41:50.120 --> 41:54.880
So you have scholars who say there's just a desire to make a mark.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.400
You know, kill or I was here.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
You make your mark.

41:59.400 --> 42:05.720
And then there's a school of thought that the idea is to represent something.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.600
Draw something that looks like something, that represents something.

42:09.600 --> 42:15.400
As we see, for example, in Lesco in the cave paintings.

42:15.400 --> 42:20.120
And there's a division about which of these impulses is primary.

42:20.120 --> 42:27.880
In the psychoanalytic literature, there's a brilliant paper by Ernst Chris, who's a great,

42:27.880 --> 42:31.720
not only a great psychoanalytic writer, but he was an art historian at the Kriśtus

42:31.720 --> 42:32.720
Dorsches Museum in Vienna.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.600
And it has this amazing paper.

42:34.600 --> 42:39.000
It's not in his book, Psychoanalytic Explorations in Art.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
It's not.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.320
It's in the psychoanalytic study, The Child, I think.

42:42.320 --> 42:46.560
And in this paper, he describes a little boy at the easel.

42:46.560 --> 42:50.200
I think it's a boy, I think, but it doesn't make, it could make absolutely no difference

42:50.200 --> 42:52.160
to you, a girl just as easily.

42:52.160 --> 42:59.760
And the child is taking paint and brush and making wonderful marks and just the pleasure

42:59.760 --> 43:04.960
of putting the paint on this paper is the impetus, impetus.

43:04.960 --> 43:15.200
And Chris describes it, and then at a certain point, the child looks at what's there.

43:15.200 --> 43:24.080
And the child takes a color and puts something on the page in response to what is actually

43:24.080 --> 43:25.080
there.

43:25.080 --> 43:30.000
And in that moment, Chris suggests this is the moment when art is born.

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
This is the moment where you begin to have an artist because the artist isn't just enjoying

43:36.000 --> 43:40.120
the smearing and the fun of the materials.

43:40.120 --> 43:46.800
The artist is actually making what we're using ego functions of judgment and developing skill

43:46.800 --> 43:53.400
to try to make something that pleases him cognitively, intellectually, aesthetically.

43:53.400 --> 43:58.640
So I don't think we have to choose, but when we think about children's drawings, I think

43:58.640 --> 44:05.560
we may want to ask ourselves about these questions of marking and matching.

44:05.560 --> 44:12.440
The second point I want to make, which is another big, huge conflict in the literature

44:12.440 --> 44:20.960
on children's drawings, is the question which really bears on these two, both of your presentations.

44:20.960 --> 44:28.320
The presentation that you gave Nathan, where we see these children who are exile children

44:28.320 --> 44:35.560
coming to Israel from Ethiopia in a new land with all kinds of problems of immigration

44:35.560 --> 44:42.040
and so on, attachment which was then the perspective that you brought.

44:42.040 --> 44:47.600
Yeah, I call you Ted.

44:47.600 --> 44:52.320
Where you talked about the scientific, the universal kinds of issues.

44:52.320 --> 45:02.200
So there are certain scholars who say the children will draw because this is how it

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
is.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.400
This is the biological necessity to do certain things.

45:07.400 --> 45:14.480
Other people will say absolutely not, but children are drawing its profoundly conditioned

45:14.480 --> 45:17.680
by the cultural context in which the child draws.

45:17.680 --> 45:25.920
And I see these two perspectives as, there's a lot of fighting in the literature about

45:25.920 --> 45:28.280
this, but I don't think we have to fight about it.

45:28.280 --> 45:35.680
I think we can simply see that it's a huge mistake to just talk about what's lighting

45:35.680 --> 45:38.600
up in the brain without understanding the culture.

45:38.600 --> 45:44.960
Ellen, I have a parallel comment about that that may be related to.

45:44.960 --> 45:50.600
That human beings, whatever culture they are, whatever language is spoken, speak a language

45:50.600 --> 45:56.160
and fairly competently by three years of age is a human issue.

45:56.160 --> 46:01.480
Whether you speak English or German depends on what your mother took, spoke to you.

46:01.480 --> 46:05.160
So that's a parallel notion.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.640
The capacity to do it is one thing.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.640
What you do and what its content is.

46:09.640 --> 46:22.280
It doesn't solve a third issue, which is the issue of why is it that the child takes so

46:22.280 --> 46:31.440
much longer to draw what the child can articulate, describe, and say.

46:31.440 --> 46:34.360
Once again, there are a lot of theories about this.

46:34.360 --> 46:41.720
A great root of Aernheim has a theory about this, but we know that every child by three

46:41.720 --> 46:49.360
can name every toe and every finger and so on, but the child will not draw that.

46:49.360 --> 46:56.640
I think that's probably a matter of maturation and biological integration.

46:56.640 --> 47:06.680
In fact, one of the questions that comes up, I showed you, the head end of the organism

47:06.680 --> 47:07.080
is highly put together in the beginning of life.

47:07.080 --> 47:11.440
Development goes from the head down, Cephalocore.

47:11.440 --> 47:16.720
The child doesn't even appreciate too stimuli, for example, if you touch a hand in the face,

47:16.720 --> 47:22.360
they won't appreciate the hand until they're pushing towards six.

47:22.360 --> 47:25.720
All of these are newly integrated aspects of it.

47:25.720 --> 47:29.320
They don't represent the middle of the body, you'll notice, but they represent the hands

47:29.320 --> 47:32.520
and the toes, which is just the way the brain is organized.

47:32.520 --> 47:39.400
If you look at the sensory strip, the thumb has a huge area of that brain compared to

47:39.400 --> 47:40.640
what the middle of the body.

47:40.640 --> 47:46.120
If you use something as simple as two-point discrimination on your finger, you can get

47:46.120 --> 47:47.520
it a millimeter away.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.880
You'll get two points.

47:48.880 --> 47:51.320
You do it on your back.

47:51.320 --> 47:54.240
You can get three inches, and they won't feel two points.

47:54.240 --> 48:00.120
There is a maturational aspect of this, I think, which is involved in control of the

48:00.120 --> 48:06.520
pencil to do the thing, which is different from how wonderfully language apparatus is.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.320
Remember, the first year is nonverbal.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.680
Infancy means without speech.

48:11.680 --> 48:18.440
Then all of a sudden, between one year and three years of age, you become a one-word person

48:18.440 --> 48:25.840
to a well-articulated seven-word sentence phrase, representational stuff.

48:25.840 --> 48:32.680
The language apparatus is much more maturationally available to you than the representational

48:32.680 --> 48:33.680
thing.

48:33.680 --> 48:40.480
The only people who's, the only creatures on Earth who not only speak and think in language

48:40.480 --> 48:44.080
of that sort, but also write and represent themselves.

48:44.080 --> 48:56.440
I also think that there is a brilliant kind of symbolism in these early drawings that

48:56.440 --> 49:07.200
they are somehow, the child shows what's important in a way that Picasso famously said, it's

49:07.200 --> 49:09.280
taken me years to learn to draw like a child.

49:09.280 --> 49:20.080
There's a certain way in which the child gets down when the child is left to do it.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.920
Why did you say in use of a wonderful phrase, trained up for it?

49:23.920 --> 49:27.640
Well, the child isn't trained up for it, but when the child is left, the child has a way

49:27.640 --> 49:33.080
of getting down in the simplest way what really matters.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.680
That drawing was amazing.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.920
That drawing was the scooter bicycle thing.

49:37.920 --> 49:47.320
So I think that's also a part of it, that there's a certain beautiful simplicity with

49:47.320 --> 49:53.640
all the little details that we learn sort of shunted aside because they're not what matters.

49:53.640 --> 49:58.040
I wanted to tell you that, Ellen, as you were talking, I was looking for one example that

49:58.040 --> 50:04.640
I don't have here, but you mentioned how as a child is drawing things happen, change,

50:04.640 --> 50:06.240
and influences what happens next.

50:06.240 --> 50:09.280
I wanted to give you one example of that.

50:09.280 --> 50:13.680
One I wanted wasn't here, but I'll find it is, again, in asking the child to do a house

50:13.680 --> 50:17.920
tree person, a family drawing, we get to see picture picture picture.

50:17.920 --> 50:21.920
So here, for instance, this is one girl, happens to be seven.

50:21.920 --> 50:22.920
So she does a person.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.240
We know she can draw a person.

50:24.240 --> 50:28.000
It's not maybe very clear, but there's a stick person with a fancy head.

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Then another person, next to it, she can draw the person.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.720
She can draw a tree.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.680
She can draw a house.

50:34.680 --> 50:38.280
And then I asked her to draw a picture of a family doing something, and she does that

50:38.280 --> 50:40.560
thing up there on the right hand side.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.440
Do you see it?

50:42.440 --> 50:45.560
So, and very careful and detailed.

50:45.560 --> 50:49.640
And I said, tell me about this.

50:49.640 --> 51:00.160
And she says, the two light purple balls, which are at six and nine o'clock, and there

51:00.160 --> 51:02.720
are two dark purple balls at twelve and three o'clock.

51:02.720 --> 51:05.160
I think you can see the colors and differences.

51:05.160 --> 51:09.520
And then she says, the vertical yellow line connects the light and dark balls, that's

51:09.520 --> 51:11.480
at twelve and six.

51:11.480 --> 51:16.240
And then there's this line drawing horizontally between three and nine o'clock.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.240
She's going through this very carefully.

51:18.240 --> 51:23.520
And then she explains that these lines keep the balls apart because if they get too close,

51:23.520 --> 51:26.920
they explode.

51:26.920 --> 51:30.080
So here you have something else that's crept into.

51:30.080 --> 51:34.520
This girl can draw figures, and this is her kinetic family drawing, and the answer is,

51:34.520 --> 51:38.840
this is her kinetic family drawing.

51:38.840 --> 51:44.480
Family therapists talk about trying in families, this is a drawing of it.

51:44.480 --> 51:48.880
But another more profound example was a boy who drew very tiny figures.

51:48.880 --> 51:55.200
A boy, really tiny in the middle of a big page, only pencil, no color.

51:55.200 --> 51:59.200
And then he does a tiny tree in a tiny house, and then I say, no, and not draw a picture

51:59.200 --> 52:01.760
of a family doing something.

52:01.760 --> 52:09.320
And he looks, if I'm you, he's looking at me during the pencil, it's pointed and poisoned

52:09.320 --> 52:12.240
the air, and then he goes like this.

52:12.240 --> 52:17.360
Looking up in the corner over there, and my student from the university is sitting there

52:17.360 --> 52:19.960
ready to take notes, and nothing's happening.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.720
And I ask, do you understand what I mean by a family doing something?

52:23.720 --> 52:26.200
And the student says, do you know what a family is?

52:26.200 --> 52:30.200
And he goes, and he goes like this.

52:30.200 --> 52:34.360
So this boy says something in what he doesn't do.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.000
That is something about the family for him.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.920
Let's say, interferes with his, what he can do, which is to draw figures.

52:40.920 --> 52:43.360
So this is so important.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.920
That's what I'm interested in.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.080
I'm very interested in that.

52:46.080 --> 52:52.040
I'm interested in that, in the child taking time, not doing something.

52:52.040 --> 52:55.960
And also, what does the child draw first?

52:55.960 --> 52:58.000
So you have a family.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.160
Which figure does the child draw first?

53:01.160 --> 53:02.680
Does the child draw the father first?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.160
Does the child draw himself first?

53:05.160 --> 53:07.720
And where are these figures placed?

53:07.720 --> 53:09.920
And which ones are close?

53:09.920 --> 53:13.080
Which ones are far away from each other?

53:13.080 --> 53:18.600
But I really think it's dangerous, or not dangerous, that's too strong a word.

53:18.600 --> 53:25.920
But I think it's maybe irresponsible to put too much, I think you said this, to put too

53:25.920 --> 53:32.800
much weight on any thing of this kind.

53:32.800 --> 53:40.720
It's only useful when it's in the context, in a much larger context.

53:40.720 --> 53:48.520
And what I think we really can't do is to treat a child's drawing as we would treat

53:48.520 --> 53:53.960
a complex work of our, you know, a statue by Bernini or a painting by Rembrandt.

53:53.960 --> 53:59.480
A child's drawing is something else.

53:59.480 --> 54:03.600
It's something which is spontaneous.

54:03.600 --> 54:06.600
It does have psychological content.

54:06.600 --> 54:09.800
Indubitably, it does.

54:09.800 --> 54:20.680
But I think that it needs a great deal of context before it can be said to have any kind of

54:20.680 --> 54:21.680
definitive.

54:21.680 --> 54:25.000
Does that make sense to you?

54:25.000 --> 54:29.440
Why one does a study as I did over three years with these families?

54:29.440 --> 54:34.440
But that's also why you ask them to draw something and then you use it as a vehicle

54:34.440 --> 54:40.440
to then probe ideas that you might have asked directly because you know if you ask it directly,

54:40.440 --> 54:46.240
you're not going to get the same rich experience that you got or the kind of creative aspects

54:46.240 --> 54:49.480
that we're talking about.

54:49.480 --> 54:53.000
Maybe it's, let me show you two images.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Push ahead.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.840
More.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.600
Down further.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.080
Further further.

55:02.080 --> 55:03.960
More.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.960
More.

55:05.960 --> 55:07.960
There we go.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.880
Okay.

55:09.880 --> 55:10.880
Go one more.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.040
And then I'll go back to this because this is, okay.

55:14.040 --> 55:21.000
This came from the study that I mentioned before of kids whose parents were hospitalized

55:21.000 --> 55:24.800
for suicide attempts.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.280
And we used only drawings as a starting point.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.720
We didn't ask them about anything.

55:29.720 --> 55:33.560
And one of the things we became aware of as if the parents lied to them about what they

55:33.560 --> 55:37.800
were doing, while everything was perfectly evident, and then many of the kids knew, in

55:37.800 --> 55:40.960
fact, even knew when the parents were doing.

55:40.960 --> 55:47.680
This is a drawing of a youngster who drew his father, who was in the hospital, who had

55:47.680 --> 55:52.240
slashed up his neck and his wrists.

55:52.240 --> 55:57.640
And those are direct representations of his father's bandaged hands and his father's

55:57.640 --> 56:01.720
straggly beard, which was covering up everything else.

56:01.720 --> 56:10.080
Now there the manifest content is smashing in relation to its immediacy.

56:10.080 --> 56:17.600
But the further inquiry was to realize that there's more behind this.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.520
We knew he realized that we knew it was there, and so forth and so on.

56:21.520 --> 56:26.640
No matter how many people lied to him, at least we had some evidentiary base that this is his

56:26.640 --> 56:28.600
acknowledgment of it.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.480
So there the manifest content is useful to us.

56:32.480 --> 56:36.200
But it's not, didn't tell us what he was thinking, feeling and what have you.

56:36.200 --> 56:41.120
By the way, one of the outcomes of this study, which was then advanced later on at other

56:41.120 --> 56:47.000
places, Bob became a great student of trauma.

56:47.000 --> 56:53.000
He interviewed a lot of kids who was one parent killed the other right in the police station

56:53.000 --> 56:55.400
and used these drawing techniques.

56:55.400 --> 56:58.840
I just wanted to tell you about how useful it is.

56:58.840 --> 57:01.320
Go one back now.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.720
Okay.

57:04.720 --> 57:08.400
Let me tell you the background of this because I'm going to get to this drawing.

57:08.400 --> 57:13.960
It was a little girl, very shy, very tiring, five years of age.

57:13.960 --> 57:21.160
Her father, a surgeon, had brought it to see me many years ago.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.920
The family had suffered a loss.

57:23.920 --> 57:30.720
A relative of theirs had lost two children and a mother in a fire in a country home.

57:30.720 --> 57:35.640
And she knew about it, etc., and was having, wasn't sleeping very well.

57:35.640 --> 57:41.560
Well, her father brought her into the office after I had gotten some history and so forth

57:41.560 --> 57:43.480
from them separately.

57:43.480 --> 57:44.680
And she was very shy.

57:44.680 --> 57:47.080
She was hanging behind her father.

57:47.080 --> 57:50.520
She wasn't going to talk and so forth and so on.

57:50.520 --> 57:54.240
So I let them both come into the consulting room together.

57:54.240 --> 57:58.520
And I realized I wasn't going to get very far with her.

57:58.520 --> 58:02.080
I started peppering her with questions or doing anything.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.320
So I took a stack of paper and I said, I just read Winnicott and Winnicott has something

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
called a squiggle game.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.360
You make a little squiggle and they finish it and then you take another sheet of paper

58:10.360 --> 58:11.560
and then we go further.

58:11.560 --> 58:13.760
We must have had 15 squiggles in the midst of it.

58:13.760 --> 58:16.680
I was brave enough to ask her father to go out.

58:16.680 --> 58:20.280
And he goes out and she stayed with me and she loosened up and she began talking about

58:20.280 --> 58:21.280
things.

58:21.280 --> 58:23.280
And Winnicott talks about when things become precongous.

58:23.280 --> 58:28.960
And anyway, along the way there's a lot of stuff.

58:28.960 --> 58:34.400
Until finally she gets to her being very fond of parties and parties which have this kind

58:34.400 --> 58:36.800
of represent they snoopy parties and so forth.

58:36.800 --> 58:42.240
And then her brother she said was having a party where there was a fireman theme.

58:42.240 --> 58:53.160
So I picked up on that and I said I heard that there was a sad fire in the family and

58:53.160 --> 58:54.680
there was a sad fire in the family.

58:54.680 --> 59:02.520
Okay, she says, yes, I said that they died so she spontaneously now tells me without my

59:02.520 --> 59:04.760
asking her about it.

59:04.760 --> 59:09.200
You know the sister did get out so there's some repair in the fact that not everybody

59:09.200 --> 59:10.200
went.

59:10.200 --> 59:12.000
I look at my daddy's surgery book.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.600
Now where did that come from?

59:16.600 --> 59:21.680
So you pay attention to the associated path and so forth as to what's going on.

59:21.680 --> 59:28.440
Now she had made reference to her father being a surgeon and he put people to sleep with

59:28.440 --> 59:30.560
what she calls sleepy air.

59:30.560 --> 59:36.480
And by the way, she remembers she has a sleep disturbance.

59:36.480 --> 59:41.160
I looked at my daddy's surgery book and the pictures of them doing dog surgery.

59:41.160 --> 59:50.240
My mother and Amy, these are fictitious names, had their appendixes out.

59:50.240 --> 59:51.960
Where does this come from?

59:51.960 --> 59:55.920
You sit there amazed as to where, what's happening here?

59:55.920 --> 59:56.920
Okay.

59:56.920 --> 01:00:03.040
I said, your mother and Amy, she said, well they only had to take it out if it's infected

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.680
and you cut a hole in a blanket and then you're asleep.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.160
I saw my mother scar.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.760
I hear she's going on.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.440
I said, maybe you'd like to draw it.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.920
That's a picture.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:24.000
If she says to me, what if it comes out looking like a child?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.520
I'll leave it up to you as we go along to make the inferences.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520
Okay.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.120
I said, do it as you like to do it.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:38.160
She draws and says, the oval part of the scar is what I'm going to show and she has a ponytail

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.160
too.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.960
I said, you have one too because she had a long, she looked at me disdainfully.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.120
She said, it's a braid, not a ponytail.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.480
And then she says, my hair is as long.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.800
No, it's longer than my mother's.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.120
And then we went on to something else.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.520
Okay.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.560
What has this got to do with the loss of those two kids?

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.440
Her not being able to go to sleep.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:13.520
Her father being a surgeon and whatever is going on with her about the marvel that while

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.160
someone sleeps, his father makes holes in their body.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:26.280
And then juxtaposed to that as a long ponytail to make up for it.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.280
Adepish medapists.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.440
So, I know what she is.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440
But five.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.160
So, she's, to me, the most absolutely.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.000
By the way, you notice she has the flipper arms of the other child.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.440
Very common thing.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.000
But she has five fingers on it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.160
That she, that she sneaks that remark.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.720
The appendix, something is going to come out.

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:50.720
Supposed it looks like a child.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.920
I mean, that's absolutely stunning.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.200
That is stunning.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.080
And it's so, it's so real.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:01.440
I mean, children, that's exactly the kind of thing a child would think, would say, would

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.320
imagine what could come out.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.160
We know it comes out of mommies.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.640
Oh my God.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.960
And the drawing is, and it's interesting, you know, what, one thing interesting about

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.880
the drawing when you look at it is that you have to remember also aesthetically how

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.480
do children learn to draw?

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.560
This is again going back to this remark about the culture.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.200
Look at the nose.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.880
That little upside down you is a convention for doing a nose that some children learn

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.640
by looking at some picture books that have that as a convention.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.040
We've all seen that.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:42.920
So certain, certain mannerisms in the drawing, when you're interpreting, if you are in

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:49.840
interpreting it, you have to remember that children will develop mannerisms that come

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.640
from the culture.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.560
And that is definitely a mannerism.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.800
We can't assume that the mother who knows it looks anything like that.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.720
That's simply probably every drawing, that will be the way the nose, this child will

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:03.720
draw the nose.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.880
Another child will draw the nose with a flat line or a straight line or a u that goes the

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880
other way.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:16.480
We have about 15 minutes remaining, so I thought maybe it was time to open up for questions

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480
from others.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480
Is that okay?

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:48.460
The blonde child, how do you determine the ability of the person drawing, the child

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:58.080
drawing against his or her creativity or individuality?

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:09.560
Then you've got another picture, the artist show that girls with arms and boys without

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.080
arms.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:20.240
Would this not be imagination running faster than the ability to draw, to get it down.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.400
The girls came first, I think.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.400
No?

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:28.240
All right, then I'm wrong about let that go.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:35.080
But one thing that runs through what I have heard today, as it seems to me, you're making

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:42.080
an assumption that drawing ability of all children of the same age or to be the same

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.080
or is the same.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.080
Not at all.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.080
Well, that's what I mean.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080
Not at all.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.280
I think that's what Ted was laying out here.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.720
But in fact, I didn't take all the time, I didn't want to take all the time I should,

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.920
but part of the study in the book is we looked at how very different developmental capacity

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.680
for drawing was at the same age.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.800
That's the advantage and that's why I chose to look only at six years of age.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.480
But go ahead, something else you wanted to ask her.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.800
Yeah, just a couple of quick points because they all are around the same issue.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.880
It's not what I heard, by the way.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.440
Read the autistic child and the bicycle.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.440
I don't know how many people in this room could draw that bicycle as stunningly as

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.640
this autistic.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.320
That child has artistic ability.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:38.680
I mean, I certainly couldn't do it.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:44.560
And then the idea of, well, you went into this which came first, the drawing on the

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.080
other.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.640
So the bike and the, where was the family?

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.640
Oh, yes.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.160
The abstract drawing of you told her to draw a family.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:58.680
That abstract with the dots, so the yellow line and so on.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:06.800
In this case, what I see, and I'm not a professional, but what I see, is in the bike, the artist,

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:13.520
or the youngster has extraordinary drawing ability, capacity, even though he's artistic.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:23.120
And as far as the child who did the abstract family, think of the abstract ability of that

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:31.520
child far beyond her age, far beyond her age, to be able to contemplate such a representation

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.520
of her family.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.080
Well, anyway, that's what I wanted to say.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.440
Could I respond to the first two, to your first point?

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.880
Because I'm so glad you made that point.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:46.440
I think that I was sort of, when you started, I knew, I kind of knew where you were going

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.440
with that.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.200
Because I think it's really important.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:59.040
So what you're suggesting is that that image, which I plead guilty to calling primitive,

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:07.160
what could in fact be an amazingly creative expression on the part of the child who could

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.840
have possibly drawn the figure in other ways.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.440
And I think that's very, very important to keep in mind.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:24.920
And the cognitive ability, the ability to draw something, is something which you did,

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.680
is trained up.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.200
It is something that is trained up a child, and is rewarded.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.920
The parent will say, oh, wow, when a child does it correctly, like coloring in the lines

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.520
on the coloring book.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.200
These are things that the culture is rewarding.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.920
But a child who does it in that magical way, like the bicycle or the other way, that child

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.840
might not be rewarded.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.960
And it might not be right to call it primitive.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.920
It might be right to call it something else.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.440
So I really, I appreciate that so much.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.960
And I plead guilty and I stand corrected.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.320
And I think that's a wonderful contribution.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320
Thank you.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.200
If I'm going to add one thing, I have a granddaughter who's going to be three, but I,

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:10.400
she's a little over two and a half, because the right time for the system, anyway, she

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.400
loves to draw.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.280
She can't draw to save her life.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.720
I mean, you know, she can't, she just scribbles.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:29.560
But give her stickies, the stickons, and she will create a montage with an oddest sensibility,

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:35.560
you know, an equal number of horizontal followed by an equal number of vertical or a circle.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.160
And it has four.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.560
So we have about ten minutes.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:48.600
So to get an idea so that you all know how many questions there are, perhaps as Rob

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.560
suggested, those who have questions, if you would step up and line so we know how many

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.240
people have questions, then you can keep that in mind when you ask your own question.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.320
There should not be a war between the artists and the humanists here.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:06.120
I mean, this is not that I'm not against creativity.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:12.280
I just want to know what aspects of capacity with developmental achievement.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:15.600
There are people who have very different abilities to be sure to be creative.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.880
I'll tell you one point where you hit a lot of tension between those who wish for and

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.280
foster creativity and the kids in another camp.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.320
You get six and seven year olds, you tend into art school, everybody wants them to be terrifically

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:30.320
creative.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.600
You know what a six and seven year old wants?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.040
Control of the medium.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.640
So he can make it work for himself in the way in which he wants to.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.200
Also there's a tension between our encouraging, you know, the artistic.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.640
Go ahead.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.760
Thank you so much for your good work in coming out today.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.280
And sometimes I've been a teaching artist early childhood education.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.480
So first of all, you might find it interesting anybody here that I have a video up on YouTube

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.240
where five year old kindergarten kids from Inwood say no adults left behind.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.000
They sit in their little kindergarten chairs and they ask each other questions about life

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.160
what makes you happy, say, why do people like, cheat and fight?

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.600
And the five year old spontaneously, no adults in this have better answers than most adults.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.800
So my question is going back to as Alice Miller who I greatly admire, she's one of

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.560
her main ideas was emotion attaches meaning to experience.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.960
If there's no emotion, there's no way that anybody can create meaning and understanding

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.760
and of reading, writing experiences got to be an emotion.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.520
When it comes to education, emotion is left out like it's the plague.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.240
So for a five year old and I'm still like a recovering five year old in my own life,

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:50.320
it is like all the emotionality is that if my mommy and daddy scream yell and fight like

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:57.080
some of these things with from Ethiopia, it must be because I'm a monster.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:03.120
And that's like the emperor's new, you know, the P under the 20 blankets of saying I am

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.200
a horrible and my whole life is predicated, I'm a monster.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.280
But to use this because language hasn't evolved yet, but when it comes to like primary and

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:19.400
basic education, institutionalized education rather than just somebody who has a psychiatric

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:25.760
problem that you have lots of experience credentials that these kinds of ideas to help a child

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:34.360
emotionally express the feelings that lead to meaning and understanding, but in a way

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:39.800
that is connected with the development of the brain.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:46.720
Do you see positive things about how these things could be introduced into everyday education

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:53.080
in the classroom rather than making a five year old be a grown up adult when he's five?

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.640
You know, I mean, is it something you're doing?

01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:01.320
You're taking action on or, you know, how would that, what you're doing?

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.960
This is my, I'll finish up here.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.800
Compliment, you know, the push to get a five year old to read and write.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800
Okay.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:15.480
I think you have articulated a wonderful new topic for the healing foundation, but we couldn't

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.640
possibly address it in this, it's a huge problem in America today.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.160
And not just in America, but in China and India and everywhere.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.760
It's a huge problem.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.720
You're addressing something enormous, sir.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.520
What I'm just saying.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.800
We're asking you for addressing it, but I don't think we can answer it yet.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:40.240
I'm also motivating you all who have credentials, who are greatly admired to maybe take the

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.040
initiative that you can do something about this and make a difference in the lives of

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.960
hundreds of children.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960
You can do it.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.200
But it takes people like you to take the initiative.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:56.760
And I greatly, you know, in the name of children, you know, I'm sorry.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.720
Thank you very much.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.720
Thank you.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:04.320
I'm not going to move to you, I just maybe just a supplement to this.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.320
The program that I worked in, I chose very carefully in Israel.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.240
In general, the Ethiopian kids are integrated into all the public school systems, but the

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.120
public school systems in Israel, the classrooms are 35 to 38 children.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.160
I can't even begin to understand how they do that, but the kids learn, they're really

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:25.880
smart and they do well academically.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.920
When the Weizels were asked when they wanted to do something significant in Israel, and

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:34.360
the Weizel used his Nobel Prize money to do this, he specifically set up an after school

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.800
program for Ethiopian kids only in two communities, Ashkelon, the one that I was in in Kiyah

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.320
Malahi.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.880
And the focus on the program was on academics, reading and writing.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.320
These parents who are illiterate or pre-literate, it's very important to them that their kids

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320
learn to read and write.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.720
And to get ahead in Israel, you need to read and write.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.000
And the focus in the program really is helping them with their academics.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.360
They do it in a remarkably warm way.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.600
The classrooms are 18 children, or 15 children, or 17 children.

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:10.040
And I chose of all the classrooms, I picked one where I thought there was a teacher who

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:16.640
was really very connected with the kids and effective.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.680
So the teachers did say, when I asked, I took the kids out to draw, I was the picture doctor,

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.040
they called me from Jerusalem.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.440
They would sometimes be surprised at what the kids revealed.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:35.240
First they didn't know that was going on in the family, or they might have known, but

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:36.240
they didn't know the details.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.920
So they were surprised at what the kids could reveal with that.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.280
So that can maybe supplement or compliment what their work was.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:46.760
But it was clearly important, and I support what they were doing, that the kids should

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.560
learn their academics.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.840
And the kids enjoyed it.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.760
I had the pleasure of writing a blog for Nathan's book.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.240
And one of the things that hasn't come out today, and you ought to read it, is that most

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:06.000
of these families were traumatized.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.160
And whatever they were doing there must have come through in some of these drawings here

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.840
or there and so forth.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.960
The women were forced into marriage when they were teenagers.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.560
The second thing is that they were immigrants from a culture which was persecuting them

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.760
and then they were here and they found this place to live and bring up their children.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.680
So there's a lot that's not being told about this that you ought to learn somewhere else.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.680
But I just want to...

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:38.240
I think three or seventeen plus or minus two short questions.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.280
One has to do with...

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.920
I really thought your discussion was very stimulating.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.360
One had to do with the relationship between the drawings and the writings.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360
The stories.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.120
The stories seemed to be, as you...

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.560
And none say them, were very sophisticated.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.520
They seemed like they were pretty...

01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:59.120
They weren't in any way illiterate.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.760
They were pretty sophisticated.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.200
So I was curious about the relationship that you perceived having to do with that.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.600
The second question is somewhat related and it had to do with the extent to which these

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.800
drawings or stories have a therapeutic value in and of themselves.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:14.800
Right.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.440
The third is a little bit more...

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:18.440
That's a question.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.240
The third is a little more of a comment and I was very impressed that I am with the international

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.120
relation, the global and comparative cultural differences that exist.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.880
And I think they have pretty significant.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:37.360
Because there are stick drawings that kids in Africa use because they haven't seen sort

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.360
of...

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.600
They can use photographs as well or three-dimensional because they haven't seen them.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.080
They haven't seen airplanes, well now they do maybe.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.320
But they're more familiar with cartoon stick drawings.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:49.040
Anyway, those are the two main questions.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.400
The second one I'll start with is the therapeutic quality.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.880
One of the things that comes out in our work and tend to refer to it is to a Winnicott

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:04.760
squiggle game is that it's hard as a doc to not try to do something that's helpful, even

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.600
if you're supposed to be diagnosing.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.560
Or I was trained in developmental assessment by Sally Provens and Sally's emphasis to

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.280
us is to help the child do the best he or she can.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.160
You want to get the best picture that can do.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.880
Not literal drawing.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.040
So yes, but if I'd come in as a therapist, many of the parents would have been skeptical

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:28.040
of me.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:32.640
In fact, one of the conditions of my doing the research by the parents, I could see the

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.160
kids I could draw, I could tell stories, I could come to the homes, I could do no testing.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:44.840
No IQ, no projective, nothing like that because they were specific about this.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:48.880
They were worried that the Israeli government would get the information and would do something

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.920
to their kids.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.840
So that's a subversive quality.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.040
The first question is a more complex one as I recall it.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:05.920
And that is I had over 300 pictures that the kids did in stories and it varied the nature

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.480
of the story versus the picture, the richness of complexity, depending on the kid and so

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.000
on.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.840
And I had kids who would start saying I don't know how to draw a person.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.920
And I said that's okay.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.000
Then they drew a person.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.400
This stuns me when I see this happen.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:35.080
So my sort of unsatisfactory answer is it depends when it comes to the relationship between

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:43.640
story and drawing.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.200
Let me think, I think there are others can answer that.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.600
I want to think about that.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.800
I would like to relate this gentleman's question to this gentleman's question because I think

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.240
those two questions really can be brought together.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:02.160
The second, your second question and your question.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.520
I think there is inherent therapeutic value.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:14.760
When a child is given a chance to express herself or himself, this is inherently in a

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:20.760
constructive kind of way with drawing materials, with singing, with dancing, with writing a

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:26.960
poem or with when a child has those experiences, it is inherently therapeutic.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:33.640
I was the Erickson scholar at Austin Riggs in Stockbridge and one of the most wonderful

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:42.000
things in that community, which is an inpatient center, is that there are all kinds of places

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:47.800
for patients to do drama, to do artwork, to do all these things.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.560
The person who was really responsible for that was Joan Erickson, who was an art therapist,

01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:03.440
who did not believe in interpreting the content of the drawing, but who believed in something

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.760
so amazing.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:13.720
She said, let's bring an artist, a practicing artist, a sculptor, for example, into Riggs

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:21.240
and give the sculptor a studio and let the sculptor work and let patients come in and

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:27.240
just be there with the sculptor and talk to them and interact with them and then they

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.800
can have materials and they can do this work.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:35.440
So your point about what's good in education for kids and your point about is it inherently

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:39.600
therapeutic are very easy to bring together.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.920
These are activities that we are not giving priority to and what you said Nathan is so

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.640
true.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:50.680
Parents are so terrified that children won't make it in the world, that they won't be

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.280
able to make it in the tough world out there.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:21:03.560
We have to test them and prepare them and give them what we think they should know.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:11.880
What's really growing the whole person, Jerome Brunner, who is 98 years old now, wrote an

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:15.160
amazing book called The Process of Education.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:21.840
He believes that the child constructs the world as did Piaget and we need to let the

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.200
child construct the world and we need also to let the child take risks.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.800
We're so ready to step in.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.360
Parents, they are so ready to step in and not let the child take risks.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:38.840
I just published a little paper on creativity in childhood and it's very important to, I

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:44.120
don't believe it not being safe, but I believe that we should let a child figure out something.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:49.680
And if it's a little bit risky sometimes because that's the only way, not just in art, but

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.000
in other areas too.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.720
So I think those questions do come together.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:58.160
It's four o'clock and Rob said we could run over a bit.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.640
We go to the port there.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:00.640
For 30.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.640
Oh, we have time.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.640
Okay.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640
We have time.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640
Go ahead.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640
Thanks for an interesting talk.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:12.640
What I found fascinating what I was thinking about was in your experience have you worked

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:21.360
with kids who, when you give them the pencil and paper or the crayon and paper, if they

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:26.640
draw outside of the boundaries of the paper, I found it fascinating that all the kids respected

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.960
the medium so much that they stayed within the confines of the paper.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:37.840
And I wonder if the paper was larger or if it was a circle instead of a square or a triangular

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.520
paper, how much it would influence what they would draw or feel that they could draw.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.160
If you say draw a house, what the paper was circular, what would happen.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.800
And I can't recall, I'm a child psychiatrist, but I can't recall giving even a young child

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.880
pencil and paper or crayons and them drawing outside of the boundaries.

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.080
And I'm just wondering if you guys had that experience and what do you think that means

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.080
about that child?

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:11.080
Well, I can tell you I worked at the Edelson Center for Child Research, this kids who

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080
are from my children.

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.160
I'm a little boy that I wrote about this, I wrote an essay about it, but this little

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:19.520
boy had no sense of boundaries.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:25.560
Everything, the paint went over onto the table, it went over onto him, it went into his mouth,

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.560
it went everywhere.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:37.160
Actually, he was so in the material and it was in a way, it was okay because he really

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.520
needed that.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:43.640
And I think you're getting at something which is again, this is the control that we put.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.240
Where are the boundaries that we want to give to the child?

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.520
I mean, I think big is good.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:55.880
I think giving a child in a wall or a huge having kids, I've done this with kids because

01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.680
I've actually done a lot of work with, you know, giving them paper on the floor and letting

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.960
them draw something big.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:05.200
I think big is important.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:10.800
Children need that, they need the big to draw, say everything so, it's very constricting

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:13.040
to draw small all the time.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.400
Big is good, I think, for many children.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.480
Children are afraid of that, it was good to move them out of their comfort zone.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.640
The comfort zone is to do what the grownups want.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.800
But sometimes, and the thing is the teacher has to not be afraid.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.080
Teachers are the ones who are afraid.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.680
The teachers are afraid of the children.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.200
The teachers are afraid of what will come out of the child.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.000
I wanted to show you, I don't know if there's time, but I wanted to show you the drawings

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:48.760
of the Children of Tarasian, the concentration camp that the Nazis made in near Prague.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.880
Children the children did drawings there.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.600
The teacher was a Bauhaus artist.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.760
She was, her name was Fiedel Dicker Brandeis.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:06.520
In the Bauhaus, it was universal arts, architecture, furniture design, fabric design, drawing,

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.520
painting, sculpture.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.680
Everybody studied there had to try everything and do everything.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.240
And she worked with these kids who were separated from their parents living in separate houses.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.560
I don't know how many of you, are all of you familiar with what went on in Tarasian?

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:27.400
I feel bad because my work, I didn't only brought the, probably just the ones that everybody

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.400
knows.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.160
But, um, should I show them?

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.200
Should I, should I, should I, I don't know if I should do.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:36.080
Are you interested to see them?

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.000
No, I, I just have a few, I have a few of the drawings, but they're in, we put them

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
onto the-

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
We're going to transfer, huh?

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
How about if we do this?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.440
Ted wants to show one picture of his question of boundaries.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.440
Yeah, that's wonderful.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.440
Then we can transfer over.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:53.920
I just wanted to show you this because it may relate to your question.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.320
I did a study once of kids' conceptions of growth, so I had them draw a ghost.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.440
This was the most elaborated ghost I've ever seen.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:08.840
Most of them are very slim and narrow, so, but this kid, I mean, you know, what you put

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:17.120
down on the page is an overflow of, it has nothing to do with what a ghost looks like

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.400
to him because later he drew a ghost from me.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.040
It has to do the feeling aspects of it.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:29.680
So yes, this is all of the unarticulated explosive aspects of his anxiety and fear and so forth

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:30.680
and so on.

01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:35.520
So if you want a representation of that, I do want to make one comment on education.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:42.880
You know, there have been, I know in a group like this, we're all very touchy-feely.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.600
There have been movements in education which want to teach for the whole child and the

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.920
creative and so forth.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:56.360
There's the Dewey movement, there's the Montessori movement, there's the Rudolf Steiner movement

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.840
and so forth and so on.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:04.400
What's happened in America is a backlash against that kind of education which started

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:10.800
with Sputnik in our competition with the fact that we weren't getting our, our math is not

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.320
as good as it is in China.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:20.360
So we have a highly competitive, learn the three R's and then we can go on to who's creative.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.640
But not everybody's make greater.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:26.960
So that's an artifact of our culture, not the aims of education.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.600
So I just want you to.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:35.280
And then when I listen to Alan, my thought is, and your question about boundary, I worked

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:42.400
in Israel, the schools are not very rich, for me to get clean white paper was a big deal.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.040
I brought my own finally.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.920
I brought my own crayons because it was too, and I know how to get crayons that don't

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.920
break.

01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.040
No, no, seriously, you can get this kind of, I learned this from Sally Provence, this thickness

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.600
crayons, they don't break.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.600
All sorts of little tricks like that.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:04.680
So maybe this would be optimal in certain settings, you know, to have different shapes,

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:06.080
paper and different sizes.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:13.280
But for me, to have each kid have a ream of clean white paper and crayons that weren't

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:15.360
broken was a big deal.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.360
And I still have.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:23.640
I had several, actually they were drawing pencils that they're like this thick and I

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.520
sharpened them each time before I saw the kids and so on.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.200
And I had a sharpener there in case they broke it.

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.000
I mean, those are the little practical things.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.280
But the other is, I hear Alan talking about helping a kid express whatever spontaneously

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:40.000
is coming to him and helping that as a process to work it through.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.560
That is an important part of the process.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.640
My job was a different one, which is to ask each child of 46 children, tell me about

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.720
yourself.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.840
Most of my kids also did spontaneous drawings, which I, some of which I included in the book.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:59.760
But in order to compare one child to another, I wanted to make sure that each kid drew the

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.120
same picture.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.600
So I did that, unguilty of that, same draw person.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.960
By the way, most of the kids enjoyed doing that.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.440
Very few objected to it.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.400
So your questions are interesting ones and you could pursue that yourself and see how

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.240
it comes out.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:20.280
In terms of boundaries, my experience, and it may be similar to what Alan is describing,

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:24.600
that it's my more disturbed kids who go outside the boundaries of the paper.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.680
Most kids stay inside it.

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:29.960
You could say some of the more disturbed kids are very constricted and stay right in the

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:35.760
middle, but really disturbed kids are the ones that went beyond the paper onto the table.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.680
And none of these kids were that disturbed.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.520
Do you want to go down on your...

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.320
I can't make it...

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:43.320
Here you go.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.320
Other questions while Alan is showing up for pictures?

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:46.880
I want to go back to the full screen.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.880
Okay.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880
Any other questions?

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.880
I can't get it to the full screen.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:54.200
By the way, there's copies of Alan's book and my book available afterwards for those

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:55.200
who want to.

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.200
Fine.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.200
You can't make it do this.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200
Can I get it to the full screen?

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:01.480
No, that won't do that.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.440
No.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.520
I don't know what it's doing.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.840
One thing I'm really bad is technology.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.240
Do you want to present something more?

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.240
She's setting that up?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240
I need to.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.240
She's got it.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.240
She's got it.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.240
Come.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.240
Two just can't get through the full screen.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.240
I just can't get...

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.240
I'm trying to get it to the full screen.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.680
Bottom on the right.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680
This...

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680
Oh, here.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680
Bravo.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.680
Brilliant.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.680
Thank you, my dear.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680
Thank you so much.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.680
Thank you so much.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680
Okay.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.120
I think we need to have some left...

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.040
Is there any way to get less light?

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Because...

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.040
Or I guess now...

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:41.800
Let's go ahead, Alan, because we'll spend so much time there.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800
Okay.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800
All right.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:51.480
So the Nazis created a concentration camp outside of Prague, which had been a fortress

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.280
which held a relatively small number of people.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.200
And the Germans began to import...

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.000
To bring Jews there.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.480
They took everybody out.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.160
They brought huge numbers of Jewish...

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.280
Czech Jews there, including a lot of children.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:13.600
It was a place where there were a lot of artists, a lot of writers, musicians, composers.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:18.920
When you go to the archive, you're astonished by what went on in this camp artistically.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:24.600
But what happened was Frito-Dooker Brandeis, who was a Bauhaus trained artist, one of the

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:33.360
very few women artists in the Bauhaus, was eventually captured with her husband and brought

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.200
to this camp.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:41.240
When she got to the camp, she decided to separate it, of course, from her husband.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:42.840
All the men and women were separated.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:46.480
She decided to devote herself to the children.

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:48.760
She lived in one of the girls' houses.

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:53.320
The girls in her house were 12 to 14 years old.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:58.720
She decided to teach them to help them draw, to give them art, because the Nazis had forbidden

01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.960
school.

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:03.400
So they couldn't do any formal learning, but they could do music and art.

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.960
They didn't think that was very important.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.240
So, of course, the children could do that.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.400
What did she do for materials?

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.640
She scrounged materials.

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.840
So whatever she could find, she used.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.560
This is a child's drawing.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.160
The Germans renamed the children.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.960
They gave them these Czech names were germanified.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.640
When I looked at these drawings, I just want to quickly tell you that what happened was

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:29.320
she worked with these children for two years.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:32.160
Her husband was going to be deported to Auschwitz.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.600
She heard about that.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:40.800
She, without with a sun glimmer of hope, decided to try to join him to go to.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.400
Both of them were killed in the gas chambers.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:49.320
But when she realized that she was leaving, she took the drawings of the children.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:51.480
We thought, originally, there were about 2,000 of them.

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:54.960
It turns out that they were close to 4,000 of these drawings.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:33:02.680
She crammed the drawings into two suitcases and hid the suitcases of these drawings, hoping

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.200
that they would be found.

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:08.120
And then she went off to die in Auschwitz.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.160
After the war, the suitcases of the drawings were found.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.880
These drawings are now in the archive of the Jewish Museum in Prague.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:23.720
I spent time there on several occasions looking at the drawings, and they're amazing.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.880
And one thing that they tell you, which we didn't talk about today in the round table,

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:32.280
we didn't mention is the element of wish.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:40.600
A dream Freud talks stunningly in the interpretation of dreams about how a dream is a wish, can

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.880
be seen as a wish.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.360
And drawings can be wishes too.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:52.480
And when you look at these drawings by these children, you don't see atrocity.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.400
Almost none of the drawings show you the horrible things that were going on around them.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.360
What they show you is what the children missed, what the children longed for, what the children

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.000
didn't have anymore, what they remembered.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.640
And sometimes you see what was going on.

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:13.960
So here's a picture of the barracks at Terrazine by one of the children.

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:19.720
This is a drawing by one of the artists in the camp, an adult artist in the camp.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.560
His name was Bedrick Fritta.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.440
And he did this drawing of one of the deportations.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.720
I'm not sure whether the people there are leaving or coming, but these drawings were

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.320
done clandestinely, of course.

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.280
This is a picture of one of the children.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.880
And here's another children's drawing.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.280
This is the doorway of Terrazine.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.320
When you go there today, if you visit the camp, you see the yellow painted plaster on

01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.600
the wooden door.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.840
This is another child's drawing.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:55.160
Now the children in Terrazine ranged from eight to about 16.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.160
No one was younger than eight.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.000
None of the children whose drawings we have were younger than eight.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.520
None of them was older than about 16.

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:05.520
And when they're documented, when we have documentation, we have the birth of the child

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.640
and the date of the deportation to Auschwitz, which is the date of the death, because no

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:14.360
child would always die in the year of deportation.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.520
So you have those two days.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.960
And you can assume that the drawings were done within two years of the date of deportation.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:27.160
So this is what the inside look like from the child's point of view.

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:28.640
This is another child's drawing.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.120
You have here the bunk beds.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:36.760
Everything was numbered, and you know the numbers were put on the arms, but everything

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.560
was done according to the number.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:44.000
This house that Fiedel lived in was L104.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.560
The houses were also numbered.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:50.880
The Nazis were very good at dehumanizing people in every possible way, but giving somebody

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:57.440
a number is a way of dehumanizing you.

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.040
And we have no information, no information.

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:09.160
So in my imagination, I see the matron on the right as Fiedel herself.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.480
She looked a little bit like that, but of course probably wasn't she.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:21.600
There is, you see the suitcases under the bed of the children who were in Tarazin.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:33.640
15,000 children passed through this camp from 1942 to 1944 of the 15,000 children, Jewish

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.440
children in that camp.

01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.760
One hundred children survived.

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.760
All the rest died.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.480
So the drawings are, by most of these drawings, are by the children who died.

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.880
Now this is Stitchery.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.120
The children, she's scrounged, which you can see this is a ledger, some page torn out

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:56.480
of some ledger, and she got some wool and you see the child doing flowers, butterflies,

01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:06.200
all the things that the children wanted, the wishes, but they couldn't, didn't have.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:12.320
So this is the family gathered for the Pesach Seder, which of course the children no longer

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:17.320
could experience, but they remembered.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.360
I love the bows on the hair, the big bows, and the hats.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.360
So carefully, lovingly done.

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:30.880
And this is one of the most poignant ones, very famous, because of course the children

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:33.720
had to leave their hats behind.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.000
Little Scotty Dog.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.560
The one survivor that I met, they were, the children's opera performed written by a composer

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.320
who was in the camp called Burundi Bar.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.920
And I actually wrote about this and I actually met one of the survivors who sang the role

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.920
of the cat.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.360
There was three animals in the opera, a dog of bird and a cat, and this, I'm Elle Beishberger

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:05.440
who sang the role of the cat and the opera told me, I said, what did you miss most?

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:12.760
And she said, I missed most, I wish, I could say it exactly the way she said, going between

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:18.120
children in school, by which she meant being able to sit in school and learn with other

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:19.120
children.

01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:24.120
So here you have the school and the little child in Terrazine is drawing the children

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:26.880
coming out of school with their lunch boxes.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.280
I mean, it could be America today.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:40.000
It's so easy to go and look at these drawings and identify with this situation that occurred

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.080
so long ago.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.600
Another drawing, you see a butterfly here, it's a watercolor, the child is struggling

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:53.040
with the medium, watercolor is notoriously, some of you probably do watercolor is notoriously

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.320
difficult medium, the child is working with it.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:00.080
And Field did all kinds of things, her teaching was amazing.

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:02.800
A couple of survivors wrote about her teaching.

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:09.360
I mean, she would sometimes hear, this is a terrifying image, it's one of the most terrifying

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:16.040
images that have come out, you see the child is very frightened, the door is black, and

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:20.160
the child is running away from something, it's hard to see what it is, the child is just

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.640
very, there's just fear, it just seems to be in the image of fear.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:33.040
And then this notion of solidarity, holding hands with children, trying to make some kind

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:36.720
of solidarity that could protect them.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:45.440
This is one of the few images we have, which shows a guard with a bully stick.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:48.480
And it's very interesting, I don't know if you can say I don't have my little pointer

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.840
that I usually use when I'm teaching by a little laser pointer, but you see that the

01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:06.720
child graphically uses angular lines to do the frightening guy, but the sort of curving

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.920
softer lines to show the other figure with a Jewish star.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.400
And the curving lines are the softer ones, the more vulnerable ones, and the angular

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:24.880
ones are the lines of the ones who has the power and the danger, and you see the mug

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.440
and debit, the stars of David there, that the children were of course forced to wear.

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.440
And then this very, very sort of almost fairy tale like image where you have a princess,

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.760
a dragon, what it looks like, and the upper left, can you see like an magician type of

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.920
figure?

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:48.040
And what I think about this is that sometimes Frito would read stories to the children, and

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:52.160
the opposite way from what you did Nathan would read a story, and then the children

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:54.800
would draw while she was reading.

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.600
Sometimes she gave them still lifes, sometimes she showed them reproductions of famous artists.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.760
We have, we have, you can see the child trying to do something in imitation of, she did all

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.440
kinds of things to try to stimulate them.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:12.960
And one of the things that was unique about her was that she was a no-nonsense apparently

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:13.960
woman.

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:19.200
She was a child in her self, she was not, but she was not afraid of anything that came

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:20.880
out of a child.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.040
Nothing could frighten her.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.880
She would, she would let the child express anything.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.120
Ah, and this is a collage.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.400
We also work with collage.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.120
This means, this is a, this is a, like a puppet theater, the child is done, like a little,

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:40.880
you know, punch and duty show type thing, and this is a puppet theater but done with cut

01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:45.120
paper and a collage.

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:51.500
This is a drawing by Otto Unger of the composer Hans Krascha, who did the music for Brindy

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:52.500
Barre.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:55.120
And if I should go on and show a few more.

01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:03.440
So this, the Nazis made a film for the Red Cross to try to show that, to try to show

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:06.600
the world, because they were very worried that the world would find out what was going

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.920
on.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.720
And they made a film called Difuele, shankt de uden einichtad.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.120
Some of you know, I see people nodding.

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.760
The fur, Hitler, gives the Jews a city.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:25.960
And what they did was they took people out into the sun, they put rouge on their faces,

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.240
they tried to make them look okay and photograph them.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:35.920
And then they had the children perform this opera Brindy Barre, which is a story of a,

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:41.000
it's like a Hansel and Gretel story, two children, a little boy and a little girl, need

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.080
to get milk for their sick mother.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.400
And they don't know what to do, they have no money.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.240
But they noticed that there's an organ grinder called Brindy Barre, who grinds his organ

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:58.560
and makes music and people throw money into his hat and they think, ah, we will sing and

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.640
people will give us money.

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.680
But when they sing, their voices are too soft and nobody hears them.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.760
And then they go, the organ grinder chases them away and they go and they sleep.

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:15.760
You know how Hansel and Gretel has that moment in the middle where the children fall asleep

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:19.840
and the angels come and they had this very beautiful music at that point.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.440
Children fall asleep and the little animals come out, the cat, the bird and the dog and

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:30.520
they say to the children, if you all join together with all the children, your voice

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:34.240
will be loud and people will give you the money for the milk for the mother.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:35.240
So that's what they do.

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:38.280
And the children come out on stage and they sing together.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.280
The song that they sing is heartbreaking.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:48.520
It's a song that the words are, when my mother cradled me and the cradle, she never knew

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.600
how I would grow up, what my life would be like when I would grow up, what I would be

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.600
when I grew up.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.520
And of course it's heartbreaking because the children never grew up.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:05.200
And the people start to give money to them and the organ grinder steals the money and

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:09.480
then the people chase the organ grinder and in the end the children prevail.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:11.920
This is the final scene of solidarity.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:17.200
You see the little sign, Skola School at the top and the children are singing together.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:24.600
And this finale of Brindy Bar was sung over and over again in the camp, adults sang it,

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:25.600
children sang it.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:34.560
It was sort of a moment of, and here's the hand-lettered program for it showing that

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.560
this is what they did.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:41.880
They did these little, and here you can see the set, that's Brindy Bar, the organ grinder.

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:49.160
The set designer was called the Lanka, wonderful artist, and again the set.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.440
And then I just have this to show you that one of this artist, Frita, who did that transport

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:55.200
picture had a three-year-old.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:02.960
He died of starvation in Auschwitz, but he made a picture book for his child.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.960
And it's exquisite, and it exists today.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.440
So you see Tommy with his little boy's name is turning three.

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.800
He's looking out the window of Tarazin.

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:17.800
And there he has his birthday cake.

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:20.080
He's drawing, he's scribbling.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:27.560
And his father says, will you grow up to be a painter like me?

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.480
He's praying.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:34.520
And then it says, this is the truth.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.560
Pravda, this is the truth.

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.560
Our places like this, where the sun shines and there's, you can play in the meadow,

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.720
run around naked and there'll be butterflies and birds.

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:48.200
There's really a place like this outside this camp.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.400
And also this is also true that you can go buy food.

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:58.480
And then this is the most heartbreaking thing for us as Americans to see.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:08.680
The last page of the book, I wish you for your birthday in 1944, food, peace, sunshine,

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:16.560
and that you should come to the United States of America, signed what we would call daddy

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.840
in check.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:26.840
Quite a difference in the discussions between, on the one hand, the creativity that the father

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:33.320
shows, on the other hand, the tragedy that these children were murdered.

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.600
And also discrepancy, as I think, I'm fortunate to be able to work with kids who aren't getting

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:44.080
murdered and who are in fact in a new country and are given a very good life, compared to

01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.760
what they were facing and their parents were facing in Ethiopia.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:48.760
Real difference.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:54.960
This child lived, the father died, but the child actually did live.

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.080
We have to be stopping shortly.

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.840
For those who are interested, books are available.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.840
We'll sign them.

01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.840
Thank you for coming.

01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:03.840
Thank you.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:04.840
Thank you.

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:05.840
Thank you.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.840
I'm going to.

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:07.840
Thank you.

01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:08.840
Thank you.

01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:25.720
Thank you.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:42.600
Thank you.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:48:03.880
Peace out.
