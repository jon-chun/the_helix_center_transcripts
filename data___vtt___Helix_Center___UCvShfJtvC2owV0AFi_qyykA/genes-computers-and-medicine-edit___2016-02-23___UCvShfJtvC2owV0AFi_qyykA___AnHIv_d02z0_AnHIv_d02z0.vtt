WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
We're going to get started.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.720
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.400
Welcome to the Helix Center.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.920
Before I introduce today's participants, let me tell you about a couple of round tables

00:12.920 --> 00:13.920
that are coming up.

00:13.920 --> 00:20.760
On Saturday, March 12, the meditative state, with research psychologist Sarah Lazar, Peter

00:20.760 --> 00:27.600
Melanowski, and Yi Yang Tang, and pastoral care leader, Koshan Paley Ellison, and psychoanalyst

00:27.600 --> 00:29.360
Morgan Stevens.

00:29.360 --> 00:36.760
And on Saturday, March 26, understanding genius part two women, with historians Joyce Chaplin,

00:36.760 --> 00:43.600
Kathleen Keat, and Darren McMahon, anthropologist Susan Seymour, and poet and visual artist,

00:43.600 --> 00:49.360
Ann Marie Levine, who as Helix executive committee member also organized that round table.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.960
Now for today, jeans, computers, and medicine, James Domen, assistant professor of biomedical

00:55.960 --> 00:58.200
engineering at Georgia Tech.

00:58.200 --> 01:03.440
Frances Lee, Mortimer D. Sackler professor and vice chair for research department of psychiatry

01:03.440 --> 01:06.200
at Wile Cornell Medical College.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.840
Karen Mashke, research scholar at the Hastings Center, and Hans Guido Wendell, principal

01:11.840 --> 01:16.160
investigator at the cancer genetics laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

01:16.160 --> 01:25.880
Okay, we'll begin.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.760
So what's the latest in genetics?

01:29.760 --> 01:38.200
Well, I'm really pleased that you started off with a question I could answer quickly.

01:38.200 --> 01:45.040
So from my perspective as somebody who does genetic therapies, who looks into the future

01:45.040 --> 01:51.880
and sees medicines where we target the genome, I think there's a revolution occurring in

01:51.880 --> 01:59.000
biology where with different types of new small molecules or, excuse me, DNAs or RNAs,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.800
we can actually go for the first time and effectively manipulate the genome the way that

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
we would like to.

02:04.800 --> 02:10.720
So in genetics, one of the many revolutions is this ability to actually go in and edit

02:10.720 --> 02:15.880
the genome as we would like or manipulate the genome and see what that can do therapeutically

02:15.880 --> 02:17.080
and scientifically.

02:17.080 --> 02:23.360
That's one of the advances in genetics, I would say.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.360
If you were to take a guess, where would be the first clinical application of this type

02:29.360 --> 02:33.480
of new wave of gene editing?

02:33.480 --> 02:36.320
It's a difficult question.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.440
I guess I'd answer it by outlining sort of one of the biggest hurdles to implementing

02:41.440 --> 02:48.280
the gene editing therapies, which is the ability to safely deliver the new genetic drugs where

02:48.280 --> 02:50.120
you want to deliver them.

02:50.120 --> 02:56.480
As you might imagine, if you're going to go in and create a targeted therapy, you want

02:56.480 --> 03:00.320
to make sure it's going to the right spot in the body.

03:00.320 --> 03:05.880
For that reason, I would venture a guess and say that anywhere where you can administer

03:05.880 --> 03:10.360
the genetic medicine locally, so for instance, your eye, you can literally spray it into

03:10.360 --> 03:13.360
your eye.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.160
You can take cells out of the body like your immune cells and edit them and then put them

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
back in.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.880
So immune cells and then perhaps also deliver, which is an organ that is a little easier

03:23.880 --> 03:28.440
to target drugs to than other organs.

03:28.440 --> 03:33.960
So just as since I'm sort of a layman of this gene editing, so what's the difference between

03:33.960 --> 03:39.360
this and the revolution I had recalled in the 1990s with gene therapy?

03:39.360 --> 03:43.400
Yeah, so again, it's tricky.

03:43.400 --> 03:47.200
The revolution in gene therapy is really actually bearing some interesting therapeutic fruit

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
right now.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.840
So again, back in the 90s, there were these advances where people started saying, all

03:52.840 --> 03:58.040
right, we're going to actually start taking patients where they're not able to produce

03:58.040 --> 04:00.240
a particular gene.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.800
And then we're going to put that gene into patients and cure the patient in some way,

04:04.800 --> 04:05.800
shape or form.

04:05.800 --> 04:11.040
And unfortunately, in sort of the late 90s and early 2000s, there were a few hurdles

04:11.040 --> 04:13.120
and events that set the field back.

04:13.120 --> 04:18.240
But now because the delivery of some of these genetic therapies has become much more safe,

04:18.240 --> 04:22.880
we're seeing a change and we're actually seeing really impressive clinical data come

04:22.880 --> 04:28.880
out with gene therapies that were originally thought of in the 80s and 90s.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.240
So an interject, because one of the step-backs was actually a death.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
Yeah, that's right.

04:33.240 --> 04:37.680
That had to do with research ethics issues.

04:37.680 --> 04:43.920
And with possibly one exception, there's no FDA-approved gene therapy at this time.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.640
There's maybe more than one.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.600
Yeah, one year up, there it is.

04:47.600 --> 04:53.200
Yeah, but in the United States as a yet, so I'm not, I'm just sort of, as a part of the

04:53.200 --> 04:54.520
revolutionary language.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, of course.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.440
The revolution hasn't happened yet and there was a lot of hype.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.440
That's right.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.080
Some people wonder if there's the same kind of hype with gene editing, you know, with,

05:06.080 --> 05:12.160
and also potential harms because of the exuberance that people are going into with this the same

05:12.160 --> 05:13.560
way they did with gene therapies.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.560
Yeah.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.560
Not to put you on the spot because you're not the only person.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.560
Yeah, of course.

05:18.560 --> 05:23.320
And I should clarify that when I say, you know, revolution, I'm not specifically only

05:23.320 --> 05:25.440
referring to gene editing technologies.

05:25.440 --> 05:31.840
I'm also referring to anti-sense technologies and RNAi, which, you know, small, interfering

05:31.840 --> 05:37.400
sirna, or excuse me, small interfering RNAs or sirna.

05:37.400 --> 05:43.640
So you know, I do think that there is a risk for overhyping new technologies, just like

05:43.640 --> 05:47.920
with any other technology that has ever been, you know, reported.

05:47.920 --> 05:53.440
But I think generally speaking, it is a relatively safe statement to make when we say that maybe

05:53.440 --> 05:59.080
20 years, different classes of medicine based on either small RNAs or anti-sense will have

05:59.080 --> 06:01.920
a much larger impact in the clinic than certainly they will now.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.160
So, and I think that's primarily because the delivery is going to continue to improve.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.440
So to the clinicians, are you seeing that in the clinical world?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.040
But you see this in your path?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.480
I have not seen a patient in 15 years.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.280
I'm calling myself a clinician anymore.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.000
I'm my only patient if I have a fever that's about it.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I don't know.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.840
I think much of the technology is a long way to go before it's a clinical reality.

06:27.840 --> 06:36.160
So no doubt it's cool new research tools that we can use to learn a lot about how cells

06:36.160 --> 06:41.080
work, how cell biology works and what genes do and what happens if you change them and

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
so on.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.320
I think the practical applications are very limited right at the moment.

06:45.320 --> 06:50.880
You can maybe the most promising he mentioned is that you can isolate immune cells, pull

06:50.880 --> 06:56.280
them out of your body, modify them and put them back and suddenly these cells have learned

06:56.280 --> 07:00.640
to target a leukemia and that works sometimes right.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.920
It's not risk free but if you don't have a choice then at the moment hey there's a

07:05.920 --> 07:08.880
new thing on the horizon right.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.880
So that's a reality.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.000
If you open a newspaper you're going to find much more speculative things of how we're

07:14.000 --> 07:20.560
going to engineer you know new super athletes or we'll make you know smarter children.

07:20.560 --> 07:27.200
But all these things I think are not a reality and I mean but obviously if you think that

07:27.200 --> 07:32.720
it might be then that has a lot of ethical implications that you have to think about.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.920
I'm going to hold this because I'm having problems with that.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.440
Well one of the things I wanted to point out and the reason for raising that question is

07:39.440 --> 07:43.080
a lot of the science that does get hyped in the media is really what we might call discovery

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
science.

07:44.080 --> 07:49.600
I mean you're in the lab and you're building a body of work and you're training a body

07:49.600 --> 07:56.160
of scientists to continue to build on that work and science is a very incremental process

07:56.160 --> 08:00.600
which often is two steps forward eight steps back and maybe even more than eight steps

08:00.600 --> 08:06.880
back and cleaning up mistakes and errors and over sites and just not even thinking about

08:06.880 --> 08:10.880
certain things that you thought might happen or didn't happen.

08:10.880 --> 08:15.760
And yet in the media when we talk about technologies and we hear all these issues about brand technologies

08:15.760 --> 08:24.320
and computer interfaces and therapy, gene splicing, gene editing, there's an intermediate point

08:24.320 --> 08:26.960
and that's where I sit which is the research ethics point.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.960
You don't just come up with a discovery in the lab and then say let's take it across

08:30.960 --> 08:35.640
the street over to Well Cornale or to take it over to Slunk Hetteran and let's use it.

08:35.640 --> 08:42.240
There's another whole step that can take anywhere from 10 to 15, 20, 30, 40 years.

08:42.240 --> 08:49.240
When you were speaking I was just thinking about a month ago there was this amazing

08:49.240 --> 08:54.040
article that was in both Washington Post and New York Times that we had now made a quantum

08:54.040 --> 08:57.000
leap in our understanding of schizophrenia.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.040
They had been able to find an immune gene, an MHC gene that was one of the largest hits

09:03.040 --> 09:05.520
in the genome wide association studies.

09:05.520 --> 09:09.080
And as you read the article you just were and it was elegant.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.000
The genetics were elegant, the mouse model that they were, they found a compliment gene

09:13.000 --> 09:17.840
that was somehow related to this that would actually prune spines and neurons.

09:17.840 --> 09:23.480
And then ultimately when you read the fine print they said that this gene, this MHC complex

09:23.480 --> 09:32.120
gene, possibly explains 0.25% of the risk factor for schizophrenia.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.240
So that from a clinical point of view it has almost no worth.

09:36.240 --> 09:44.080
It would possibly help us understand something about the pathophysiology for that 0.25% of

09:44.080 --> 09:48.800
people on the planet earth who have this genetic variation.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.200
But for the rest of the people it would have no effect.

09:52.200 --> 09:58.000
So the way I think about it is that in terms of the genetic revolution, I think of it in

09:58.000 --> 10:05.240
terms of either diagnosis, pathophysiology or some type of intermediate phenotype that

10:05.240 --> 10:07.880
we could use to possibly understand things.

10:07.880 --> 10:14.760
And I would put this in the pathophysiology that we could study, as you said, it's a discovery

10:14.760 --> 10:22.720
science that possibly that there is some neuroimmune component to schizophrenia in 0.2% of the

10:22.720 --> 10:27.480
population that increases your risk by 0.25%.

10:27.480 --> 10:33.520
But by itself would not cause schizophrenia by no means at all.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.400
And I think this is the kind of things that the media does, which actually does a disservice

10:38.400 --> 10:43.640
to our field because psychiatry in particular has had many false starts.

10:43.640 --> 10:49.040
I was at a talk recently where the Nobel Prize was given for frontal lobotomies and it's

10:49.040 --> 10:53.680
absolutely clear that we do not understand many things and that when these types of articles

10:53.680 --> 11:01.560
come out they actually, now people think that we're probably, as you said, one step closer

11:01.560 --> 11:07.680
to probably eight steps back in terms of understanding this.

11:07.680 --> 11:14.320
And that makes me wonder, so from the bioethics perspective, this is something I think that

11:14.320 --> 11:21.280
many fields struggle with, how do you present your science to the public and how do you

11:21.280 --> 11:24.560
tone down some of the popular press reports?

11:24.560 --> 11:29.960
So when you guys look at the bioethics, do you guys ever consider questions like these?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.760
Yes, it's been written about a lot.

11:32.760 --> 11:38.640
And unfortunately, when I'm at sessions having these conversations, the scientists end up

11:38.640 --> 11:41.880
being in the hot seat because we're asking you, well, is this really going to happen

11:41.880 --> 11:44.320
in 10 years or 15 years.

11:44.320 --> 11:48.520
Part of it's a media problem and part of it is also, I think, the nature of our culture

11:48.520 --> 11:54.160
that institutions are in a position of competing because they want the best and the brightest

11:54.160 --> 11:57.320
and they want the NIH money and they want the venture capital money and they want the

11:57.320 --> 12:04.960
patents and they want, you know, and so they're part of the mix of promoting, I wouldn't say

12:04.960 --> 12:07.960
hype, but promoting their work and their people.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.600
And the media then takes those stories and translates it in ways and then you see movies

12:11.600 --> 12:16.240
like The Matrix and you see other movies where this gets put into the popular culture in

12:16.240 --> 12:21.520
ways that the, you know, the scientists and his or her team who are working in the lab

12:21.520 --> 12:26.880
day after day, after day, you know, you know, wonder.

12:26.880 --> 12:31.160
And yet in the popular discourse, we have these conversations about different human

12:31.160 --> 12:32.920
brains, different human organs.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.000
We can fix them in the lab.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.800
We can do petri dish organs and put them in humans and they'll live forever and it's

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
not really close to reality.

12:38.800 --> 12:43.280
Yet it becomes a part of the public discourse and then it becomes a part of the public fear

12:43.280 --> 12:47.040
too, which can often hinder science going forward.

12:47.040 --> 12:54.600
Yeah, I would also contend that it does a disservice because it sets expectations, you

12:54.600 --> 12:55.840
know, pretty high.

12:55.840 --> 13:00.040
And as you said, I think it's a really nice way of stating it science is really two steps

13:00.040 --> 13:02.040
forward and eight steps backwards.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.040
I mean, it takes a lot of effort to make even an incremental change.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.360
And I think when we, you know, you read a popular press report about, you know, we're

13:10.360 --> 13:14.880
going to create a new organ and, you know, now you're going to be able to have new kidneys

13:14.880 --> 13:17.360
and new lungs and new whatever all the time.

13:17.360 --> 13:26.440
I think if that's what's sort of understood in the popular media, that's what people are

13:26.440 --> 13:29.760
going to read and that's how they're going to think about science and that, as you said,

13:29.760 --> 13:31.400
that's not at all how it works.

13:31.400 --> 13:35.120
It takes a really long time and there are a lot of failures before you get any kind of

13:35.120 --> 13:36.120
even mild success.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
Yeah, okay.

13:37.120 --> 13:50.080
So when you have a hypothesis that you have verified, like a gene editing, that has been

13:50.080 --> 13:51.080
done.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.680
So what causes the eight steps back?

13:55.680 --> 14:00.200
If you know how to do the gene editing and you know what to apply it to.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.400
And I think what Giro was saying, you can modify the immune system of the person.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.480
So what causes the steps back?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
I don't know.

14:09.480 --> 14:14.040
I'd defer to the people closer to the clinic than I am on that.

14:14.040 --> 14:18.120
I would defer to, I think the sex stories have mainly been in cancer.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.840
So I would ask you, like, what would you think would be?

14:20.840 --> 14:27.080
Because this is where you actually do have genetic biomarkers that inform diagnosis and

14:27.080 --> 14:28.080
treatment.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.080
The success stories.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.320
Yeah, no, there are plenty.

14:31.320 --> 14:37.000
And I think it's not just therapeutics, and it's not just gene editing and it's not science

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
fiction.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.160
There's real life things that have improved light years since I've treated my last patient.

14:45.160 --> 14:50.520
Now if you come to a major cancer center, your cancer is going to be sequenced.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.640
The whole genome of the thing.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.520
Previously, we didn't have that.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.960
Now you can sequence the whole thing.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.920
You can find what is the mutation that drives this disease.

14:59.920 --> 15:04.920
And there's a chance you might have a drug specifically for that mutation.

15:04.920 --> 15:09.320
For some patients that benefit directly from this, that's a major breakthrough.

15:09.320 --> 15:14.520
Right suddenly you don't get, you know, the standard therapy, but you get something that

15:14.520 --> 15:18.120
is essentially tailor-made for your disease.

15:18.120 --> 15:25.320
I think that's where we are now, and probably with new drugs and we will go further.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.320
Right?

15:26.320 --> 15:29.600
So I think there is a real breakthrough here that now we can sequence a whole tumor.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.560
Now previously, how did you diagnose a tumor?

15:31.560 --> 15:35.680
You look at it under a microscope and you say, well, this kind of looks like, you know,

15:35.680 --> 15:41.440
figure 7B in the textbook, and therefore it has to be that tumor, and we usually treat

15:41.440 --> 15:44.240
them with drug B, and that kind of works.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.640
And now you have the whole genome, and you can find specific sensitive.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.680
So on the diagnostic side, I think there's like a real breakthrough.

15:52.680 --> 15:57.440
That's just sequencing, analyzing, being able to do this, which maybe 20 years ago was

15:57.440 --> 15:59.920
like flying to the moon, it was impossible.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.280
You couldn't do it.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.160
You would count individual nucleotides.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.120
Now you sequence everything.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.560
So that's a major break.

16:06.560 --> 16:14.880
And I think for us as a research group, the next major advances that we can use these

16:14.880 --> 16:22.320
genetic tools like CRISPR, like gene editing, and RNA, RNA interference, and so on, as research

16:22.320 --> 16:30.720
tools to ask in a leukemia or in a cancer, what would happen if we take away any of the

16:30.720 --> 16:33.040
genes in this cancer?

16:33.040 --> 16:36.480
Which ones can't they tolerate to lose?

16:36.480 --> 16:39.880
What are they really sensitive to?

16:39.880 --> 16:43.360
And what are these things maybe already?

16:43.360 --> 16:47.040
Something that we can target with a drug that we have today?

16:47.040 --> 16:52.200
Or maybe tell the pharmaceutical company and say, look, we keep finding this gene and we

16:52.200 --> 16:57.840
think that these liver cancers, they really need this gene.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.320
Can you help us make a drug?

16:59.320 --> 17:06.800
And I think that's sort of the next research level that these technologies are practically

17:06.800 --> 17:09.360
immediately useful for.

17:09.360 --> 17:15.760
I think those for me are the biggest sort of advances that we have there.

17:15.760 --> 17:21.040
Now along those lines, I'm stepping outside my field of expertise here a little bit because

17:21.040 --> 17:27.360
I do therapeutics, but one of the things that's most interesting to me is using this idea

17:27.360 --> 17:33.080
of genomics and looking for mutations early on in a patient sample because I know that

17:33.080 --> 17:39.520
at least my understanding is that in the clinic, especially with cancer, one of the

17:39.520 --> 17:44.320
biggest limitations is being able to find out that you have the disease early.

17:44.320 --> 17:49.160
And if you catch it early, then you have a much better shot of surviving or being treated

17:49.160 --> 17:50.760
successfully.

17:50.760 --> 17:56.880
So is it true or is it realistic that, again, not to put everybody on the spot, but in a

17:56.880 --> 18:01.320
reasonable amount of time that we'll have technologies available where you can, when

18:01.320 --> 18:04.880
you get your annual checkup, you can take a blood sample and say, oh, there's something

18:04.880 --> 18:05.880
going on here.

18:05.880 --> 18:12.280
This looks kind of wonky and we need to take in to give a CT scan and look for early signs

18:12.280 --> 18:13.280
that way using genetics.

18:13.280 --> 18:18.720
Yeah, so that's a difficult, I have an echo, right?

18:18.720 --> 18:20.920
I think that's very attractive, right?

18:20.920 --> 18:26.720
Being able to pull blood and say, well, we're going to find a specific marker or a specific

18:26.720 --> 18:34.520
cell that has a specific mutation and therefore we know that you have pancreatic cancer.

18:34.520 --> 18:40.200
That has a lot of difficulties to this and they're not just technical.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.800
So technically it's all possible.

18:41.800 --> 18:48.280
You can pull blood and you can sequence it and you can analyze and you can find things.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.880
But I think they're practical issues here.

18:50.880 --> 19:00.520
So let's say you find a mutation in your blood, a translocation, T1480 and it occurs in lymphomas.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.560
Well it turns out 50% of healthy people, you can find it.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.920
So what are you going to do with that?

19:06.920 --> 19:12.040
I mean, take 50% of the population and roll them through a CAT scan and nobody's going

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
to pay for that.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.360
It's impossible, right?

19:15.360 --> 19:21.320
So there isn't the level of specificity to it yet that you can say, well, we really

19:21.320 --> 19:24.440
have the tools to do it.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.840
I think many of these diagnostic tests, they're very useful in following up.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.440
So you have diagnosed someone with a cancer and you treat it and you know this marker

19:34.440 --> 19:39.960
was at a certain level and you get treated and it disappears.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.320
You know, you did the right thing.

19:42.320 --> 19:46.480
If it comes back, you know, where we need to have another look.

19:46.480 --> 19:52.440
So there are issues about specificity and about the cost associated.

19:52.440 --> 19:57.240
All this was discussed and it's not just even genomics or genetic tools.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.920
All this was discussed with PSA recently, right?

19:59.920 --> 20:05.040
Which I mean, this is a marker that's been around for, I don't know, 30, 40, 50 years.

20:05.040 --> 20:10.400
It's a protein marker you can measure in the blood and it indicates whether your prostate

20:10.400 --> 20:12.360
is happy or not happy basically.

20:12.360 --> 20:16.200
It also goes very high in prostate cancer.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.840
But if you just screen the population for high levels of PSA, you're going to end up

20:20.840 --> 20:25.680
doing a lot of biopsies and not everyone likes to have a needle stuck in their prostate

20:25.680 --> 20:28.000
and it does cost a lot of money.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.120
So there are practical problems of following through with these tests.

20:34.120 --> 20:36.040
So yeah, I'll go ahead.

20:36.040 --> 20:42.120
I'm also stepping out of my comfort area, but one of my colleagues is a geneticist and

20:42.120 --> 20:47.560
he said that what he's now working on, he said, he's at Hudson Alpha in Alabama, is

20:47.560 --> 20:51.400
that so what they're doing to study breast cancer, for example, some of the psychiatrists.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.080
So this is obviously outside of it.

20:53.080 --> 20:58.760
Is that they're actually isolating all the immune cells in the blood and they're sequencing

20:58.760 --> 21:03.960
them because obviously your immune profile by genetics is different because you're generating

21:03.960 --> 21:04.960
different antibodies.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.040
And they'll notice that they get a completely different profile.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.400
It's not a single gene.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.800
It's just a different genetic profile biometratically.

21:13.800 --> 21:20.280
And then after treatment, your immune system looks different on this genetic profile.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.280
Was he just making this up or have you heard of this?

21:23.280 --> 21:24.720
I was just having a bit of it.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.520
I had a similar idea a while ago.

21:26.520 --> 21:31.440
I thought, you know, this would be fun, fun thing to do with people who are exposed to

21:31.440 --> 21:32.880
a lot of pathogens.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.880
So you know, bacteria or something.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.560
So you just take everyone who takes the subway in New York and compare them to people who

21:38.560 --> 21:39.560
don't take the subway.

21:39.560 --> 21:46.600
You're going to get a completely different representation of the immune system, right?

21:46.600 --> 21:49.160
Again, I don't know how specific this is.

21:49.160 --> 21:55.840
I'm not familiar with the specific research he's doing.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.840
Maybe.

21:56.840 --> 22:00.280
Your comment was what I was going to actually, it was a good comment because that's what

22:00.280 --> 22:01.880
I was going to say over here was.

22:01.880 --> 22:11.640
Again, I'm an enthusiastic skeptic or a skeptical enthusiastic.

22:11.640 --> 22:15.920
Biomarkers are one whole category of skepticism in some ways.

22:15.920 --> 22:22.160
And if we just look at genetics and look at a genetic biomarker and take out the environment

22:22.160 --> 22:27.240
and the exposures of people and the epigenetic issues, we may not have the whole story.

22:27.240 --> 22:32.160
So there's this much more complex picture that we don't hear about in the media and that

22:32.160 --> 22:36.040
we don't even hear about in cancer genomics, which is absolutely right, it's had phenomenal

22:36.040 --> 22:42.280
improvements and spectacular advances in terms of being able to sequence a cancer genome.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.080
On the other hand, you have a vast amount of information that physicians and geneticists

22:46.080 --> 22:47.080
know nothing about.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.480
And I really understand how they interact with each other.

22:49.480 --> 22:53.480
They don't understand how environmental factors interact.

22:53.480 --> 23:03.000
And even within categories of ancestry, age, when the disease was actually caught in that

23:03.000 --> 23:08.080
sense, there are a lot of factors that don't necessarily mean there's going to be a drug

23:08.080 --> 23:14.400
for that specific patient at that specific time or that editing some piece of the genome

23:14.400 --> 23:18.280
is actually going to help and may help that patient but not another one who you would

23:18.280 --> 23:22.480
think looks just like that patient in terms of biophysical characteristics.

23:22.480 --> 23:28.120
So again, it's a lot more complex and my skepticism comes from the precision medicine,

23:28.120 --> 23:33.760
personalized medicine hype in some sense that we're just going to be able to find just

23:33.760 --> 23:37.720
one person, you don't want personalize, you want something that works for everyone.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.720
Exactly.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.320
Who wants personalize, who wants something that works, right?

23:42.320 --> 23:44.840
That was the first cancer war, that it's going to work for everybody.

23:44.840 --> 23:48.880
We're going to find the drug and we're going to use powerful chemo therapeutic drugs for

23:48.880 --> 23:52.880
lots of people and we're going to find the right combination and it's going to work for

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
everybody.

23:53.880 --> 23:58.320
Well, the other thing I like to point out is when we think about precision medicine or

23:58.320 --> 24:03.760
we think about personalized medicine, I like to sort of split diseases when I think about

24:03.760 --> 24:08.160
them into basically cancer and everything else.

24:08.160 --> 24:13.440
Because when I look at, you know, when I try to design something that will deliver a drug

24:13.440 --> 24:24.960
to a tumor, I get a little nervous because the tumor thinks and will fight back against

24:24.960 --> 24:25.960
whatever you're delivering.

24:25.960 --> 24:30.760
So you'll deliver a drug and if you kill, if you have like the best drug delivering the

24:30.760 --> 24:37.040
world and you have a tumor that for easy numbers has 100 cells in it and you get 99 of those

24:37.040 --> 24:42.440
cells, that one little surviving cell is now smarter and won't respond to that therapy

24:42.440 --> 24:44.720
later on.

24:44.720 --> 24:50.200
I don't know many other diseases that evolve so rapidly in that way.

24:50.200 --> 24:55.120
So a lot of times when we talk about personalized medicine, we automatically sort of default

24:55.120 --> 25:03.960
to cancer and I don't, again, this is outside of my expertise but I'm a little less skeptical

25:03.960 --> 25:08.800
that precision medicine will work for diseases outside of the cancer field.

25:08.800 --> 25:13.400
Maybe we'll get lucky and we'll find something for aethro or we'll get something for some

25:13.400 --> 25:16.640
other ischemic heart disease or something like this, something that isn't, you know,

25:16.640 --> 25:20.040
so aggressively fighting against you.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.280
So I think that's important to note is that, and I actually don't know if that's the case

25:23.280 --> 25:27.920
in neuropsychiatric disease or not because that's complicated for a different reason,

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
is that what you're just saying?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
Yes, it's very complicated.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.280
Well first of all, the brain's very complicated.

25:33.280 --> 25:39.080
You know, but I would have to say what, just in my sort of like last five years of research,

25:39.080 --> 25:44.680
is that what I'd never understood particularly well even though I was trained by Dr. Narsesian

25:44.680 --> 25:50.840
and others in psychiatry, is that almost every psychiatric disorder emerges between the transition

25:50.840 --> 25:53.600
from childhood to adolescence to late adolescence.

25:53.600 --> 25:58.320
So the entire disease progresses and then you live for the rest of your life with this.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.880
So when you actually start treating them, you're actually seeing people that have had

26:01.880 --> 26:03.720
this disease for a while.

26:03.720 --> 26:10.880
And the idea is that we might have had to treat them at that moment when it first started

26:10.880 --> 26:18.080
because the, and it, and what we're now realizing is that the adolescent or child brain is very

26:18.080 --> 26:19.080
different.

26:19.080 --> 26:26.560
So whatever drugs that we now have in our current armamentarian is not really set for

26:26.560 --> 26:29.520
this therapies we have or set for what we are treating.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.880
So it's actually quite a moving target.

26:31.880 --> 26:38.160
You have a disease that began in essentially an immature developing brain and you are treating

26:38.160 --> 26:42.280
it based on a completely different roadmap later on.

26:42.280 --> 26:49.480
So it's very hard to design particular, both behavioral or molecular therapies based on

26:49.480 --> 26:50.480
that.

26:50.480 --> 26:54.200
Ultimately you would want to treat that when your symptoms first emerge but it's very

26:54.200 --> 27:00.440
difficult to, it's very difficult to do clinical trials in children and adolescents which is

27:00.440 --> 27:04.600
probably when what we'll ultimately find, if I had to make a prediction 20 years from

27:04.600 --> 27:07.400
now we realize that we'll have to, that's when you treat it.

27:07.400 --> 27:14.520
Because ultimately 10 year, if you go to disease like chronic disease go on for 10 years,

27:14.520 --> 27:15.960
it's just not going to be hard.

27:15.960 --> 27:20.640
I think that's sort of the lesson we're learning in the field of Alzheimer's disease that actually

27:20.640 --> 27:25.800
you need to actually treat them when they first have their cognitive impairments emerging

27:25.800 --> 27:31.240
and the reason why almost every clinical trial has failed is because they're treating them

27:31.240 --> 27:33.920
at age of 60 and above.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.080
Let me ask in your field.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.160
It's a kind of genetic research.

27:40.160 --> 27:45.360
Come up with new targets, new ways of treating.

27:45.360 --> 27:51.960
I mean for cancers I think being put a finger on a few things that we have new drugs and

27:51.960 --> 27:56.280
we know they target certain mutations and that's how they work.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.040
And psychiatry and neurological diseases has there been...

28:00.040 --> 28:05.240
Well first of all I would say that there's been a great revolution in studying the fact

28:05.240 --> 28:12.200
that both autism and schizophrenia, there's been massive advances in genome sequencing

28:12.200 --> 28:19.560
and for example the study of the MHC gene was based on the capacity of large consortiums

28:19.560 --> 28:25.560
to get essentially over 100,000 schizophrenic patients entire genome sequence and there you

28:25.560 --> 28:28.280
can then get genome wide significant hits.

28:28.280 --> 28:34.720
The problem that they ultimately found was that it explains so little of the vary.

28:34.720 --> 28:37.960
Each of these genes don't explain much.

28:37.960 --> 28:45.040
What's most befuddling for autism is that after 10 years what they realized is that almost

28:45.040 --> 28:49.160
every mutation in autism is essentially rare.

28:49.160 --> 28:53.680
And what they said in the last five years what they realized is the word rare actually

28:53.680 --> 28:55.000
means rare.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.320
So that ultimately there's not going to be a common biomarker or diagnostic tool and

29:01.320 --> 29:07.000
every autism spectrum disorder patient is going to probably be unique because it's sort of

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
these spontaneous deletions and mutations and in that sense that for that one patient

29:14.000 --> 29:20.720
if they found one interesting gene that will help that one patient but that's about it.

29:20.720 --> 29:28.920
The hope is that in the future that there will be common mutation variants that have

29:28.920 --> 29:33.400
been found that can be used because the genome is filled with people that have these genetic

29:33.400 --> 29:39.640
variants in these special plasticity genes that my lab actually studies and the idea

29:39.640 --> 29:42.560
is that we could use this to at least guide something.

29:42.560 --> 29:48.280
It's still very early days of whether or not this will happen but that's the idea that

29:48.280 --> 29:53.680
there would be some common genetic variation that could be used to at least but the bar

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
is so low inside.

29:54.680 --> 29:59.880
But you think of these are mutations that you think of as inherited so that it's in

29:59.880 --> 30:02.200
every cell in your body basically.

30:02.200 --> 30:07.680
So I think it's very different from the idea we think about cancers arising where you know

30:07.680 --> 30:14.760
most cancer genes are normal in every other cell but we think really there's mutations

30:14.760 --> 30:22.280
that occur in one cell somewhere that triggers a cascade of further changes that ultimately

30:22.280 --> 30:24.400
lead to the tumor.

30:24.400 --> 30:31.680
But I think in your field you think of the genetics as a predisposing thing that will

30:31.680 --> 30:39.160
make you more sensitive to environment, to stresses, to early life's traumas or something.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.360
Right, whatever that actually is.

30:41.360 --> 30:46.000
So you probably don't think of it then as much as a genetic disease.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.360
I mean we think of cancer as a genetic disease.

30:48.360 --> 30:55.840
Basically there is a cell that gets irradiated, something goes wrong and then the things happen.

30:55.840 --> 30:59.560
But to what extent do you think psychiatric diseases are genetic?

30:59.560 --> 31:06.400
They have to be genetic because this is just an example because my lab also studies obsessive

31:06.400 --> 31:07.840
compulsive disorder.

31:07.840 --> 31:14.120
If you have an identical twin there's a 65% chance that identical twin will have obsessive

31:14.120 --> 31:15.400
compulsive disorder.

31:15.400 --> 31:20.320
So something is definitely being transmitted and the same with schizophrenia is almost

31:20.320 --> 31:22.120
that hot or bipolar disorder.

31:22.120 --> 31:27.120
So these are incredibly heritable disorders and what the field has been dealing with is

31:27.120 --> 31:30.200
what we call the missing heritability.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.240
There's something massive, some large elephant we're missing.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.240
And you can imagine.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.240
What do you mean by missing?

31:36.240 --> 31:37.240
What is missing here?

31:37.240 --> 31:41.960
Because not all the genome wide association studies have not found a gene that can be

31:41.960 --> 31:45.480
transmitted that is in identical twins even.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.240
People are very smart now.

31:47.240 --> 31:52.800
They're doing twin studies and family based studies with large pedigrees to try to find

31:52.800 --> 31:56.520
even sort of rare genetic and they've not been able to find.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.480
There have been so many false starts.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.200
That's what I'm being very...

32:01.200 --> 32:03.000
They thought they found some before.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.560
They named them schizophrenia genes and now they're sort of discredited.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.840
So how does the field reconcile?

32:10.840 --> 32:11.840
Because that's...

32:11.840 --> 32:13.200
How does the field reconcile that?

32:13.200 --> 32:16.560
Because you might say, okay, well then we're just going to sequence more people to which

32:16.560 --> 32:18.080
the kind of argument could be made.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.920
Well, if it's really that ubiquitous then you shouldn't have to sequence very many people

32:21.920 --> 32:22.920
at all.

32:22.920 --> 32:23.920
You should be able to pick it up.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.520
Well, it's going to be something new.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.520
It's the three dimensional structure of the genome which we don't know how to characterize

32:28.520 --> 32:33.560
or some other sort of currently black box mechanism.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.800
No, I think the...

32:34.800 --> 32:41.080
At least in the neuropsychiaty field we've come to terms with the fact that we actually

32:41.080 --> 32:43.520
don't know how to diagnose our patients very well.

32:43.520 --> 32:51.240
We use a criteria called the Diagnostic Statistical Manual which is essentially a syndromic manual.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.960
There's no quantitative biomarkers.

32:52.960 --> 32:59.280
You have a histology test or you have blood pressure even to measure hypertension.

32:59.280 --> 33:04.000
I was at a wonderful grand rounds at Cornell the other day where Kathleen Merrick-Hang is

33:04.000 --> 33:06.840
a very talented human geneticist.

33:06.840 --> 33:07.840
I had done some...

33:07.840 --> 33:09.280
A very fascinating study.

33:09.280 --> 33:15.760
She took bipolar patients and gave them essentially fit bits and smart watches to walk around.

33:15.760 --> 33:22.120
What she noticed that what every bipolar patient had was not what we think of as a DSM-5,

33:22.120 --> 33:30.200
racing thoughts, whatever, mania or hypomania, she noticed that she could predict when they

33:30.200 --> 33:36.400
would become functionally ill is by the fact that they traveled more within the city or

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
within their town.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.480
So it was just physical activity that there are certain aspects of the way we diagnose

33:41.480 --> 33:44.560
patients that don't actually capture the disorder.

33:44.560 --> 33:50.360
As an example, another example, if someone is given a diagnosis of major depression, you

33:50.360 --> 33:54.560
can either eat too much, eat too little, sleep too much, sleep too little and actually get

33:54.560 --> 33:55.840
the same disorder.

33:55.840 --> 34:04.480
So essentially you're studying the equivalent of 1940s cough or some bad x-ray, long x-ray.

34:04.480 --> 34:05.480
You're not...

34:05.480 --> 34:10.080
So it's not surprising that all the genome-wide association studies have failed.

34:10.080 --> 34:15.080
I've always advocated that there are certain things in psychiatry which are incredibly

34:15.080 --> 34:16.840
robust.

34:16.840 --> 34:20.840
If you have a panic attack, no one will say there's no...

34:20.840 --> 34:21.840
It looks...

34:21.840 --> 34:26.120
No one will disagree that that was a panic attack or if you wash your hands ten times

34:26.120 --> 34:30.920
a day, no one will disagree that that is a repetitive behavior and if your hands are

34:30.920 --> 34:33.600
chapped, then you know you have a disorder.

34:33.600 --> 34:39.160
So you need to study what we call phenotypic extremes or if you have a disorder of type

34:39.160 --> 34:44.120
of depression where you start hallucinating, you're now studying a very specific type of

34:44.120 --> 34:48.720
depression, a subtype that is extreme in some sense.

34:48.720 --> 34:55.640
And I think that's where the field is moving, that we have failed and this was a sort of

34:55.640 --> 35:00.920
an argument between the head of the APA and the head of NIMH a couple of years ago that

35:00.920 --> 35:04.680
was played out in the New York Times where they disagreed about the...

35:04.680 --> 35:11.680
How to diagnose patients and to my senses that the fact that there is even a discussion

35:11.680 --> 35:17.400
about how we even diagnose our patients tells us that we're still at a very early stage

35:17.400 --> 35:19.160
for this.

35:19.160 --> 35:24.720
But I should not be so negative about psychiatry just because...

35:24.720 --> 35:26.920
I know technology is going to help you there.

35:26.920 --> 35:33.160
I mean it's a new imaging thing is going to help you out of a lot of other medical diagnostics

35:33.160 --> 35:37.760
are based on imaging or measuring activities in your EEGs.

35:37.760 --> 35:42.120
But are those things providing criteria at all or are they?

35:42.120 --> 35:45.840
I would even step back further and just say that the brain is complex.

35:45.840 --> 35:51.600
The model of genetic disorder in the brain is Huntington's disease.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.240
It's autosomal dominant.

35:53.240 --> 35:57.800
You have one copy, you have the disorder and the genetics is just beautiful.

35:57.800 --> 36:04.400
You have 70 repeats, you get different gradations of this phenotype and you now have a genetic

36:04.400 --> 36:11.320
test you have a great MR or whatever cat scanning to basically show you that the brain is shrink...

36:11.320 --> 36:17.120
certain areas of the brain are shrinking and they've known this since the 1980s.

36:17.120 --> 36:23.480
And to this day it is an incurable disorder and the reason only reason why it's decreasing

36:23.480 --> 36:29.320
in prevalence is because the genetic testing will allow people to decide that if you have

36:29.320 --> 36:31.680
the gene you will not have children or something.

36:31.680 --> 36:39.800
So this should have been like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of neurological psychiatric

36:39.800 --> 36:46.720
disorders and they've been trying to put in growth factors into the brain or somehow

36:46.720 --> 36:51.480
because they know exactly what circuit they know that the striatum is degenerating.

36:51.480 --> 37:00.720
So even if you can't repair Huntington the protein you can at least pump it full of whatever

37:00.720 --> 37:04.760
growth factors and that has not actually worked at this point.

37:04.760 --> 37:08.480
Is that where this CRISPR thing should be useful?

37:08.480 --> 37:12.040
So actually I think this proves your point beautifully.

37:12.040 --> 37:20.840
Earlier you said you're very skeptical and that we should tone down at times our exuberance

37:20.840 --> 37:26.640
for these new technologies and I think this is a great demonstration that you're correct.

37:26.640 --> 37:32.600
We've known as you said the genetics on Huntington's have been clear for a very long time since

37:32.600 --> 37:36.320
the original linkage studies and some of Dave Hausmann's work and worked by some really

37:36.320 --> 37:40.400
other great scientists.

37:40.400 --> 37:45.720
It's pretty clear that in theory if you could reduce the CAG repeats in that disease that

37:45.720 --> 37:55.800
you could correct the phenotype and theory and despite that fact my field, this drug

37:55.800 --> 38:04.920
delivery therapeutics field has not successfully been able to deliver a therapeutic that can

38:04.920 --> 38:10.560
do this very simple genetic task despite the fact that we've known exactly what we needed

38:10.560 --> 38:12.440
to do for 30 years.

38:12.440 --> 38:18.160
And also to some extent proves your point when you say the brain is complex.

38:18.160 --> 38:22.040
When I look at the brain from a drug delivery perspective I get extremely nervous because

38:22.040 --> 38:29.880
of that fact it's just a big huge complicated organ and it's hard to get stuff to go to

38:29.880 --> 38:30.880
the brain.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.440
Which is a nice place in the brain.

38:32.440 --> 38:38.680
Yeah I would even argue it's hard to get, I don't want to speak too broadly or too like

38:38.680 --> 38:43.440
an over colloquial terminology here but I think about this very simply which is that there's

38:43.440 --> 38:48.600
this thing that we're all aware of the blood brain barrier which is basically the blood

38:48.600 --> 38:53.240
vessels in the brain are very good at keeping stuff out of the brain generally speaking.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.640
And so if you want to deliver a drug into the brain it's really hard to do it because

38:56.640 --> 39:01.080
the body has evolved and designed itself to prevent things from getting into the brain.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.960
It's quite literally that simple, it's hard to get drugs into the brain so even if we have

39:04.960 --> 39:08.960
clear genetics it's hard to make an impact which again like you said.

39:08.960 --> 39:12.720
Well to second that with the imaging I think the next big hype is going to be the brain

39:12.720 --> 39:13.720
imaging.

39:13.720 --> 39:20.840
The reality is out there you can see things that we could never see before and the absolutely.

39:20.840 --> 39:26.360
But it has a, well it's not a picture that's the other myth, it's not a picture of somebody's

39:26.360 --> 39:30.960
brain it's a composite of a number of statistical and computerized.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.720
Is this like the, half of my eyes.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.480
Oh I think it's not a picture of my brain in the sense that people think of a picture.

39:36.480 --> 39:40.520
So there's already the media, I have this slide in some ways.

39:40.520 --> 39:45.880
But you know I think the next kind of potential hype is going to be brain imaging and Alzheimer's

39:45.880 --> 39:51.960
disease because again there's pretty good information about what's happening.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.720
You can see the same thing happening in Alzheimer's patients and Parkinson's patients.

39:55.720 --> 40:00.600
And yet just because one can actually show that doesn't mean there's going to be some

40:00.600 --> 40:02.800
kind of targeted delivery.

40:02.800 --> 40:07.000
And yet we keep seeing over and over again you know the next, I have articles that said

40:07.000 --> 40:11.560
in ten years we're going to have drugs or Alzheimer's, we had those articles 15 years

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
ago for gene therapy.

40:12.560 --> 40:16.040
We're going to have gene therapy for these particular disorders in ten years.

40:16.040 --> 40:23.400
It's an ethical problem what you do with, do you want to diagnose early a condition that

40:23.400 --> 40:24.960
you can't do anything about?

40:24.960 --> 40:25.960
Correct.

40:25.960 --> 40:26.960
I mean.

40:26.960 --> 40:30.960
And that's the whole genetics information in terms of the bio banking and the results.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.960
I mean that's what I've been doing for ten years, research results exactly.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.640
That's super interesting right?

40:35.640 --> 40:39.840
This is, I'm so curious to hear your voice for a second on this.

40:39.840 --> 40:47.040
Yeah, we have this wave, I mean total tsunami of genetic information available and it's

40:47.040 --> 40:48.520
frankly difficult to interpret.

40:48.520 --> 40:52.600
Even for somebody who's, you know you have a PhD in genetics you can get spin a tube

40:52.600 --> 40:57.040
and get your 23andMe profile back and it's hard to interpret your own stuff.

40:57.040 --> 41:02.640
So it's going to be difficult and we're going to need scientists and people who are trained

41:02.640 --> 41:08.120
specifically to take all the genetic information and talk to patients in a way that's practical

41:08.120 --> 41:09.120
and I don't know how you do that.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.360
I mean do you guys have any idea how to do that?

41:11.360 --> 41:13.000
Well the field is moving in that direction.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
When I started thirteen years ago at the Hastings Center I was on a project, an NIH funded

41:18.000 --> 41:25.400
project on the genetics education and ethics or something to that effect was the title.

41:25.400 --> 41:29.920
And we talked about these issues about, you know the human genome had just started to,

41:29.920 --> 41:32.560
it had just started to produce some data.

41:32.560 --> 41:36.240
So this was in the early 2000s and you know the whole issue was oh my god we have all

41:36.240 --> 41:38.400
this information now and we're going to have all these breakthroughs.

41:38.400 --> 41:42.640
Well then the scientists and the clinicians started saying we have a lot of information

41:42.640 --> 41:43.880
that tells us nothing.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.880
We just have a lot of information.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.520
And even if we have information that shows something that might be close to helping us

41:50.520 --> 41:52.240
on a diagnosis we have no treatments.

41:52.240 --> 41:57.560
And then all the other issues about familial connections and heritability and paternity

41:57.560 --> 41:59.240
issues and all this came up.

41:59.240 --> 42:03.760
The field in medicine and genetics has moved, I would in at least the last five years quite

42:03.760 --> 42:15.760
a bit to trying to find ways for institutions and specialty groups to at least kind of have

42:15.760 --> 42:20.480
some kind of a consensus on what is the key information they want to actually look at

42:20.480 --> 42:22.200
and what do you actually know.

42:22.200 --> 42:26.760
And to try to have that information filtered down to the clinical level as opposed to

42:26.760 --> 42:28.440
everybody just has everything.

42:28.440 --> 42:32.680
So a lot of institutions I'm sure your institution I know at the Mayo Clinic I had done some

42:32.680 --> 42:34.040
work there.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.760
At the larger professional society level there are these groups now these consortia

42:37.760 --> 42:44.120
either regionally, institutionally or across the field of trying to find out you know what

42:44.120 --> 42:49.880
are the key genetic variants that we need to be focused on in terms of clinical practice.

42:49.880 --> 42:53.640
Even if we can't do anything is there enough information about something that we would

42:53.640 --> 42:58.160
want to at least ask patients if they want that information and then try to find some

42:58.160 --> 43:02.200
way to deal with even if you can't do anything with Huntington's at least you know if they

43:02.200 --> 43:03.200
want to know.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.640
Then you come into the ethical issue of what if they don't want to know.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.280
Does a clinician have an obligation?

43:07.280 --> 43:10.160
So you've got the right to know issue and right not to know issue.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.160
Yeah.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.080
It reminds me of the informed consent.

43:14.080 --> 43:20.600
I remember as a medical student I had to consent a teenage year for an appendectomy taking

43:20.600 --> 43:25.560
the appendix out and it was just really difficult to explain to him exactly what it involved

43:25.560 --> 43:26.560
and so on.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.280
This is just an appendix.

43:28.280 --> 43:35.280
Now you talk about risk factors that may by 2% or 5% or 17.3% or to your risk of something

43:35.280 --> 43:39.520
for which you it just very hard to see how you will.

43:39.520 --> 43:45.840
Well if you're educated in the field how will you reach a conclusion how you will how

43:45.840 --> 43:51.200
this affects your treatment and how you then tell this to broader.

43:51.200 --> 43:57.480
It's really critical to take into account how your description you know when that patient

43:57.480 --> 44:02.640
receives that information it could affect their even even if medically their genetic

44:02.640 --> 44:07.040
code isn't going to really change the odds that they get a given disease.

44:07.040 --> 44:13.520
If you say okay you know I'm your risk for disease X has now increased by 15% right as

44:13.520 --> 44:14.960
a patient I might go oh my lord.

44:14.960 --> 44:21.040
This is that's scary to me you know I am at risk for disease X however the overall risk

44:21.040 --> 44:25.840
of any disease is like 1 in 10,000 so now you're like 1.15 out of 10,000 statistically

44:25.840 --> 44:27.680
nothing really has changed.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
Correct.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.960
Right and but that's I know that even if I got that information I would be like oh man

44:31.960 --> 44:34.360
this is you know.

44:34.360 --> 44:38.360
Most major diseases though even though they may be genetic components and maybe even the

44:38.360 --> 44:43.280
science might get us to a point where you could be the next Nobel Prize winner for finding

44:43.280 --> 44:46.920
a targeted you know pathway.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.480
Most major diseases we already know if you're at risk for it.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.400
You have family history, you have high blood pressure, you have certain markers in your

44:54.400 --> 45:00.520
blood for diabetes and for prostate cancer, you have scans imaging from mammography,

45:00.520 --> 45:02.280
CAT scans, MRIs.

45:02.280 --> 45:07.280
So the genetic information may not in and of itself change much already and if you're

45:07.280 --> 45:12.360
talking about trying to prevent those diseases we have tons of literature and studies showing

45:12.360 --> 45:18.440
that people are very very very hard to get people to change their eating, exercise, lifestyle

45:18.440 --> 45:23.080
habits even when they have the information that their dad died at 45.

45:23.080 --> 45:28.960
So sometimes I wonder what you know from again from the discovery science point the discovery

45:28.960 --> 45:34.800
science is critically important but from the clinical point what we already know about

45:34.800 --> 45:39.000
patients what we already learn in the clinic you have a lot of information already.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.720
Go into a new doctor and the first thing you do is go down the list what your family history

45:41.720 --> 45:44.800
have you been in the hospital, have you had any operations, have you had a stroke, do

45:44.800 --> 45:48.880
you have diabetes, do you ever get dizzy, do you ever have all these things that you

45:48.880 --> 45:54.360
look at and it's not completely done but it gives you a lot of information already.

45:54.360 --> 46:01.800
Correct, for example one of my colleagues is a stroke specialist and all he says is that

46:01.800 --> 46:06.200
if you control your blood pressure that's probably the best thing to prevent stroke,

46:06.200 --> 46:11.320
Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment much more so than much later on and that would

46:11.320 --> 46:16.840
be probably from a public health impact that's probably much more important if you just control

46:16.840 --> 46:22.880
your blood pressure your chances of all these devastating neurologic disorders that decrease

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
oxygen.

46:23.880 --> 46:29.520
And it would be a lot easier if I can still eat the way I eat and get a gene chip or some

46:29.520 --> 46:35.040
mechanism put into my brain to get your blood pressure checked and decrease salt intake

46:35.040 --> 46:37.120
which is actually what you're supposed to do.

46:37.120 --> 46:41.360
Well and the other thing I'll point out too is that so this is what it looks like right

46:41.360 --> 46:47.720
now but you know things change and it could be in 20 years they play this video back and

46:47.720 --> 46:51.840
everybody on the stage looks like a fool as I would actually statistically this is probably

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
a good case.

46:52.840 --> 46:56.680
This is why it's always better to keep skeptical stance.

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
Yeah, that's right.

46:57.680 --> 47:02.760
But you know things I mean things could change it could turn out that the precision medicine

47:02.760 --> 47:06.320
didn't work out as much as we want to or it could turn out that you know we have cures

47:06.320 --> 47:10.040
to three or four diseases that we didn't think were on the table because in eight years

47:10.040 --> 47:11.520
I think that's actually more likely.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.520
Yeah, that's right.

47:12.520 --> 47:16.240
Because the focus is on a siloed science focus and yes absolutely right.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.840
That's right it's just impossible to predict how these things evolve.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.160
They're in the business of what discovery.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.160
That's right.

47:21.160 --> 47:26.560
One of the areas that was promising for the gene editing were the kind of diseases that

47:26.560 --> 47:32.040
we know are inherited and we know that start early like muscular dystrophy for example.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.040
More sickle salinine.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.040
More sickle salinine.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.920
I thought those are areas where the promise was the greatest.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.360
Oh yeah that's right.

47:39.360 --> 47:45.080
So there are a number of disease and I'm not an expert in this because we just work on

47:45.080 --> 47:46.640
the delivery.

47:46.640 --> 47:51.600
But there are a subset of biological diseases where again sort of akin to Huntington's

47:51.600 --> 47:56.440
where the genetics and the biology is pretty clear.

47:56.440 --> 48:00.880
As a broad statement we all know here that most diseases are very complicated biologically

48:00.880 --> 48:05.240
but there are subset diseases where we know okay roughly you know this gene is messed

48:05.240 --> 48:08.080
up and therefore you get the disease or that gene is messed up and therefore you get the

48:08.080 --> 48:09.280
disease.

48:09.280 --> 48:15.680
So for disease like that I do think there's a possibility that we'll see advances before.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.400
This is definitely a safe statement to make.

48:17.400 --> 48:21.240
We'll see famous lawswords.

48:21.240 --> 48:26.040
I do think that we'll see advances in the simple diseases before we'll see advances

48:26.040 --> 48:27.920
in the complicated diseases.

48:27.920 --> 48:31.320
And I do think that's the case.

48:31.320 --> 48:39.400
I was going to ask you don't these current ways of working with genes allow you to alter

48:39.400 --> 48:45.880
the brain blood barrier at the brain, in other words isn't that part of the job to see how

48:45.880 --> 48:48.080
you can alter that barrier.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.080
So it kind of depends.

48:50.080 --> 48:56.240
Alter can be a scary word in the brain and I guess the best way to describe it is there's

48:56.240 --> 48:59.680
a reason why that blood barrier is there.

48:59.680 --> 49:05.520
And so for instance let's say theoretically you said okay I want to deliver drugs to the

49:05.520 --> 49:10.160
brain so we know that there is a gene.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.640
So the blood vessels that line the brain all express this one particular gene called

49:14.640 --> 49:20.520
VE kit here and the VE kit here basically takes the cells that line up the brain and

49:20.520 --> 49:24.600
it makes the cells stick together so that there's a tight junction nothing can get in

49:24.600 --> 49:26.120
between the cells.

49:26.120 --> 49:30.680
So in theory you know you go in and inject an antibody towards VE kit here and direct

49:30.680 --> 49:35.360
to SIR and A against VE kit here and knock down that protein so the cells become loosened

49:35.360 --> 49:39.240
up and now you can deliver your drug and it would get out.

49:39.240 --> 49:44.760
However they're going to be side effects to that and they could be pretty dramatic side

49:44.760 --> 49:45.760
effects.

49:45.760 --> 49:56.800
So I think manipulating the brain in order to get drugs to it is in theory a workable

49:56.800 --> 49:59.920
strategy been practiced I would you know if I had to put money on the table I'd probably

49:59.920 --> 50:00.920
bet against it.

50:00.920 --> 50:05.960
Because you get to modify the drugs so they will go up and the other way around.

50:05.960 --> 50:10.800
You can change the pharmacology of molecules so that they do go to the brain.

50:10.800 --> 50:11.800
Yeah.

50:11.800 --> 50:18.800
And there's a lot of utility in understanding some basic biology so you know there's a

50:18.800 --> 50:23.360
there are certain they're very limited number but there are a small number of pathways where

50:23.360 --> 50:28.600
you can actually these molecular pathways the cells use these pathways to get things

50:28.600 --> 50:32.720
across the bloodstream into the brain because the brain does need to get stuff out of the

50:32.720 --> 50:37.120
bloodstream so the body has ways to get certain things into the brain and you can hijack

50:37.120 --> 50:41.400
some of these molecular pathways to get things across the brain.

50:41.400 --> 50:47.960
Now the efficacy is can be limited but there are a small number of pathways where you can

50:47.960 --> 50:49.360
exploit them to get things across.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.360
There's a lot of things to the brain.

50:51.360 --> 50:55.400
I would have to say one of the miracles of modern psychiatry or of psychiatry in the

50:55.400 --> 51:02.480
20th to 20th century is that we actually were serendipitously able to find prozac and

51:02.480 --> 51:08.360
halloparadol and lithium which are now sort of like everything is a mainstay of that but

51:08.360 --> 51:14.160
if we and they get across very well and it's amazing because these actually change the

51:14.160 --> 51:20.240
practice of psychiatry and if we did not have this we would not be in the state we are now

51:20.240 --> 51:25.400
where it's so these definitely went across the board and they're actually quite effective

51:25.400 --> 51:31.600
so it's not as if this is we're dealing with something that is 50 to 60% effective in most

51:31.600 --> 51:36.520
people what we have the main issue that we're sort of grappling with now is what do we do

51:36.520 --> 51:43.080
for the 40 to 50% of people that don't respond to the third and fourth generation of prozac

51:43.080 --> 51:48.560
or the third and fourth generation of lithium at this point but it is quite miraculous that

51:48.560 --> 51:49.560
we have these.

51:49.560 --> 51:55.640
And it's also important to note here too that when you think about getting things across

51:55.640 --> 52:00.960
or across the blood brain barrier into the brain there's a size limitation so the things

52:00.960 --> 52:05.560
that get across to the things that cells can handle and sort of take across on their own

52:05.560 --> 52:10.680
are typically extremely small so they might be on the order of like a chemical chemical

52:10.680 --> 52:16.120
compound that might weigh 500 Dalton's or maybe a thousand Dalton's at most.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.360
A lot of these biological drugs that we're talking about these sort of next generation

52:19.360 --> 52:25.040
drugs if you put them inside a nanoparticle people don't know how to weigh a nanoparticle

52:25.040 --> 52:29.680
but I've heard estimates on the order of 20 million to 100 million Dalton's which is certainly

52:29.680 --> 52:37.240
a lot different than 500 Dalton's and so getting that delivery of these large biologics across

52:37.240 --> 52:41.360
is going to be a different ball game.

52:41.360 --> 52:44.200
What the technical hurdle of just getting RNA across?

52:44.200 --> 52:47.680
It's RNA, that's a great question, thanks.

52:47.680 --> 52:54.960
I love that question, I've been living with that question for years.

52:54.960 --> 53:03.440
Yeah, so if you want to get RNA out of the bloodstream into a tissue it helps if the

53:03.440 --> 53:06.440
tissue helps you out on its own.

53:06.440 --> 53:10.720
In the liver there are certain blood vessels so I'll take a sit back and say that the blood

53:10.720 --> 53:17.000
vessels that are sort of lying your liver are different than the blood vessels that line

53:17.000 --> 53:21.560
your lung and the different ones that line your brain and the blood vessels that line

53:21.560 --> 53:26.720
like an average artery in your heart for instance are different than the blood vessels that

53:26.720 --> 53:32.920
line a vein in your heart so there's heterogeneity both across tissues and within the tissue

53:32.920 --> 53:35.640
and you can use that to your advantage.

53:35.640 --> 53:40.880
There are wonderful delivery vehicles for delivering small RNAs to hepatocytes in the

53:40.880 --> 53:46.280
liver and one of the reasons why allegedly they work so well is because some of the blood

53:46.280 --> 53:51.720
vessels in the liver actually a little holes punched in them so the holes might be between

53:51.720 --> 53:57.400
a, you know, so imagine like a garden hose with like a bunch of holes punched in it and

53:57.400 --> 54:00.720
then you want to get stuff out of the garden hose it's going to get out of the garden

54:00.720 --> 54:04.640
hose more so than a garden hose that doesn't have any holes on it, right?

54:04.640 --> 54:09.920
And so those fenestra or like little windows in the liver help drugs get across so that's

54:09.920 --> 54:17.280
one thing and you know besides that to be honest I mean we don't really know, we don't really

54:17.280 --> 54:22.160
know we know that we can use these physical barriers to our advantage but if we want to

54:22.160 --> 54:26.040
actively target something like the brain or the lung or something that doesn't have those

54:26.040 --> 54:32.680
physical advantages and we have to get clever and you know it's hard to get clever.

54:32.680 --> 54:36.120
I was thinking as you were talking the two of you brain disorders are very different

54:36.120 --> 54:39.720
too it's like cancers are different although they're finding some similarities and

54:39.720 --> 54:42.760
listening to them are seeing cancers comparatively easier.

54:42.760 --> 54:48.640
Yeah exactly because not all brain disorders are equal and you have the package of disorders

54:48.640 --> 54:53.120
it had to do with depression and mania and psychosis and then you have the package it

54:53.120 --> 54:56.880
has to do with neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and other

54:56.880 --> 55:05.000
dimensions and then the other more complex kinds of ALS kinds of things they have spinal

55:05.000 --> 55:11.720
connections it's such a complex area to try to figure out a can you just figure out can

55:11.720 --> 55:15.720
you just explain what's happening number one which we're not there yet.

55:15.720 --> 55:21.000
Number two even if you can't explain can you at least rejigger it somehow to get some kind

55:21.000 --> 55:27.920
of different outcome than what the patient is experiencing and that's going to be complex

55:27.920 --> 55:30.520
because you've got these different combinations.

55:30.520 --> 55:38.640
Yes I think the biology is so complex but I would have to say since I'm I hope to be

55:38.640 --> 55:44.320
an optimist is that is that as a society we have figured out how to treat patients in

55:44.320 --> 55:48.960
a completely different way which is through psychotherapy right which I think is one

55:48.960 --> 55:53.720
of the most effective ways people have shown that whether it be psychodynamic, psychoanalytic

55:53.720 --> 55:59.160
or cognitive behavioral they all seem to have an effect size that is sometimes larger than

55:59.160 --> 56:03.320
the drugs we use and I think this is something we can take advantage of.

56:03.320 --> 56:08.680
I mean we which I think gets to the whole point that this is what we call targeted environment

56:08.680 --> 56:13.480
you're actually using the environment you're trying to we program the brain by having a

56:13.480 --> 56:19.520
discussion with someone else I mean obviously I'm simplifying it beyond means but the one

56:19.520 --> 56:24.200
example I'm going to give and I apologize this is an example from my lab but so it's

56:24.200 --> 56:30.360
sort of biased but so we've been studying post-traumatic stress disorder and actually

56:30.360 --> 56:35.040
I actually see patients coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and actually what I first

56:35.040 --> 56:41.240
of all I've noticed is they're all really young they're like they're 22 to 24 years

56:41.240 --> 56:46.240
old there's young soldiers and I really makes it what I've been working with them for about

56:46.240 --> 56:52.040
five six years and and I realized that they're essentially adolescents so that we essentially

56:52.040 --> 56:57.160
are sending our soldiers our adolescents to war because you don't send 30 year olds to

56:57.160 --> 57:04.160
war you send 18 to 22 year olds and what we're what my colleague BJ Casey who was also at

57:04.160 --> 57:10.280
the Sackler Institute we're in we're very we were very much trying to tailor treatments

57:10.280 --> 57:15.440
at different stages of development and we recently have made a fairly significant we think well

57:15.440 --> 57:21.960
and not not like New York time significant but just like lab significance advance in the

57:21.960 --> 57:27.920
sense that we find that if we do different types of what we call exposure based treatments

57:27.920 --> 57:33.680
in both humans and in our mice that we study that we actually get different what different

57:33.680 --> 57:40.680
levels of attenuation of memories so in many ways you can imagine as I was discussing before

57:40.680 --> 57:46.280
that that the brain is really developing during different stages and we've noticed now that

57:46.280 --> 57:51.400
adolescents in particular is very plastic you're much more plastic during you're actually

57:51.400 --> 57:57.320
much smarter than you are at other points in development and we think that we can possibly

57:57.320 --> 58:02.440
tailor new types of behavioral treatments which are not whatever don't involve blood

58:02.440 --> 58:08.360
brain barrier and so you can imagine another form of precision medicine is actually trying

58:08.360 --> 58:13.800
to target the right time when your brain is ready it's very similar to the way we've

58:13.800 --> 58:19.640
been very much informed by the work of like decades ago there was the Nobel Prize was

58:19.640 --> 58:24.640
given for what they call critical periods of visual plasticity that if you have someone

58:24.640 --> 58:30.920
that has doesn't have perfect aligned vision you had a window of about five years before

58:30.920 --> 58:35.560
when you had to actually close one eye and let the other eye get stronger and basically

58:35.560 --> 58:41.040
and if you miss that window you could not do things and we think that in psychiatric disorders

58:41.040 --> 58:46.920
at least in the simple realm of something like fear learning or fear post traumatic stress

58:46.920 --> 58:52.120
disorder you might be able to find a window where you can actually alter memories or alter

58:52.120 --> 58:56.800
the emotional valence of memories because the brain is much more plastic again this is just

58:56.800 --> 59:02.560
like the tip of the iceberg but then you could imagine if you could bootstrap this that ultimately

59:02.560 --> 59:08.320
you could possibly then add a drug on top of it so right now we're doing a clinical trial

59:08.320 --> 59:13.280
with these veterans where in addition to giving them exposure therapy we're actually giving

59:13.280 --> 59:17.680
them a cognitive enhancer it's not a very good one I can say that but you can imagine

59:17.680 --> 59:22.680
the future in the future of psychiatry might be where you combine what is probably the

59:22.680 --> 59:27.680
most effective treatment where you actually get because not only psychotherapy is not

59:27.680 --> 59:33.240
just what happens in the if you think about it for a patient to be in psychotherapy or

59:33.240 --> 59:39.200
see a psychiatrist or psychologist they actually have to get out of their room and travel somewhere

59:39.200 --> 59:43.880
so there's something about that whole movement which we think is much more important that

59:43.880 --> 59:48.320
they're re-engaged with the environment in some way and that you could imagine in the

59:48.320 --> 59:54.320
future it'll be this combination of using potentially drugs RNA or other biologics and

59:54.320 --> 59:58.600
also but combining with psychotherapy I think we're now at a point where we're realizing

59:58.600 --> 01:00:03.080
that one drug won't do it or one therapy won't do it so I think that's I mean that's sort

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.800
of the future I think you've touched you haven't you haven't gotten there but the logical discussion

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.880
that's going on in the ethics literature is so where so when you when if and when we get

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:20.320
to the point where you can fix PTSD and societies have always sent young boys to war that's

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:27.360
not new it's always been young boys by by draft in most in most historical moments you

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:34.000
don't have a choice the logical extension is well if you can fix the brain after this

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.560
horrific trauma and maybe even erase those horrible memories which you know there are

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.120
some drugs that are being discussed about that then what is what are the societal implications

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.760
for that for nation states and wars and so on if we can and even if you could gene edit

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:55.120
something later on to erase bad memories about killing and bad memories of trauma do we then

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.880
have a societal or other societal implications for the use of those therapeutics and the use

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.360
of those techniques or reasons that may be nefarious and not necessarily what we would

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.520
like to talk about yes no the brain is actually quite no I think it's a very good point I think

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:18.920
the best way the best anecdote I had heard about this is from Joe Lidou who's a neuroscientist

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:25.640
at New York University if you see a car crash outside you have a memory of it you go home

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.800
and within six hours for some reason has to be six hours but within six hours if you then

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:37.240
watch a TV news of episode of it and it's slightly different and you will update that

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.960
memory and the memory will be more like the newscast than your eyewitness account of it

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.160
and so this is what they call updating your memory so this I think is what you're saying

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.880
about this is actually quite dangerous which means that memories are not as fixed in this

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:58.200
I saw it as we think and it can it's always amenable to updating or in many some cases

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.280
potentially erasure right yeah so that you can update or and this is how I think this

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.280
is the danger that you could imagine that you there are various forms of treatments

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.400
that could actually lead to significant updating in a different way than it was we of course

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.920
want to think of it in a therapeutic way that we're going to try to update it and make

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.840
previously bad memories lose their emotional or fearful valence but you can imagine they

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:28.720
could go the other way the best example I have of this is I was talking to a general

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:35.160
from when we're doing a DoD study the Department of Defense study and when the soldiers first

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.160
came off the field and this has not been published but he said that what they did add

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:43.560
and totally they were and they know that they had been under a very traumatic experience

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:50.040
they gave all of them either ambient or clonipin these are sort of tranquilizer drugs and but

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:57.200
what all neuroscientists know is that sleep consolidates memories so so they looked temporarily

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.520
calmer they woke up and became more frightened because their memories had been consoled

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.520
acquired and consolidated so you can imagine that that that especially when we put our our

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:16.680
our adolescent citizens into war situations this is actually quite a dangerous situation

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.520
because we could actually make things much worse and my colleague also I have a colleague

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:27.560
Richard Friedman who is a psychiatrist but also writes for the New York Times and what

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.520
he mentioned is that he's noticed that the people and he's written about this so this

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.000
is in the New York Times that that there's an incredibly high use of amphetamines because

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.360
when you're on on in the field you have to stay awake and so then the but then this also

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:48.160
consolidates and makes you remember things much better just as anyone who's given a patient

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.800
ritalin this is essentially they're giving ritalin to others the soldiers and that ultimately

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.880
your your fearful memories also get hyper consolidated as a result of this so again we're we are

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.120
already doing things right now manipulating memories even potentially inadvertently even

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.600
though the government doesn't really think they're doing it and it was actually very

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.640
hard for Richard to actually extract this information from the government actually they've been using

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.560
amphetamines for a long time at least since World War II absolutely yeah in the military

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.720
yeah I mean from my perspective I don't from a drug discovery perspective I don't think

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:33.240
we're gonna be in the game but yeah we're looking to hemophilia and cystic fibrosis

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.120
and yeah that's kind of what we look at where does your field does it intersect at all with

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:45.920
brain interface in any way sure I mean we look at trying to design drugs for Alzheimer's

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:53.000
or Parkinson's I mean my field specifically asks a more simple question which is can we

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.920
full stop can we get drugs into the brain genetic drugs into the brain the underlying

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.320
hypothesis is that the biologists and the geneticists are going to come up with genetic

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:08.640
targets to treat disease X or disease Y or disease Z the one thing that those diseases

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.120
have in common is that no matter what gene you're going after you have to deliver that

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.480
genetic therapy so that that's where we live as we ask the simple question which is you

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.760
know can we use chemical engineering or nanotechnology or bioengineering to just get a

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:28.040
genetic drug into the brain period and then you know if we succeed and we say okay we're

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.880
gonna go after Parkinson's or if we get it to the long we're gonna go after cystic fibrosis

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.400
so we do interface with with neurologists and neuroscientists but only in that context

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:43.440
yeah and when you talk about getting targeted therapeutics to the brain are you talking

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:48.800
through a pill or through a transfusion or through brain surgery or all three so a pill

01:05:48.800 --> 01:06:01.040
would be great but ideally yeah but but we're talking IV infusion oral delivery is incredibly

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:10.560
hard and it's kind of interesting why it's hard IV administration is already hard enough

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.000
because it goes to the liver right yeah well IV just it'll go through it'll pump out everywhere

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.480
and then the liver tends to soak things up as does the spleen and kidney but but if you

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.800
give something orally if you have a hamburger 20 minutes before you take that pill or you

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.040
don't the entire environment in your gut the receptors that are expressed the bacteria

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:41.520
that are everything changes so it's extremely hard to get something to get oral oral delivery

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.280
so I think you know the first genetic drugs that you'll see are likely to be either subcutaneous

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.880
administration or intravenous administration well so with Parkinson's other doing stem

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.520
cell injections actually through surgery through so so do you work with people who are thinking

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.800
about going that route or are you in a different kind of fall this is kind of a third rail

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:08.560
for me right now because I'm not a stem cell biologist so I don't want to sip out on too

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.600
much of a limb here but I do have colleagues who work on stem cell therapies I think that

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:18.400
some stem cell therapies will have the potential to be useful others others will not I can't

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.080
speak to Parkinson's but would you but would you think would but would there be a potential

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:29.360
drug that would that you might be able to discover that would only be able to be through

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.920
brain through brain surgery actually directly into the brain so this is one of the advantages

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.160
to the new gene editing technology so we were talking about distinguishing between like

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:45.640
sort of traditional gene therapies and new gene therapies one of the advantages to in

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:53.800
theory and again theory to these new gene therapies is that the effects are to some extent fairly

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:59.960
permanent so the analogy is that if you were to use an sirna which has a temporary effect

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.880
and you wanted to do something in cardiomyocytes you know like writing though or I will just

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.360
stick in the brain you want to do you want to do it in the brain you know if the effect

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.520
of the drug lasts like if you're lucky in the last three months you're not going to be able

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.800
to go in and perform brain surgery every three months right so that's not really an option

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.480
however if you have one of these new gene therapies where the effect is again in theory

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.400
pretty permanent then if you got the therapy to be effective enough then you could do you

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.600
could say okay we're going to perform a brain surgery and just spray a ton of this stuff

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.360
where we want it and we know just because we're these new gene therapies are semi-permanent

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.200
that the effects are going to last a really long time and therefore you know we're going

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.360
to look at this therapy now I don't know if people are looking into that but I know that

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.040
my colleagues and I when we think about this say oh this is actually kind of interesting

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.360
because it would open up like the pancreas or local administration to the heart in ways

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.240
that we haven't thought about before simply because the effect in the right type of cells

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.320
quiescent cells long-lasting cells is actually pretty pretty so how would you how would you

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.520
actually do this in human research because you can't go from the bench to the bedside

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:13.120
without doing studies and how would you actually study the long-term effects what kind of

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:21.240
endpoints would you be looking for that would be reasonably acceptable risk and yeah over

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:25.840
time I mean at least you can go back if you give somebody in some kind of a therapy with

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:30.560
the kidney or the heart or diabetes you can go back into follow-up testing that's not

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:35.120
sometimes it's invasive but it may be minimally invasive whereas if you're doing gene editing

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:41.760
yeah so and again there are people both probably on this panel and even in this room they probably

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.920
have more of an expertise in this and I do but when I when I think about this and I try

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.280
to think practically in the way that I would ever consider doing something like this I'd

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:56.040
say okay well what procedures are minimally invasive and access that tissue already in

01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.120
other words are we going in already in a bunch of patients so if you're you know putting

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.000
a scope in and you're like in the heart as is could you just spray some stuff in there

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.920
while you're taking your pictures or if you're you know doing a colonoscopy and you're already

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.040
you know in that area can you just spray stuff in locally and I imagine that would be a reasonable

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:21.000
starting starting point but again there there you know that's really an answer for a practicing

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.480
clinician because they would say no you idiot like you know that isn't going to work you

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.920
know it's better to you know this would be useful I'm looking to the clinician from cancer

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:34.880
perspective because you can follow up by looking at yeah I said that one so my only

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.320
excursion and distanced those for Parkinson's and editing them was from a cancer point of

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:49.600
view and the idea of implanting basically precursors of neurons into the brain it's a dangerous

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.560
proposition too because these cells do have plasticity in the wrong ways right they can

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:02.600
in fact form tumors and so with I think a lot of these new technologies whether it's genome

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:11.840
editing or stem cells you need to think of engineering a fail-safe switch what happens

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.840
if these cells suddenly decided now they will form a tumor and there are studies on stem

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.480
cells they are just more likely to cause tumors so you need to to anticipate that and you need

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:30.280
to be able to to get rid of them genetic ways of doing it and then we can do a lot of cool

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:38.520
things genetically and we can eliminate them that's sort of my my an option basically an

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.320
ideally you'd want it in a way that you know let's say someone needs a new liver and you're

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.120
able to grow it in the lab right and some population of these liver cells decide to become a liver

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.360
cancer the patient still needs the rest of the liver so you don't want to wipe out everything

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.160
you want to have a way that ideally selectively destroys these tumor cells but perhaps leaves

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:10.160
the rest of the liver intact and even that you can you can do there are ways of doing

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:17.880
this you know these are suicide genes basically that kill specific cells and a specific circumstances

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:24.680
these things are all technically possible you can engineer cells before implanting them

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:32.680
in a patient or an animal for a time being and have those cells perform specific functions

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:38.880
and you can install failsafe mechanisms to take them out when they misbehave in a way

01:12:38.880 --> 01:13:00.960
that you didn't want them okay questions thank you for a very interesting discussion there's

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:10.520
an area that perhaps ought to receive some attention in this age of over promise how

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:18.400
do we pay for the research when Galileo made his observations it didn't cost a billion

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:26.320
dollars the way it did to show the two black holes went were in collision so the cost of

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:35.480
this kind of research has mounted exponentially what about the cost for biomedical research

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:42.120
right now I have friends who when they hear the word socialism they faint but when I suggest

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:50.640
that the NIH is funding research they don't see that that's a form of socialism where

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.480
should the funding come from are we funding adequately do we need to fund it more and

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:08.360
are we over promising well of course research is expensive new therapies are expensive too

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:16.120
I think still in the context of the budget of the country it's nothing it's a drop in

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.160
the buckets compared to military spending compared to this successful operation in Iraq

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:28.920
a few years ago the money that is spent on cancer or psychological research is basically

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:39.840
nothing in comparison and I think it's ultimately more useful even if 99% of it will never lead

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:47.480
to clinical application a few things that actually do work immensely valuable so if

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.600
you are a government and you want to spend your money wisely it's probably one way to

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:58.840
go the related question I mentioned that the new therapies are also expensive so if you

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.360
think about the controversy about drug expenses and so on so there's a company that makes

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:10.920
a new drug against hepatitis C it's a pill it's a pill right you take it for a certain

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.040
number of months and they want a hundred thousand dollars for it prevent just the new other

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.240
other drug for cancer for a second cancer thirty thousand dollars three times and you'd

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:27.280
say that's insane how's it possible and it's expensive on the other hand up to now the same

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:34.280
patient would need a liver transplant it's gone across 200 300 400 thousand dollars even

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.280
even in those extreme cases where a company is really trying to make a lot of profit on

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:47.400
what is not even their own research partially maybe even there I think you still have a

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:52.760
benefits so Galileo and others were funded by the Catholic Church

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:59.760
a fairly wealthy and they were patrons of they were patrons of very wealthy people in

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.760
this culture so as an educator and an enthusiastic skeptic I absolutely agree we make prior we

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.960
make bad prior decision making in this country we have our priorities are wrong this is my

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.680
own personal view and I come from being trained and wanting to be an educator my whole life

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:20.600
and I think our priorities are wrong until recently the National Institutes of Health was

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.840
the largest funder of research that is in happens surpassed by private sector and mainly

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.680
by venture capital firms which many people here are familiar with which sometimes the

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:37.680
term venture capital sounds to those who are socialistic inclined bad but I think it's

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.160
a good thing that there's a mix but there's a huge problem now with conflicts of interest

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.120
in science and so that's another whole ethical dimension about where the money is coming

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.000
from and if you know all the movies that you watch you just follow the money there are

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.080
lots of complex issues many people argue for public private partnerships with and I come

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.320
from a political science background so I'm the person who always says in the sunshine

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.320
in the sunshine in the sunshine transparency accountability good governance with public

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:12.320
participation that's my fantasy as a non scientist where I would like to get yeah and just

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.880
in your early point I'd like just to sort of reemphasize things here which is that first

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.880
it may seem like the NIH budget is very large but it is not and I can say for a fact that

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:34.840
many of the colleagues that have grown up in sort of my scientific generation who would

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:41.840
make incredible professors incredible researchers I'd say I won't put in a exact number many

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:49.520
of them more than 50 percent well more than 50 percent do not go into academic science

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:56.800
because there is no research money and that is the exact reason why I know that when I

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.920
was considering taking a faculty job there were other jobs that were on the table as

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:06.800
well and I've always wanted to be a professor I think teaching students is incredible I'm

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:12.800
proud of the students I've taught so far it's the greatest joy in my life and yet I almost

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:18.680
took a different type of position because the grants are so hard to get that is the reason

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.680
why I almost didn't go in and it's the reason why everybody in my generation if they do

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:28.600
not go in that's the reason why they don't go in the other thing I think is a really

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:35.600
important point to understand is that it's really hard I would say it is impossible to

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.080
predict what is going to be useful down the line so today we've discussed a lot about

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.600
this new technology called these gene editing technologies and right now the most easy to

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.760
use gene editing technologies called CRISPR-Cas9 and right now I mean everybody knows about

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.000
CRISPR-Cas9 in the biological field it's considered arguably the biggest biotechnology

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.480
discovery in 40 years totally changing the world and that was originally discovered by

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:07.280
a bunch of bacteriologists sequencing some random repeats in an unknown bacteria and

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.440
saying oh that's weird these things look the same now if you put that grant in that 1980s

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.560
grant into the NIH system right now that doesn't get funded and 30 years down the line we don't

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:23.080
have CRISPR-Cas9 and that's the huge risk that we're facing right now is that there's

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.120
all these incredible transformational potentially transformational technologies 30 years 40 years

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.840
down the line that we're not stumbling onto because that's how science works so I think

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:37.320
it's really important to support increase in NIH funding you guys can believe me or not

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.720
obviously I'm sort of biased in that because this is important to me but I think there's

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:47.080
ample evidence to support the fact that that these discoveries are hard to make and there

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.480
are many people who want to do a great job who just are leaving the field right now because

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.760
there's no money but it's not just NIH funding because let's state so NIH is federal funding

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.280
so yes our federal dollars paper research but state funding for research and education

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:06.160
has been decimated in my lifetime I started as an academic teaching in 1989 or no age 1985

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.920
and it was being decimated in its continued science programs that were at public schools

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.440
you're at a private school but Georgia Georgia Tech gets public funding I've been cut dramatically

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:26.080
I wanted to ask a question I studied computer science and not biotechnology so when I look

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:33.320
at something like you know the RNA you know delivery of you know whether it's transmission

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:38.480
or messaging I think in sort of a computer model where you know we might send something

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:44.920
with an assist and rather than waiting for it to eventually succeed or break down we immediately

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.600
see an acknowledgement like we would see you know like an AC or an ACK it would say right

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.360
away send back this message and you say yes it succeeded it's failed and I've never heard

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:03.400
of anything like that within sort of the study of medicine where you know I think in terms

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:10.440
of you know is there it's more like eventually you see a cancer marker or you see a disorder

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:16.240
in the blood or this thing happens and it's measured maybe through a blood test but I wondered

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.280
I don't know enough about it to know is there something that you can immediately see that

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:27.000
is this sort of feedback within the system loop.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.360
So it's you know it's a difficult question to say yes or no to I will point you to a

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.200
field you may like reading about just for fun it's called synthetic biology it's a new

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:42.080
field very experimental right now but actually that sits right at the interface of basically

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:48.680
computer scientists like yourself and bioengineers and there are many universities now that actually

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.600
have faculty members whose research are sort of dedicated to living right at that interface

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:59.720
and it's really funny you'll see a biological paper published and they'll put in diagrams

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.680
that have resistors and transistors and the equivalent of that stuff in the circuitry of

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:10.280
the cell and so you know I don't know the field one enough to say yes or no that hazard

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.840
hasn't happened yet but it may have and if so I would say synthetic biology is a likely

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.080
place to find that.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:24.280
I think you sort of asked about immediate readouts of whether you know your message arrives and

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.320
whether you get an effect.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:33.360
Sorry and I think so in drug studies certainly that's something that you need to be able

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.720
to measure immediately you give a new drug and you want to be able to know the drug hit

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:43.360
the target and how effectively and for how long it suppresses that so that's certainly

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.560
part of any medical any drug study that you want.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:53.080
You have a call it a biomarker just something that says it got there and it did what it's

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.080
supposed to do.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:23:03.160
I have a question about the field of optogenetics and channel redoxins and also the delivery

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.640
how did they get it into the specific parts of the brain I've read a lot about it and

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:13.080
confused about that part and also the ethical implications of turning on and off neurons

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.800
in particular parts of the brain using channel redoxins.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.760
Well I'll quickly address the delivery part and I'll let the experts handle the media

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.440
part of the question.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.920
Luckily the answer is pretty simple as far as understand it.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.920
No black magic here they basically say okay we're going to take a virus that encodes the

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.600
optogenetic whatever channel redoxins you would like and they spray it in where they want

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600
to spray it in.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:40.120
They might use a cell type specific promoter to make sure it's only expressed in neurons

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:46.440
as opposed to glia but yeah they basically just and then you know you're good.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:52.520
But I think interesting enough mainly because there's a technical glitch almost all optogenetics

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.760
now is in rats and mice because all the promoters have been done.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.680
There seems to be a technical glitch of getting to primates so that there is not that much

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.440
of the ultimate use of optogenetics in humans is probably not going to be the reason why

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:11.440
optogenetics is so powerful up until now is because we had these very powerful promoter

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.360
specific expressions so you could go right to one type of dopamine neuron for example

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.320
and turn it on and in the monkey you cannot do it.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:27.000
So all the experiments so far in monkey and you can tell scientists are not stupid so

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.520
if you see how many people are going towards trying to translate this to human optogenetics

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:36.880
it seems to be very low it seems to be something that not is not something because you have

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.120
to actually put a fiber optic cable it's very complicated.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:47.520
I think in the future there is another type of technology which is still in its sort of

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:52.000
in essence is now being developed at many places but in particular at Rockefeller University

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.360
where instead of putting a virus that gets turned on by light but will get turned on

01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:03.600
by a magnetic beam so that is something that is possible in terms of developing better

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.200
and stronger ways of turning on magnetic fields within a darkened chamber like the brain and

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.680
I think that's an area.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:16.240
What they have definitely been able to do is turn on a magnetic beam on the pancreas and

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.760
get it to secrete insulin so that they can definitely do something like that so I think

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.240
that will probably be something that will people would much rather have a magnet put

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:32.480
on your abdomen than a fiber optic cable so I think that will probably be the 10, 5, 10

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.480
years from now.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:40.000
But the ethical concerns of optogenetics for primate human and non-human are probably

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.440
not that critical because the technical difficulties are a little bit too great right now and

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.560
you can't get funding for it.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.360
Well there are some questions that have come up about controlling the brain though in some

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.680
other technologies so deep brain stimulation and neuro enhancement not drug neuro enhancement

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.520
but mechanisms the electronic.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:07.040
There's two issues, well there's more than two issues but free will is one but another

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:15.200
one is what if I like what happens to me when I have deep brain stimulation or I'm using

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:19.760
a neuro enhancer and I can figure out how to do it and jigger with it on my own and

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.080
the clinician does not want to go there for a variety of reasons and there have been some

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.680
discussions in the ethical field about the rights of the patient to be able to say either

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.240
stop this which we in medical ethics we basically acknowledge the patients right to say I don't

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.400
want chemotherapy, I don't want the heart surgery, whatever, I don't want a brain interface.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.080
But the other flip side is I really like this, I like being manic and there's some literature

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.800
on this now and I like what this has done to me and I don't want to come down from whatever

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.760
the particular brain not drugs we're talking about are the kinds of interventions although

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:57.600
we could be talking about drugs but this is in the non drug field so it does raise some

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:03.840
interesting questions about individual control and then if people have control over what's

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:10.040
happening in terms of computers and chips and then the data that comes from that information

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.480
and who has access to that data is another whole realm.

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:21.040
I think the only comment I have is analgesia right so there were and maybe there's still

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.880
their pain control where patients can control their own medication and basically give themselves

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.720
opiates right and I think the conclusion of that research was that they actually administer

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.520
less than if it is given by the doctors and the nurses who have been self-controllable

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:44.520
actually do less than for better or worse it's actually a surprising.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:28:05.040
And you will know when you mention that we knew all there was to know about Huntington

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:11.360
you know identifying it but we didn't know how to control or to take interventions this

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:19.760
is very disturbing to me not what you said but that it's like it's closing it's as though

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:25.280
it's closing so much because I think that I just heard of something and it was about

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.440
post-traumatic syndrome and that other people have it you know we begin to realize under

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:35.200
other circumstances and it had a lot to do with mindfulness now and this was people

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:40.360
who were rather responsible saying that you know just controlling your mind and that gets

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:46.480
into the psychoanalysis of it but it seems that how do you get support when you have

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:53.160
some idea that's way out there that I have one more question and it was do you divide

01:28:53.160 --> 01:29:00.160
your field into dimensions you know this is this is what is happening in the cell this

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:06.600
is what we can do to control that thing that's happening in the cell I mean are there all

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.040
these steps that you you know do you go into this and different this I should know this

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:17.360
but do you go into different disciplines or aspects of your discipline so I there were

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:23.480
kind of three questions well it's a great set of questions so to your first question

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:33.360
about about Huntington's so I remain optimistic that we will be able to deliver to Huntington's

01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:37.440
and my lab works on new delivery technologies and there are many great labs across the

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:44.000
U.S. and also work on on the delivery technologies I think historically science most of the time

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.560
fails but a friend of mine says that you know all your failure all your failures don't

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:53.400
don't matter it's really your the few wins that you get that actually make a difference

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:58.160
and I agree with that so I wouldn't be dissuaded or feel pessimistic yeah

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:12.200
oh well you who's who's doing more basic oh by the way you're absolutely correct we don't

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:16.800
know what the protein Huntington actually does yep we really still don't understand

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.640
that yeah so and I should have been more clear earlier what I meant is from a therapeutic

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.440
perspective we know the sequence to go after and that is an important distinction I didn't

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.960
make that clearly so that's my fault to your second question I'll I'll intro that quickly

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.560
in my lab we do think about things in different layers and we purposefully try to position

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:40.640
ourselves at interfaces of new technology or different fields and that's how we try to

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:48.600
thrive so we try to use genomics and genetics and really big data sets to make our chemical

01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.920
engineering systems better that's how we try to distinguish ourselves so I know that

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:59.560
are in our lab we do purposefully subdivide things and then right look right where that

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:02.000
interface is.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:14.960
Thank you very much for very professional conversation and I have a lot of questions

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:25.520
but I would like to ask about simple techniques not like generating interventions for example

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:36.120
couple of years ago I on routine tests I it was I got really bad results on very routine

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:45.360
tests and I of course I straight was sent to more invasive tests and I was scared to

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:52.040
that that I should do this instead of this I start to read and that I a lot of information

01:31:52.040 --> 01:32:02.080
right now a lot of research that could some got some way but then lost finding and in

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:13.460
my case it was actually I should just change diet I just stop stop drink what I liked I

01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:23.240
liked very much so milk that was it in couple of months my test was okay everybody but everybody

01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:33.600
you're amazed it was it was not possible from their point of view so why we cannot yes maybe

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:41.040
really test more people and give them these some kind of connection that probably some

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:48.240
something in your environment in your diet could cause it why don't don't try it for

01:32:48.240 --> 01:33:00.160
example there are some research that psychological problems could be caused by our gut flow

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:11.760
micro flow and just prebiotics could change our brain functions or there are some research

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:23.720
that fish oil could really improve a lot of brain functions why we don't make these simple

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:31.720
connections without go to invasive tests and very expensive treatments because there are

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.520
a lot of great doctors out there who probably make a lot of those connections and can probably

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:43.560
help you I'm glad that you got better by changing the diet I think there first of all you I

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:48.560
can leave you there's smarter doctors but then also at Cornell I just realized this also we

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:55.080
hired we have a new microbiome project and I didn't realize that our entire gut floor

01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:01.080
all our bacteria weighs more than our brain the mouth it's like five or six pounds of

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:08.120
bacteria inside our body so it's not so simple it's not one bacteria and it's the genome of

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.880
the bacteria is 30 to 40 times more complex than the genome we have ourselves so that

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.360
you can imagine it's it looks like on the surface like it's simple it's actually much

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.400
more complex because then you're it's almost like we were studying a lake and that's an

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:32.600
ocean okay anyone else okay thank you very much thank you
