00:00.000 --> 00:18.640
Now to today's roundtable on happiness.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.000
Alberto Bisson, Professor of Economics at NYU,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.120
Shimon Edelman, Professor of Psychology at Cornell University,

00:27.120 --> 00:30.240
Benjamin Radcliffe, Professor of Political Science

00:30.240 --> 00:33.480
at the University of Notre Dame, Wendy Suzuki,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.560
Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at New York

00:36.560 --> 00:39.200
University, and Christine Vittrano, Associate Professor

00:39.200 --> 00:41.720
of Philosophy at Brooklyn College.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.760
And now we'll begin.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.720
Let's have a question for the panel.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.580
I wonder whether you know whether happiness

00:47.580 --> 00:50.760
has been measured as a function of stress levels

00:50.760 --> 00:54.160
in a country or a society, and physiological cortisol

00:54.160 --> 00:58.120
levels in the blood, or wherever other stress levels you have.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.560
There's been some work done on that.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
I know that people with hypertension

01:01.560 --> 01:03.400
are less happy than other people.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.640
But in terms of cross-national comparisons,

01:05.640 --> 01:06.680
I don't know.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.800
The other thing they do not exactly measure,

01:09.800 --> 01:12.360
they correlate it with the way you smile.

01:12.360 --> 01:16.680
There are measurements of how you smile, which

01:16.680 --> 01:18.000
relate to how happy you are.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.280
And they naturally do that.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.160
So OK, the idea of what she is happy.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.800
So they also have measured, yes, so I actually

01:31.800 --> 01:34.960
don't know which kind of a blood testing group.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.280
But there's an enormous battery of correlation.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.720
I just wonder, because I did a study,

01:40.720 --> 01:45.720
kind of another microcosm level in Y students,

01:45.720 --> 01:49.120
who were students doing exercise one time a week more

01:49.120 --> 01:50.960
during the whole semester, compared

01:50.960 --> 01:53.920
to another class that didn't exercise that much,

01:53.920 --> 01:55.640
beginning at the end of the semester.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.520
I didn't realize that I was doing a stress study,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.240
because stress goes up a lot at the end of the semester.

02:00.240 --> 02:04.520
What I found was the performance

02:04.520 --> 02:07.720
on cognitive tests, memory tests, of my students

02:07.720 --> 02:11.040
that exercised stayed the same from the beginning to the end.

02:11.040 --> 02:15.000
But the other class that didn't exercise with me in class

02:15.000 --> 02:18.080
went significantly down, because exercise protects

02:18.080 --> 02:22.840
the perciput campus from stress, protects the prefrontal cortex

02:22.840 --> 02:24.120
from cortisol.

02:24.120 --> 02:29.720
And so I just started wondering about stress levels.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.320
Yeah, I know that they measured the exact stress level.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.920
So I don't know how you would measure stress level,

02:33.920 --> 02:36.280
but there's all sorts of patterns.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.720
Yeah, exactly.

02:37.720 --> 02:42.160
On a group level, there have been several recent studies

02:42.160 --> 02:47.160
about socioeconomic strata groups that are better off

02:47.160 --> 02:49.000
or worse off at different times of the year.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.200
You've probably not studied from MIT.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.600
So farmers who grow one crop a year,

02:55.600 --> 03:00.280
just before they harvest, they are the most stressed.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.160
And so they have the proper control.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.040
It's a wonderful study.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.240
I forget the names of the people.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.120
It's very easy to Google them.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.320
But the interesting aspect was that the amount of stress

03:11.320 --> 03:14.280
seriously affected negatively, seriously affected

03:14.280 --> 03:15.560
the cognitive abilities of the people.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.520
Yeah, it does.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.600
And of course, if this is not a seasonal thing for you,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.520
if you're stressed because you are economically,

03:21.520 --> 03:22.720
I mean, if you are physically stressed

03:22.720 --> 03:24.440
because economically stressed, you're

03:24.440 --> 03:28.040
in a hole that becomes more and more difficult for you

03:28.040 --> 03:29.280
to get out of.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.440
You just dig yourself more in because you're

03:32.440 --> 03:33.480
cognitively impaired.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.800
Right.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.480
And it's really a travesty when someone says,

03:38.480 --> 03:41.320
there's a famous quote about, I think,

03:41.320 --> 03:44.240
Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish writer, said,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.280
the biggest mistake people made in the last thousand years

03:47.280 --> 03:49.920
was to assume that poor people are stupid.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.760
So there are two sides to this coin.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.560
They wouldn't be.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.960
They were not poor, I guess.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.120
That's one way of putting it.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.800
And another comment that your question, when you brought

04:00.800 --> 04:06.040
to mind, is in Baboon's stress was studied across stress.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.120
Robert Sapolsky's work.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.720
I'm sure you know that the guy who

04:09.720 --> 04:13.040
was running around taking saliva tests from Baboon's,

04:13.040 --> 04:17.280
not an easy task, and discovered wonderful things

04:17.280 --> 04:21.840
about social status, especially younger,

04:21.840 --> 04:25.480
the lessened males, and how they can be very negatively

04:25.480 --> 04:28.600
affected by being rejected, by being a young.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.640
If you're number 20 in the Baboon's of males,

04:32.640 --> 04:37.520
you basically have a brain and the physiology of somebody

04:37.520 --> 04:38.560
with PTSD.

04:38.560 --> 04:38.960
Right.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.400
Because you're chronic stress.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.760
You get beat up all the time, you don't have sex at all.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.760
And so this is another aspect.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.560
This is a complementary aspect in which someone who is already

04:47.560 --> 04:50.640
in the hole gets even worse because of the dynamics of this.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.800
And we have to recognize this is our nature.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.960
This is our physical nature.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.560
Exactly.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.200
And that is why the main reason why social democracy makes

04:59.200 --> 05:02.400
people happier in part is it reduces their stress levels

05:02.400 --> 05:04.840
and permanent levels of anxiety about living in a market

05:04.840 --> 05:06.960
society, and particularly people at the lower end

05:06.960 --> 05:07.840
of that spectrum.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.920
At least it makes them think they live in a market.

05:10.920 --> 05:15.480
I just saw an ad on the subway coming in here.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.120
I think it was from 7-Eleven.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.800
You can buy now your drink in two colors of cup, red or blue.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.200
And you know, have your say.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.000
Have your choice, free choice, land of free choice.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.600
The elephant or the donkey.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.920
You have your choice.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.200
So are you coming to the conclusion

05:37.200 --> 05:44.320
that happiness can be defined as low stress and low anxiety

05:44.320 --> 05:48.320
on an individual level and that those social things that

05:48.320 --> 05:50.920
alter it have to do with the fact that they bring down

05:50.920 --> 05:53.240
the stress level in people?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.480
The last part I would agree with that.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.080
I personally would not say that happiness is

05:56.080 --> 05:58.960
isomorphic or equivalent to low levels of anxiety.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.880
But that anxiety is a cause or a correlate of happiness.

06:02.880 --> 06:07.120
So if you reduce anxiety, you reduce you increase happiness.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.640
So they're not identical by any means.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.400
There's a normal variation, again,

06:12.400 --> 06:13.600
of the things equal, right?

06:13.600 --> 06:18.600
So all these studies are done correctly

06:18.600 --> 06:19.880
from a statistical point of view.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.200
They are done at the same sequence.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.920
So you keep your own regressions where essentially you

06:24.920 --> 06:27.440
put these individual variables and a bunch of other things.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.720
So again, happiness depends on how they take.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.160
So given the level of your anxiety, you're happier.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.720
If you're rich, given the level of your wealth,

06:35.720 --> 06:38.320
you're happier if you're less anxious.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.960
Given the level of your wealth and anxiety,

06:40.960 --> 06:43.240
you're happier if you have more sex.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.040
You're happier if you exercise.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.480
If you don't have kids or things of this sort.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.200
So these are all correlates.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.120
It's actually true.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.520
This is one of the puzzles is this issue of kids.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.880
It's very widespread in the literature

07:00.880 --> 07:04.600
that people with kids are not as happy as me without kids.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.480
No, that's absolutely true.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.880
And of course, and people.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.880
Yeah, until they leave.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.880
Right.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.240
It goes back, right?

07:11.240 --> 07:15.720
So, again, from the economist point of view,

07:15.720 --> 07:18.240
people still are doing kids.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.040
Why aren't they?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.680
So one of the two measures is a problem.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.960
But on other dimensions, no, right?

07:25.960 --> 07:29.520
On the stress or sex or other things,

07:29.520 --> 07:32.640
people are happy when they do it and they do it.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.840
But the kids is the other way around.

07:33.840 --> 07:39.640
So the point I want to try and make is these things all move.

07:39.640 --> 07:41.400
They're all correlated.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.480
It's very hard to do any causation argument.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.960
And in a case, they are all correlated.

07:44.960 --> 07:49.000
So we look at variations where you keep one thing cost

07:49.000 --> 07:49.800
and you move the rest.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.080
So all contribute.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.560
If you think of them in a causal manner, which perhaps you

07:54.560 --> 07:59.240
shouldn't, but if you do, still all of these are causing

07:59.240 --> 08:02.480
all of these measures are causing happiness.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.920
I think you can, from a philosophical standpoint,

08:04.920 --> 08:06.520
I don't think it's so hard to explain.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.120
I know people think that it's so, you know,

08:08.120 --> 08:09.800
it's comical and sort of mysterious.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.440
And I always, in like my first day of class and my happiness

08:12.440 --> 08:14.240
class, I always hit my students with that because they're

08:14.240 --> 08:16.120
always like, oh, you know, a lot of them

08:16.120 --> 08:17.840
don't have children and they're thinking they want to have

08:17.840 --> 08:19.560
children and I tell them, well, if you want to be happy,

08:19.560 --> 08:21.200
that's not one of the things you want to do.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.200
But I think that the reason that the studies show that

08:24.200 --> 08:28.360
is because when you pull people the way that typically

08:28.360 --> 08:31.080
these results come from these poles of people,

08:31.080 --> 08:34.320
happiness is a very limited, I mean, if you think of happiness

08:34.320 --> 08:37.680
as just your sort of satisfaction with your life,

08:37.680 --> 08:39.720
kids are, I mean, I have two children.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.480
So I mean, they're a huge source of, you know, very, very

08:43.480 --> 08:45.280
positive and very, very negative emotions.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.320
I felt like before I had kids, my emotional range was like this.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.280
And then when I had kids, I was like, wow,

08:50.280 --> 08:53.200
there's this whole spectrum I didn't even know existed

08:53.200 --> 08:55.600
in terms of like, I've never been happier and like,

08:55.600 --> 08:57.800
I've never been more miserable, more frustrated,

08:57.800 --> 09:00.320
more terrified, et cetera, et cetera.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.240
And I think that that speaks to the idea

09:02.240 --> 09:04.600
that there are a lot of values out there that

09:04.600 --> 09:07.240
make for a good life other than happiness

09:07.240 --> 09:10.600
and that the, you know, this fixation we have on just being

09:10.600 --> 09:12.840
happy, that's a very limited thing.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.440
It's, you know, was my life easier before I could?

09:15.440 --> 09:17.400
Absolutely, especially because I had a job.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.320
You know, I could write and work whenever I wanted,

09:19.320 --> 09:21.360
I could travel whenever, now I have kids.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.000
So when my life is bound to them and very limited,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.880
I have to put myself last all the time

09:25.880 --> 09:29.280
because they're my kids and I love them and I do it willingly.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.880
But that in terms of my personal happiness,

09:31.880 --> 09:33.760
life was way easier before I had them.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.360
And I think that, do they make my life more meaningful?

09:36.360 --> 09:37.440
Do they give me purpose?

09:37.440 --> 09:39.640
Do they, you know, I would never,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.760
have wanted to live without them, you know?

09:41.760 --> 09:44.200
But at the same time, in terms of like,

09:44.200 --> 09:46.480
personal happiness, no, you know,

09:46.480 --> 09:49.720
they feel a lot of frustration and anxiety there.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.760
I'm up at two a.m. worrying about, you know,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.280
not myself, them.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.480
So, you know, I think that, you know,

09:55.480 --> 09:57.760
and speaking to what you said before,

09:57.760 --> 10:00.640
about, you know, sort of the dangers of, you know,

10:00.640 --> 10:02.920
because happiness is reflective of your expectations

10:02.920 --> 10:04.480
and everything else, it is dangerous

10:04.480 --> 10:05.640
when you just focus on happiness

10:05.640 --> 10:07.080
because you can make people happier

10:07.080 --> 10:08.440
by just convincing them that they don't,

10:08.440 --> 10:11.040
they're perfectly fine with the life they have

10:11.040 --> 10:12.920
versus, you know, wanting more

10:12.920 --> 10:15.520
and risking being more unsatisfied with your life.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.840
And I think that's perfectly fine, you know,

10:17.840 --> 10:19.360
because there are these other values, you know,

10:19.360 --> 10:21.680
when you strive for something, when you work towards something,

10:21.680 --> 10:23.640
you're gonna be dissatisfied in the process

10:23.640 --> 10:26.120
and that's good, you know?

10:26.120 --> 10:29.440
Doesn't that suggest that perhaps you could take up

10:29.440 --> 10:32.200
a little bit more discussion of, you know,

10:32.200 --> 10:32.960
the, the, the, the, the, the,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.600
the, the, the, the, the, the, the judgment of,

10:34.600 --> 10:37.080
the value of the good in life

10:37.080 --> 10:38.440
and how that bears unhappiness

10:38.440 --> 10:40.040
because the way you're describing it,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.960
it's almost as if you could separate happiness

10:42.960 --> 10:45.120
from defining what the good is

10:45.120 --> 10:46.440
because as you're saying, well, there are,

10:46.440 --> 10:49.160
there are elements of having a child

10:49.160 --> 10:52.320
that pertains to a higher good.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.280
Do you derive happiness from that?

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
I think, yeah.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
I think, yeah.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.280
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.280
I mean, my view of, we just wrote a book on this topic too,

11:01.280 --> 11:05.280
so my view of what makes for a good life would be,

11:05.280 --> 11:07.280
happiness is a necessary component.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.280
I would definitely say that if you're not satisfied

11:10.280 --> 11:13.280
with your life, you're not having a good life.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.280
And I would say it's happiness achieved

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
in sort of morally acceptable ways

11:17.280 --> 11:19.280
where that sort of is a very personal choice

11:19.280 --> 11:20.280
about what that is.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.280
But I think that there are a lot of goods in life

11:23.280 --> 11:28.280
and philosophers love to, which we sort of rail against them,

11:28.280 --> 11:31.280
tell people what they ought to be doing,

11:31.280 --> 11:34.280
aesthetic, this, intellectual, that, and blah, blah, blah.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.280
Philosophy is always on that list.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.280
And we sort of reject all of those lists

11:38.280 --> 11:39.280
of what is the good life.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.280
And we sort of say, look, it's how you can find happiness

11:42.280 --> 11:46.280
with your life, but there are a lot of goods out there.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.280
There are a lot of, and you have to have a long-term approach

11:49.280 --> 11:53.280
to not just the sort of short-term, you know,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
I'm going to do what makes me feel good right now,

11:55.280 --> 11:57.280
but what is ultimately going to be good in the long-term.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.280
That, by the way, has a clear evolutionary advantage.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.280
So the major finding of this study,

12:02.280 --> 12:06.280
of mine that I mentioned, is agents, those simulated little agents

12:06.280 --> 12:12.280
that compete, those that have a longer window of memory looking back

12:12.280 --> 12:15.280
over which things are counted, like successes with any account,

12:15.280 --> 12:17.280
they do better on the evolutionary timescale.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.280
So we kind of have evolved, I guess,

12:19.280 --> 12:23.280
extrapolating to real agents like ourselves, in that sense,

12:23.280 --> 12:27.280
we have evolved to have, and this is actually well-known

12:27.280 --> 12:29.280
by psychologists who would discover the independently

12:29.280 --> 12:31.280
just by asking people different types of questions.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.280
You can ask them, are you happy just right now?

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
And also, what's your life evaluation?

12:36.280 --> 12:38.280
Those are the two classes of questions.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.280
So can we go back?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.280
So this is a good question.

12:42.280 --> 12:50.280
This is the arguments you were making are exactly the reason

12:50.280 --> 12:52.280
why economics don't like happiness.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.280
And they like a choice-based measure, right?

12:55.280 --> 12:59.280
Because the people who have kids and they want to have them,

12:59.280 --> 13:02.280
the people who don't have them and don't want to have them,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
the people who have them, they don't want them,

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
the people who don't when they want.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.280
Okay, so you look at these people and you rent them.

13:09.280 --> 13:12.280
You can see what they want, what they have and so on.

13:12.280 --> 13:19.280
So the word, and then call whatever they get in exchange

13:19.280 --> 13:23.280
for these choices that are, in some of these cases,

13:23.280 --> 13:25.280
are what they are chosen.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.280
They have a really choice in some cases.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.280
So what they get in exchange, we call it utility,

13:31.280 --> 13:33.280
but you can still call it happiness now.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.280
And this is a way of getting at the point without finding

13:37.280 --> 13:40.280
all these paradoxes of, you know,

13:40.280 --> 13:43.280
and really this is really the fundamental reason why

13:43.280 --> 13:46.280
economists tend to or at least classical economists,

13:46.280 --> 13:49.280
certain kind of economists, so however you want to characterize

13:49.280 --> 13:51.280
and don't like the concept.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.280
Now, the other way you can go, so one way is just,

13:54.280 --> 13:57.280
let's not define happiness and let's see what people do

13:57.280 --> 14:02.280
and wearing strange conditions, typically they do what they want

14:02.280 --> 14:03.280
to do, not all.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.280
So you have to be careful about that too, but, okay,

14:05.280 --> 14:07.280
you try and do that.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.280
The other way, of course, is going the way we're talking

14:12.280 --> 14:17.280
before, which is you try and get a little bit more into the

14:17.280 --> 14:19.280
details of what happiness means, because again,

14:19.280 --> 14:21.280
happiness is the way it's measured.

14:21.280 --> 14:25.280
So in many places, the GSS measures it with general questions

14:25.280 --> 14:28.280
of the sort, you know, how even taking stock of your life

14:28.280 --> 14:31.280
at this point, how happy do you think you are?

14:31.280 --> 14:36.280
Other people, other experiment asks questions where

14:36.280 --> 14:39.280
how happy are you right now, right this moment, right?

14:39.280 --> 14:43.280
So these are two very different constants of happiness

14:43.280 --> 14:45.280
and you can imagine many more.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.280
So not just in terms of time, you can imagine many more,

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
you can imagine asking the question in many different ways,

14:51.280 --> 14:54.280
you can imagine stressing various different aspects.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.280
And so at this point, so that's the sense in which then the question

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
becomes kind of meaningless, because if there are a million

14:59.280 --> 15:02.280
questions which are more or less correlated, we need

15:02.280 --> 15:03.280
theorizing behind it.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.280
So just all you need is factor analysis.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.280
And you ask a whole lot of questions or even give them an

15:08.280 --> 15:11.280
opportunity to get freely and then you use natural language

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
processing.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.280
You can try and do that.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.280
Or once again, you can have them choose, make choices,

15:16.280 --> 15:18.280
and you're going to have to do factor analysis.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.280
It doesn't always work.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.280
The choices are three in many aspects.

15:22.280 --> 15:28.280
So just to add another challenge to the way that we're talking

15:28.280 --> 15:33.280
about this, is happiness always self-evident or can someone

15:33.280 --> 15:37.280
not be aware that they're unhappy?

15:37.280 --> 15:38.280
Or happy?

15:38.280 --> 15:42.280
Yeah, I think this is a very big question.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.280
I don't know.

15:45.280 --> 15:50.280
There are certainly, so one issue certainly, so I don't,

15:50.280 --> 15:52.280
of course, I don't know how would I know.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.280
I'm trying to translate in terms of what we know in the

15:56.280 --> 15:58.280
happening, in the happiness literature.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.280
So I can go back to what we were saying before.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.280
One fundamental aspect of measures of happiness, realize

16:05.280 --> 16:10.280
measures of happiness, is expectations.

16:10.280 --> 16:15.280
So those are perhaps a little bit less conscious.

16:15.280 --> 16:20.280
So I think I should be very rich because whatever, and I'm not,

16:20.280 --> 16:25.280
and I don't really know why I'm answering that I'm not happy.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.280
So a lot of this is playing a big role.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.280
To me, so that's certainly a dimension where I don't know how

16:31.280 --> 16:35.280
conscious I am about my expectations.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.280
Some certainly I am conscious about.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.280
Maybe there are some that I'm not.

16:40.280 --> 16:44.280
And the impression is that all of this play a big role in the

16:44.280 --> 16:45.280
answering this question.

16:45.280 --> 16:50.280
So all this idea about people adapting to situations, they all

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
have to do with expectations.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.280
So at some point you're on a wheelchair, and you're not

16:55.280 --> 16:58.280
that unhappy anymore, your expectations obviously are not

16:58.280 --> 17:00.280
the place of current somehow.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.280
Or to do it.

17:02.280 --> 17:07.280
And somehow this, at the moment where you go on a wheelchair,

17:07.280 --> 17:11.280
your happiness drops to a bit more levels, and then you go back.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.280
So this is the fact of us.

17:13.280 --> 17:14.280
And how conscious is that?

17:14.280 --> 17:18.280
I don't know how much there's actually a rationalization

17:18.280 --> 17:19.280
exposed.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.280
I'm sure if you ask people why are you happy, they'll tell you,

17:21.280 --> 17:24.280
yes, I was running before, but they discover that happiness,

17:24.280 --> 17:25.280
it's only a sign.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.280
It's only my mind.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.280
That's perfectly possible.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.280
I may weigh in on this.

17:32.280 --> 17:35.280
One of my other lines of research is consciousness,

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
computational phenomenology.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.280
I think in phenomenology or consciousness research, the first

17:41.280 --> 17:45.280
rule is that you have to take the conscious, report the face

17:45.280 --> 17:46.280
value.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.280
Because think of someone seeing red or not seeing red when

17:50.280 --> 17:54.280
looking at a picture that's obviously red.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.280
But they don't see red.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
You can't tell them, no, no.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.280
You see red.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.280
You just don't realize that that just doesn't work in conscious

18:00.280 --> 18:01.280
research.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.280
It cannot work in any field in which you want to quantify or study

18:04.280 --> 18:05.280
human feelings.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.280
Because you as the perceiver and experiencer are the ultimate

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
and only authority in what you feel.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.280
Right?

18:12.280 --> 18:14.280
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.280
I give the first person authority.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.280
I remember it.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.280
My dissertation defense, somebody was like, well, what about

18:21.280 --> 18:22.280
self-deception?

18:22.280 --> 18:24.280
Well, you know, and I didn't have a good answer.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.280
I still don't have a great answer.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.280
I tried to read a bit of that literature and it was just, I

18:29.280 --> 18:31.280
didn't really get anywhere.

18:31.280 --> 18:35.280
But I would just simply say that I think you don't always know

18:35.280 --> 18:37.280
going back to what you were saying.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.280
I don't know that everybody can enumerate what factors are

18:40.280 --> 18:44.280
bothering them or contributing or detracting from happiness.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.280
With a bit of thought, I think you can get there.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.280
But I don't know that everybody, but I do think that when you ask

18:49.280 --> 18:51.280
people, how's it going right now?

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
How satisfied are you?

18:52.280 --> 18:55.280
They can give you an answer and then sort of backtrack and

18:55.280 --> 18:57.280
figure out why that answer is what it is.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.280
And then the more you think about it, you might find, yeah,

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
I'm not that satisfied actually.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.280
You know, my job isn't going that well.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.280
I got passed up for promotion or whatever.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.280
But I do think that people do have a sense of how their lives

19:09.280 --> 19:10.280
are going.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.280
And some people are very sort of self-aware and they're

19:13.280 --> 19:15.280
constantly doing these analyses of, I mean, I'm one of those

19:15.280 --> 19:18.280
people, what's right, what's wrong, what do I need to fix?

19:18.280 --> 19:21.280
Other people I think are just kind of more, you know,

19:21.280 --> 19:22.280
things are fine.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
It's going well.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.280
But I give the first person authority there.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.280
I think that nobody can tell you that you're not happy because

19:29.280 --> 19:31.280
they don't think your life is matching up to what they expect

19:31.280 --> 19:34.280
from you or the reverse that, you know, you should be happy

19:34.280 --> 19:35.280
because your life is so great.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.280
If you're not feeling it, then clearly something that you

19:37.280 --> 19:42.280
either expect or want or, you know, is not working out for you.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.280
Can we ask a question?

19:43.280 --> 19:44.280
Sure.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.280
So do a lot of scientists measure non-conscious activity in

19:48.280 --> 19:49.280
any way?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.280
So the question here was, what's it?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
You do, right?

19:52.280 --> 19:53.280
Yeah.

19:53.280 --> 19:59.280
So why are we saying that, why are we saying that, you know,

19:59.280 --> 20:04.280
I understand one issue is the one of paternalism, you know,

20:04.280 --> 20:10.280
but can I measure the fact that, can she measure the fact that

20:10.280 --> 20:13.280
I don't see that thing read, I guess, in a certain way?

20:13.280 --> 20:15.280
There are such things you can do, right?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.280
The concept of happiness that becomes difficult.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
No, no, no, I understand.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
I understand.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.280
But yeah, I mean, the answer to your questions.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.280
Yes.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.280
Okay.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
Wow.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.280
Wow.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.280
How do you...

20:27.280 --> 20:28.280
Yes.

20:28.280 --> 20:29.280
Yes.

20:29.280 --> 20:35.280
Because there are very specific studies in both psychology

20:35.280 --> 20:39.280
and neuroscience that show that you can see.

20:39.280 --> 20:45.280
You can measure, for example, parts of the brain are responding

20:45.280 --> 20:49.280
correctly, even when the person does not respond

20:49.280 --> 20:51.280
behaviorally correctly.

20:51.280 --> 20:54.280
You calibrate an instrument.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.280
And you always have to do it by triangulation.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.280
You know, this is wonderful simile in Willard, the Norman

21:00.280 --> 21:05.280
Klein's theory of science, about science being like a donkey

21:05.280 --> 21:09.280
skin on a drum, you know, you make it taught so you can play the

21:09.280 --> 21:10.280
drum.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.280
And the places where the skin is fixed to the hoop are the

21:13.280 --> 21:15.280
experimental data.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.280
But science also tells you what's happening in between

21:18.280 --> 21:20.280
by interpolating.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.280
And in regard to subconscious things, you have to go by that

21:23.280 --> 21:24.280
route.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.280
I mean, we can't just put your finger literally or metaphorically

21:27.280 --> 21:28.280
on it.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.280
So it always takes...

21:29.280 --> 21:31.280
You have to involve neuroscientists and computational

21:31.280 --> 21:34.280
scientists who do the analysis of the data and brain

21:34.280 --> 21:36.280
scientists and what not psychologists.

21:36.280 --> 21:37.280
It's always a collective effort.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.280
That's science.

21:38.280 --> 21:44.280
I wanted to go back to this issue of stress and anxiety

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
and happiness.

21:45.280 --> 21:49.280
Obviously, happiness is a different feeling from, let's say,

21:49.280 --> 21:50.280
anxiety.

21:50.280 --> 21:54.280
But is it possible to be happy if you are under stress or you

21:54.280 --> 21:56.280
have a lot of anxiety?

21:56.280 --> 21:59.280
Well, I think it's obviously an empirical question.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.280
I guess I would say yes, but you are easier to be happy without

22:03.280 --> 22:05.280
stress and anxiety.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.280
Because it seems to me many of the things you were talking about

22:08.280 --> 22:12.280
economically have to do with things that diminish people's

22:12.280 --> 22:13.280
stress.

22:13.280 --> 22:18.280
So that would imply, and I think what Wendy is saying in terms of

22:18.280 --> 22:25.280
her work with exercise is that exercise decreases stress and

22:25.280 --> 22:28.280
therefore can contribute to happiness.

22:28.280 --> 22:32.280
Well, to some way, well, for income to be

22:32.280 --> 22:33.280
diminished stress.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
In terms of security.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
Yeah.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.280
So in that sense, yes.

22:38.280 --> 22:43.280
But the question, can you say that somebody who is very

22:43.280 --> 22:49.280
anxious is happy, it's difficult to define because happiness here

22:49.280 --> 22:51.280
still is a relative concept.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.280
So what does it mean happy?

22:53.280 --> 22:57.280
If you are saying, can, so if you reformulate the question

22:57.280 --> 23:01.280
saying, can somebody weed that specific level or that you just

23:01.280 --> 23:05.280
level of anxiety, can be happy five?

23:05.280 --> 23:06.280
I don't know.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.280
We can go and measure.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.280
I'm sure there are some people.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.280
You shouldn't say, but it can be happy unfortunately the

23:11.280 --> 23:15.280
literature can't be defined because we just define them.

23:15.280 --> 23:19.280
We just measure in a scale from one to five or one to ten or

23:19.280 --> 23:21.280
whoever we measure it.

23:21.280 --> 23:26.280
So unless you define a cutoff, it's very hard to say, can somebody

23:26.280 --> 23:31.280
receive this problem, psychological problem be happy?

23:31.280 --> 23:36.280
So I had a comment and a question on your initial kind of

23:36.280 --> 23:39.280
concern about how do we talk about happiness.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.280
One of the things that makes me happy is that the research that

23:43.280 --> 23:49.280
I do on exercise and meditation is helping to define things that

23:49.280 --> 23:53.280
increase people's mood, that protects their brain from

23:53.280 --> 23:57.280
degenerative damage of stress.

23:57.280 --> 24:04.280
And yes, it puts mood up and that's one measure of happiness.

24:04.280 --> 24:11.280
But you express some discontent with studies that have been

24:11.280 --> 24:17.280
done and what should we be doing more to what can we do more to

24:17.280 --> 24:23.280
help these numbers in the United States go up of happiness?

24:23.280 --> 24:28.280
To some terms of both of those questions, you pose the

24:28.280 --> 24:30.280
question, how do we make people happier?

24:30.280 --> 24:33.280
The research that I've done, which isn't paid for by anybody

24:33.280 --> 24:36.280
except the University of Notre Dame, it can give you very

24:36.280 --> 24:39.280
clear prescriptions on how to make, I've mentioned them

24:39.280 --> 24:40.280
already.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.280
We want to make our country or the world a happier place and do

24:43.280 --> 24:45.280
it in a broad systematic way.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.280
We can't, it's hard to make people exercise, it's hard to

24:48.280 --> 24:51.280
make people meditate or keep gratitude journals, right?

24:51.280 --> 24:53.280
We probably want to legislate those things.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.280
We can legislate a higher minimum wage, we can legislate

24:56.280 --> 24:59.280
getting rid of right to work laws, we can have a more

24:59.280 --> 25:02.280
generous welfare state, we can do all kinds of things which would

25:02.280 --> 25:04.280
move the United States at least towards Denmark.

25:04.280 --> 25:08.280
The right to work law, this expression became tainted because

25:08.280 --> 25:11.280
of course now it's associated with union busting and that

25:11.280 --> 25:15.280
statistic just out which shows that in states with those so-called

25:15.280 --> 25:18.280
right to work laws, the average income is much lower

25:18.280 --> 25:19.280
significantly.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.280
And so it's happiness.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.280
Exactly.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.280
Yeah.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
So.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.280
I would still be worried about the causal argument, if you

25:26.280 --> 25:28.280
think I may say.

25:28.280 --> 25:32.280
So these are correlations, there are so many things moving

25:32.280 --> 25:33.280
at home.

25:33.280 --> 25:37.280
There are causal studies, there are studies on giving cash donations

25:37.280 --> 25:40.280
to people in the so-called third world.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.280
So these are small things of course.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.280
Johannes Halswofer, there are serious states.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.280
I have no doubt about the cash transfers, that's a very

25:49.280 --> 25:53.280
different issue from social security which I'm all in

25:53.280 --> 25:54.280
favor of.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.280
It's a whole different story.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.280
There are amount of things that move with social security,

25:58.280 --> 26:00.280
the understanding, so it's huge.

26:00.280 --> 26:06.280
So one thing is to give cash to kids and all sorts of things

26:06.280 --> 26:09.280
increase, happiness increase, the drinking of the father

26:09.280 --> 26:13.280
increase, by the way typically in those studies the father is

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
not the mother's.

26:14.280 --> 26:18.280
You keep it to the mother's because the father's drinking.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.280
And they're happy, of sure by the way.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.280
So I'm not saying that I don't buy.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.280
How long are you going to start?

26:27.280 --> 26:37.280
Completely in favor, I would just, you know, as a academic stress

26:37.280 --> 26:41.280
aspect, that it's very easy to do the causal arguments here

26:41.280 --> 26:44.280
in particular because they make sense, in particular because

26:44.280 --> 26:47.280
we all tend, many of us tend to think that, you know,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.280
social security is a good thing.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.280
We can imagine easily how we'd be happier in a place with more

26:53.280 --> 26:55.280
security in a place with less security.

26:55.280 --> 27:00.280
We don't always account for the costs of these issues in our

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
argument.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.280
So the point I'm trying to make is it's easy to do this.

27:05.280 --> 27:09.280
The same argument says make sure that nobody has kids.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.280
I'm not sure you want to do that.

27:11.280 --> 27:14.280
The causal argument, no, I did the kid's argument.

27:14.280 --> 27:18.280
I did the example before exactly because of this because the

27:18.280 --> 27:23.280
causal argument is difficult now.

27:23.280 --> 27:28.280
No, you actually get very close to hearing at least that the wrong

27:28.280 --> 27:30.280
people shouldn't have kids.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.280
We are this close to hearing that on the national TV.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.280
So don't put that up as a joke because it's not a joking matter

27:36.280 --> 27:37.280
anymore.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.280
It used to be a joking matter maybe 30 years ago.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.280
It's not a joking matter.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.280
Right, I'm not sure.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.280
But in any case, that's obviously not the sense in which I meant it.

27:44.280 --> 27:52.280
It's an example about not using causal arguments when you don't

27:52.280 --> 27:58.280
have causal studies, especially in situations of this sort where

27:58.280 --> 28:04.280
people are not able to do that.

28:04.280 --> 28:09.280
At least between outside of the people you have in mind now,

28:09.280 --> 28:13.280
at least between reasonable people, we all tend to be on the same

28:13.280 --> 28:16.280
side, which is all social security.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.280
So that's just what I'm saying.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.280
Just a word of caution.

28:20.280 --> 28:27.280
There is no neuroscientific way of measuring that.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.280
I wish I was.

28:28.280 --> 28:33.280
But you know, MRI studies are happy people versus not.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.280
Well, you know, people have approached it.

28:35.280 --> 28:40.280
There are the studies of people that have couples that are in

28:40.280 --> 28:41.280
deep love.

28:41.280 --> 28:45.280
They just fell in love with what's happening to their brain.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.280
But that just shows all the reward centers get activated.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.280
Your motivational centers get activated.

28:50.280 --> 28:55.280
That doesn't help you define happiness itself.

28:55.280 --> 28:58.280
So we're still at the same point we were at the beginning here.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
How do you define happiness?

28:59.280 --> 29:04.280
Coming back to the point you raised with the sort of

29:04.280 --> 29:07.280
tangentially, would we want anybody else to be able to tell us

29:07.280 --> 29:09.280
whether we're happy or not?

29:09.280 --> 29:12.280
I think we're all in agreement quite that, right?

29:12.280 --> 29:15.280
So we would want to resist some kind of external standard.

29:15.280 --> 29:21.280
I think I was getting at something a little different from that.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.280
Let me give you a composite clinical example.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.280
A psychoanalytically speaking.

29:26.280 --> 29:31.280
A wife insists that her husband come for a consultation because

29:31.280 --> 29:33.280
she thinks he's unhappy.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.280
So this may be a maternalistic attitude here.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.280
And he comes in and he says, I'm perfectly happy.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.280
I don't have any problems.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.280
And over the course of the consultations, he's complaining

29:44.280 --> 29:46.280
about this, he's complaining about that.

29:46.280 --> 29:51.280
And he doesn't connect it with any sense that he's unhappy.

29:51.280 --> 29:56.280
The consultation continues and you discover something about a

29:56.280 --> 30:01.280
parent who was chronically depressed and unhappy all the time.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.280
The wife's pain?

30:03.280 --> 30:05.280
No, the pay...

30:05.280 --> 30:07.280
That's right.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.280
Obviously that...

30:09.280 --> 30:10.280
That was good.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.280
They also...

30:11.280 --> 30:16.280
So, you know, the question was, was there something that didn't allow

30:16.280 --> 30:20.280
this man to recognize how unhappy he was that it was such a dangerous

30:20.280 --> 30:23.280
identification with an impaired parent?

30:23.280 --> 30:27.280
So, it's not about things like a red shirt because, you know, for most

30:27.280 --> 30:30.280
people, a red shirt is not a conflictual issue.

30:30.280 --> 30:35.280
But when something is more deeply conflictual, what can you say

30:35.280 --> 30:40.280
about the degree of veracity of someone's self-report?

30:40.280 --> 30:42.280
I mean, I don't have the answers to that, but I think it's something

30:42.280 --> 30:43.280
worth thinking about.

30:43.280 --> 30:47.280
That's exactly how I reacted to the imagining of no question

30:47.280 --> 30:51.280
of state in neuroscience, because, I mean, of course, there are other

30:51.280 --> 30:55.280
methods you can go with psychoanalysis, but the whole point is

30:55.280 --> 30:57.280
exactly this, which is...

30:57.280 --> 31:00.280
It doesn't seem so obvious to me that the only thing you can look at

31:00.280 --> 31:03.280
are the conscious states, that the only thing you should measure is

31:03.280 --> 31:06.280
how happy people to tell you they are, because there's all sorts of

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
other things.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.280
People might hide it, might...

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
Exactly.

31:10.280 --> 31:16.280
So, it'd be, in general, important to try and, you know, again,

31:16.280 --> 31:22.280
this goes back to theorizing, trying to understand various

31:22.280 --> 31:26.280
aspects of, you know, components, theoretically, components of

31:26.280 --> 31:31.280
happiness, so that you can hopefully try and measure them,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
measure them separately, right?

31:33.280 --> 31:34.280
So...

31:34.280 --> 31:38.280
But I think what you're raising to just speaks to limitations of

31:38.280 --> 31:41.280
polling people using that as the only measure, and you obviously

31:41.280 --> 31:44.280
want to check that against some of the more objective measures that

31:44.280 --> 31:47.280
are out there to see if, you know, people are reporting that they're so

31:47.280 --> 31:50.280
happy, but their suicide rates are, you know, drastically increasing,

31:50.280 --> 31:53.280
or, you know, because there is this sort of cross-cultural problems

31:53.280 --> 31:54.280
with this, too, right?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.280
That Western countries, where we fix it on happiness, we're very good at

31:57.280 --> 32:00.280
reporting it, and we're constantly trying to brag about how happy we are.

32:00.280 --> 32:04.280
Eastern countries where the suicide rates are lower, but they don't

32:04.280 --> 32:06.280
have this fixation on individual happiness.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.280
Just kind of here, because there's no...

32:08.280 --> 32:12.280
You can define the suicide rate with the gutless single person, right?

32:12.280 --> 32:14.280
So...

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
Yeah.

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
There's a bit of the...

32:16.280 --> 32:19.280
But in other countries where they report happiness levels much lower.

32:19.280 --> 32:22.280
That's exactly the issue with the aggregation, right?

32:22.280 --> 32:23.280
Right.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.280
And with regard to seeing red or not, or to being happy or not,

32:26.280 --> 32:29.280
I think the level of his question was a single person,

32:29.280 --> 32:33.280
what the person feels, not what the aggregate of our country is, right?

32:33.280 --> 32:34.280
It sounds too...

32:34.280 --> 32:37.280
But I think the same limitation applies, whether it's on a large level or a

32:37.280 --> 32:38.280
small level.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.280
The question is how much should we take people's word at happiness,

32:41.280 --> 32:44.280
and if you were taught by your mother or your country that your

32:44.280 --> 32:48.280
happiness doesn't matter, or that you should be so happy and you are so happy

32:48.280 --> 32:51.280
and your life is so great, obviously that's going to be reflected in your

32:51.280 --> 32:52.280
self-report.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.280
Right.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.280
And that's again why there's a limit to...

32:56.280 --> 32:59.280
I mean, we theorize in philosophy about this stuff, but there's a limit to the

32:59.280 --> 33:03.280
social scientific data, how good it is and which is why economists hate this

33:03.280 --> 33:04.280
stuff.

33:04.280 --> 33:06.280
Makes sense, because it is sort of all over the place.

33:06.280 --> 33:09.280
And some of these psychological studies are not well done and not...

33:09.280 --> 33:12.280
That's why it has to be cross-disciplinary effort.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.280
That's the neuroscientist, psychologist, computer scientist,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.280
political scientist, psychoanalysts.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.280
So we have...

33:20.280 --> 33:24.280
Everyone at this table with me is exactly yes.

33:24.280 --> 33:29.280
You want to go to the question?

33:29.280 --> 33:38.280
Please line up and state your name and come on up to the microphone here,

33:38.280 --> 33:44.280
line up and please keep your statements in the form of a question.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.280
Thank you.

33:45.280 --> 33:51.280
Hi, my name is Catherine.

33:51.280 --> 33:57.280
Can more be said about the happiness of women in the 50s?

33:57.280 --> 34:06.280
And does it conflict with the idea that children are not a source of happiness?

34:06.280 --> 34:11.280
Some total of what I know is that there's a general pattern.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.280
A bunch of articles recently asking the question, why is the happiness advantage

34:16.280 --> 34:17.280
of women disappearing?

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
So you see all kinds of data over time.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.280
In the 80s, women were clearly happier than men now on average.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.280
It's just a little bit happier.

34:24.280 --> 34:27.280
Why that is, I don't know, I'll leave that to someone else.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.280
But that's the basic trend, which I think everybody agrees on.

34:30.280 --> 34:34.280
I think my understanding of some of it, and it speaks to...

34:34.280 --> 34:37.280
I mean, in the 80s, our wage differential was even greater.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
Now we're making...

34:38.280 --> 34:42.280
I mean, we're still 70 or 80 cents to the man, but it's clearly better.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.280
So a lot of the trends for women in the object of men are clearly better.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.280
Men are doing more in the house.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.280
Men are helping out more.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.280
Why are we getting less happy?

34:50.280 --> 34:55.280
And I think some of the data I've seen is, again, it's partly expectations that girls today grow up.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.280
Being told, you can do whatever you want.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.280
You're equal to men.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.280
Yet we still don't make the same money.

35:00.280 --> 35:03.280
And clearly, there are so many signs that it's not that way.

35:03.280 --> 35:08.280
And then I think the other problem that keeps women back and doesn't keep men back

35:08.280 --> 35:12.280
is the whole managing of work, life, and more women work now.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.280
And the fact that you have to balance these two things,

35:14.280 --> 35:17.280
and American corporations do nothing to help us, we're very little.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.280
I mean, some do some things, but it's not enough.

35:21.280 --> 35:25.280
And I think that women feel the stress much more than men, even men who are about.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.280
And I think women still...

35:27.280 --> 35:29.280
The studies that I've seen, again, women still do more in the house,

35:29.280 --> 35:31.280
even though we all do much less overall.

35:31.280 --> 35:35.280
Women still do more for the kids, even though men contribute more.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.280
And so I think that all of that affects our happiness.

35:38.280 --> 35:43.280
Are there any studies being done on present day full-time homemakers,

35:43.280 --> 35:45.280
women having children alone?

35:48.280 --> 35:50.280
Probably, aren't they?

35:50.280 --> 35:51.280
I'm not familiar with it.

35:51.280 --> 35:55.280
I don't know that it is specific, but women are happier.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.280
Still, a little bit happier than men.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.280
I mean, they were very happy.

36:01.280 --> 36:06.280
They're still happier than men on it.

36:06.280 --> 36:12.280
No, I think there's a lot of people...

36:12.280 --> 36:18.280
Of course, one of the reasons why this kind of literature is a problem

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
is that you tend to give the explanations that you like,

36:20.280 --> 36:22.280
and you tend to go for course issues that you like.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.280
So a very right-wing person would say women should be in the house,

36:26.280 --> 36:29.280
they were in the house and they were happy.

36:29.280 --> 36:37.280
I'm a very reasonable person, would say women thought they had to be in the house,

36:37.280 --> 36:40.280
and so they were very happy because they had reached whatever.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.280
They had told them it was their potential.

36:43.280 --> 36:51.280
While now, of course, women have much more ambitious goals,

36:51.280 --> 36:55.280
and it's true that they are taken back by society from achieving these goals.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.280
So then, of course, then disconnect.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.280
But very hard to...

37:01.280 --> 37:05.280
How would children's happiness be infected by this?

37:05.280 --> 37:09.280
Are there changes, like a mother's happiness?

37:09.280 --> 37:11.280
I don't know if anybody knows.

37:11.280 --> 37:17.280
I've never seen any study correlating the happiness of mothers or fathers with the kids.

37:17.280 --> 37:23.280
That is actually a very good point that I hope somebody is done,

37:23.280 --> 37:25.280
but I don't know what they're doing.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.280
Thank you.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.280
I'm sorry, on that point, I don't know any specific studies either,

37:28.280 --> 37:31.280
but there is a lot of work done on network analysis

37:31.280 --> 37:36.280
where you can connect my happiness to the people that I know and the people that they know.

37:36.280 --> 37:41.280
So you can find out that the example in the article was that your happiness will go down

37:41.280 --> 37:44.280
if you have a friend who has a friend who's unhappy.

37:44.280 --> 37:49.280
So I imagine the relationships between children and mothers and other people are quite strong.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.280
Great, thank you.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.280
My name is Sharon.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.280
Happiness is a choice.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.280
It actually can be a learned skill.

38:00.280 --> 38:05.280
What can be done to help teach people how they can be happy?

38:05.280 --> 38:09.280
For instance, everyone here is a victim of all sorts of horrible things,

38:09.280 --> 38:13.280
and everyone here is also in the recipient of some very nice things

38:13.280 --> 38:17.280
where you choose to put your focus, determines how happy it will be.

38:17.280 --> 38:22.280
I think a lot of people can learn the skill of happiness,

38:22.280 --> 38:25.280
and I think it also is very much tied to gratitude.

38:25.280 --> 38:36.280
Is there any effort to teach people who are unhappy that they can be happier?

38:36.280 --> 38:38.280
At a general level?

38:38.280 --> 38:39.280
In a general level?

38:39.280 --> 38:40.280
I think the answer is no.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.280
I totally agree with you.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.280
I think it is a large part of choice

38:44.280 --> 38:48.280
and how you view all the great things that have come

38:48.280 --> 38:50.280
versus all the difficult things that have come

38:50.280 --> 38:54.280
really helps define how you are dealing with your life stress.

38:54.280 --> 39:02.280
I think that it would be great if we added this component to education.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.280
It's not a radical view.

39:04.280 --> 39:07.280
It's a way of looking at the world, and I agree with you.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.280
I think it would be better.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.280
But is it done?

39:09.280 --> 39:10.280
No.

39:10.280 --> 39:14.280
I think it's a very important answer that you are giving with the proportion of variance,

39:14.280 --> 39:18.280
explained by personal traits versus choice traits.

39:18.280 --> 39:22.280
I think we only have in our control maybe 10% of the variance.

39:22.280 --> 39:27.280
With regard to being or not being happy, so to a large part, like I would say,

39:27.280 --> 39:32.280
90% you are incorrect in your assumption that it's all up to us.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.280
Who is us?

39:33.280 --> 39:35.280
You are your physical body.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.280
What you are is your physical body.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.280
The level of hormones circulating in your blood right now

39:42.280 --> 39:45.280
determined to a certain extent your perception.

39:45.280 --> 39:49.280
The working of your brain cells determined to a certain extent your perception.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.280
Nobody is there apart from your body.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.280
But you can't.

39:53.280 --> 40:03.280
Once we realize that, once we realize that, we will get to a place where we should be able to devise better interventions.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.280
As opposed to coasting on this wave of imagined freedom,

40:07.280 --> 40:11.280
we are not free to the extent that you are assuming.

40:11.280 --> 40:19.280
But the studies of mindset and psychology have shown how strongly our ideas about how we view the world,

40:19.280 --> 40:26.280
how we view what we've eaten or how much exercise the placebo effect really affect our physiology.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.280
It's the mind, body connection.

40:28.280 --> 40:32.280
So I think that's how I interpret your question and that's how I answered in terms of yes,

40:32.280 --> 40:42.280
there's growing evidence that there is a strong link and if we can influence mindset in the way that psychology studies have been done,

40:42.280 --> 40:51.280
then we do have a very powerful way to be able to help people deal with unhappiness to get towards more happiness.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.280
That's my question.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.280
Can I have a quick point?

40:54.280 --> 40:57.280
There's this whole field of positive psychology that takes up exactly what you're saying.

40:57.280 --> 41:02.280
Train yourself to be happy regardless of the circumstances of your life.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.280
Obviously that's a good thing to do. You mentioned gratitude.

41:04.280 --> 41:10.280
There's all kinds of evidence that keeping gratitude, journals and focusing on gratitude, all that stuff really does make people happier.

41:10.280 --> 41:16.280
So you can find lots of self-help books on doing that which are not complete psychobabble.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.280
But I think the main point comes back to where does happiness ultimately come from?

41:20.280 --> 41:24.280
Some scholars want to think that it's purely an internal mental process and the way you are describing,

41:24.280 --> 41:27.280
that you can make yourself happy if you just know how to or try.

41:27.280 --> 41:32.280
But I think most of us think that happiness is primarily due to things that happen to you

41:32.280 --> 41:36.280
and the circumstances of your life which are beyond your control.

41:36.280 --> 41:39.280
If you live in Aleppo, you're not going to be very happy.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.280
If you're a quadriplegic, you're not going to be very happy.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.280
If you're poor in the United States, you're not going to be very happy.

41:44.280 --> 41:48.280
And I think that those people can also learn to be happy.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.280
To some point, I agree.

41:50.280 --> 41:55.280
I acknowledge biochemical issues that do happen for some people.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.280
But yes, I...

41:57.280 --> 42:00.280
It's a good question.

42:00.280 --> 42:08.280
Hi. My question is about how your view on happiness change through the spiritual lens.

42:08.280 --> 42:13.280
For instance, you talk about happiness as relative to other people, as transient.

42:13.280 --> 42:17.280
Today you have a house. Tomorrow your neighbor has a bigger house so your happiness is gone.

42:17.280 --> 42:23.280
I doubt that will stay when you study about happiness amongst the monks, about amongst the priest.

42:23.280 --> 42:28.280
There must be something changed when you look at happiness through the spiritual lens.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.280
So we'd love to hear what you're thinking about that.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.280
Are you just people out happy?

42:33.280 --> 42:36.280
That's just everywhere.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.280
So what can we learn about happiness?

42:38.280 --> 42:40.280
I don't know. I would...

42:40.280 --> 42:41.280
I would think it's not.

42:41.280 --> 42:44.280
I would go back to the kids again. I'm not sure.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.280
No, I wouldn't go back to the kids.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.280
But they're just people that are happy.

42:47.280 --> 42:55.280
I would go back to mindset that the monks and spiritual people have a particular mindset that I don't care whether I have a big house.

42:55.280 --> 43:02.280
I have a belief in something that is beautiful and that helps me get through whatever comes.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.280
I think that is mindset when psychologists are starting to suffer.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.280
Why they call it the Opium for the masses.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
What?

43:08.280 --> 43:10.280
That's why they call it the Opium for the masses.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.280
That's right. That's right.

43:11.280 --> 43:13.280
And there's definitely truth to that.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.280
People on Opium are happier too.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.280
I'm not joking.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.280
Actually, it's obvious to me too.

43:20.280 --> 43:27.280
So the view that happiness is relative and that happiness is transient.

43:27.280 --> 43:32.280
It's only true in the practical lens when you apply the spiritual lens.

43:32.280 --> 43:37.280
Those criteria are attributes are not applied.

43:37.280 --> 43:41.280
But you can't eat spiritualism or you can't eat faith.

43:41.280 --> 43:47.280
Most of us are going to have our lives determined by the extent to which our needs as human animals are met.

43:47.280 --> 43:54.280
And monks may be very commendable and great role models, precisely because they can get past that.

43:54.280 --> 43:58.280
But 99.99% of people will never be monks.

43:58.280 --> 44:01.280
So I admire what you're saying and agree with you.

44:01.280 --> 44:07.280
But I think as a political scientist, I think how to help the world, making us all monks is infeasible.

44:07.280 --> 44:19.280
There is a sense in which you can think of the question a different way, which is we typically think again in terms of linear regressions where you take somebody whose religious are the things equally happier.

44:19.280 --> 44:24.280
But then between religious people, the rich guys are happier than the poor guy, he would say the equation.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.280
Now, if that's not the case, if there are nonlinearities there, I don't know that people have looked at that.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.280
But that's kind of interesting.

44:31.280 --> 44:43.280
What she's saying is that if you are religious, how much condition of the fact that you're a region, the wealth or income or other variables enter less strongly.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.280
And that might be true. I actually don't know that that's true.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.280
Yeah.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.280
Thank you.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.280
Hi.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.280
Hello.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.280
My name is Yolanda Merchant.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.280
I'm an artist.

44:55.280 --> 45:00.280
And I'm going to somewhat pierce your bubble altogether.

45:00.280 --> 45:08.280
Because according to the Dalai Lama, we are born with a disposition.

45:08.280 --> 45:22.280
And like fish, we're born either with a, I would use the word happy or content disposition or a miserable disposition.

45:22.280 --> 45:34.280
And the way that he reflects on that is someone who goes to a terrible tragedy with a more positive disposition,

45:34.280 --> 45:40.280
reverts back to that fairly quickly, even though it could be jail time.

45:40.280 --> 45:47.280
You know, I don't know if he talks about the Holocaust, but something quite devastating.

45:47.280 --> 45:57.280
So I guess my question is, you know, if that's a given that we have a certain mindset, we have very little control over that.

45:57.280 --> 46:04.280
Although I agree with, you know, meditation and prayer and other ways to bring peace and calm.

46:04.280 --> 46:16.280
My second reflection on what you're talking about is with regard to the wife that thinks her husband is unhappy or they're all these circumstances.

46:16.280 --> 46:22.280
That would, you know, reflect that he should be a very unhappy person.

46:22.280 --> 46:26.280
I guess reverting back to the philosophy of meditation.

46:26.280 --> 46:35.280
If you live in the moment, if you wake up and you're happy in your being because you're having a nice coffee, you know, happens to be a pleasant day.

46:35.280 --> 46:37.280
You happen to live in New York City.

46:37.280 --> 46:51.280
You know, that's where you are at that moment. And reflecting on it is, you know, you may feel well within your body and within yourself.

46:51.280 --> 46:57.280
To have other people impose or project, you know, you should be a millionaire.

46:57.280 --> 47:03.280
You, you know, should be traveling to whatever Venice.

47:03.280 --> 47:11.280
Those are other people imposing their reality or as people who meditate, you know, say that's projecting.

47:11.280 --> 47:15.280
So you're not really being in the moment. You're absorbing the moment.

47:15.280 --> 47:25.280
So to my popping the bubble and also to other people imposing their definition of content or happiness.

47:25.280 --> 47:31.280
I thought we all agreed that that's the one thing we all agreed about that we shouldn't do.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.280
What was that? I'm sorry.

47:33.280 --> 47:43.280
I'm sorry. At one point in the conversation, I asked everyone to agree that the one thing we all agreed about was that we shouldn't be imposing our idea of happiness on other people.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.280
That there's no external standard by which to judge happiness.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.280
Right.

47:48.280 --> 47:55.280
Just two points about what you said. And I could correct me if I'm wrong, but I think New Yorkers of the moment, the least happiest in the nation.

47:55.280 --> 48:01.280
I think we're like 49 out of 50 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with the bottom three typically.

48:01.280 --> 48:05.280
So we're actually less happy here than everywhere else in the country.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.280
I don't know. It changes.

48:07.280 --> 48:12.280
So we, I think we only beat New Jersey actually. I think Connecticut beats us.

48:12.280 --> 48:19.280
And to your point about, again, my understanding is that we have this polyana complex.

48:19.280 --> 48:25.280
So we typically as a whole actually see our lives as better than they are. And all of this sort of biases we have.

48:25.280 --> 48:30.280
We view ourselves as better, smarter, better drivers than in reality we actually are.

48:30.280 --> 48:37.280
So most, it's hardwired in. It's not something that, you know, so most people have a disposition to be optimistic, not pessimistic,

48:37.280 --> 48:40.280
contrary to what they may say or what you may think. It's not the case.

48:40.280 --> 48:44.280
We're actually as a whole are fairly resilient, very resilient actually.

48:44.280 --> 48:50.280
We recover very nicely from a lot of, you know, things and adversities and whatnot.

48:50.280 --> 48:56.280
And we actually are optimistic about things more so than.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.280
Any feedback on the Dalai Lama?

48:58.280 --> 49:03.280
Yeah, he's wrong. I'm very sorry, but he's just wrong.

49:03.280 --> 49:11.280
It's not true. It's not true that, so let me,

49:11.280 --> 49:15.280
let me be a little bit clear on what I meant.

49:15.280 --> 49:22.280
So I think it's correct that there are individual effects so that, you know, I might be on average.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.280
Other things equal, less happy than you are.

49:26.280 --> 49:30.280
If that's the statement that I'm sure it's correct.

49:30.280 --> 49:37.280
It is not correct that I will stay at this level more or less along my life independent on what happens.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.280
That's not correct.

49:39.280 --> 49:48.280
So I might always be, I might be incredibly richer than she is, but, and always less happy because I have a disposition to be less happy.

49:48.280 --> 49:54.280
That's okay, but be much happier than I would be not being rich or not being, or being stressed or anything.

49:54.280 --> 49:58.280
Of course psychological research, tons of psychological research on this.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.280
Sonia Lubomirsky is the first name he is.

50:01.280 --> 50:07.280
She's one of the many who shows that people have a set level for happiness.

50:07.280 --> 50:20.280
And then the so-called hedonic treadmill that you run up, up, up, and don't get anywhere sees to eat that you, if you get an up, a boost, the boost is temporary, and you return to your set level.

50:20.280 --> 50:27.280
Well, I understand that these would mean that everything we've spoken about today is completely irrelevant because there would be no variation on their size.

50:27.280 --> 50:30.280
No, yes, that's exactly what it means.

50:30.280 --> 50:34.280
With regard to the set level, there is a certain range of possible variation.

50:34.280 --> 50:37.280
So there is an individual effect, and that's it, that's the whole point.

50:37.280 --> 50:43.280
There is an individual effect, of course there is an individual effect, but outside effects have an effect on happiness.

50:43.280 --> 50:51.280
But I think the light on actually was correct in assessing the percentage where the set point is and how much intervention people are.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.280
Oh, that might be.

50:52.280 --> 50:55.280
There are individual effects, I don't, I'm not saying anything.

50:55.280 --> 51:00.280
I'm just saying it's not true that, you know, these effects are, the other effects are transitory, it's just not.

51:00.280 --> 51:11.280
At least if we trust our measurement now, you know, you might have a different definition of happiness, I don't have a different definition of happiness, but if we stay with the definition of happiness we have, that's not true, right?

51:11.280 --> 51:13.280
That's not the case.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.280
Sorry.

51:14.280 --> 51:17.280
That's going to save time.

51:17.280 --> 51:25.280
I'm baddie, usually I am not comfortable speaking in front of a group, but I couldn't resist.

51:25.280 --> 51:34.280
I am a woman of the 50s.

51:34.280 --> 51:40.280
I do have some comments.

51:40.280 --> 51:45.280
Number one, we didn't know how we felt.

51:45.280 --> 51:51.280
We really, no one cared, and to my knowledge, no one ever asked.

51:51.280 --> 51:57.280
And I was part of the generation of IBM, I've been moved.

51:57.280 --> 52:03.280
Husbands would make a decision, come home and tell his wife.

52:03.280 --> 52:09.280
Companies would say how to approach it in talking to your wife.

52:09.280 --> 52:18.280
You could live two years in one place, travel to a state halfway across the country, maybe three years.

52:18.280 --> 52:42.280
And the men today, and I have sons and five grand sons, and a lot of what they do now with their wives has to do with their mothers, who didn't, a husband who didn't know how to turn on the washing machine, whose mother had ironed his under shorts,

52:42.280 --> 52:54.280
who never ironed, who would travel, come home, set standards or null and void, something that had happened with one of the children.

52:54.280 --> 53:11.280
So I do know, and when we talked, we talked to each other, and we were reading books, Gloria Steinem, and then, and I thought, usually I wouldn't say this, a book that a woman wrote about reading your husband,

53:11.280 --> 53:15.280
or a new or with whipped cream on you.

53:15.280 --> 53:19.280
I tell you, we didn't know where we stood.

53:19.280 --> 53:22.280
So that's my comment.

53:22.280 --> 53:51.280
I'm Woody Walther, I'm a psychoanalyst, and my comments have to do both with the clinical work that we do, and whether or not we enhance our patient's happiness, a pretty key issue that

53:51.280 --> 53:56.280
this has been more macro happiness, you might say, and less micro.

53:56.280 --> 54:19.280
And I think that it's interesting that some research on dynamic therapy, especially done by Leborski in Philadelphia, showed that when people went through psychotherapy, there was an increased balance of positive experiences that they had, as opposed to negative ones.

54:19.280 --> 54:30.280
And you mentioned the reward center, and the connection between reward centers and happiness, and it does seem reasonable to think about that.

54:30.280 --> 54:48.280
The other thing that's related to that, two other things that I'd be interested in, you guys, comments, is the role of meaningful life, and what your goals are, and how much that seems to have to do with people's lives.

54:48.280 --> 55:02.280
And the related thing is unconscious issues versus consciousness, which is what we deal with every day in the office.

55:02.280 --> 55:15.280
There's the whole group called the Mount Zion Research Group out in San Francisco that studied the patient's unconscious plan when they come into treatment.

55:15.280 --> 55:21.280
What is it that they are trying to resolve, and how do they bring it into the transference, and how do you work with it?

55:21.280 --> 55:30.280
So there's quite a lot that has a very clinical aspect, it seems to me, that we want to think about more.

55:30.280 --> 55:35.280
Can I ask you, are you trying to make your patients happier?

55:35.280 --> 55:39.280
What part of your goal for the patients that you see is to make them happier?

55:39.280 --> 55:50.280
Actually, I think it's a great question. I personally believe that if you want to have a practice, you bloody better way of trying to make your patients happier.

55:50.280 --> 56:07.280
So I think that it's a central issue to what is it that's making them unhappy, to clarify that, to help them to clarify it, and to do something that used to be sort of foreboding, to give advice even,

56:07.280 --> 56:20.280
to say, if you're afraid to do X, Y, and C to get to this goal that you would really like to get to, and we need to clarify what keeps you from trying.

56:20.280 --> 56:28.280
I had a patient just this week where the issue is his father hadn't done that well.

56:28.280 --> 56:44.280
So every time he started to really do well, and he's a very gifted guy, he had to find some excuse to get away from the potential success, because it made him feel bad to separate himself from his father who was actually unhappy.

56:44.280 --> 56:50.280
So, can I comment on that?

56:50.280 --> 57:08.280
My wife, I'm very, very happy to be married to a psychotherapist, and she reports that about half of the clients that come the first session, she makes a point of asking them, what would you like to see the end of this process, and they say we want to be happier, I want to be happier.

57:08.280 --> 57:13.280
Nice to say. How can I help you?

57:13.280 --> 57:29.280
Hi, Michael. I love the subject so much for that for the past couple of years, a couple of times a month, I run a happiness discussion group with all people who want to discuss all things happening. So that's happening right after this.

57:29.280 --> 57:46.280
If those want to talk on that, and my question is about the whole study and talk of your happiness being a function of the five people you spend the most time with, of the five people you kind of keep in mind the most.

57:46.280 --> 57:59.280
I'm wondering if people on the panel had any thoughts on that particular study or anything having to do with that.

57:59.280 --> 58:05.280
Those are difficult things to do because there's a selection problem.

58:05.280 --> 58:08.280
So, you choose the five people you spend time with.

58:08.280 --> 58:21.280
So, do you choose happy people because you're happy or do you choose unhappy or are you happy and unhappy people make you unhappy. So these are things that are essentially impossible to identify.

58:21.280 --> 58:24.280
So, very hard.

58:24.280 --> 58:26.280
Any other thoughts?

58:26.280 --> 58:29.280
Ideas about that particular.

58:29.280 --> 58:48.280
Okay, and just as like a final comment, the lady in red that brought up spirituality, I guess my my thought on spirituality, I think it's your ability to create sensitivities arises which allows you to be more in touch with subtleties and sub subtleties, which allows you to have a more

58:48.280 --> 59:01.280
wider spectrum of feelings, thoughts, ideas, open-mindedness, and the results of all this is connectedness with all things. So I think there is a lot of value in spirituality.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.280
Thank you.

59:03.280 --> 59:06.280
Thank you very much.

59:06.280 --> 59:25.280
I have a question and it's about meaningfulness in life and to have to lead no life. It's not extraordinary but meaningful to you and about the women in the 50s. I'm the class of 50, went Stanford about a five-day key and was very

59:25.280 --> 59:42.280
difficult. It was a difficult life and I woke up going to it. My husband committed suicide after we divorced but got into real trouble and I was very naive, did not know many things. But I want to know, my mother would always say, I don't know why you're unhappy and this is for the

59:42.280 --> 01:00:05.280
gentleman from Italy and then I married the lawyer who was from Italy. This was a big mistake. I went from one extreme. I went from one extreme to the other, one that was very dismissive but my mother would always say, but he doesn't go out with other women and he doesn't drink. I was so lucky.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:15.280
I'm just wondering how can we recognize the fact that all of our lives should have meaning no matter whether we come.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:26.280
I'm sorry. No matter whether we come very ambitious or very laid back or whatever our nature. I don't know who talked about nature but I thought that was a very interesting thing to contemplate.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:46.280
But I don't know, was it here to Mr. Nazarian or Dr. Nazarian that we said there were cultures that there was no such word as happiness. Was that here or was it not here? But it was a seminar and there was no such word as anyway.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:59.280
And I guess that's it. Thank you very much. Can I make one little comment? There's a great book by a historian named Darren McMahon who talks about the history of happiness.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:12.280
History of happiness. History of happiness. That's the name of his book I think. One of the things that he stresses which has always been on my mind too is that happiness is a post enlightenment construct in some ways.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:23.280
People like Aristotle talk about happiness but he didn't think any of us were going to be it. I think the blurb for this presentation began with only the only happy man is a dead man.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:35.280
So there's a lot of reason to believe that what we think of as happiness involving choice and someone in our lives are lives being motivated by the pursuit of happiness is the result of the enlightenment, the French Revolution, the American Revolution,

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:46.280
and that fundamentally as weird as it may sound the people before us may not have had a word for happiness but it wasn't part of what they expected from their lives.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:55.280
Happiness is what you got maybe when you were dead but they didn't have the privilege living subsistence lives and stuff like that.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:07.280
Even a subsistence culture where people were very poor but they all had a role and they all had a sense of satisfaction in playing that role.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.280
Possibly they certainly had a role but that's exactly the whole role they didn't have any choice.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.280
They didn't see it. Oh they didn't have a choice you're right.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:26.280
Well there's a book I'm reading now and it's called Why Philosophy Never Goes Away.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.280
And it's written by Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. Why Philosophy Never Goes Away.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:39.280
And it's very interesting is why were they happy and what made them miserable and what made us miserable that they accepted.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:49.280
And we just want to be happy but you know confusing but if you could talk about that.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.280
I'm Alex. It's a really excellent conversation today.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:03:06.280
I'm really grateful and surprised that the social and macro elements of happiness were discussed so thoroughly and deeply.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:20.280
A complicated issue that I find myself running into is in whatever rebel rousing or radicalizing or addressing the political crises of our times I find myself in the thick of.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:32.280
You know concerning myself with the happiness of the population seeing the extent to which institutions that are poorly thought out and to the benefit of a few decrease the happiness of so many.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.280
And I find myself becoming unhappy when I think about all these things.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.280
And I think that this is often a distillama that people face. They're like okay so I know there's all this bad news out there.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:58.280
I know that there are actually steps to take and groups to join and solidarity to express and realize how do people work through that specific dilemma of being an individual in the midst of a world that needs institutional change to actually increase everyone's happiness.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:08.280
Knowing that all of our happiness is connected but also having to be happy enough myself that I'll actually be a good instrument raising all that happiness.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.280
Any of your reflections on that would be welcome.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:22.280
When I give talks on happiness people always ask me what's so great about being happy or are we losing only a fool wants to be happy or only the selfish want to be happy.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:30.280
For the reasons you just described that I guess the question I always asked back to them was was Gandhi unhappy into the Dalai Lama unhappy.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.280
But obviously people deeply committed to social change and the welfare of others but where they.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:51.280
Does that mean you have to be miserable. I mean I guess I hope at least that those people are exemplars of how we can be committed to making the world a better place and and worry about other people but at the same time leaving lives that we find not only meaningful but happy.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:05:11.280
As many as that is one that shows that when you are altruistic and give something to others that's one of the easiest ways to activate your own reward system and you have to think especially in life or comment that that might be an evolutionarily developed kind of kind of response.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:22.280
So give to others and that might make you feel happy and help everybody else at the same time.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:29.280
My name is Charles Markovski. I'm a psychiatrist and I'm very happy I'm here today.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:44.280
Most stimulating conversation. What I'm struck by is the absence of discussion of depression which seems to me is the opposite number of happiness.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:06:01.280
And as a clinician it's at least been my experience that overwhelmingly the work I do deals with people suffering with depression. Many of whom are actually not cognizant on the fact that they have depression.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:23.280
It's presents in a myriad of ways very often hidden from the patient themselves. And what I want to ask is how you would integrate the fact that some of the people who suffer with depression cannot fight their way out of it no matter how they try.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:33.280
And that somatic treatments particularly medications are become relevant to the treatment and to the management of their happiness or lack of it.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:42.280
And I just wonder if how that sort of fits with your thinking as up to now.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:57.280
I just answered the wrong question. I don't quite buy the distinction but to a certain extent one can speak about the body versus the processes that make use of it.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:17.280
It still depends on it completely. And certain disorders are just too deep to be as I'm sure you know you just said that much to be amenable to an intervention merely by talk. I mean it's a miracle in some sense that the talk saying cognitive behavioral setting can get you as far as it can.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:31.280
It's fantastic. Think of it. You know you someone reaches down inside your brain or you yourself do so and change things change the electrical impulses in the chemical balance because it's all about this.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.280
As I said before I'll say it again. It's nothing beyond the chemical balance and the electrical impulses. That's what you are.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:53.280
And so to some extent you can change that from the outside by talk. I mean right now I'm causing immediate early gene expression in your brain. I mean genes get some get transcribed others do not because I talk to you so I'm making changes in your brain.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:08:03.280
I know I can only reach luckily for you. I can only reach this far not farther for some of the things in the psychiatry school prescribed for you something more serious than just talk.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:19.280
I think it depends on the value of unhappiness. I think there's some interesting research on this by psychiatrists who feel that we are over medicating people that it's too quick of a solution to say oh you're not happy let's give you some you know prozac or whatever the drug of choice is

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:36.280
and well but so I think it depends on the cause of you know are you talking about somebody who's clinically depressed who clearly it's not related to the conditions of their life. It's you know postpartum depression it's something that is clearly uni medication but that's not everybody who's on medication today.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:48.280
In fact it's not even the majority right because the rates of I mean the rates they show of you know the people suffering from clinical depression have remained road to end schizophrenia and these other diseases that require these heavy duty drugs.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.280
Have remained relatively stable yet the drug doesn't correlate at all.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:59.280
Siric polemies other really serious drugs are being prescribed to people who are saying well I have a little trouble sleeping I'm not you know I'm not feeling so great.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.280
Oh let's get you on some medication.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:07.280
Social problem that's like you know like the army answering 911 call which is what happening in our cities right.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.280
You should I mean the first line of defense should be psychotherapists who talks to you know the psychiatrist prescribed drugs.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:20.280
Exactly and they show that the combination of both is obviously more effective than you know for for some people it's you know they need the talk therapy even if they need the drugs.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:31.280
So I mean there's a case that I remember reading about in one of these where they were and they were there's a whole study now of the evolutionary benefits of depression again not that sort of pathological clinical depression but the idea that when you

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:43.280
ruminate on your problems and you pull away from pleasurable you're not experiencing pleasure so you're not with your friends you're not having sex you're not eating you're focusing on your problems and you're solving them better than if you were getting pleasure out of these things

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:52.280
so they're clearly evolutionary benefits to not being happy with your life at the moment which force you to reexamine reevaluate and figure out what's wrong.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:10:03.280
There was a case that in one of these articles by one of these psychiatrists of a patient of his who was on you know was doing very well on antidepressants and then finally came back to him and said I want to go off the antidepressants

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:12.280
and he said oh but they're working well for you know what what's what's the problem and she said the problem she goes are you are you they're not working or are you are you not happy anymore.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:21.280
And she said no she said the reason I want to go off of them is because I feel fine but I'm still married to the same alcoholic SOP and I realize that it's not that my problem.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:30.280
It's my life problem and although I feel fine I'm not happy that I feel fine and I want to go off the medication in order to fix my life.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:42.280
So I just want to make one quick point I think clearly there's over treatment with drugs but there's under diagnosis of depression so that's sort of a curious paradox.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:56.280
And a quick point in agreement there's over treatment but under diagnosis and if we're going to treat depression or happiness or in that sense as a social problem as opposed to something that only the privileged are privileged to.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:05.280
We have to begin with a healthcare system that provides everybody with access which helps diagnose them and helps them get treatment so sorry.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.280
I have to check to.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.280
Hi I'm Samuel.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:26.280
I'm not really a speaker in front of crowds either but Betty gave me the inspiration so even though I'm not a woman from the 50s.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:47.280
I enjoyed this conversation very much. One of the things that one of the reasons why it didn't speak to me so much is because I'm a part of what I think is not an insignificant number of people in this class of young pretty well educated.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:12:07.280
I don't have many real anxieties financial issues but still I don't have data to support this but I sense that there's still a great sense among sort of maybe my generation of a sense of like unfulfillment or emptiness.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:32.280
I think part of it has to do with to echo some of what psychotherapist said but I'm not sure what it really means to pursue a meaningful life or how to choose to pursue a meaningful life but I'm not convinced that one of you said that a better work life balance

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:46.280
would necessarily help. I'm not convinced that more time watching Netflix or prozing Facebook or lying on the beach would necessarily help that.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:13:03.280
I think part of one of the flaws I think in this conversation is sort of this assumption or this methodology of if I achieve X then I'll be happy. And then the problem with happiness is we have to manage our expectations.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:27.280
If only X wasn't so great or you know we weren't on this in this paradox or this hedonic treadmill or whatever. And I think sort of this problem is probably exacerbated by social media and technology that sort of give us this same type of promise

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:40.280
that you know if you look like this or if you buy this or if you have this then you'll be happier than you know because they're dictating what success means and what happiness should look like.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:56.280
So I guess if you have any thoughts on that I'm not sure exactly what my question or I guess if you want to pinpoint the question I guess it's you know do you think in the age of social media and this heavy heavy advertising and stuff like that

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.280
the pursuit of happiness is even more difficult.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.280
I have a couple of kids you won't think about.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:13.280
There's a meaning for you. Yeah. I'm not being so good if you have kids you have meaning therefore you don't have time to worry about the lack of fulfillment that you just described.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Right.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.280
Exactly.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:26.280
Thank you for your audience.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:39.280
Hi my name is Olga and thank you very much for very interesting conversation I have a lot of questions but I can even ask all of them.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:15:04.280
For me it's very interesting why happiness became so big figure in American mythology like American freedom or democracy and for example in the Soviet Union we didn't talk about happiness at all we talked about meaning in life,

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:15.280
meaningful life and the creating but a future but not happy future but a future.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:33.280
And it was different mythology and but what I would like to talk about I recently read about theories psychological theory by psychology professor.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.280
In Colorado June.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:16:01.280
Grover she wrote an article missing the standing of positive thinking and what she is she comparing our mind with ecological system and talking about biodiversity and diversity of emotions.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:27.280
And she's saying that we know that in the physical ecosystem by diversity is healthy and important people can buy into that we know that biodiversity was just was just resistance to pathogens and invasive species.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:45.280
And that human mind may be not so different and that's it's important to have a diversity array of emotions joy sadness love admiration guilt and so on.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:58.280
So would you yes would you comment on your statements.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:07.280
She sounds like she was right but not for the reasons that that you recounted.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:15.280
I think it's irresponsible to make for scientists to make an analogy basis for an argument because analogy is not valid argument.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.280
You know saying like the mind is like the ecosystem from that point on everything you say is completely up in the air.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:34.280
But it so happens I think this came up that in this discussion here that sometimes less than happy states can be more adapted for the individual.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:43.280
This is not ecosystem and because sometimes there might be need for focus or whatever. So to that extent I would agree with that.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:18:00.280
There is some very good psychological research published in the best journals psychological science I think you read mouse is one of the authors on the value of unhappiness and I know that Christine here wrote you did the deal right about that so there are people here more qualified

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:12.280
than I can speak to that but it's like you say.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:18.280
Yeah, my name is Doug I'm a financial planner and you know money is very quantifiable.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:29.280
I think I'll agree happiness is not and a lot of the prevailing thought when you're working financial services that people make these huge financial decisions based on two emotions fear agreed.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.280
And it seems my experience is a whole lot deeper than that.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:46.280
But you know I'm not a psychiatrist a lot of psychiatrists are not financial planners so we can't really have that overlap and a lot of the books that I've read you know you get halfway through it and you realize oh this is a training manual on how to sell

01:18:46.280 --> 01:19:05.280
a newity to someone. So how do you kind of get people to open up up about their relationship with money. How does that impact their happiness. You know if you have any thoughts on that I would greatly appreciate it.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:18.280
And then watch me because I'm the economist. I always don't know don't some Congress don't have any things with money. I'm one of them.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:25.280
No I don't think people I mean really I don't think people have looked that deep.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:38.280
The issue of the relationship the psychological relationship that people have with money and how that can affect financial plans. It's it's a very interesting question. I really don't know.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.280
I really don't know anybody who's that honest.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:57.280
There are psychologists that work in psychologists and economists that work in related questions but that's a specific question.

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:02.280
I think it's a very interesting question. We've heard quite a few actually.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:15.280
I think that would be interesting to go and look at and this one but I can write a book.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:22.280
As you helped people make these decisions based based on you know what is it what's motivating is this a right.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:29.280
Yeah it's what's the motivation what's the end goal in mind and you know is it something you feel that you need to do or something that you want to do.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:31.280
So it's a good question to you.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.280
Yeah and it's more it's more a question how do I unlock that thinking in their head.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.280
I think I would advise you to cite Tolkien to them from the Lord of the Rings.

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:46.280
You know when when the gimli the dwarf asks of glad me of a gift.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:57.280
I will not go into details what the gift was but she tells him that with the gift go those words that your hands will flow with gold but over your gold will have no dominion.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.280
Not the bad advice.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280
Yeah I think.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280
Help me yet.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.280
Thanks a lot.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:20.280
Hi I don't have a question I kind of just want to make a statement which seems to work for me and that and that's what attracted me to this conference the name happiness.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.280
I'm also a psychoanalyst but that's not why I'm here.

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:37.280
My philosophy is that contentness is what's important to be content was what you have.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:54.280
Happiness of those special times in life when whether it's love in the beginning or birth of a child or whatever we all know what those moments are.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:01.280
If we were happy meaning happy all the time we really wouldn't know that we're happy.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:08.280
It's just like if we were drinking champagne and eating caviar all the time we wouldn't know it's special.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.280
So that's basically my comment for today.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:13.280
Thank you.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:18.280
Any comments?

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:22.280
Allow me to give Sophocles the final word.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:31.280
The final chorus from the Antigone where he said of happiness the crown and chief is part is wisdom and to hold the gods in awe.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.280
That is the law that seeing the stricken heart pride brought down we learn when we are old.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Thank you to all of our discussions today.
