00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
When we talk about free will and when we get really heated debates over that, what we're

00:07.280 --> 00:10.480
actually talking about is human behavior.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.000
If we all held the exact same idea and it was the wrong idea, that would be detrimental.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.760
And so having this debate and having ideas kind of develop it is the thing we want to

00:21.760 --> 00:23.260
do.

00:23.260 --> 00:29.960
In the late 80s, early 90s, I came to realize that people from the different areas of neuroscience

00:29.960 --> 00:33.920
psychology, biology didn't really talk to each other.

00:33.920 --> 00:39.680
And it seemed to me that's a major loss because each of them had something to say that could

00:39.680 --> 00:43.000
be useful to the other.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.760
The first round table we had actors, philosophers, neuroscientists.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.960
I invited them to my home.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.280
I served them dinner and wine.

00:52.280 --> 00:56.800
Then we went to my living room and what I recognized was that these meetings in and

00:56.800 --> 01:00.400
some of them themselves were extremely enlightening.

01:00.400 --> 01:08.040
And so that's where Helix comes from.

01:08.040 --> 01:13.320
The mission of Helix is to bring together thought leaders from different disciplines,

01:13.320 --> 01:16.960
speaking with one another in spontaneous a way as possible.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.360
The discussions are not aimed to answer a question because if that were the case, there

01:21.360 --> 01:25.440
would be more homogeneity and you'd have a monolithic group of experts.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.560
And it's just the opposite.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.360
It's more of an intellectual free for all.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.920
It's true in different ways, in different phases of child development.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.480
But what preoccupies a kid at a certain stage in life is going to influence what he

01:39.480 --> 01:41.720
or she actually experiences.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
We all know that.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.000
We're in a terrible mood.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.760
If something horrible just happened to us, we misperceive what someone else said.

01:48.760 --> 01:54.840
I don't think we're in some sense moving toward a steady state of objectivity.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
You disagree?

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
Go ahead.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.040
I think you never get to a stage of objectivity.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.640
There's no such thing.

02:00.640 --> 02:05.600
But I think kids are more limited because they have more limited minds.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.440
That's what you get in an interdisciplinary conversation.

02:08.440 --> 02:14.560
You get to realize that there's no one privileged point of view or one privileged kind of information.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.960
So I think it's essential if we're going to understand anything about the world.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.520
I'm a lab scientist.

02:20.520 --> 02:25.720
I'm being a lab scientist, I spend a lot of time in the four walls of my laboratory.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.800
So when you have an opportunity to sit around with colleagues who are coming from very different

02:30.800 --> 02:35.520
perspectives, it changes the way you think about your subject matter in a way that I

02:35.520 --> 02:40.960
hope I will then take back into my laboratory and import some of those different perspectives

02:40.960 --> 02:43.200
into the work that we do there.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.040
We cover a very broad area.

02:46.040 --> 02:50.320
We do neuroscience, biology, medicine.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.120
We have auditory, surrealism.

02:54.120 --> 02:58.000
And there isn't a meeting I walk out of that I haven't learned something.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.960
It's very important to see how carefully the child has made an effort to draw these figures.

03:05.960 --> 03:13.000
And now if we go to the next child's drawing, same age, it's very primitive.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.720
How do you determine the ability of the child drawing against his or her creativity or individuality?

03:23.720 --> 03:30.080
It seems to me you're making an assumption that drawing ability of all children of the

03:30.080 --> 03:32.560
same age ought to be the same.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.760
I'm so glad you made that point.

03:34.760 --> 03:42.960
So what you're suggesting is that that image, which I plead guilty to calling primitive,

03:42.960 --> 03:52.640
could in fact be an amazingly creative expression on the part of the child, who could have possibly

03:52.640 --> 03:54.840
drawn the figure in other ways.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.960
It might not be right to call primitive, it might be right to call it something else.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.440
So I really appreciate that so much.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.920
I plead guilty and I stand corrected.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.520
And I think that's a wonderful contribution.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.600
We had a series on music and cognition.

04:11.600 --> 04:19.040
We asked Nacho Armani, a percussionist, to give a performance where he engaged not only

04:19.040 --> 04:44.680
all the roundtable participants, but the entire audience.

04:44.680 --> 04:50.360
And I think that's a great thing.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.200
So genius requires intelligence, but then there's something else.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.960
And originally the idea was that, you know, the genius, that extra something was breathed

04:57.960 --> 05:02.360
into you by a god or a muse or implanted in you by the gods.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.920
But it was a divine special something that ordinary human beings didn't have.

05:06.920 --> 05:13.200
We submitted an application identifying 14 areas within the big questions about sciences

05:13.200 --> 05:15.000
and humanities.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.920
And we were very pleased for them to fund us for those.

05:18.920 --> 05:25.400
It's when we get puzzling phenomena that is observable physical phenomena that are

05:25.400 --> 05:31.520
current inventory, physical inventory of properties and enforces doesn't seem adequate

05:31.520 --> 05:36.160
to capture that we then have to broaden out our physical understanding.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.640
In the case of consciousness, it's not the behavior of consciousness that leads us to

05:40.640 --> 05:44.280
think we're going to need some new fundamental explanatory principle.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.080
It's the intrinsic character.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.720
Is it epiphenomenal?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.320
Is it such that it's just there?

05:50.320 --> 05:55.800
There's an interesting form of overstatement that scientists are prone to in this, that

05:55.800 --> 06:03.280
we have biology and we have a mechanism by which you can see how random variation plus

06:03.280 --> 06:09.720
natural selection could give you complicated organisms like us.

06:09.720 --> 06:10.720
That's true.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.440
What you often see scientists do is convert that into a very different statement which

06:15.440 --> 06:22.880
is we know that random mutations plus natural selection gave rise to us.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.960
Those are two very distant statements and the second one is completely beyond what we know.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.240
Of course, we don't know that all those mutations were random.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.560
We have no idea.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.120
With the John Templeton Foundation grant, we had one about immortality that I thought

06:33.120 --> 06:36.480
was really enchanting and nerve-racking.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.640
If we were to be able to say on such and such a date, this will be the end of the human

06:41.640 --> 06:46.320
race, what would that do to all human endeavor?

06:46.320 --> 06:50.760
We can accept to a certain extent the fact that we individually, each one of us is going

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
to end.

06:51.760 --> 06:57.160
But the idea that the entire thing is going to end, all humanity I think is as close to

06:57.160 --> 07:00.000
unthinkable as we can get.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.400
I feel like we've changed a great deal in this recent period of time since modernity

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
basically.

07:07.400 --> 07:14.800
There are sensibilities that are arising and not just in academic frameworks but in the

07:14.800 --> 07:24.360
popular realm as well that would say it might be possible to accept endings, accept one's

07:24.360 --> 07:32.680
own death, accept the deep uncertainty of our existence, that that might be kind of

07:32.680 --> 07:34.240
cool.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.880
It was just a discussion but you did in some way feel that something really large was at

07:38.880 --> 07:41.880
stake.

07:41.880 --> 07:48.360
There will always be a irreducible degree of unpredictability of human behavior.

07:48.360 --> 07:53.360
Even given all the addictions, even given all the neurological conditions that people

07:53.360 --> 08:01.560
have, there is an element of choice in humans which is inherent to that human for one reason

08:01.560 --> 08:05.200
or another.

08:05.200 --> 08:10.920
These events really democratize the intellectual life in the city.

08:10.920 --> 08:19.240
I think it's very important not to restrict ideas to elites and universities.

08:19.240 --> 08:26.080
We have an audience here and we simulcast it and we put it on YouTube and that way a

08:26.080 --> 08:28.840
lot more people can benefit from it.

08:28.840 --> 08:34.320
A lot of you have been talking about the fact that when we are conscious we have a feeling

08:34.320 --> 08:37.400
inside that we have an experience inside.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.720
So my question is inside what?

08:39.720 --> 08:44.320
Because if we say that conscious experience is inside the mind it's kind of circular

08:44.320 --> 08:50.520
definition because just the thing, so it cannot be literally inside the head.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.200
We do not expect to find consciousness like we find sugar in the blood.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.960
So I just wanted to ask inside what?

08:56.960 --> 09:03.480
Something we haven't really talked at all about which I guess we'll wait until the last

09:03.480 --> 09:09.320
minute to throw it out there is that consciousness is as far as we know embodied.

09:09.320 --> 09:14.960
When I stub my toe I feel pain in my toe, not in my brain and I don't feel it in the

09:14.960 --> 09:17.360
rock that I stubbed my toe against.

09:17.360 --> 09:23.640
There seems to be this deep interface of consciousness that blends into the body even though we've

09:23.640 --> 09:25.800
been talking about it being situated in the brain.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.960
So when you ask the question we've been talking about consciousness being inside what the

09:29.960 --> 09:34.880
first thing I think of is it's inside the body and that gets us out of that immediate

09:34.880 --> 09:38.280
circularity and then you can say well what is the consciousness, the embodied consciousness

09:38.280 --> 09:41.280
inside of and then that's a different question.

09:41.280 --> 09:48.800
Do you think that if given unlimited resources and the ultimate proficiency in algorithms

09:48.800 --> 09:54.800
could we create a machine that's capable of replicating itself enough to become freewheeling?

09:54.800 --> 10:00.400
I really like that each of the panelists really just talked about their own experiences with

10:00.400 --> 10:05.480
the topic and questions from their own approaches and I really gave like a multifaceted understanding

10:05.480 --> 10:08.000
to the questions.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.360
My hope is to provide this to various universities around the country and around the world especially

10:15.360 --> 10:18.200
in lesser fortunate places around the world.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.080
I've always been in favor of independent thinking and critical thinking.

10:23.080 --> 10:29.800
This is a perfect way to bring it to as many people as possible.

10:29.800 --> 10:36.200
These kinds of events remind us all in academia that it is really about relevance of what

10:36.200 --> 10:37.200
we are doing.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.880
It is ultimately the question how do we contribute to the betterment of society or to the greater

10:42.880 --> 10:43.980
good.

10:43.980 --> 10:50.640
The more individuals who can engage in this kind of high quality discussion the more we're

10:50.640 --> 10:57.080
raising not only the awareness but the potential for contributions of people both participants

10:57.080 --> 11:22.080
and non-participants to the greater wisdom and knowledge of the world.
