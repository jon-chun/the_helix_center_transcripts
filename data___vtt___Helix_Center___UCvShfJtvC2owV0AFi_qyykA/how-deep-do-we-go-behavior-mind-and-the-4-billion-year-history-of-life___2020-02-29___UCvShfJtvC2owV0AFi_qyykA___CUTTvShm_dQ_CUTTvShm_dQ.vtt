WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I guess.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I'd like to talk once.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm sorry?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I'd like to talk once.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
You've been lunch with me?

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And then it's my app to make sure that it's going out to me.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
What is it?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
What is it?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
I see.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
So, you just had a quick walk.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Oh, that's not so heavy.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Well, we went into the kitchen with drivesome.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
So, no one did?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Well, I was in the kitchencle.

00:41.000 --> 00:32.620
It was kind of news because we run into their

00:32.620 --> 00:47.060
vehicle.

00:47.060 --> 00:50.000
She said we're going to take drugs.

00:50.000 --> 00:50.000
So, you're going to come at the doors?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Okay.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.600
Welcome. Welcome the Hillock Center. My name is Gerald Hurrowitz. I'm the associate director

01:01.600 --> 01:08.040
of Hillock's, Ed Nurse-Sesian. Can people hear me? Okay. No? Okay. I'll speak louder,

01:08.040 --> 01:13.680
but I will get a little bit more amplification. So my name is Gerald Hurrowitz. I'm the associate

01:13.680 --> 01:20.200
director of Hillock Center. Ed Nurse-Sesian, our executive director, is out today. Unfortunately

01:20.200 --> 01:25.800
for him because we have a wonderful program and I think that's reflected in this wonderful

01:25.800 --> 01:31.440
turnout we have here today. So welcome everybody. Before we get started, I want to mention

01:31.440 --> 01:39.160
our two of our upcoming panels, the Round Tables. On March 14th, we're having a round table

01:39.160 --> 01:48.440
on the many minds of memory. And then on April 18th, the topic will be ethics and AI, artificial

01:48.440 --> 01:55.640
intelligence and ethics. So let me do a brief introduction to our panelists today. The discussion

01:55.640 --> 02:11.600
today is based on Joseph Lidoux's new book on the emotional brain. And let me just say

02:11.600 --> 02:16.680
a few words about Joseph and we'll go through the rest of the panelists. So Joseph Lidoux

02:16.680 --> 02:22.800
is the Henry and Lucy Moses professor of science at NYU in the Center for Neural Science. He

02:22.800 --> 02:28.600
also directs the Emotional Brain Institute located at the Nathan Klein Institute at NYU

02:28.600 --> 02:33.760
and is professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Department of Child and Analysis and Psychiatry

02:33.760 --> 02:40.160
at NYU Langone Medical School. His work is focused on the brain mechanisms of memory and

02:40.160 --> 02:46.440
emotion. Lidoux is the author of the Emotional Brain, which is the basis of our talk today.

02:46.440 --> 02:52.920
The Synaptic Self and Anxious. The latter received the American Psychological Association

02:52.920 --> 02:58.520
William James Book Award. Lidoux is also written about the brain for the New York Times and

02:58.520 --> 03:04.400
Huffington Post. He's received a number of awards, including the Carl Spencer Lashley

03:04.400 --> 03:09.480
Award from the American Philosophical Society, the Frisbee International Prize in Cognitive

03:09.480 --> 03:19.280
Science. Gene Jean-Louis-SingerÃ© Prize of the Ipsen Foundation, the Santiago Grisolia

03:19.280 --> 03:24.720
Prize, the American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award

03:24.720 --> 03:31.160
and that's enough. No, and the list really goes on and it's quite wonderful and impressive

03:31.160 --> 03:36.040
at the same time. His most recent book is The Deep History of Ourselves, The Four Billion

03:36.040 --> 03:43.040
Years Story of How We Got Conscious Brains and that's the title of our talk today.

03:43.320 --> 03:48.600
Kristen Linkwist, who I'm imagining you can identify because she's our sole woman on

03:48.600 --> 03:53.220
the panel today, is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel

03:53.220 --> 03:58.400
Hill where she has appointments in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience and the Biomedical

03:58.400 --> 04:03.920
Research Imaging Center in the School of Medicine. She directs the Carolina Effective Science

04:03.920 --> 04:09.720
Lab which uses tools from behavioral science, physiology and neuroscience to examine how

04:09.720 --> 04:16.200
our social worlds, bodies and brains conspire to create emotion. She's interested in how

04:16.200 --> 04:22.480
emotion and emotional regulation varies across the age span and health and disease and across

04:22.480 --> 04:28.920
cultures. Carl Nicholas, you'll raise your hand since you're not as easy to identify

04:28.920 --> 04:35.560
there, although the beard helps. Carl J. Nicholas is the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Plant

04:35.560 --> 04:41.560
Biology Emeritus in the School of Integrative Plant Science Cornell University. His research

04:41.560 --> 04:48.560
is in the Plant Biophysics and Evolution with a particular focus on the evolution of biomechanics,

04:49.560 --> 04:56.400
complexity and multicellularity. He has written over 400 peer reviewed articles and five books

04:56.400 --> 05:03.400
and they're listed here, you could find them on your introduction to the talk today. He's

05:03.400 --> 05:07.400
a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Advanced Study at

05:07.400 --> 05:14.400
Davison Shafte-Koleg in Berlin and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

05:14.600 --> 05:20.360
David Rosenthal is Professor of Philosophy at the Graduate Center of the City University

05:20.360 --> 05:26.440
of New York with courtesy appointments and linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. He's

05:26.440 --> 05:31.440
also the coordinator of the Graduate Center's interdisciplinary concentration in cognitive

05:31.440 --> 05:37.920
science. He has published widely on consciousness, the mental qualities of perceiving and sensation,

05:37.920 --> 05:44.160
the representational character of thought, the nature of emotions, the self and related

05:44.160 --> 05:50.560
topics including his 2005 book Consciousness and Mind. His work on consciousness advances

05:50.560 --> 05:55.640
the theory that a psychological state is conscious if it is accompanied by a thought to the effect

05:55.640 --> 06:01.040
that one is in that state. He's also published in the Nature of Emotion, the Mind Body Problem

06:01.040 --> 06:08.040
and the Relation of Thought and Speech. And I am the last panelist, as I mentioned,

06:08.400 --> 06:13.880
Gerald Herwitz. I'll just say I'm a clinical neuropsychiatrist and psychopharmacologist

06:13.880 --> 06:19.520
who practices here in New York City and I'm in faculty at Columbia University. So we're

06:19.520 --> 06:25.720
going to begin with Joseph Lidou giving a brief sort of praise of his book and then we'll

06:25.720 --> 06:28.880
commence having our conversation.

06:28.880 --> 06:41.160
Thanks, Jerry. So it's really great to have these panelists because in a book that covers

06:41.160 --> 06:46.400
four billion years we need a lot of different expertise to get into all of this. And when

06:46.400 --> 06:53.160
I was writing the book, the work that each of these people has done comes into play because

06:53.160 --> 06:59.720
it's in part about the early history of life and I consulted quite a bit with Carl as I

06:59.720 --> 07:04.880
was trying to understand how single cells became multicellular organisms and he was

07:04.880 --> 07:12.160
incredibly helpful to me in that. Kristen's work on the cognitive construction of emotions

07:12.160 --> 07:18.520
is very consistent with the kinds of ideas that I'm interested in. And I also am a very

07:18.520 --> 07:25.520
good friend and collaborator with David Rosenthal here who has the grandfather, the main god

07:26.640 --> 07:33.560
of higher order theory of consciousness which I also mostly subscribe to. I have my own

07:33.560 --> 07:40.200
version of it. So it's a real pleasure to have all these folks here and to be able to

07:40.200 --> 07:46.320
interact with them. So let me just tell you a little bit about the book. If you know anything

07:46.320 --> 07:50.120
about my research, you know that I study a part of the brain called the amygdala and its

07:50.120 --> 07:56.120
role in threat detection and responding to danger. And I've done that for about 30 or

07:56.120 --> 08:02.760
something, 30 something years, maybe 40 years I don't even know anymore. And so at one

08:02.760 --> 08:09.400
point I started thinking about something which is that the molecules that we've discovered

08:09.400 --> 08:16.400
in the rat brain that are important for the detection, learning about danger and responding

08:16.960 --> 08:23.520
to danger are also the molecules that are present in bees and flies and snails and other

08:23.520 --> 08:30.040
organisms like that. So Eric Candel's work for example in discovering all of these molecules

08:30.040 --> 08:35.320
was very influential and helpful because those of us studying mammals would have a much harder

08:35.320 --> 08:40.600
time doing that. So we used the clues that Eric and his colleagues discovered. And I was

08:40.600 --> 08:45.880
talking to one of his colleagues once about how do these things come together, how do flies

08:45.880 --> 08:51.320
and bees and slugs have the molecules that we end up having as well. And of course it has to

08:51.320 --> 08:57.720
do with there being a common ancestor that had all of these molecules. So if you think about

08:57.720 --> 09:04.840
that, that takes us somewhere around 630 million years ago. So it goes back a long time. And this

09:04.840 --> 09:11.240
fella, his name is Seth Grant who we tried to get to come to the panel. He's in Scotland and he

09:11.240 --> 09:16.680
would love to have come but he had a conflict so we weren't able to add him in the extra seat

09:16.680 --> 09:24.360
here. But Seth's work is on the genetic mechanisms of memory and the genes in particular underlying

09:24.360 --> 09:30.280
certain kinds of receptors that are important and plasticity. And Seth had found these that these

09:30.280 --> 09:37.240
molecules not only are present in mammals and invertebrates but also in organisms like jellyfish

09:37.960 --> 09:48.120
and snails and slugs, I'm sorry, jellyfish and sponges. And so we're now talking about the

09:48.120 --> 09:54.280
beginning of animal life. But he also noted that they're present in protozoa. Now protozoa are

09:54.280 --> 10:00.280
single cell organisms that are able to learn and they're able to detect danger, respond to danger

10:00.280 --> 10:05.880
in their environment, incorporate nutrients, balance fluids and use behavior to do all these

10:05.880 --> 10:11.400
things. They also reproduce. They produce the protozoa, which the protozoa are part of,

10:12.520 --> 10:17.800
are the beginning of sexual reproduction. So a single cell, how does a single cell reproduce?

10:17.800 --> 10:22.280
Well sometimes it's self fertilization but other times there are male and female cells that

10:22.280 --> 10:31.800
will fertilize the female. So we're now going back about 2 billion years or so to get to where we

10:31.800 --> 10:36.360
still have these molecules that are present in us. Now these animals, these organisms don't even

10:36.360 --> 10:41.880
have a nervous system. So what are they doing with learning and plasticity molecules? There's

10:41.880 --> 10:49.000
nothing to be plastic about. So the point is that you don't need a nervous system for behavior and

10:49.000 --> 10:54.280
you don't even need it for learning. And that's kind of a mind-blowing concept. And so if you keep

10:54.280 --> 11:00.680
going back and I kept going back until I got to the beginning of time, to the beginning of the

11:00.680 --> 11:06.280
time of life, which is about somewhere around 3.7 billion years ago, 4 billion years ago,

11:06.280 --> 11:12.680
where the first cells that were able to successfully reproduce and continue to reproduce so that the

11:12.680 --> 11:21.240
rest of life then followed. These were bacterial-like cells that also had to do these same things.

11:21.240 --> 11:28.040
Detect danger responded to detect danger, incorporate nutrients, balance fluids, reproduce and things

11:28.040 --> 11:34.120
like that. And they use behavior for many of these things. So when we think about these in humans,

11:34.120 --> 11:39.960
we're talking about danger, we're talking about fear. Incorporating nutrients, we're talking about

11:39.960 --> 11:45.720
feeding and hunger, balancing fluids, we talk about thirst, reproduction, we talk about sex and

11:45.720 --> 11:53.960
pleasure. But these mental states have nothing to do with why these behaviors exist. They exist

11:53.960 --> 11:59.320
because they were necessary for these early bacterial cells to survive in their environment.

11:59.320 --> 12:07.160
Behavior is a tool of survival, not a tool of the mind. We use behavior with our minds, but most

12:07.160 --> 12:14.680
of our mental capacities do not necessarily impact our behavior. So for example, in the work I do

12:14.680 --> 12:21.640
on the amygdala and threat detection in rats and in people, we often hear the amygdala is the

12:21.640 --> 12:27.720
brain sphere center. That's absolutely wrong. The amygdala detects and responds to danger. Your fear,

12:27.720 --> 12:33.960
as Christian will talk about, is a cognitive construction interpretation of what's going on

12:33.960 --> 12:40.520
around you. It's not simply a bottom up thing that we turn on the amygdala and all of a sudden

12:40.520 --> 12:46.840
bam, you're afraid. No, the fear is what happens when you realize what's going on. So you jump

12:46.840 --> 12:53.400
back from a bus flying across 2nd Avenue here and you do the jumping back long before you feel any

12:53.400 --> 12:59.720
kind of fear. Your brain is able to keep you alive because it has survival talents. And that's

12:59.720 --> 13:05.320
really what we are survival machines. And we use our greatest capacities such as consciousness and

13:05.320 --> 13:12.120
so forth to help us survive as well. And that's an unusual thing in the history of life that we

13:12.120 --> 13:17.880
can anticipate the future and use our understanding of what's going on in order to keep us alive.

13:17.880 --> 13:23.560
Now, our conscious minds are perhaps our greatest talent, but they're also our worst,

13:24.520 --> 13:31.400
they're responsible for our worst proclivities, greed, anger, envy, narcissism, and all of the

13:31.400 --> 13:39.000
things that are getting us into trouble today and potentially preventing the future survival

13:39.000 --> 13:44.040
of our species. You know, we're kind of, I think, maybe Carl can address this more accurately,

13:44.040 --> 13:49.320
but species have a kind of typical time course. And I think we're probably pretty close to the

13:49.320 --> 13:56.040
end of ours. The only way we can get past that, I think, would be if as a species we come together

13:57.000 --> 14:02.520
and use our collective of conscious minds to do something good for the survival of our kind.

14:02.520 --> 14:07.240
So that's, that kind of takes you from the beginning of the book to the end. And I guess we can throw

14:07.240 --> 14:16.840
it open to the conversation now. That's great. Well, as someone who's read through Joseph,

14:16.840 --> 14:22.760
Joseph's book, I can tell you, it's just wonderful, magisterial, and all the, and you could imagine

14:22.760 --> 14:28.200
four billion years, a lot of time to cover it. And he covers it beautifully. I guess there's so

14:28.200 --> 14:32.520
many places to jump in and have a conversation about the contents of the book, but I think maybe

14:32.520 --> 14:37.880
we should start at the beginning and talk a little bit about the development of behavior.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.800
Was that sort of an interesting entry point?

14:43.880 --> 14:52.200
So, continue, or, I mean, as I said, behavior is something that every organism does in some way,

14:52.200 --> 15:00.120
including plants which Carl works on. A tree that is absorbing light, or certainly sunflowers,

15:00.120 --> 15:07.480
are going to adapt to the light. The roots of plants will seek out minerals and water.

15:08.520 --> 15:14.680
And there are many things that plants do that are quite amazing behaviorally. And I think that

15:14.680 --> 15:19.000
that's actually kind of a hot topic now, plant behavior. We just have to be careful not to go

15:19.000 --> 15:24.120
too far when we over-interpret plant behavior in terms of mental states. And I'll just stop there

15:24.120 --> 15:25.000
and throw it open.

15:25.000 --> 15:36.360
Well, I would add that behavior probably should be viewed as an example of any kind of biological

15:36.360 --> 15:46.440
trait that spans the continuum of the tree of life. And if you look at its evolutionary history,

15:47.000 --> 15:54.840
even consciousness, you see that to one degree or another, it exists within every lineage of

15:54.840 --> 16:04.200
life, including plants and bacteria. But it is elaborated progressively with the appearance of new

16:04.760 --> 16:11.800
evolutionary groups. And you see that it becomes more elaborated as you go from unicellular to

16:11.800 --> 16:19.400
multicellular. And in multicellular animals, for example, it becomes more elaborate from

16:19.400 --> 16:25.400
those lineages that lack a central nervous system to those that do. Now, even though

16:26.600 --> 16:32.440
one can look at it as a continuum through the tree of life, that doesn't mean that it doesn't

16:32.440 --> 16:39.480
have discernible thresholds. So the analogy that I would give is if you look at the visible

16:39.480 --> 16:47.720
electromagnetic spectrum light, and you see that the wavelengths go from blue to red in increments

16:47.720 --> 16:53.720
of one wavelength, you still nonetheless see the different colors of the rainbow. And so those

16:53.720 --> 17:01.560
are the thresholds. And so we can say, for example, in lineage A, we're not sure that there's a level

17:01.560 --> 17:08.840
of consciousness. But when you get to, let's say, homo sapiens and primates, yes, consciousness

17:08.840 --> 17:17.960
appears to be the most elaborate. So as again, there's this continuum. But there are these

17:17.960 --> 17:23.800
increments that when you go from one wavelength to the next, you go from orange to yellow or yellow

17:23.800 --> 17:24.920
to orange line.

17:24.920 --> 17:34.440
I ask you to talk briefly about the importance of genetic compatibility of the cells within an

17:34.440 --> 17:40.600
organism, and what was required to create a multicellular organism with all the cells having the same

17:40.600 --> 17:49.240
genetic compatibility. Okay, very briefly. So if we look at the fossil record, and I brought a

17:49.240 --> 17:57.320
prop, which maybe I'll discuss in a little minute, we see that every lineage plant animal begins as

17:57.320 --> 18:04.200
a unicellular ancestral form. And then if we look at the progressive evolution, we see that we go

18:04.200 --> 18:12.600
generally to colonial, then to simple multicellular, and then to complex multicellular organisms. So

18:12.600 --> 18:22.040
the theory is that there are two very critical stages. The first is a stage in which the unicellular

18:22.040 --> 18:28.920
to colonial has to have genetic compatibility amongst adjoining cells.

18:28.920 --> 18:36.760
Just maybe explain colonial. So a colonial organism would be something like a sponge. So you have a

18:36.760 --> 18:46.040
bunch of aggregated cells that are, to some extent, cooperating in behavior, behaving in a

18:46.040 --> 18:54.040
collaborative way. If I was talking about plants, I would be talking about some kind of alga that is

18:54.040 --> 19:01.640
just a glob of cells glued together by an extracellular matrix. But those cells have to be at least

19:01.640 --> 19:09.320
initially genetically compatible. And so it's comparatively easy to do that in the sense that

19:09.320 --> 19:16.680
one is cell divides. Its derivative cells are very, very similar genetically. And so there's this

19:16.680 --> 19:24.920
gamutlic kite, this community structure that's established. But then the really difficult stage

19:24.920 --> 19:32.520
is this second stage, where you go from cells that are cooperating to cells that have now exported

19:32.520 --> 19:39.800
their fitness. So in other words, the survival of the multicellular organism doesn't depend on the

19:39.800 --> 19:48.360
survival of the individual cells. It depends on the reproductive success of the multicellular

19:48.360 --> 19:55.400
entity. And that's a very difficult thing to achieve. Nevertheless, if you look at the fossil

19:55.400 --> 20:04.280
record, multicellularity is evolved at a minimum of 27 independent evolutionary events. And it all

20:04.280 --> 20:11.160
started with something like this. This is a fossil which I'll pass around, but don't cut yourself.

20:12.840 --> 20:21.240
This rock is 2.6 billion years old. It's an example of a thing called a stromatoline.

20:21.960 --> 20:30.520
It's minerals that were precipitated by a bacterial biofilm. And inside this are microfossils,

20:30.520 --> 20:35.240
which are visible when you take thin sections and look at them through the microscope. Now,

20:35.240 --> 20:43.800
if I was alive back then, 2.6 billion years, I would still see things that perhaps I would

20:43.800 --> 20:51.240
identify as behavior. Because these biofilm organisms are collaborating. Some of them are

20:51.240 --> 20:56.840
doing one function, another, another function. But getting them all to collaborate is a single

20:56.840 --> 21:03.320
multicellular organism. That's a very complicated thing. So if you'd like to pass this around,

21:03.320 --> 21:09.800
just don't cut yourself on the edges. It's sharp. So one of the ideas I end up with at the end of

21:09.800 --> 21:18.600
the book, and it's kind of a crazy idea, but anyway, is that the human capacity for self-awareness

21:18.600 --> 21:28.840
is, results in our brain having a rogue component that is different from anything else that has

21:28.840 --> 21:37.000
existed in a multicellular organism, which is the ability to go against the good, the greater good,

21:37.000 --> 21:43.640
of all of the other cells of the body, and end your own life. And I think that that doesn't exist

21:43.640 --> 21:49.800
in any other organism. You have to be able to know you exist, to know that an end can exist,

21:49.800 --> 21:57.080
and to choose to bring that in for fruition. So that was one of the most amazing things,

21:58.040 --> 22:04.840
many, I discovered many amazing things, reading Carl's work and other really deep biological

22:04.840 --> 22:11.240
thinkers on these topics. But one of the things that stuck with me was the compatibility

22:11.240 --> 22:19.400
of an organism. And to have an organism that has many cells, all of the cells have to work towards

22:19.400 --> 22:28.920
the purpose of the organism to stay alive. And that's why unlike in a colony where you can remove

22:28.920 --> 22:37.800
a cell or a cell can defect and live on its own because it's not dependent on the colony.

22:37.800 --> 22:42.440
It helps the colony if the cell was there, so the colony needs to protect some way from the

22:42.440 --> 22:47.800
cells defecting. But if we remove a skin cell or any other cell from our body, the cell dies,

22:47.800 --> 22:52.840
because we have so many different parts of our body that are interdependent. Our circulatory

22:52.840 --> 22:59.400
system depends on our respiratory system and so on. So it's just a multicellular organism,

22:59.400 --> 23:03.560
it's just a fascinating thing, and I thank you for everything I learned from your work.

23:03.560 --> 23:09.240
So maybe David, we could talk about consciousness.

23:09.240 --> 23:16.040
Well, I was going to ask you a question in what you just said about this suicide thing.

23:18.040 --> 23:26.600
If the animal, a human, thinks, well, this is a good idea, I'm going to end my life.

23:26.600 --> 23:34.280
And it goes ahead and does that. Why, I mean, there are all sorts of psychological things that

23:34.280 --> 23:45.480
I'm not competent to say anything about. But let's assume that we have a case of a person

23:45.480 --> 23:51.160
who decides I'm going to end my life. And it's actually from the point of view of the person's

23:51.160 --> 24:00.120
psychological functioning. That's a good thing. Why is this going against the rest of it? I mean,

24:01.640 --> 24:07.240
because it's the rest of the body doesn't want to die, it's purpose is to keep on living.

24:07.800 --> 24:13.320
Well, the rest of the body is doing whatever it does as long as the animal is alive.

24:13.320 --> 24:19.080
But you have one part of the animal, one small part of the animal that is making a decision for

24:19.080 --> 24:22.920
the rest of the body. Normally, the body is working as a unit.

24:25.080 --> 24:33.240
Well, so if I'm a tiger and I see prey over there and I say, I'm hungry, I'm going to go

24:33.240 --> 24:41.960
kill the prey and eat the prey. This is my psychological functioning that's driving the rest of my

24:41.960 --> 24:46.840
limbs and my mouth and all of this stuff. I would say psychological.

24:46.840 --> 24:51.960
But I'm sorry. I wouldn't make it cycle. I would say that it's the survival imperative of the

24:51.960 --> 24:57.480
organism to do that. I mean, that may be some psychology that goes with it. But I don't think

24:57.480 --> 25:05.880
that's necessarily what's driving the behavior. So when you talk about psychology, it's got to be

25:05.880 --> 25:18.520
conscious. I was assuming that what happens above the neck, so to speak, that's going to be psychological.

25:18.520 --> 25:23.160
But our medulla is causing us to breathe and causing our heart to root. I don't think we can

25:23.160 --> 25:30.440
take everything in the brain as psychological. Well, I was being a little loose that way. But

25:30.440 --> 25:38.920
in any case, the brain is not asking the kidneys or the feet or any other part of the body

25:39.880 --> 25:47.320
about this business of going over and killing the prey and eating it. The brain is driving

25:47.320 --> 25:52.040
the rest of the body. So maybe there's a smaller piece of the brain that says,

25:52.040 --> 26:01.160
I know what, I've been around long enough. I'm going to put an end to all of this. It seems to be

26:01.160 --> 26:08.600
a continuity between the brain running the body for killing prey and the brain.

26:08.600 --> 26:15.960
The point was that, as you said, it's not a small piece, but there's one component of the brain's

26:15.960 --> 26:21.880
capacity that is making a decision that is going to terminate the activity of everything else.

26:21.880 --> 26:30.040
It's not, whereas biologically, organisms are designed, not designed, but are built

26:32.040 --> 26:40.280
so that they can persist. Would you agree with that? Yeah, I would. I'm a plant person,

26:40.280 --> 26:49.560
so a lot of the examples that I can give are probably very alien because plants are not alive.

26:49.560 --> 26:55.720
At least a lot of people don't view them as living organisms. But anyway, I can think of a few examples

26:55.720 --> 27:05.960
amongst plants where the entire organism essentially commits suicide. But in each case, it's for

27:05.960 --> 27:14.520
reproduction. So the sunflower, for example, a lot of aquatic plants will reproduce once.

27:14.520 --> 27:23.080
And when they reproduce once, they will divert all of their energy from the somatic, non-reproductive

27:23.080 --> 27:31.160
cells. They'll divert all of their resources into perpetuating, and as close as it can, ensuring

27:31.160 --> 27:38.760
the survival of its progeny. So that is one word that comes to my mind is it's an example of

27:38.760 --> 27:48.520
altruism. It's not saying I'm tired of living. I don't want to live. In fact, it's committing

27:48.520 --> 27:54.760
the ultimate Darwinian self-sacrifice for the fitness of the next generation.

27:54.760 --> 28:02.360
And it's a decision, but it's a process of the entire organism.

28:02.360 --> 28:07.960
It's actually genetically programmed. It's genetic. So I don't know. I'm not going to use

28:07.960 --> 28:13.000
the word consciousness, but it's certainly behavioral. The purpose of the brain is to

28:13.000 --> 28:21.720
regulate the body and to ensure survival. And so it is odd for a human to sort of override that

28:21.720 --> 28:29.640
process. In the case of plants, they're ensuring the longevity of the extended organism.

28:29.640 --> 28:35.400
Right. So the biologist Emil Durkheim had an interesting discussion of all of this.

28:36.040 --> 28:43.080
This is where I'm getting this idea of the human being, the only organism that intentionally

28:43.080 --> 28:54.760
terminates itself. When you mentioned Carl, the development of multicellularity and how now the

28:57.480 --> 29:04.440
cells with similar genetic endowment now, as you said, they've exported their fitness.

29:05.080 --> 29:09.720
And this may sound like it's a digression, but I think it is related to what we're talking about

29:09.720 --> 29:18.440
now. And so does that make rubbish of the self-esteem notion? And I mentioned it in the context of,

29:18.440 --> 29:26.280
well, are there directives, that's called them, from nature, that are at odds with one another?

29:26.280 --> 29:30.360
In this case, you see it. They may line up differently depending on whether it's a

29:31.320 --> 29:36.280
colonial versus a multicellular organism. Well, if you read Dawkins very carefully,

29:36.280 --> 29:45.400
the selfish chain. He's really not saying the gene is in control. He's been interpreted to really

29:45.400 --> 29:53.320
push that point of view. And later on in his subsequent publications, he kind of has. But in

29:53.320 --> 30:03.800
that book, he really is talking about the emergent properties from the level of the genome from the

30:03.800 --> 30:13.080
genetic structure. And we know that genetic structure does not directly map to the phenotype,

30:13.080 --> 30:21.320
to the appearance of the organism. When I was a student at CCNY, I was taught, well, DNA,

30:22.280 --> 30:28.520
messenger RNA protein. We didn't know about alternative splicing. We didn't know about

30:28.520 --> 30:34.920
intrinsically disordered proteins. We didn't know about gene silencing. We didn't know about epigenetics.

30:34.920 --> 30:42.520
What we do know now is you cannot directly map the genotype to the phenotype. And so this

30:42.520 --> 30:49.400
self is gene, the way it's been interpreted in the popular literature, is rubbish.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.960
Well, the idea of the fitness being exported, which I think is a wonderful phrase. I haven't

30:55.960 --> 31:02.440
got a latch onto that. It makes it simple. That's now the element that gets affected by natural

31:02.440 --> 31:06.760
selection. And it's some slightly more abstract sort of thing.

31:07.880 --> 31:13.800
I mean, if you talk about the export of fitness, what you're really saying is the fitness of the

31:13.800 --> 31:21.720
organism does not depend on the number of times individual cells divide. It depends on the number

31:21.720 --> 31:29.800
of times the multicellular organism reproduces. So if you cut off your arm, which is not suicide,

31:29.800 --> 31:37.240
by accident, all those cells are dead. But that's irrelevant. Their fitness has nothing to do with

31:38.040 --> 31:46.280
the individual's capacity to reproduce and produce progeny. So that's one way of thinking about the

31:46.280 --> 31:55.000
export of fitness. It's a major, major transition in every evolutionary lineage that's achieved

31:55.640 --> 31:57.960
complicated multicellularity.

31:59.880 --> 32:05.560
So whereas there are instances of, say, for example, program death like an apoptosis,

32:05.560 --> 32:09.640
and you mentioned an example of the plant, I think Joe, what you're talking about,

32:09.640 --> 32:17.880
still is something different. There's a meaning behind my act, then my life,

32:18.440 --> 32:24.600
which it seems to be in a different sort of concept. So there's a reason out of

32:25.160 --> 32:30.840
this lower level biological functions that might include program death.

32:30.840 --> 32:41.960
It's a higher order thought. Right? Well, I think, so Joe is alluding to my theory of consciousness.

32:42.920 --> 32:50.280
The theory of consciousness is basically along very common sense lines, I think.

32:50.280 --> 33:00.200
If you're in some type of psychological state, the state counts as conscious only if you're aware

33:00.760 --> 33:09.320
of being in that state. And that seems natural because if we have evidence that somebody is in a

33:09.320 --> 33:17.480
certain psychological state, and the person says, no, I don't feel that way. I don't see the stimulus.

33:17.480 --> 33:24.120
I don't have that thought. I don't have that desire, whatever it might be. That's evidence that

33:24.120 --> 33:32.520
the, but we still have evidence that the person is in the state. And it's possible under all these

33:32.520 --> 33:40.200
the conditions that I just mentioned to have such evidence. Then we have a case of, we have a clear

33:40.200 --> 33:48.280
case of an unconscious mental state. So that pretty much implies that what it is for a state to be

33:48.280 --> 33:54.680
conscious is for the individual to be aware of it in some way or another. And what I've argued is

33:57.320 --> 34:02.760
going again from the human case here, though, unlike Joe, I think I would

34:02.760 --> 34:11.320
move down to non-linguistic animals. But in the human case, the standard thing is that if I'm in

34:11.320 --> 34:19.240
a mental state that I am aware of, I can tell you that. And if I tell you that, that's performing a

34:19.240 --> 34:26.600
speech act, I'm saying something, I'm expressing a thought that I'm in that state. So the way that

34:26.600 --> 34:33.800
I'm aware of being in the state is by having a thought about that's basically the theory. And

34:34.600 --> 34:41.240
as Joe mentioned, he likes the theory. He has a slightly different version of it.

34:45.080 --> 34:51.560
So I'd just like to add one thing to what you said, which is that, you know, a lot of people think

34:51.560 --> 34:56.680
I say that animals don't have consciousness, but I don't say that. I say that we don't know what

34:56.680 --> 35:03.960
they have. Precisely because they can't tell us. And we can't use behavior as a reliable indicator

35:03.960 --> 35:10.040
of what an animal is experiencing. For example, this has been tempted in the area of emotion with

35:10.040 --> 35:17.640
the amygdala in fear. We assume that because a rat in a person both frees to danger, and in both

35:17.640 --> 35:25.480
cases, the amygdala is required to freeze to danger, that must mean that the rat and the person both

35:25.480 --> 35:30.040
feel fear, and that the rat feels fear because the person feels fear and they're both using the

35:30.040 --> 35:36.600
amygdala. But the assumption is wrong that, you know, often when we are running from a bear,

35:36.600 --> 35:44.920
we are afraid. But that doesn't mean that fear is what causes us to run. They're not the same

35:44.920 --> 35:51.240
thing. Those are correlations, not causation. Every scientist is taught from day one to not confuse

35:51.240 --> 35:57.800
correlation and causation. And yet we've been kind of seduced by this correlation to think that if

35:57.800 --> 36:04.120
an animal or a person is responding to danger, it must be because they're afraid. But when we look

36:04.120 --> 36:09.000
in the brain and start trying to analyze how fear is coming about, we see that there are people

36:09.000 --> 36:14.600
who have damage to the amygdala, that under some conditions can still report fear. So

36:14.600 --> 36:21.560
also if we present stimuli to a person subliminally, so the person that means a very quick flash,

36:21.560 --> 36:27.320
for example, that means the person doesn't know the stimulus is there, doesn't report feeling any

36:27.320 --> 36:33.000
fear, but the amygdala is activated, the heart is racing, palms are sweating. So the responses are

36:33.000 --> 36:37.560
there, but fear is not what's driving them. That doesn't mean fear is irrelevant, it's just not

36:37.560 --> 36:43.000
what the amygdala is doing. So we have to look elsewhere for where the amygdala might, or where

36:43.000 --> 36:51.320
fear may be coming from, and building on your theory, I and others have talked about high-order

36:51.320 --> 36:56.120
states involving prefrontal cortex. In fact, you and Hawkewan Laude written about prefrontal

36:56.120 --> 37:02.760
cortex. So let me just say a couple of words about prefrontal cortex. There are different

37:02.760 --> 37:10.360
parts of the prefrontal cortex, one of which has properties that are only found in the human brain,

37:10.360 --> 37:16.040
and this is called the frontal pole. Now there are other parts of the prefrontal cortex, for example,

37:16.040 --> 37:21.640
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that are only found in primates including other humans,

37:21.640 --> 37:27.880
and this has also been actually implicated in consciousness in humans. So I'm willing to say,

37:27.880 --> 37:33.320
yes, probably other primates because they have this part of the brain could very well have some

37:33.320 --> 37:39.160
kind of awareness, but an awareness that is made possible by that kind of prefrontal cortex,

37:39.160 --> 37:45.160
as opposed to the other kind. So my idea would be that these dorsolateral regions shared by all

37:45.160 --> 37:52.040
primates are involved in a kind of knowledge of what's there, whereas the frontal pole, for

37:52.040 --> 37:58.280
reasons I won't go into other than that it's relatively unique in humans, might be involved in

37:58.280 --> 38:04.600
the ability to know that it's you that is aware of what's there. So that extra higher-order thought,

38:04.600 --> 38:11.880
that that awareness that you have, it's definitely worth pursuing in terms of this frontal pole.

38:11.880 --> 38:17.480
We don't have an answer to this question yet, but in your paper with Hawk 1 Law in 2011,

38:17.480 --> 38:21.640
you mentioned the frontal pole and that's really how I got onto the frontal poles, and thank you.

38:22.520 --> 38:29.480
But now if we go to other mammals, there are a bunch of prefrontal regions that are present

38:29.480 --> 38:36.840
in these animals, but on the medial side of the hemisphere, inside the, we have the two hemispheres

38:36.840 --> 38:42.360
of the hot dog one, and we spread them apart, so the white, untested part would be where the

38:42.360 --> 38:51.400
medial areas are, and these are the mustard. Yeah, and the dog, yeah, or ketchup. But the,

38:51.960 --> 38:57.720
so these other mammals have these medial prefrontal areas, and this may

38:57.720 --> 39:05.400
allow a kind of body awareness that is another level down, that beyond that knowledge that,

39:05.880 --> 39:12.120
you know, that they understand what's out there, and beyond their knowledge that they know that

39:12.120 --> 39:15.960
it's them that's having that state. So I allow for all these things that just don't know how we

39:15.960 --> 39:24.920
would test it. So here's the thing, there's an experiment that Alan Cowie and Petra Sturring did

39:24.920 --> 39:40.760
with some macarcomonkeys. So blind sight is a condition where some area of primary visual cortex

39:41.320 --> 39:52.760
is ablated or damaged, doesn't function. And if a person with blind sight is presented with a stimulus

39:52.760 --> 40:00.920
that goes to that area of primary visual cortex, the person will say, and I'm seeing anything.

40:02.120 --> 40:10.680
On the other hand, the person will be able to guess if the experimenter presses the person to guess

40:11.720 --> 40:19.800
you say, well, guess about what the nature of the stimulus was that you're saying you didn't see,

40:19.800 --> 40:26.280
and the subject will say, well, I can't guess, I didn't see anything, please just guess,

40:26.280 --> 40:32.040
and they get it more or less around 83% of the time correct, which is very good.

40:33.400 --> 40:43.800
And there have been a number of human subjects of this sort, and the results are pretty constant.

40:43.800 --> 40:54.840
So what Cowie and Sturring did was to surgically ablate, I think it was the right side,

40:58.840 --> 41:06.440
the left side of primary visual cortex will see the right visual field.

41:06.440 --> 41:19.320
And they had a monkey that in two separate experiments performed as follows. The monkey was able to reach out

41:19.320 --> 41:29.160
and touch something in the right visual field, even though that's the blind sight area for that monkey.

41:29.160 --> 41:38.040
Then several months later, the monkey was trained to distinguish between a stimulus in the left side

41:38.040 --> 41:47.000
and a blank. So if there's something, you press it. If it's a blank, you press another button, which is the

41:47.000 --> 41:56.920
blank button. And then it turned out that this monkey would press the blank button for a stimulus in the right side.

41:56.920 --> 42:06.040
So the monkey is able to do pretty much what a human can do. That is to say, in a certain way, the monkey is able to guess

42:06.040 --> 42:17.160
that there is something there, and the monkey also says, I don't see anything. And it seems to me that it's hard to explain that pair of results

42:17.160 --> 42:29.560
without assuming that the monkey has blind sight. That is to say that there's a difference for the monkey between seeing and consciously seeing.

42:29.560 --> 42:39.800
So I'll just refer to what Larry Weisbrand said about that, which is that yes, it looks like they're seeing, but because it's an animal,

42:39.800 --> 42:49.720
we can't, Larry Weisbrand says that the person who discovered blind sight and has popularized it. And also, in the commentary piece of Coward's story, we're using Larry said,

42:49.720 --> 42:56.840
we think that the animal is conscious, but we simply don't know scientifically that there's no proof.

42:56.840 --> 43:08.120
So Larry was the one who told me that this particular experiment was produced. I don't. But in the conversation he told me, he thinks this is Evans.

43:08.120 --> 43:16.400
And it's a finding, Joe, that I think is hard to explain any other way. So,

43:16.400 --> 43:18.880
I'm not questioning what it's saying.

43:18.880 --> 43:34.920
Can't surrender for a hypothesis. What's the hypothesis that would explain the fact that the monkey can actually detect, but the monkey presses the blank button for a stimulus on that side.

43:34.920 --> 43:39.080
I'm willing to admit it's possible. I'm sorry. I'm willing to admit it's possible.

43:39.080 --> 43:46.800
But the other explanation would be that there's some sort of disposition to act that doesn't necessarily include what we often refer to as consciousness.

43:46.800 --> 43:50.760
Right? Isn't that? I mean, even when that is exactly.

43:50.760 --> 43:54.800
But what I'm asking for an explanation of is the pair of results.

43:54.800 --> 44:11.000
Why is it? So if a stimulus is presented on the left side, the monkey presses the stimulus, where the stimulus is on the screen.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.640
If no stimulus on the left side presses blank.

44:15.640 --> 44:20.200
And if the stimulus on the right side presses blank.

44:20.200 --> 44:27.560
And so that's one kind of experiment. And the other kind of experiment is that the monkey can actually detect it.

44:27.560 --> 44:40.800
So it seems as though there's a distinction between the ability to detect, which I'm suggesting corresponds to the human's guessing on the one hand.

44:40.800 --> 44:44.600
And the monkey is counting it as a blank.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.240
Whatever it means for blank.

44:47.240 --> 44:51.400
The blank means I don't see anything.

44:51.400 --> 44:55.760
I'm not sure if this is relevant. And please, I'm apologizing.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.480
I'm speaking as a botanist.

44:58.480 --> 45:13.520
But I think it was philosopher Ned Block that made the difference between the phenomenology of responding and receiving signals.

45:13.520 --> 45:19.680
And the phenomenology of being aware of those signals.

45:19.680 --> 45:31.920
And so I'd like to point out that plants, which lack a neurological system, but nevertheless have an electrical signaling system within them,

45:31.920 --> 45:38.360
clearly perceive external stimuli and respond to them adaptively.

45:38.360 --> 45:43.600
So that's kind of a phenomenological awareness.

45:43.600 --> 45:53.960
But it's by no means self-awareness. There's no reflection as we might project from our own experiences.

45:53.960 --> 45:57.920
So this thing called consciousness is a touchy subject.

45:57.920 --> 46:04.480
I'm not sure. I think it was John Locke who actually used the word consciousness for the first time.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.720
He was Descartes.

46:05.720 --> 46:13.440
Was it? Well, Locke said consciousness is what happens in man's mind.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.280
And that was the definition.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.480
Not the definitions are holding.

46:18.480 --> 46:25.200
But I would just say that there's one attribute that I think defines all forms of life.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.800
And when I was a young person, oh, God.

46:28.800 --> 46:38.600
It's not only a century ago, but a millennium ago, the biology book said life is defined by irritability.

46:38.600 --> 46:44.960
And then you read on it and it says, and as I get older, I become more irritable.

46:44.960 --> 46:50.360
But what it was really saying was that life responds.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.120
It reacts to external stimuli.

46:53.120 --> 46:56.840
And I think that is from bacteria all the way up to us.

46:56.840 --> 47:04.200
But this thing about consciousness being self-awareness, as I have to agree,

47:04.200 --> 47:12.960
I'm not sure that any primate other than us has been shown to be truly self-aware.

47:12.960 --> 47:18.200
I think in your book, Joe, you do spend a lot of time trying to push back against certain intuitions.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.680
Even you criticize Darwin for this in a way.

47:21.680 --> 47:29.840
For adopting anthropomorphism, maybe prematurely, or as you say prematurely.

47:29.840 --> 47:37.360
I think it's such a woolly concept, consciousness, because we also mean slightly different things

47:37.360 --> 47:39.120
than we use in different sentences, for example.

47:39.120 --> 47:43.600
But I'm interested in the famous story about running from a bear.

47:43.600 --> 47:48.400
Because I think where you might also lose some of your audience is that it would seem to me

47:48.400 --> 47:53.360
whatever impels me to start running when I see a bear, at some point along the line,

47:53.360 --> 47:58.160
especially if I think about it, hypothetically, I get fearful.

47:58.160 --> 48:06.000
And I can imagine even in the actual event of running away, halfway down the whatever it is.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.560
It's not a block, I guess, of a mirror bear.

48:08.560 --> 48:11.760
But you are fearful, but it is your fear of the cause?

48:11.760 --> 48:12.800
Right, right, exactly right.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.800
So at some point, it certainly kicks in.

48:14.800 --> 48:15.520
That's for sure.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.120
Maybe, Chris, I can't.

48:17.120 --> 48:25.120
In the history of the study of emotion, there's a tradition of assuming that there's some centrally

48:25.120 --> 48:28.320
organized state that is causing behaviors.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.640
And you see that as far back as Plato, right?

48:30.640 --> 48:35.920
And Darwin was certainly guilty of this, and perhaps is the one who has sort of ushered

48:35.920 --> 48:40.400
that idea into modern science.

48:40.400 --> 48:46.080
And yet, behaviors are often emerging more quickly than conscious experiences.

48:46.080 --> 48:51.840
And so the brain is perceiving behaviors as they're unfolding.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.240
It's perceiving stimuli in the world around it.

48:54.240 --> 49:00.000
It's perceiving vis-a-motor changes in the body and is categorizing those experiences.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.560
But there's not clear evidence that there is some centralized mechanism that is fear

49:06.560 --> 49:10.120
per se that is causing a certain suite of behaviors or anger per se that's causing a

49:10.120 --> 49:12.600
sort of sort of a suite of behaviors.

49:12.600 --> 49:19.000
I was just thinking about how when you're addressing people and trying to explain that,

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
there's such a kind of pushback because our conscious, you know, deliberations about

49:25.000 --> 49:29.200
these episodes so strongly inserts fear.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
That's right.

49:30.200 --> 49:34.200
You know, if all we needed was intuition, we wouldn't have to do experiments.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.480
Science would be irrelevant.

49:36.480 --> 49:42.320
So I mean, intuition is often the starting point of an experiment, some scientific endeavor.

49:42.320 --> 49:47.400
All, you know, men we live in our heads, we live in our folk psychology.

49:47.400 --> 49:52.160
And this is why we do psychology and one understands how it all works.

49:52.160 --> 49:57.360
But ultimately, we have to get to what's going on in terms of how these processes really

49:57.360 --> 49:58.520
work.

49:58.520 --> 50:05.040
And what I've tried to argue is that the processes that control these innate behaviors,

50:05.040 --> 50:10.760
like freezing or escape, are separate from those that are making us feel fear.

50:10.760 --> 50:14.880
And I think this is consistent with Kristin's work as well.

50:14.880 --> 50:19.120
You know, it's the, we're innately anthropomorphic.

50:19.120 --> 50:24.160
I mean, it's been said that anthropomorphism was very useful to our early ancestors as

50:24.160 --> 50:29.280
they were living with cows and creating farming and agriculture.

50:29.280 --> 50:35.000
It was helpful to treat animals as little people, big people would have been on the

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
animal.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.920
And that, you know, because they were partners in this process, maybe not equal partners

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
or enough.

50:42.920 --> 50:47.640
One guy, he didn't even know that.

50:47.640 --> 50:52.640
And so something could be innate in our brain and yet not be scientifically correct because

50:52.640 --> 50:55.560
it's not about whether it's scientifically accurate.

50:55.560 --> 50:58.240
It's about whether it was useful to our species.

50:58.240 --> 51:03.800
So you know, I say this almost every lecture I give, I go home, I pet my cat, he purrs,

51:03.800 --> 51:05.040
and I think he's happy.

51:05.040 --> 51:08.680
You don't have to be a scientist every moment of your working life.

51:08.680 --> 51:12.000
Science is a different thing than life.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.760
We, you know, we lead our lives in the ways and sometimes science is useful in leading

51:15.760 --> 51:16.960
our lives.

51:16.960 --> 51:23.240
But certainly it's not a way to, if you didn't have another hat, you could never have a pet

51:23.240 --> 51:27.040
if you were a materialist, scientist like me.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.040
Right.

51:28.040 --> 51:32.680
I would argue that we're not just innately anthropomorphic, but we innately assign agency

51:32.680 --> 51:33.680
to things.

51:33.680 --> 51:39.800
And so we infer intention from behaviors because it's a useful shortcut, cognitively.

51:39.800 --> 51:46.240
And therefore we are likely to infer intention of other people's behaviors in animals behaviors,

51:46.240 --> 51:50.280
in natural events, in ways that they don't actually exist.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
Cartoon characters.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
Right.

51:52.280 --> 51:53.280
And plants.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.280
Yeah.

51:54.280 --> 52:03.560
The one advantage to being a botanist is that your study organisms don't bleed on you.

52:03.560 --> 52:08.520
And the other is that it's almost impossible to project human emotions when you're looking

52:08.520 --> 52:09.520
at an organism.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.880
I think some people do that.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.040
Well, yes.

52:12.040 --> 52:21.440
But as a scientist who studies plants, I have no fear about projecting human emotions or

52:21.440 --> 52:23.120
attributes to plants.

52:23.120 --> 52:29.080
Now, what about this, this, maybe that rubbish of the touring test?

52:29.080 --> 52:30.080
You know, what?

52:30.080 --> 52:36.160
Well, the idea that we answer more fives away from valentoring said famously that if you

52:36.160 --> 52:40.040
are interacting with a computer program and you can't tell the difference about whether

52:40.040 --> 52:44.000
it's a conscious being or not, then it's conscious.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.880
So this line of argument would suggest that's just totally wrong.

52:47.880 --> 52:58.800
Well, I think Turing's idea is that Turing imagined that Turing was considering whether

52:58.800 --> 53:05.600
you could have a computer program that would be as elaborate and flexible as a person would

53:05.600 --> 53:07.080
be.

53:07.080 --> 53:16.240
So that's not, I think, along the lines of anthropomorphizing an elephant or a palm tree

53:16.240 --> 53:17.240
so much.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.240
Right.

53:18.240 --> 53:26.080
But he's relying on the notion of acceptable anthropomorphization as a criterion for consciousness.

53:26.080 --> 53:38.480
Well, he's relying on a particular hypothesis that humans are able to react in a conversational

53:38.480 --> 53:46.120
setting like this in marvelously flexible, unpredictable ways.

53:46.120 --> 53:55.880
And so some very smart programmer, he was a very smart programmer, might be able to design

53:55.880 --> 54:06.200
a program so that a very smart psychologist wouldn't be able to tell whether a program

54:06.200 --> 54:14.280
was behind the screen or a person was typing out answers.

54:14.280 --> 54:22.520
And so it's a particular hypothesis about, I think, the nature of human thinking rather

54:22.520 --> 54:27.400
than something having to do with anthropomorphizing.

54:27.400 --> 54:32.920
A thought that has occurred to me while listening to this is, and it's a question I'm not sure

54:32.920 --> 54:39.040
anyone's really ever asked is, when does the individual human being become conscious?

54:39.040 --> 54:46.880
We started out as a fertilized egg, as I go through the blastula, gastrula, etymological

54:46.880 --> 54:47.880
modifications.

54:47.880 --> 54:48.880
Right.

54:48.880 --> 54:57.280
The point is that that's the same organism throughout its ontology.

54:57.280 --> 55:05.000
And this attribute that we call consciousness makes its appearance at some stage in that

55:05.000 --> 55:07.280
ontogenetic sequence.

55:07.280 --> 55:14.920
So it's fair to say that we're not conscious throughout our entire embryology or in many

55:14.920 --> 55:19.920
parts of our life, or most of our life.

55:19.920 --> 55:23.040
It's worth making a few distinctions.

55:23.040 --> 55:30.840
One distinction, we use the word conscious to distinguish between the way we all are now

55:30.840 --> 55:36.840
here, and when we're asleep we're knocked out or amesthetized or something like that.

55:36.840 --> 55:50.160
So that's one kind of consciousness that has to do something like biological functioning.

55:50.160 --> 55:57.920
We also use the word conscious, so unconscious of a table, unconscious of a water bottle.

55:57.920 --> 56:08.800
So and it might be that the psychological state, the visual state in virtual work, where the

56:08.800 --> 56:16.880
table in front of me is an unconscious visual state, one of these subliminal states.

56:16.880 --> 56:22.720
So if you say, well, David, is there a table in front of you, I would say now there isn't.

56:22.720 --> 56:30.160
But then if you ran some tests like priming tests or force choice or whatever, you wouldn't

56:30.160 --> 56:31.320
be able to see actually.

56:31.320 --> 56:33.080
I was seeing the table.

56:33.080 --> 56:38.360
So I was conscious of the table, but not consciously conscious.

56:38.360 --> 56:44.960
And sometimes this appears in the popular press as a distinction between being aware of the

56:44.960 --> 56:47.840
table and being consciously aware of the table.

56:47.840 --> 56:53.880
So my question gets back to this.

56:53.880 --> 57:04.240
These three things that developmentally will emerge at some point with an animal's development.

57:04.240 --> 57:08.880
My statement actually was meant to provoke that kind of response.

57:08.880 --> 57:16.120
But also to point out that, not that I'm heckle saying that on Tajini recapitulates

57:16.120 --> 57:20.760
by Rajini, but it's kind of interesting that when you look at the tree of life from unicellular

57:20.760 --> 57:29.400
to multicellular, from simple multicellular to complicated multicellular, from early primates

57:29.400 --> 57:37.360
to late primates of which we're the most recent example, the question may be the last.

57:37.360 --> 57:45.080
The question is when does it make its appearance that we would say this thing is self-conscious.

57:45.080 --> 57:51.880
And so that's even beyond what I was talking about.

57:51.880 --> 57:58.200
So if we're talking about the difference between seeing something consciously and seeing it

57:58.200 --> 58:03.600
subliminally, that's not a matter of self-consciousness.

58:03.600 --> 58:06.520
That's something more primitive.

58:06.520 --> 58:12.760
And then Joe talks in the book a fair amount about this.

58:12.760 --> 58:19.480
This is this notion that he borrows from Endel Tovin about auto-noetic consciousness.

58:19.480 --> 58:27.240
I'm not completely comfortable with the distinction between auto-noetic consciousness and noetic

58:27.240 --> 58:28.720
consciousness.

58:28.720 --> 58:38.560
But at least something that involves reflective awareness in itself is a more advanced stage

58:38.560 --> 58:42.480
of development than simply consciously seeing.

58:42.480 --> 58:49.720
So Michael Lewis is a developmental psychologist, has written a book called the Dawn of Consciousness

58:49.720 --> 58:52.440
or something like that for you exactly in the title.

58:52.440 --> 59:00.560
And then that he proposes that the child becomes conscious in an adult kind of sense with the

59:00.560 --> 59:04.880
development of personal pronouns around the age of two or three.

59:04.880 --> 59:11.000
So that you now have something to hang your understanding of who you are, I, me, mine.

59:11.000 --> 59:19.960
And it's not that the child was asleep all that time, but didn't have a sense of me the

59:19.960 --> 59:21.880
way you have when you have a concept.

59:21.880 --> 59:27.040
I think maybe Christian can say a lot about concepts and emotions and consciousness and

59:27.040 --> 59:28.040
so forth.

59:28.040 --> 59:32.080
Yeah, so there's a lot of developmentalists who argue that self-awareness in children

59:32.080 --> 59:39.080
emerges around two or three around or 18 months around the time that they can identify themselves

59:39.080 --> 59:43.360
from other individuals via this mirror self-recognition task.

59:43.360 --> 59:48.920
So you put a dot on the child's head and you make them look in the mirror and instead of

59:48.920 --> 59:53.040
touching the other baby in the mirror, they touch their own forehead.

59:53.040 --> 59:57.000
And it's thought that that is an indication of the self.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:06.400
But the self, like any concept, is a concept that is accumulated over time that you are

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.640
you and you have certain features and certain likes and certain dislikes.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:17.680
And it's clear that that's something that emerges over top of their hood.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:25.560
But your comment was interesting regarding ontogeny as it sort of recopitulates the phylogeny

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.960
that Joe outlines in the book because it is this gradual process, right?

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:42.880
And there's an urge to infer these stages at which they're shifts and it's much more

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.880
complicated than that.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.560
Yeah, I'll go back to that analogy that I made with visible light when you break it

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:54.320
up with a spectrum that you know you go from one frequency to the next, click, click, click,

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.760
click, you go from red to blue and in between are all the colors of the rainbow.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:04.160
And there are demonstrable thresholds when we would all agree this is yellow, this is

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.960
orange, this is green.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:12.360
And yet it's a continuum as a process, which to me is rather interesting even from an evolutionary

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.800
point of view because as you probably all aware there's an argument between sultational

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.880
evolution and gradualistic evolution.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.000
And I don't see them as necessarily mutually exclusive by virtue of that analogy that I

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.880
can get you know go from a fish to a terrestrial thing or an amphibian and that doesn't mean

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:39.040
that I had to go through a massive reorganization of the body structure of the organism.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:44.320
You know that analogy really answers the question I was about to pose, it doesn't completely

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:50.120
answer I think, but that is I think what an amazing sort of miracle or a mystery is that

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.680
we all pass through this developmental stage when we're unconscious and become conscious

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.080
and then likewise every day there are lots of instances where we're self aware or not

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
self aware.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.160
I'm thinking of the example of driving in the car and something that you're very you

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.680
know and then you suddenly realize where's my mind been all this time even though obviously

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.560
we're responding to the thing but the I think well that's an amazing miracle why can't

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.760
we pinpoint why we're like well that's aha that's where I became conscious because we

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.920
don't and we don't know that but it's interesting with the analogy with the color spectrum is

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.400
because you know there are those odd ball colors between yellow and orange let's say

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.520
or blue and purple where we might stop and think I don't know where the line is here

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.200
I'm not sure where the line is right and that may be some I don't know I'm putting out

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:44.360
there's a possible analogy to our difficulty knowing when we're fully conscious or not

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:48.800
you know coming back to more complicated in terms of emotions I mean we have these specific

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:57.320
words that we use and you know but the gradations are not so clear and Kristin you've done a

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:03.080
lot of work on emotion words and also in terms of culture and maybe you could yeah I was

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.200
actually going to start that off with the color analogy which is interesting because

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.520
it turns out that there are actually cultural differences and where people see cut points

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:19.120
and visible spectrum of light and you know there's hot debate surrounding this but it

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.440
does seem that you know even within a culture people disagree on where you know where the

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.640
categories begin and end and certainly across cultures people disagree about where color

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.440
categories begin and end now if that's the case for color emotion is much more complicated

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:44.640
and there much of my work has shown that the emotion words that people know and acquire

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.920
through their culture name rich sets of categories that help people to parsley the world into

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:59.320
emotional meaning and so the richer your emotion vocabulary the more likely you are to see

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.800
instances of these categories in the world around you and so in that sense to come full

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:11.280
circle to the point about language humans may have a unique form of consciousness that

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:19.920
is predicated on their ability to use language which essentially warps perceptual space it

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920
makes certain things look more similar together to one another and certain things look more

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.520
distinct from one another and that's not to say that animals don't have complex representations

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.720
but the question then becomes one of gradation again right so to the extent that animals

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.560
have the ability to represent these rich caches of knowledge in an abstract way they may or

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.400
may not have emotion concepts that that look something like humans you know I think it's

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.680
interesting that we can translate a word like fear across languages but obviously we know

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.720
that there are cultural differences in the experience of these things but we assume because

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.360
we have the same word we're all experiencing the same thing and this is you know a huge

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:10.560
problem in geopolitical politics where we take the translation literally but it means

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:16.360
acts to the people who are listening to the translation and why do the people from whom

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:21.800
the translation is coming from so I mean words are our friend but also can get us into trouble

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:28.280
with sloppy use and I think scientists are often very sloppy with words I have a percidifical

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:43.760
these happen even in very local context and very often because you know people are being

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:50.120
nice they don't say anything about it or they may not notice it but I don't think that you

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.120
have to travel across national boundaries or language of culture and that is the bad

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.760
thing yeah you're gonna say something oh I was gonna be personal example I was writing

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.840
a book with a German colleague and we were working together week after week a lot of

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.040
math and we decided that one day we would speak English and the next day we would speak

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:18.960
German so our brains didn't fry and at one point the day we spoke English I'm trying to

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.600
explain something to Christoph and he said 999 that it doesn't make sense so I said it

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.960
in German he said oh yeah

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:39.400
that's a joke you do make a very interesting introduction to this topic of deliberation

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.480
as a chapter on that I think this goes back to maybe even the example with the monkeys

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:51.720
there's this I guess one one thing to make some of us believe that an animal might be

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:57.400
conscious if they seem to deliberate they're conscious themselves I know the stoic philosopher

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:05.400
Christophus mentioned that would describe how animals for example who might be preparing

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:15.120
to leap over crevasse will size up their ability to do it and seem to be in some way deliberating

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:23.160
and aware and he uses as a he believes a demonstration that there's some degree of self-awareness

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.680
at least in that regard I I know how far I might be able to jump or not and will I do

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:33.760
it so sometimes the animal back off and sometimes it kind of a week and that's a very interesting

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.840
challenge to the idea that animals aren't conscious I mean I'm not saying I accept him

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.000
but I think it's everything interesting sort of you know one of the points I tried to

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.640
make about deliberation was that you have to distinguish conscious from non-conscious

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:54.680
deliberation so our cognitive capacities are a lot of what we do is done non-consciously

01:07:54.680 --> 01:08:01.440
we make decisions all the time and we may justify them after the fact consciously but

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:06.760
you know in the process of making snap decisions we're not like analyzing everything consciously

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:13.120
so the animal that's making that snap decision whether they jump or not or maybe it's you

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.560
know maybe it's not so snap but you don't know that it's consciously exploring it's

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.400
probably is I'm not saying it's not right but it's an interesting challenge because

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:28.320
it's just so much appears to be that but I would add to the worry that sometimes at

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:37.360
least it seems to me and other people that I took to what happens well I don't know whether

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:47.480
to do A or B and instead of being Aristotle and whatever Aristotle was saying about deliberating

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:53.360
which would be very conscious I turn my mind off so to speak though I don't turn my mind

01:08:53.360 --> 01:09:01.080
off but I turn I stop thinking about it consciously and I let it simmer and you know it's going

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:08.680
on somewhere but I'm not paying any oh then I see things clearly and so this is the unconscious

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:14.720
processes that are doing the work which really are deliberating many instances yes I'm not

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:24.640
suggesting that they aren't deliberating I'm suggesting that they aren't conscious and

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.520
that we can't extrapolate from deliberation to consciousness I agree with that Joe may

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:38.720
be familiar with this work but there's evidence that you can look at cells that map out space

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:45.400
in a non-human animal and as the animal is preparing to behave it's simulating which pathway

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.880
it's going to take and you can see that playing out in the firing of the cells and then the

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:55.000
question becomes is that deliberation right so again we need to be careful with our with

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:07.120
our definitions it's amazing what it is well it's something like a decision making process

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:16.640
so was you worry about whether it's deliberation whether it's conscious deliberation I'm just

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.080
pointing out again that it's slippery right where where we begin to infer some sort of

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.480
human-like state right humans certainly deliberate by saying oh should I take you know this route

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:33.240
or this route but if the if the animal brain is is simulating these future events and sort

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.520
of weighing which one to guide behavior the question is that's something that's all you

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:46.520
know space and place cell and all that came from Tolman's observations that rats are deliberating

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:53.000
as they go through a maze and then there's a middle modeling of the maze so yeah I think

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.640
you know there's a lot of stuff that happens outside of what we're thinking about plant

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.040
roots are an example actually a number of measurements showing how roots penetrate the

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:11.720
soil that the tips are the growing points of the root and you will occasionally see the

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:21.400
tip of the root stop growing and it's sensing and we know the mechanism which is the weakest

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:28.640
root and that's the one it follows so you know is that deliberation but it's it's really

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:40.520
perceiving alternatives and it adaptively takes the easy way out so to speak so Joe just

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:50.120
go back to the you know your question earlier about the hard sell about that it's not fear

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:55.760
that's causing us to respond this time so this is coming at it from a different angle but

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:01.200
this is your field in terms of psychopharmacology and so let me ask you a question how would

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:07.240
you evaluate current treatments psychopharmacological treatments for novel treatments for anxiety

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:15.440
right now well haven't much evolved over the last you know forty years 40 years I guess

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:24.480
it reminds me of your comment you know that people could not have an amygdala and still

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:30.840
have fear you know it's very difficult to pin down exactly the conscious experience

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:38.320
of fear but you know it's interesting there's some interaction between the sort of sheer

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:47.040
physiological response like for example in a panic attack and the experience of avoiding

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.400
behavior right because we usually in psychiatry think we don't talk about fear actually is

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.680
that much in literature I mean usually which is it is a shame people patients certainly

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:05.000
do but more avoid behavior and so most of the efforts are made to tamp down a lot of

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.720
physiological responses and I think it was interesting we've spoken about Donald Klein

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:15.520
earlier who was the psychiatrist recently passed away who distinguished panic anxiety

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.400
from sort of generalized anxiety and he'd also discovered that the mid-permine which

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.960
is one of the older antidepressants seemed to be effective for that and was better than

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:31.360
taking a benzoylous like Valium or Xanax and that was a very interesting breakthrough

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:37.720
because it did seem to create a very distinct and unanticipated benefit from a class of drugs

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.200
there was no reason to think aside from what got Don thinking about it no obvious reason

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.200
to think if that would work but it does actually help and there are a lot of theories about

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.600
why that's so but there is this sort of residual problem of patients going through this and

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:59.080
still being troubled by avoid behavior I mean another example would be PTSD it's very difficult

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:07.160
to get people to despite all sorts of pharmacological and behavioral treatments if they succeed

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.720
sometimes of course but there's no you know perfect solution to those things

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:18.040
Danny Pine and a psychiatrist and I wrote a paper a few years ago I know I said so in

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:27.040
this paper we reviewed the efforts to find medications and so forth to help people with

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.360
problems of fear and anxiety and I guess more anxiety than fear because you said it's not

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:37.840
as fear is not talked about as much but one of the things that comes up is the fact that

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.880
the pharmaceutical industry is getting out of the business of developing new treatments

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:50.400
and the reason is because nothing has been discovered over the last 40 years really and

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:58.800
so what we propose in this paper is the problem is not with the studies that are being done

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:04.400
but with the interpretation that's being applied to them because the way the research is done

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.760
is to work on for example avoid a behavior in rats or mice and to assume that that's

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.080
going to make the person less fearful or anxious but because the amygdala and these subcortical

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.760
circuits that control those behaviors are not generating the fear and anxiety itself

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:28.000
the subjective experience the patients don't quote feel better so the problem is that we

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.280
assume that you have this fear center that can be targeted by drug and that if you change

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:41.840
that fear center the person is better but that's not how it works I mean the subjective

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:49.680
experience of the patient has to be an endpoint and I think this is not my field as an outsider

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:55.360
it seems that subjective experience has been marginalized in the field both in cognitive

01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:02.400
therapy and in pharmaceutical therapy as a goal of the whole process well I'll say since

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.000
we're sitting here at the Ndibsy you know psychoanalysts don't make that mistake I know

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:14.000
right but they do give a lot of consideration to that but I like to say when patients challenge

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.320
me about how long is taking from them to get better that is a little bit of a cheek out

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.640
but I'll say look it's an amazing your mind's unbelievably complex and complicated and it's

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.400
not a tremendous shock that it's difficult to fix it I don't think you'd want to be simpler

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.560
so that it would be easy to find a drug to do this and I really do think that's true

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.720
if you imagine consciousness that's why that's also what brought the mind the story about

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.760
running away from the bear maybe somewhere along the line I'd say well for sure now I'm

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:51.400
just beautiful to bear right whether or not I first bolted because I saw one and that the

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:59.280
symbolic rendering of a fearful object or a beloved object or of the object of jealousy

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:06.080
whatever whatever so the symbolic representation that may very well sit in the very part of

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.240
the brain that you're interested in you know associating with consciousness of a prefrontal

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:21.600
pole and the mechanisms which are novel to humans you say and I accept are not the sorts

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.920
of mechanisms that respond easily to be infused with a certain molecule so I don't think it

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.440
would be possible to change the content of a conscious thought with a drug I mean how

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.800
would you even design that exactly that's exactly what I'd say you know what's interesting

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.440
because the sort of operas is that is patients because they've read that some drugs can induce

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.960
suicidal thinking really which I think is done more badly more bad than good because a lot

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.880
of people stay away from medicines and otherwise help them really literally get this notion

01:17:53.880 --> 01:18:00.280
that this will put this idea in my head you know and I guess in some sense that's kind

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:06.240
of true but it's not it's not an idea that's being inserted in their head right at some

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:12.480
level of arousal and agitation and dysphoria and happiness that might then lead to it but

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.560
it's not as though you're suddenly brainwashed that's this sort of idea and that's exactly

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:23.880
why when we're trying to make people unfuriful and when their object of fear can be a very

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.600
complex affair it could be very not just a bear but something much more complicated

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:33.600
than that it's very difficult to figure out a way to neutralize those I think the drug

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:40.040
companies would be better off if they sold these as avoidant medicines or you know physiological

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:45.880
arousal producers that would be much more accurate and it would create the right expectation

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:51.240
of what's going to happen with the medication as opposed to fear or anxiety medication absolutely

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:59.200
I know I look I think you know the basic outline of how the mental health field tries

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:05.360
to deal with these conditions is reasonable enough I'd say because but it's not in practice

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:11.480
always done very well that is the most people understand I guess PTSD is a great example

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:17.320
of this because it's so difficult to treat and many people who have that condition do

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.000
take medications for it and I think for good reason but it's very clear that's just one

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.640
step in a sort of rehabilitation and the rehabilitation which is sort of like the rehabilitation of

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:35.320
another chronic illnesses involve you know what involve a community you know it's not

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:44.400
just this thing or that and getting them better they need therapy demands they need to expose

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:52.800
themselves to what they're fearful of this reminds me of a large body of literature and

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:58.200
some of which is greatly debated but what's called the integrative phenotype and that

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:04.920
is it's as you go into more and more complicated organisms and I'm not sure we can identify

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:10.280
or quantify complication but we can think of the human mind is one of the most complicated

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:16.320
organs that it's such an integrated phenotype that it's very difficult to target a particular

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:25.040
aspect of that phenotype that doesn't have a generic effect and you know much of science

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:33.000
is reductionism we think that we can reduce complicated ideas to some very simple phenomena

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:39.040
and laws but as we really begin to look at biology in particular we realize that reductionism

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:47.960
is only the first step after you reduce all the components you then have to rebuild conceptually

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:55.280
and integrate all of those factors and then you see a large number of emergent properties

01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:02.120
that could never have been predicted based on those very simple physical laws and relationships

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:10.840
so I'm resonating with this discussion about pharmacological solutions to behavioral issues

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:20.520
because it's not it's one organ and you're looking at just one facet of its behavior.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:29.560
There's another condition that's not as often advertised as being a common target for psychotherapy

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:35.040
or psychopharmacology and that is the state and this pertains to consciousness state of

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:42.640
depersonalization where people feel detached from themselves and what's amazing here again

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:51.480
is I think that term covers a wide gamut of experiences I mean I've had patients who say

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:58.920
they feel they have no like as if they had no working memory as if they had no conscious

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.960
scratch pad they're not they're sort of they feel like an automaton and there are others

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:09.000
who won't say that but they feel very disconnected from their emotions they feel but they're

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.280
muted and they feel distant from them there's a really a wide range of abnormal states

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:21.360
and that's also something very difficult by the way to treat and it's from my way of

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:27.800
thinking because it involves ideas about the self which are so complex as you know if you

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.800
talk about different concepts built around emotion so that I just think how many of

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:39.360
them are built around myself right there are so many flavors of depersonalization and it's

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:44.480
a challenging condition to treat.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.040
The other kid I've we were there open up for questions with it but there was one other

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:52.600
I think oddball state that I just wanted to hear everyone's thoughts about and wants

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.800
to comment on and that is to the opposite of blind sight which is this Anton syndrome

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:05.240
and people who are blind in fact and provably blind because they can't walk with obstacles

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.360
and such who insist that they can see.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:15.600
Now this is and of course it's often referred to as a state of confabulation so they're

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.760
making excuses for their blindness but even the most absurd circumstances they'll go

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.840
to absurd lengths and insist that they can see.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.880
So now I wonder okay are they conscious of seeing what what's going on in that situation?

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.720
David do you have any thoughts on that?

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:46.240
I think that they could have conscious visual states and but it's a tricky thing and people

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:53.960
in the consciousness racket debate some about this but my own view is since so here's a

01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:02.840
visual state and just by itself it isn't conscious it will be responsive to stimulate

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.880
but that's all.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:11.520
Then there will be what I call a high order awareness of the state that is to say the

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:19.640
individual will be aware of being in the state one will be aware of oneself as being

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.800
in the state.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:30.240
So this is a separate state so now you can take away that and then you would still have

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:37.560
some kind of visual awareness right without the so that is to say you would be aware

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.920
of yourself as seeing you would be aware of yourself as being in the visual state even

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:49.400
though in more in fact as we as you mentioned biologically we know that there is no visual

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:56.840
state but that's not the way it is for the individual right and I don't see any reason

01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:05.160
why this wouldn't be the case I think with these end tons patients it's a bit of a question

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:11.840
how fine-grained it is and what the nature of the visual consciousness is but it seems

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:18.880
as though this particular model of what it is for psychological functioning to be conscious

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.040
provides a very nice explanation of what's going on.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.960
So you're the patient you described sounds more like Charles Monet.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.600
I'm sorry sounds more like the Charles Monet syndrome that Richard and Hocklawn.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.840
Oh yes right there's a lesion of visual cortex and the person still has these vision that

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:42.800
can report these visual experiences but what's the damage or what's the condition in the

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800
end tons?

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800
The neurological.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.040
You know I'm not sure I know let's get to it.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:55.880
So it's some disconnection between the fibers of travel from the occipital load towards the

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.120
temporal parietal load.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120
Okay.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:02.120
Same basic kind of thing.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:07.000
From the in terms of what we're talking about it's basically the same.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.240
But it's interesting that they're so productive in I think in general we have a whole talk

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.120
on confabulation one day or at least I'll have one and I'll pretend all the rest of you

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:23.440
are here that it's very productive and I wonder about this idea that sort of like this gestalt

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:29.960
completion that concepts and sometimes actually create consciousness of some sort.

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:38.320
There's this great paper from the 90s looking at color space representations and congenitally

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:46.800
blind individuals versus sighted individuals and they you know sort color concepts as similar

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.960
and different and then you can use multidimensional scaling to infer what's seen as similar and

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.360
what's seen as different by people.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:02.040
And what they find is that this is shepherd and kuber I think what they find is that congenitally

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.520
blind individuals have a representation of color space that's remarkably akin to sighted

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:14.240
individuals and so via language people are forming representations that are then shaping

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.440
some sort of conscious experience.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:25.240
You know it was studies of confabulation and split brain patients that made me turn to

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.760
rats to study emotion.

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:34.640
So we studied these patients who's brain just split and have to control epilepsy and would

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.640
ask the left hemisphere which you could talk to why you did a certain behavior that had

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.840
been elicited from the right hemisphere.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.000
So the left hemisphere has no internal information about what's in the right hemisphere but can

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.320
observe the behavior that's being produced and the left hemisphere would make up all

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:59.360
these narratives these explanations, confabulations to make it all make sense.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:06.760
And so we were discussing this my mentor and I Mike Zanniger were discussing this and we

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:12.040
said well maybe emotion systems or something that would be generating behaviors non-consciously

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.600
that would require this kind of explanation.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.160
So the light bulb went off in my head and I said okay and so I left once I left Mike's

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:25.320
lab I started doing rat research ended up in the amygdala and here we are today.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.320
That's great.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.160
Alright well I think we should open up for questions if people want to please one of the

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:37.800
time and please make sure it's a question and not a laboratory if you don't mind and

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.800
take it away.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.840
Thank you so much I'm a big fan of the work for the African circles doing future in my

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:43.840
life.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.840
Close to the mic please.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.840
Mike, did you work now?

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.840
No.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.840
So if you are right that Donald Trump might win a game on pressure.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.880
The reason I say is that you know we have to talk about representations as well because

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:04.400
propaganda is extremely successful and we have to acknowledge we make people think a

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:09.160
specific thought at the same time billions of people can think that way and we all know

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:13.880
that conditioning works how low the experiments have proven that conditioning could be you

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:20.840
know is effective and an organism could be made to salivate on arbitrary things.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:27.040
So my question is that knowing that Homo sapiens are tribal and the start is narcissists are

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:32.200
there any representations which can make us more humanistic more planetary conscious more

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.040
peace-loving more human rights-loathing.

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040
Thank you.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:42.200
Well we have to figure out how to make that appealing to people which apparently is not

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.960
anybody else has any bring into center.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.200
I think attending the Elex Center.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:56.200
But thank you for your comment.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:05.240
Noah Harari in his popular in several senses of the word book sapiens talks about 70,000

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.720
years ago a consciousness revolution.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.200
Have you read the book?

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:12.760
You know what I'm talking about?

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.880
Yeah well what do you ask as professionals really in the field?

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:18.680
What do you think of that concept?

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:29.920
Well if consciousness as we humans understand in our own particular way is part of our evolutionary

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:36.480
history as a species not necessarily as an animal then yeah maybe that's going to happen.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.480
I mean that's a wild guess in terms of putting a number on that.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:46.560
Yeah I was sort of wondering about the assessment of the data that Harari used to find that

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.400
out to claim it shall we say.

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.000
I think he's a great writer.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.200
I'm not sure he's a great scientist in terms of all of this stuff.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.200
Well.

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:58.200
Well.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.200
Well.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.200
Well thank you.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:07.240
Even though we talk a lot about consciousness it seems to me that most cultures have also

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:13.200
developed techniques to become unconscious or at least unself-conscious such as Buddhism

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:20.440
seeks to become unself-conscious and connected in a form of unity where in other cases depersonalization

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.280
we're becoming unself-consciousness it's fractionated depersonalization so it can go

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:29.880
either way but one seems to be much better state than the other.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:37.080
But in that regard can we look at death as a means, final means to assure unconsciousness.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.360
The same way we use alcohol, drugs, dance, trance any other myth.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.640
If I'm not mistaken Plato said he looked forward to death so that he could be pure conscious

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.360
or pure mind.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:32:06.480
Back in 2016 I was so struck by Rudolfo Linas' comment about the improbability of cells

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:14.320
coming together for a multi-sality organism and remain then as a unified entity that it

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:22.240
struck me that would require a mechanism to make that happen that would be a turning point

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:30.240
and that mechanism you could begin to identify with consciousness provided you remove self-awareness

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:35.960
from consciousness and therefore if we thought of consciousness as first of all the unifying

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:43.240
element of what brings multi-cellularity into a unified being and then we humans came along

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:49.080
later and added the ability to turn that on ourselves and to understand our own consciousness.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:58.160
So I wondered if you see that shift to multi-cellularity as being, even if you don't agree with my

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:04.960
connection with consciousness, if you see it as being like a fundamental turning point

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.360
in evolution, it must have led to a new set of characteristics coming about even if you

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:19.040
are not agreeing with them being called some of the being called consciousness.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:25.960
That first step towards multi-cellularity, the formation of some kind of colonial organization,

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:35.120
in each lineage that has achieved that, it has achieved it by virtue of an extracellular

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.120
adhesive.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:42.920
Now what's interesting to me is the fact that different lineages have used different materials

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.760
to accomplish adhesion.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.120
I'll give you an example.

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:53.440
Almost all of the cells in your body are adhering because of transmembrane proteins called

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.520
cathearins.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:02.200
The cells in the plant body are stuck together by virtue of pectins which are carbohydrates.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:07.560
So our bodies are stuck together by proteins, plants are stuck together by carbohydrates.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.000
And if you look at the metabolism of what a photosynthetic versus non-photocetic organism

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.880
does, it makes intuitive sense.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.720
Carbohydrates are cheap.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.960
Proteins are relatively easy to make because of the physiology of the animal.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:32.840
So that's not consciousness because every unicellular ancestor has used the adhesive

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.880
for a different purpose.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.360
So for example, you think of unicellular things as well, they don't stick together.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.920
Well, of course they do.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.840
If reproduction requires two cells to come together, they have to adhere.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.120
And they're using that adhesive to form the colonial organism.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:35:01.760
So contingency and a co-option, co-opting the use of something as an adhesive here that

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.880
now gives you an adhesion here.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.400
The real major step is not sticking together.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.280
It's working together.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.360
And our species has yet to accomplish that.

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.800
More scotch tape.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.800
I feel like red tape.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.960
Joe, I haven't yet had the pleasure of reading your book.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:29.920
But would you perhaps characterize how your work differs from Antonio de Masios?

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:32.440
Because it seems to me to be the converse that you're suggesting.

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.960
Yeah, so Antonio and I have been on writing books about emotion and rougher at the same

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.960
amount of time.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:50.080
And we have different perspectives that ultimately come together in terms of the higher levels.

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:57.240
So for him, he started out by saying that the somatic marker hypothesis, which is the

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:04.320
idea that body signals, somatic signals that reach the brain, are interpreted as defining

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.720
the emotion.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:14.880
So my view is that those signals are important in modulating the experience of it not defining.

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.920
So that's the main distinction.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:22.360
But Antonio had an interesting component to that, which he called the aziflu.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.440
So if you don't have the body states, you can conceptualize, you can simulate it.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:33.400
And for me, all emotions are these kinds of simulations rather than predetermined events.

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:41.760
And if I may just one other question, perhaps the brain is a distributed system.

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.280
Beyond what's in the skull, of course, it started with a gut.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:47.000
The tube was the first brain that's evolved subsequently.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.760
And of course, there's a lot of work now going on around microbiome.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.920
In fact, work with rats, reared in a sterile environment, having a propensity to be more

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:00.480
anxious than those with a stable, healthy gut microbiome.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.480
In fact, plants have just come up with a conference where it's discovered that tiny

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:09.760
filaments and plant roots that actually co-op bacteria in to do work with them and then expel

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:13.280
them out into the environment later on.

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.320
Is it perhaps that the brain is a distributed system, the amygdala perhaps part of it, but

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.280
it's much broader, challenge than that?

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:26.680
Well, there is, I guess, a distributed processing within the brain.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680
I don't know.

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.960
I mean, it seems much of what you mean exactly.

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.640
What I'm talking about is, in fact, a lot of work is going on at the moment about gut

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:39.040
brain access, anxiety as a function of dysbiosis in the gut.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:43.240
Oh, you mean that the body is a distributed system in the brain?

01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:48.240
I'm talking about actually the ecology of microorganisms in the gut being another community

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.120
that's contributing to the concept of intelligence.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.120
I mean, you know, it could use intelligence.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120
Oh, anxiety.

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120
You're right, yes.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.080
So, I mean, I agree, I mean, we're doing some work on the microbiome now.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.080
Okay.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:09.400
So, I think it's all one system, obviously, and I think the brain is special, but I'm

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.400
biased.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.400
Thanks.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:16.960
I mean, just to put this into perspective about the history of life, we can think of

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:23.120
the amygdala as a continuation of that first bacterial cell that had to detect and respond

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.120
to danger.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.120
It's the, I'm not saying the amygdala itself, but the circuits within the amygdala that

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:35.320
detect and respond to danger are just a continuation of that, that protective survival imperative

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.320
that we have.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:41.240
And so the amygdala and other parts of the brain that do those kinds of things are just

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.680
allowing a big multicellular organism accomplish those goals.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.480
If I can add to that, absolutely, I agree.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:56.200
We used to think of plant, a tree as a separate organism.

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:02.920
And now our ecological evolutionary perspective is, well, yes, it's an individual that will

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.800
have a life in death.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:09.240
And individuality is another concept that's somewhat difficult to define.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.320
But we now know that those trees are actually interconnected to neighboring trees by Michael

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:23.880
Rizy and bacterial colonies, and that they're actually capable of exchanging nutrients.

01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:29.240
And that is that one tree that is overproducing can actually contribute to the carbohydrate

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:34.120
gain of another and sharing minerals and things of that.

01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:40.200
So you know, this integrated phenotype, what is the individual from an evolutionary or

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.840
a biological point of view?

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.840
It's really a fascinating topic.

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.120
What about the idea that we're just here to support bacterians?

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.120
Yeah.

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:51.120
No comment.

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.120
Hi.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:40:02.440
Forgive me, I have not read your book, but I was thoroughly interested in coming here.

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.560
I guess I have a two-part question.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:08.120
The first is from the description itself.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:15.240
It says, emotions you concluded in your book result from our efforts to make sense of the

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.040
significant moments in our lives.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.560
And forgive me if I missed it.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:25.200
I don't recall your, could you comment on that?

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.160
So preceding that, I'm trying to reconstruct where that sentence came from, but preceding,

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.640
is that from the description here?

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.640
Yes.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:42.000
In the book, that idea is preceded by the fact that we have these biological systems

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.920
that control our survival activities in terms of finding food, mates, balancing fluids,

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:56.760
finding liquids, and so forth, and all of these things that are important in the ecology

01:40:56.760 --> 01:41:04.040
of daily life, and emotions are a conscious awareness of those significant things, and

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:13.880
putting those significant things out of biological context, not that psychology is in biological,

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:19.280
but allowing us to experience what we're doing when we have these biologically significant

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.840
moments.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:21.840
Thank you.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:29.800
And so this also goes to the gentleman next to you, but obviously for anybody, the psychopharmacologist,

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:37.560
and you just mentioned, I guess, the juxtaposition between, you said not that psychology is not

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.060
biological.

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:51.080
So my question had to do with what effect does the taking of, let's say, multiple psychopharmacological

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:59.560
drugs, not only for anxiety, but mood stabilizers, a whole bunch, and in the long term, et cetera,

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.160
have on perception and behavior.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.840
And we're talking about humans here.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:10.800
That's a small question, I guess it depends on what medicines or what agents you're talking

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.800
about.

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:18.480
I think that most concise way to respond to that would be...

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:22.200
Forgive me for interrupting, because before you did, you did a really good job of saying,

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:31.160
well, these psych or any sort of measure, anxiety meds cannot change your thinking, but you

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:34.640
were talking about the suicide warning.

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:36.320
I wouldn't say they can't change...

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.920
Well, they don't implant ideas in your mind.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.920
That's for sure.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.280
They could change the way you think about things in important ways.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.280
That's for sure.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:50.360
But what I was about to say, which I think is the most concise way to respond to you and

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.920
to the concern about what are the...

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.280
You didn't say adverse, but it's implied, I guess, adverse effects are taking lots of

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:57.280
bills over time.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:42:59.000
We're just the effect.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Okay.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.400
Because they don't do studies on it.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.400
The...

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:09.480
Especially you're right, when it's multiple meds, they certainly don't.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:18.200
All I'll say is that a person's ability to function, be creative, be alert, sleep well,

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:24.560
make up, have energy, all of those things, those factors are more important in the long

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.680
run than the number of medicines you take.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.480
So the bad outcome would be someone who's taking lots of medicines and they are thereby

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:38.280
very impaired in terms of their alertness or their cognition and so forth.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:40.960
And they shouldn't be on all those medicines.

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.480
But when people really...

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:47.840
It requires a careful analysis and a discussion and it's not something that necessarily can

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.320
happen in one quick session.

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:55.800
But in the long term, looking at how well that person is sort of fitting into their

01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.720
lives and I call it just generally a healthy way, then typically with a few exceptions

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:05.720
based on blood tests you have to get once in a while, typically the effects are good.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.720
That's what I would say.

01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:07.720
Okay.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:15.000
There are lots of exceptions to it, but watching the overall sort of functional state of the

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.480
individual is more important.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.800
I guess one perfect example would be there's a short one, it's only one type of medicine.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:29.960
There was a great viewer that rose a few years back because of a study that said benzodiazepines

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.080
cause dementia.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:43.000
And I felt that study wasn't well done and there was a follow-up study, large multi-institution

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.960
study that found that no, the connection was false.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:50.920
Okay, it may yet still be debatable, but I do know this.

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:57.520
Anxiety in the elderly is a very strong risk factor for dementia.

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:58.520
Okay.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:02.480
So when you confront, well now you have to make a choice.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.480
And there are important choices.

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:08.440
There are ways to do it intelligently, but it would be wrong to assume that the medicine

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.400
necessarily is going to happen negative outcome, and net, so.

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.400
Okay.

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.400
Thank you.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.400
Sure.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:22.680
As I was listening, I was on the various themes here.

01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:29.920
I was trying to put it in a context of some other research in a different field, and perhaps

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.840
Joseph and Kristen might come in on this.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:44.000
A quorum sensing in bacteria and the ideas of how bacteria, first of all, are not solitary,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.360
they're social, and that took a long time for the field to come to that conclusion and

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:55.800
the research to start from that as the foundation.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:46:00.360
And similarly, consciousness is social, it's not solitary.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:05.520
I mean there's the solitary expression of it within an individual, but that's still mediated

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.600
by all of the other influences that have been social.

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:15.080
And the one thing that sort of hit me when we talk about the consciousness and developmentally

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.480
around two and three years old, well you know, the terrible twos, the tantrums.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.040
If I don't get my way, I'm going to start screaming.

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:29.480
Well, when that stops, and the child becomes more pro-social, that's when the consciousness

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:31.080
component of it develops.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.360
So I think that that's a very interesting thing to start looking at.

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.000
Okay, responses?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.960
Anything to say about quorum?

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:47.280
Well, I can respond only in terms of the comment about bacteria, and that is it's very interesting

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:56.560
because quorum sensing in bacteria, we think, is a mechanism to gauge the availability

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.800
of nutrients in the environment.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.760
So by sensing the size of the population and the extent to which the population might be

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:13.480
growing or diminishing, that is a feedback as to the availability of nutrients for the

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:15.400
collective.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:21.520
What's interesting to me is that in a lot of bacteria, the molecule that's used for quorum

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:29.600
sensing, which is endolicitic acid, or IAA, is used by plants as a signaling molecule

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:35.200
to go from the tips of leaves and the tips of roots and the tips of stems.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:42.360
So it's a beautiful example of where quorum sensing in the mechanism that was used by

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:49.800
bacteria is now been highly elaborated and sophisticated in terms of now communicating

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.040
amongst the cells within the plant body.

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.040
Great.

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:57.320
I want to make one quick announcement after our next question, which has to be our last

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320
one.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.480
We're going to have the pleasure of listening to, I don't know if you know this, but Joe

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:07.600
is a music app performer and he's going to put on a small performance for us in the guitar.

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:10.160
Should I go?

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:17.920
Yes, regarding the consciousness of vision, in the words of great culture, and the words

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:27.280
of great cognitive scientist Stevie Wonder, just because a man cannot see does not mean

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.160
he does not have a great vision.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:44.320
It's working, but seriously, folks, human designed experiments, one person smiles.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:53.680
Human designed experiments have shown that species as greatly separated from us as birds

01:48:53.680 --> 01:49:02.360
can figure out human designed puzzles and strategize and plan ahead knowing that if they

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:09.520
figure out a multi-step puzzle, they'll get to the reward, the food.

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:19.840
We know that dogs can dream, we know a dog will sacrifice its own life to save a human

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.600
being.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:30.160
And I believe there are documented cases of urban cats jumping out of high rises, knowingly

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:39.080
that they're jumping to their deaths because of disturbances in a loud noise in the city.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:49.960
So my question is when humans design experiments to test the animals of consciousness, when

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:55.200
it's obvious to a lot of people that they do, isn't this, you know, what we're talking

01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:01.240
about here today, isn't this really more anthropomorphic chauvinism than science?

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:06.240
As we said, if all we needed was intuition, we wouldn't need to do science, but it's

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:10.760
difficult, it may be impossible to know what's on the mind of another animal.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:16.960
But no one's saying that the experiments we design are designed by using our own biases.

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:17.960
Right.

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.960
I don't do those, sir.

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.960
Yes, I think.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:27.160
Well, this is a quick one.

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.800
Yeah, quick, wait a second.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.800
C.C.N.Y.

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:31.800
Sorry?

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.800
C.C.N.Y.

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:33.800
Yes.

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.800
Yes.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.800
Okay.

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:36.800
Can I have a second?

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.800
Yes.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.800
Yeah.

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.800
Yes.

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.800
Yes.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.800
Yes.

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.800
I'm that old.

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.800
C.C.M.Y.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:44.800
Okay.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:52.880
Human beings, Homo stapiens have been on this earth for about 200,000 years.

01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.820
We're also hybrids.

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:59.360
We're Neanderthals, decibens, and perhaps some other species.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.520
We're a brand new species.

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:08.320
Only in the last 10,000 years have we created civilization and now technology.

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:12.720
And ways to kill ourselves.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:16.480
And one of the people here who spoke, one of the gentlemen, talked about this may be

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.040
the end.

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:20.320
And yet it may be the end.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.120
And can we fix it?

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.520
Well, we are evolved monkeys.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.360
We are evolved chimpanzees.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:34.600
If you look at chimpanzees, they're always after each other, there's a male, alpha male,

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.280
and they're fighting, they're killing, and so on.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:48.600
The question is, what can we do with ourselves as humans, as Homo sapiens, to change that

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:52.640
aspect of ourselves which is built into us?

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:57.600
Does anyone have an answer?

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.760
Find a common enemy.

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:01.760
That's us.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:02.760
Yeah.

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:09.520
I can't think of any one, you know, a quick response to that because I just think that

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:15.840
there are so many ways, there are so many ways in which that can be affected for the better.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:19.640
But it's through too many things to enumerate, I'm sorry to say.

01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:23.960
And again, I was joking about the healing center, but having general discussions of this sort,

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:30.640
and it's a little bit of a joke, but not extending humanism as a sort of a guiding tool.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.640
It's a good way to do that.

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:37.640
So, with that, as soon as we're all set.

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.640
All right, if anyone wants to get up and leave, you can do that now.

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.160
No hard feelings.

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:47.160
Please take your time.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:57.120
So, I'm only going to play three short songs.

01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:00.600
We were originally supposed to have a larger group here, but we couldn't get everybody

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.080
together, so we canceled the whole thing.

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.960
Then at the last minute, I decided to do something I never do, which is performed by myself.

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:10.120
So, let's see how that goes.

01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.560
All right, so we have a band called the Immig Deloids.

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:23.680
We invented our own genre called Heavy Mental, which is music about mind and brain and mental

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.360
disorders.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:30.600
And we've actually played here for the New York psychoanalytic Christmas party once upstairs.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.800
There's a video on the web, and that's just came across.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:48.600
All right, I'm going to do a song called My Mind's Eye.

01:53:48.600 --> 01:54:05.960
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cry deep inside in my mind's

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:08.960
eye.

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:12.280
We had love.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.520
It was good.

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.920
You were there.

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:24.520
You understood everything.

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.920
Yes, everything.

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:33.720
I can't always trust what you think you know.

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:37.320
Can't trust what you believe.

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.240
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show.

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:43.240
It's simply disease.

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:54.360
And my mind's eye, you were mine, but my mind's eye was blonde.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:55:11.320
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cry deep inside in my mind's

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.920
eye.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:18.280
Can't always trust what you think you know.

01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:21.880
Can't trust what you believe.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.800
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show.

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:50.120
It's simply disease.

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:56.760
My mind's eye, you were mine, but my mind's eye was blonde.

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:00.120
My mind's eye was blonde.

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.480
My mind's eye was blonde.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:03.480
Oh, yeah.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:07.000
My mind's eye was blonde.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:13.400
Okay, thank you.

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.840
So sometimes when I write a book, I write songs that go with the book, and that's what

01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:21.000
we're going to play here today.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.160
And some of this has electronic music and so forth, which obviously we won't have today.

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.080
So I'm just going to do one song from the book, which is called Life.

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:31.360
There are four songs in the book.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:36.080
One is called As soon as there is Life, There's Danger.

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:41.160
And another is about, these are kind of dystopian, either beginning of the world or into the

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:46.400
world songs, except this one, which is about beginning and end of life.

01:56:46.400 --> 01:57:11.560
Oh, I just...

01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:18.840
All of the things that I think about are all so things that I think that I doubt.

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:22.920
I can't keep straight all the things in my mind.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:28.840
Too many thoughts and too little time in life.

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840
Life.

01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.840
Life.

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:31.840
Life.

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:39.960
The states of mine, they come and go.

01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.600
Sometimes fast and sometimes slow.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.360
Some leave a trace in my brain.

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.160
Others just wax and wane in life.

01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:54.160
Life.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:55.160
Life.

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.160
Life.

01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:57.160
Life.

01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.160
Life.

01:57:58.160 --> 01:57:59.160
Life.

01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:00.160
Life.

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.160
Life.

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:02.160
Life.

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:03.160
Life.

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:04.160
Life.

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.160
Life.

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.160
Life.

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:07.160
Life.

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.160
Life.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.160
Life.

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.160
Life.

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.160
Life.

01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.160
Life.

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:13.160
Life.

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.160
Life.

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:15.160
Life.

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.160
Life.

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.160
Life.

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.160
Life.

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.160
Life.

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.160
Life.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.160
Life.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.160
Life.

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.160
Life.

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:24.160
Life.

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:25.160
Life.

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.160
Life.

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.160
Life.

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:27.760
Life.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:28.760
Life.

01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.760
Life.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760
Life.

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:31.760
Life.

01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:32.760
Life.

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:33.760
Life.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.600
Life.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:35.760
Life.

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.720
Life.

01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:37.760
Life.

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.760
Life.

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:19.920
life.

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:40.920
Life, life, life, life.

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:47.920
Thank you.

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.920
Thank you, thank you.

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:58.920
Thanks, Kristen, Carl, David, and Gerald.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.920
And the Helix Center.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.920
And Miguel back there in the booth.

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:05.920
Okay.

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.920
Thank you.

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:14.920
You're a large 14-year-old boy.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:54.920
Thank you.

01:59:54.920 --> 02:00:15.920
Thank you.
