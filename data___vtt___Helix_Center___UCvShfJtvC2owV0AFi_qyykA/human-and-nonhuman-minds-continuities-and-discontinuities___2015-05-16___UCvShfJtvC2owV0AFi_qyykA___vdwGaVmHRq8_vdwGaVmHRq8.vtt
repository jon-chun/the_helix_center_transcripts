WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Okay, we're going to get started.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.760
Welcome everyone.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.760
I'm Rob Penzer.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.760
I'm the associate director of the Helix Center.

00:12.760 --> 00:17.480
Thank you for coming out today for what promises to be a fascinating program on human and

00:17.480 --> 00:19.200
non-human minds.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.920
Before we get to the introductions of today's participants, just have a few announcements.

00:24.920 --> 00:32.480
This is the last of our roundtables for the academic year, and I want to just give you

00:32.480 --> 00:39.920
a little bit of a taste of some of the roundtables coming in the fall.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.920
We're going to start out in September on the subject of interdisciplinary investigations.

00:45.920 --> 00:52.920
Our John Templeton Foundation roundtables continue in October, a standing genius, followed

00:52.920 --> 00:58.000
by genes, computers, and computers in November.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.200
We'll be addressing epigenetics.

01:01.200 --> 01:06.040
We have a new arts and humanities program, and the topic toward the end of November will

01:06.040 --> 01:08.520
be on translation.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.480
Then we're going to have a three-day symposium in December, a Freudian perspective on what

01:13.480 --> 01:22.360
hails the world today, and that will be an international event with participants from

01:22.360 --> 01:25.120
Europe and the states.

01:25.120 --> 01:33.160
Then in mid-December, capital with an A, notions, the future of the American economy.

01:33.160 --> 01:39.680
Then we continue again with the Templeton Foundation-sponsored roundtable on memory,

01:39.680 --> 01:43.600
followed by the meditative state, and then the realm of mystery.

01:43.600 --> 01:50.400
I also wanted to mention that we had a very successful fundraiser on May 8th, and nothing

01:50.400 --> 01:53.160
breeds success like success.

01:53.160 --> 02:01.080
So I hope it might inspire some of you to consider donating to our nonprofit organization

02:01.080 --> 02:07.680
so that we can continue to provide you with such programs, and as always, they are free

02:07.680 --> 02:10.600
and open to the public.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.960
So now, on to today's participants.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.480
To my right is Alexandra Horowitz, professor of psychology at Barnard College, whose dog

02:20.480 --> 02:25.720
cognition lab conducts research on a wide range of topics, including dog, old-fashioned,

02:25.720 --> 02:30.880
interspecies play behavior, and attributions of secondary emotions to dogs.

02:30.880 --> 02:38.520
Among her books are Inside of a Dog, What She Smell and Know, and Unlooking, Eleven Walks

02:38.520 --> 02:40.960
with Expert Eyes.

02:40.960 --> 02:45.840
To her right is Diana Reese, professor of psychology at Hunter College, and professor

02:45.840 --> 02:51.000
of biopsychology and behavioral neuroscience at the Graduate Center of CUNY, whose research

02:51.000 --> 02:57.200
focuses on Sotitian cognition, communication, comparative animal cognition, and the evolution

02:57.200 --> 02:58.640
of intelligence.

02:58.640 --> 03:03.680
She is the author of Secrets of the Dolphins, and the book The Dolphin in the Mirror, Exploring

03:03.680 --> 03:07.280
Dolphin Minds, Dolphin Lives.

03:07.280 --> 03:12.280
To her right is Theodore Diamond, director of the Diamond Instance, joint assistant professor

03:12.280 --> 03:18.000
at Columbia Teachers College, covers the study of the human mental and physical system as

03:18.000 --> 03:19.800
a holistic entity.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.640
Among his books are The Body in Motion, Its Evolution and Design, and Neurodynamics,

03:25.640 --> 03:28.600
the Art of Mindfulness in Action.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.800
To his right, Stuart Fierstein is the former chair of Department of Biological Sciences

03:32.800 --> 03:37.360
at Columbia University, where he studies the vertebrate olfactory system, and he's the

03:37.360 --> 03:44.640
author of the book's Ignorance, How it Drives Science, and Failure by Science is So Successful.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.480
And to his right, it's a research associate in lecture at Harvard University, an author

03:50.480 --> 03:55.400
of the Alex Studies describing over 20 years of peer-reviewed experiments on the cognitive

03:55.400 --> 04:03.120
and communicative abilities of Gray Parrots, X and Me, her memoir of a 30-year collaboration.

04:03.120 --> 04:08.880
Now to our round table.

04:08.880 --> 04:15.760
No, you're going to start it.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.560
You see, that's where we are here.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.920
That's the first question.

04:20.920 --> 04:27.920
Who starts?

04:27.920 --> 04:35.920
This is Ed Nurse-Sassian, the director, but I think most of you know.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.920
It's so typical that we can't get a round table on cognitive.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.920
Diana, you'll start.

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
Yes.

04:44.920 --> 04:50.840
So I think what we're hoping to do today is talk about, as we advertise, the continuities

04:50.840 --> 04:55.120
and discontinuities between human and non-human animal minds.

04:55.120 --> 05:01.600
And it's wonderful to be here together to do this with you, all of us, and we obviously

05:01.600 --> 05:05.680
encourage discussion, not just us, but you as well.

05:05.680 --> 05:12.720
I think some of the ways we might start this is from a perspective of Darwinian, the continuity

05:12.720 --> 05:22.880
of evolution, emotion, thinking from a Darwinian perspective, as contrasted by a few, Descartes

05:22.880 --> 05:29.720
view that humans had a body, that they also had this ghost in the machine, a thinking

05:29.720 --> 05:31.920
substance of mind.

05:31.920 --> 05:38.000
And again, the view that Descartes had was that other animals only had the body.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.600
They were devoid of this thinking substance.

05:40.600 --> 05:45.840
And I guess I just want to kick in a first idea here to get us going, that for a little

05:45.840 --> 05:50.880
bit, there's been this running debate as to whether other animals think or not.

05:50.880 --> 05:57.520
Of course, I'll just mention this because there were arguments that, well, parrots

05:57.520 --> 05:59.680
certainly are vocal.

05:59.680 --> 06:04.560
They're using words, but it's just a devoid of thought.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.560
And their thought were dismissed.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.400
And I know Irene's going to have a lot to say about that.

06:11.400 --> 06:17.480
And then, you know, other animals are doing behavior that looks complex, but it's not

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
complex.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.480
It's that.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.600
I think we can just start talking about what some of the things we're learning.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.600
There you go.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
You just have to bring the speakers to many of the students in my class.

06:26.600 --> 06:33.200
So, and I mean that only partly as a joke, actually, because I think one of the difficult

06:33.200 --> 06:38.120
issues is, in fact, defining what we mean, first of all, by the idea of continuity and

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
discontinuity.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.680
We don't look for it.

06:41.680 --> 06:47.920
And how to identify what we consider to be conscious or cognitive behavior, whether there's

06:47.920 --> 06:55.400
anything to do with the is a difference between, I guess, what you would call, programmed behavior

06:55.400 --> 07:00.240
or things like that, or instinctive behavior and more cognitive behavior.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.440
I mean, I don't, I think we know, okay, that's intuitive, whatever.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.360
The dog does something that all dogs do, and that looks intuitive.

07:08.360 --> 07:11.360
And then something is affirmative, but it just looks that way.

07:11.360 --> 07:15.920
It's very difficult to actually, can I tell a quick story actually about this?

07:15.920 --> 07:19.360
It has nothing to do with cognition, but it does have to do with behavior and the idea

07:19.360 --> 07:22.160
of instinct.

07:22.160 --> 07:28.640
So when a bird, not a pigeon, a chicken is born, the very first thing it does when it

07:28.640 --> 07:32.160
gets out of the egg is it begins pecking the ground for food.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.680
Appears to be an instinctive behavior.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.920
For years it was considered an instinctive behavior.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.680
So Japanese scientist whose name now eludes me.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.840
But anyway, Japanese scientist, this is a weird thing to do, I know.

07:43.840 --> 07:49.040
But if you spread Vaseline on an egg and hold it up to the other side and hold it as a light,

07:49.040 --> 07:52.160
it becomes transparent and you can see through it with a light behind it.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.800
I don't know how we discovered that.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
That's a whole other story.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.800
I suspect.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.800
But anyway.

07:57.800 --> 08:02.200
So this enabled him to take chicken eggs and put them in an incubator and then he goes

08:02.200 --> 08:05.400
Vaseline and watch the chicken develop.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.720
And that develops, it turns out that the chicken develops in the egg with its head bent over

08:09.720 --> 08:14.200
this way and it's bent directly over the region that becomes the heart.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.480
And at some point about four days before the thing cracks up, it begins beating actually.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.000
I think it's sooner than that, but it's better.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.240
And you watch the head of the chicken go up and down and up and down with the beat of

08:24.240 --> 08:25.240
the heart.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.600
And it comes out of the egg, it just keeps on going up and down and then it kind of binds

08:29.600 --> 08:32.560
up picking up some food and well there you go, right?

08:32.560 --> 08:35.080
So it's not instinctive at all.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.200
It's a behavior that's learned in fact in some way or another.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.480
So I just think that's a problem that's worth discussing, how we make this discriminate.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.280
We say discontinuity versus content.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.480
I don't really know where to draw the lines here.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.640
There's a similar story with Jack Hammond studies on the goals.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.720
I mean people know that goals, parental goals have a little red spot on their beak and supposedly

08:56.720 --> 09:01.160
the chicks come out and stay in that red dot.

09:01.160 --> 09:06.320
It turns out what is instinctual is something like what you're describing a response to

09:06.320 --> 09:12.660
some kind of dates and they happen to hit the red dot at one point and mom and dad barf

09:12.660 --> 09:15.720
up some food and you know there you go.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.960
But it's these things, many of these things people thought were instinctual.

09:20.960 --> 09:27.720
Turns out to have a learning component, to have different aspects, behavioral intuition

09:27.720 --> 09:30.200
plus these other aspects.

09:30.200 --> 09:36.000
So much of what we do in our lab now to look at the effects of context and that's another

09:36.000 --> 09:43.320
issue where we're studying these so many different types of behavior patterns that are exquisitely

09:43.320 --> 09:48.440
sensitive to the context in which you study them.

09:48.440 --> 09:53.840
We did a study where some people were looking at fish behavior.

09:53.840 --> 10:00.520
There's a fish that lives in a reef that a cleaner fish and the other fish that live

10:00.520 --> 10:04.080
in the reef come over and get all the parasites taken off.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.520
But every once in a while another fish comes by and these cleaner fish will jump out and

10:08.520 --> 10:12.520
grab those fish because the local residents they're going to just sit there.

10:12.520 --> 10:18.400
They're not going to come back but you can basically optimize your food intake by jumping

10:18.400 --> 10:19.880
out to these other fish.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.160
So it's too complicated to explain the whole study but based on that people were comparing

10:24.160 --> 10:29.080
chimpanzees and these fish and it turns out a regular task.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.400
The fish outperformed the chimpanzees.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.000
So we looked at this, I worked with parrots and I said, wait a minute, my birds can do

10:36.000 --> 10:37.560
this really easily.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.880
And so we did the task and the parrots outperformed everybody.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.400
But it was the way we set up what we call the initial conditions.

10:45.400 --> 10:51.640
And when you compare exactly how to experiment you're going to find in so many ways different

10:51.640 --> 10:54.600
animals just based on how you set up the experiment.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.760
So this is another thing that people are not sensitive to when they say, well, you know,

10:58.760 --> 11:00.000
this animal does this and this animal.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.680
Can't do this in blah blah blah.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.280
So much of it depends on exactly how you set up the experiment.

11:04.280 --> 11:09.120
I mean, I think that what that highlights and what we're going to highlight is that we're

11:09.120 --> 11:12.280
still trapped in a way of working for us, right?

11:12.280 --> 11:16.880
The instinctive or learning or reflexive versus cognitive.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.480
And the science that drove an interest in non-human animals, which is a psychological

11:21.480 --> 11:26.640
science really, but they wind up being categories that now we're stuck.

11:26.640 --> 11:32.640
We're trying to fit our behavior into one or the other and it'd be the ideal.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.000
Resization of most of the behavior that we're seeing.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.360
I mean, context, the importance of context seems to me to rise above that a little bit.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.600
But somebody will still want you to say, well, is it instinctive or is it learned?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.400
Which might not be easy to.

11:46.400 --> 11:51.240
There are also some other issues, I think, as scientists that we face.

11:51.240 --> 11:55.480
And some of them are, you know, we're stuck looking through this human lens, that other

11:55.480 --> 11:57.280
animal behavior and intelligence.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.640
And, you know, the eyeward, intelligence.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.920
How do you measure that?

12:00.920 --> 12:04.760
Is the intelligence of a dolphin the same thing as the intelligence of a chimpanzee?

12:04.760 --> 12:06.760
I mean, morphologically, they're different.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.440
Very different environments.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.880
They've been separated by 95 million years of separate evolution.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.680
We might expect that they'll do very different things.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.160
And, you know, that to me, that's one of the most challenging things of it.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.560
How do you even think about intelligence in an animal and even know that you're not missing

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
most of it?

12:24.560 --> 12:29.760
Because simply, they're using different kinds of, you know, ways of thinking.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.840
They have perspectives there in environment we can't imagine.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.520
I'll tell you one story that was very telling to me.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.560
A couple of years ago, one of the doctoral students in my lab pressed in further and

12:40.560 --> 12:44.000
I did a study at the Smithsonian's National Zoo with Elephants.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.520
I joke about saying that I study big gray brains and big gray mammals, elephants and

12:48.520 --> 12:49.800
dolphins.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.120
And so we worked with elephants this time, not dolphins.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.960
And I don't know how many of you are familiar with this study that was done many years ago

12:56.960 --> 13:03.120
by Wolfgang Köhler with showing the first evidence for insightful problem solving in

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
chimpanzees.

13:04.120 --> 13:10.520
So insightful problem solving has been defined as being faced with a novel problem or situation

13:10.520 --> 13:13.880
and without trial and error.

13:13.880 --> 13:18.440
You come up with, you have sort of this aha moment and you see the solution suddenly,

13:18.440 --> 13:24.920
a sudden, you know, solution, a reorganization of your thinking so you can solve this problem.

13:24.920 --> 13:32.560
So what he did with his attempts is he hung bananas high above their reach and he placed

13:32.560 --> 13:35.400
variety of eggs in their environment.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.280
This was done at a zoo in Tenerife and he gave them, there were some sticks and there

13:39.280 --> 13:40.280
were some boxes.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.760
And you know the chimps, one of them's name was Sultan, you know, I forget the names of

13:43.760 --> 13:46.560
the others, were looking up, obviously couldn't reach it.

13:46.560 --> 13:52.000
And finally, one of the chimps without trial and error apparently stacked the boxes, took

13:52.000 --> 13:57.800
a couple boxes, stacked them up and then took a stick and was able to reach the banana.

13:57.800 --> 14:03.240
And that was sort of the first evidence that a non-human species showed this aha moment,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.080
they sort of got it.

14:05.080 --> 14:10.160
And we were really interested because there had been a lot of discussion about elephants.

14:10.160 --> 14:15.120
Being elephants are big tool users, they're one of the biggest tool users.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.760
But somehow they weren't showing this kind of insightful problem solving when people

14:18.760 --> 14:21.600
gave them sticks to solve problems.

14:21.600 --> 14:26.720
So we went to Smithsonian's National Zoo and we simulated or replicated this curler experiment.

14:26.720 --> 14:31.520
We didn't hang bananas above their reach but we strung up a sort of a clothes line out

14:31.520 --> 14:38.440
of wire and shot out tree limbs, baited with tasty fruit that they would eat.

14:38.440 --> 14:43.320
What we did was we put boxes that they could stack and sticks and wrong.

14:43.320 --> 14:48.160
Well, what we saw was that this elephant never picked up a stick.

14:48.160 --> 14:53.240
Again, in bother he got stuck with his trunk and he didn't know if he didn't know if he

14:53.240 --> 14:54.240
never did it.

14:54.240 --> 14:59.760
But what he did was he went for the block and he, which was much more effort, there was

14:59.760 --> 15:01.560
much more effort involved in this.

15:01.560 --> 15:07.200
He pushed the block right under, got up on the block and got his trunk where the fruit

15:07.200 --> 15:08.400
was.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.880
And it was interesting and he continued and gave him repeated trials where we hid the

15:12.880 --> 15:16.360
block, we moved the block, he had a search for the block.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.920
Once he got it, he got it, he could solve the problem.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.240
But if we had only given him sticks, he may never have shown that.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.720
Well, let's think about this.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.600
So an elephant's trunk is a really cool sensory organ.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.000
First of all, they're optimal vision.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.800
Their best visual acuity is at the end of the trunk.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.280
They have two little points that we call fingers that can pick up something that's a dime so

15:38.280 --> 15:42.040
they can see, touch, smell with this great.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.800
It's not a tool because it's part of their body.

15:44.800 --> 15:49.600
And what they needed to do perhaps is get this cool sensory organ up where the food was

15:49.600 --> 15:54.640
and the stick would have shut off their ability to touch the food, smell the object and perhaps

15:54.640 --> 15:55.640
their visual acuity.

15:55.640 --> 16:02.120
Again, it was at these past experiments where we only gave them sticks and they do.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.400
So again, I think there's a lesson to be learned in some of that.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.200
Maybe a elephant if we can if we're going to test them.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.320
Well, we saw that with the...

16:12.320 --> 16:13.600
Pulling.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
So this is a study.

16:14.600 --> 16:19.480
This was developed by Baron Heinrich for work with crows and ravens.

16:19.480 --> 16:24.680
What you do is you have a perch and you put a really long string with a tasty treat on

16:24.680 --> 16:26.080
the bottom.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.280
And he showed this to the ravens and the raven sort of flew over and looked at it and flew

16:29.280 --> 16:31.120
back and flew over and looked at it.

16:31.120 --> 16:37.360
And then again, without any trial and error, reach down, grabbed the string with his beak,

16:37.360 --> 16:41.840
pulled it up, clumped his foot on it and basically reeled it in.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.360
Crows weren't so good at this.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.480
So we thought, hey, we got these brilliant parrots.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.480
Let's try this.

16:46.480 --> 16:52.160
Well, it turned out that the parrots in our lab that had not yet learned to speak did

16:52.160 --> 16:53.360
extremely well on this.

16:53.360 --> 16:58.560
I mean, it took them, you know, ten seconds or so, they figured it out.

16:58.560 --> 17:03.560
Ones that did speak, Alex and Griffin looked at it, looked at us and went, go pick up

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
nut.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Now...

17:05.560 --> 17:08.560
That's not...

17:08.560 --> 17:10.560
Language is a tool.

17:10.560 --> 17:15.320
But had we done it only with our older, more intelligent parrots, we would have said

17:15.320 --> 17:18.520
they can't figure out how to do the task.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.920
But it wasn't that they couldn't.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.720
It was like, that's not...

17:21.720 --> 17:24.000
You know, we don't do physical work.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.640
You know, we know how to manipulate you to do it.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.320
Well, that actually reminds me a lot of the comparison between wolves and dogs because

17:30.320 --> 17:33.920
on a string pulling task where a string...

17:33.920 --> 17:39.880
The researchers create this convoluted apparatus where there's essentially a ball of old's

17:39.880 --> 17:46.520
meat and... which can open the door and wolves and dogs will learn to pull the string to

17:46.520 --> 17:47.520
open the door.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.520
They both will use their mouth.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.200
But then the researchers make it an impossible task.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.480
In other words, they jimmy it so that it won't open if you pull the string.

17:55.480 --> 18:00.240
And wolves will go up this task, you know, until they wreck the cage.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.160
You know, they'll go at it until they're...

18:03.160 --> 18:04.520
From their gums.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.680
Dogs start to pull at it.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
It's not opening.

18:06.680 --> 18:11.520
They pull at it and they stop and look at the handler or the person.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.280
We're sort of the tool who solves the problem for the dogs.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.280
And the question is, which is more intelligent?

18:17.280 --> 18:19.520
The wolves with their persistence?

18:19.520 --> 18:25.440
That's useful in their environment or the dogs with their using us who have hands and

18:25.440 --> 18:28.800
brains which can solve that problem.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
Hmm.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.640
I have a question.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.800
Here's a question.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.840
My question is this.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.560
If the dog...

18:37.560 --> 18:41.600
If the elephant has a certain kind of intelligence, if the dog has a certain kind of intelligence,

18:41.600 --> 18:45.040
humans, are they all limited and why?

18:45.040 --> 18:48.560
Why is it that the human intelligence seems unlimited?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.640
Why is it grown to the point it's grown?

18:50.640 --> 18:55.560
I have my own views on this, which I'll say a tiny bit about.

18:55.560 --> 19:01.240
But why is the intelligence that we see in elephants not going to go beyond where it

19:01.240 --> 19:02.240
is?

19:02.240 --> 19:07.880
It's interesting in your example, Dan, because it's almost like the example with the elephant

19:07.880 --> 19:11.680
and the trunk is sort of an example of embodied cognition.

19:11.680 --> 19:15.560
We're applying the stick to an elephant, but it doesn't deal with sticks, where it's chimpanzees

19:15.560 --> 19:18.920
like sticks.

19:18.920 --> 19:19.920
Humans have...

19:19.920 --> 19:25.560
They do use sticks as tools to run themselves, try open things where they don't have to

19:25.560 --> 19:27.200
smell and get to them.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.760
But in this case, it wouldn't necessarily facilitate it.

19:31.760 --> 19:39.480
But what I want to know is why is it that the elephant intelligence doesn't go beyond

19:39.480 --> 19:43.160
that and what happened to humans that somehow led beyond...

19:43.160 --> 19:45.640
I believe it's related to physical design.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.240
I believe that the upright design was sort of the...

19:48.240 --> 19:55.600
Kind of like a breakthrough design that allowed human intelligence to evolve in a completely

19:55.600 --> 20:00.560
different way and lead to an expansion of the brain, a whole set of different behaviors.

20:00.560 --> 20:09.640
But I wonder if the elephant design doesn't allow further development in that direction.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.760
Well, actually, I'd like to switch it in a different way.

20:12.760 --> 20:19.240
I think symbolic representation is one of the critical issues here, because we've done

20:19.240 --> 20:24.000
some studies with our birds on evidence.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
And by giving them...

20:25.000 --> 20:27.640
I mean, they don't know the way you and I have language.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.680
I couldn't put Alex on the table here and we couldn't have had the conversation we're

20:31.680 --> 20:33.120
having, okay.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.880
But he had symbolic representation.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.760
My other birds do too.

20:36.760 --> 20:43.600
And they can do numerical tasks that animals without symbolic representation cannot do

20:43.600 --> 20:45.480
at all, all right?

20:45.480 --> 20:49.520
And this seems to be an incredible difference.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.480
And of course, we've given these birds a symbolic representation.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.800
Whatever symbolic representation they have in the wild seems to be much more limited,

20:57.800 --> 20:58.800
okay?

20:58.800 --> 20:59.800
But it's...

20:59.800 --> 21:03.640
That's to me seems to be an incredible difference.

21:03.640 --> 21:10.800
And to me, it seems to be that for humans, we've kind of ratcheted things up by using

21:10.800 --> 21:14.880
you know, symbolics and then thinking things, using the symbols to think things through

21:14.880 --> 21:18.480
and then getting more complicated symbols, et cetera, et cetera.

21:18.480 --> 21:25.320
I guess the question is when does a difference in quantity become a difference in quality?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.280
And where does that ever happen?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.880
So I mean these...

21:30.880 --> 21:35.160
I don't think anybody would deny that human intelligence is in some ways further developed

21:35.160 --> 21:40.160
and virtually any other intelligence on the planet maybe, more close to or near the top

21:40.160 --> 21:43.920
or whatever way you want to put it.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
But is it different?

21:44.920 --> 21:50.000
Is it fundamentally different in some way, in this discontinuous way?

21:50.000 --> 21:53.160
Or are we just looking at a kind of a quantum leap, a gap?

21:53.160 --> 22:00.360
I mean I'm personally philosophically against the idea of discontinuity because that immediate

22:00.360 --> 22:05.920
magic sauce of some sort or another special sauce that I mean assuming we all believe

22:05.920 --> 22:12.600
that mentality of all sorts is basically physically embodied in this thing called the brain and

22:12.600 --> 22:16.720
the rest of the nervous system then if you think human intelligence is different than

22:16.720 --> 22:21.240
other animals' intelligence then it has to be because we have some special sauce which

22:21.240 --> 22:23.160
I don't think is the case.

22:23.160 --> 22:26.920
So I'm a kind of a no-miracles kind of person in that sense.

22:26.920 --> 22:32.440
So it can't be totally discontinuous and yet you're absolutely right that you can't fool

22:32.440 --> 22:37.520
yourself into believing that it's perfectly continuous either in some just tiny incremental

22:37.520 --> 22:38.520
way.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.520
So it's an interesting question.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.520
I mean where are the differences?

22:40.520 --> 22:44.880
And I think there are differences not only between say elephants and humans or chimps

22:44.880 --> 22:49.040
and humans or dolphins and humans whatever you want to consider the next best thing to

22:49.040 --> 22:52.600
us or something like that in some scale but there are differences all the way through

22:52.600 --> 22:58.200
the animal kingdom where there are these jumps that may look discontinuous but are not.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.680
They're just using the same stuff for different purposes, for new purposes perhaps.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.760
Did you ever have, oh I thought you were.

23:04.760 --> 23:05.760
We do questions after.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.760
Oh okay.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.760
I guess.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.760
Is that right?

23:11.760 --> 23:13.760
No, no, no, no.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.760
No, no.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.760
No, no, no.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.760
Right.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.760
Okay.

23:17.760 --> 23:23.760
Is that human intelligence evolves but that animal intelligence doesn't evolve.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.760
Am I any question correct?

23:25.760 --> 23:26.760
I think it is.

23:26.760 --> 23:31.440
Humans are more intelligent today than they were 5,000 years ago but the elephant is the

23:31.440 --> 23:32.440
same.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.440
Well that's hard to say.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.440
You don't have that.

23:34.440 --> 23:40.000
You have that question then 5,000 years ago but there's something that happened in the

23:40.000 --> 23:45.680
human design that led to so many different faculties, so many different faculties arose

23:45.680 --> 23:47.160
with hominids.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.360
Now you could say that that's part just a circumfusion.

23:50.360 --> 23:55.440
You have an animal that's upright, capable of you in a way that you know they're forelimbs

23:55.440 --> 24:00.200
in a way that no other animal can and all of a sudden because of that they were you know

24:00.200 --> 24:04.960
they were capable of new behaviors and one of them is simply eating differently.

24:04.960 --> 24:11.880
Maybe that alone could account for the change in the size of the brain and yet the question

24:11.880 --> 24:15.200
I ask myself just studying anatomy is an area that I'm interested in.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.280
I've been interested in it for a long time.

24:17.280 --> 24:21.560
What is, why is it that it seems that just being upright is associated with being more

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
conscious?

24:22.560 --> 24:27.080
To me there's some, so almost like a qualitative connection.

24:27.080 --> 24:34.920
I mean you know Jane Goodall used to say that she felt that chimpanzees were capable of awe.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.080
Certain pretty unusual emotions she said she believed that.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.000
I'm not sure that's.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.640
But she believed that a chimpanzee seen a new beautiful setting that they could look and

24:46.640 --> 24:49.400
experience some kind of emotion.

24:49.400 --> 24:56.520
It seems to me that in primates something happened where going, the mere fact of being upright

24:56.520 --> 25:02.040
seems to decouple thinking from motor function.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.800
Not in the sense that Stuart and I were, Stuart was mentioning how function is the basis of

25:06.800 --> 25:08.760
so much complexity in cognition.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.040
I'd agree.

25:13.040 --> 25:20.960
That motor function, separate function functionally but it says if in the human motor system cognition

25:20.960 --> 25:27.320
begins to find a separate way of operating separately from motor action so that as far

25:27.320 --> 25:37.560
as I know, and I could be, I'm not an expert in animal cognition, but as far as I know animals

25:37.560 --> 25:43.120
almost, I could stand corrected just from what you said to Anna, but so many animals

25:43.120 --> 25:46.400
when you see them thinking, they're thinking is linked with movement.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.920
So a dog that sees prey.

25:49.920 --> 25:56.400
It may stop and look at the prey and lose interest and walk away, but even when it's

25:56.400 --> 26:02.160
stopped, it's either loses interest or it's calculating how to get the prey.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.840
It never seems to move independently of the action.

26:06.840 --> 26:11.480
It's like it's one operating system, but a human being could do something in my view

26:11.480 --> 26:18.680
that's unique, whereas a human being can sit and look at a piece of food and deliberate

26:18.680 --> 26:22.000
whether they want the food and say, I'm not even sure.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.960
You're going to say a bird can do it.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.000
Griffin passed the marshmallow test.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.800
Well, I want to hear.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.800
I'm going to test.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.800
You know, wait 15 minutes.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.040
We can give him, he has a nut in front of him.

26:35.040 --> 26:38.200
We show him if you wait for the nut, wait, you'll get a skittle, which he loves much

26:38.200 --> 26:42.960
more, and I'll sit there for 15 minutes and he does the same behavior patterns as the

26:42.960 --> 26:44.040
kids do.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.880
He pushes the nut away.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.800
He turns around and he starts preening so he doesn't have to look at it.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.880
He tries to fall asleep.

26:50.880 --> 26:56.160
I mean, he starts talking to himself and muttering things to himself and things.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.160
It's...

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
You don't walk easily.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.160
The same type of thing.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.160
You just train.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.160
I actually...

27:01.160 --> 27:02.160
No, but this was not trained.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
Our dog, I have it on video.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.800
Our dog does it.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.080
We have him share a dog.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
And we did a...

27:08.080 --> 27:14.280
I put a treat down there and I said, just stay in the sense of training.

27:14.280 --> 27:17.440
Like the videos you showed me, I mean, we didn't do a whole system.

27:17.440 --> 27:21.120
I'm at Big Newfoundland and he's looking at it and he looks at me and he looks at the

27:21.120 --> 27:22.120
thing.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.120
He looks away.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.280
It's like, he looks...

27:24.280 --> 27:25.280
Finally, he just...

27:25.280 --> 27:26.280
He's like real...

27:26.280 --> 27:27.280
He's like every...

27:27.280 --> 27:30.840
He finally leaves and then he comes back and he...

27:30.840 --> 27:31.920
You know, similar kinds of things.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.960
We have these similarities in patterns.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.600
I think animals, you know, I think the constraint we have...

27:39.600 --> 27:40.600
I do think they're thinking.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.280
I mean, we've had situations where...

27:43.280 --> 27:45.280
Okay, so this is my...

27:45.280 --> 27:46.280
Like study.

27:46.280 --> 27:50.960
So he was trained to use the word none for the absence of similarity.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.720
So you could take any two things out of your pocket and say, what's the same, what's different?

27:54.720 --> 27:56.960
He'd say, color, shape, matte, or none.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.800
If nothing, we're same or different.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.160
So we're now doing a number of comprehension study.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.680
He's already at the point where you can put a tray out with red and blue balls and blocks.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.560
So you've got four sets of things mixed in...

28:08.560 --> 28:11.200
You know, how many blue blocks and I'll tell you.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.040
So now we got to do comprehension.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.680
So there's three, four, and six things on the tray.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.040
And we've already had like a dozen trials where you say, you know, what...

28:19.040 --> 28:23.160
Then he says blue because there are six blue blocks on the tray.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.000
So now I come in with the three...

28:25.000 --> 28:27.880
You know, this set of things and I say, Alex, what color three?

28:27.880 --> 28:29.920
And he looks at me and he goes five.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.600
There's no five things on the tray.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.360
Now usually when he doesn't want to work, he takes his beak and wax everything off on

28:35.360 --> 28:38.080
the floor or turns around and starts...

28:38.080 --> 28:39.560
But he's giving me a number...

28:39.560 --> 28:41.520
Or he gives me all the wrong colors.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.760
So if the color's on the tray of red, blue, and green, he says purple, orange, and yellow

28:45.760 --> 28:46.760
and stuff.

28:46.760 --> 28:47.760
So...

28:47.760 --> 28:48.760
But now he's giving me this number.

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
So...

28:49.760 --> 28:50.920
You know, what color three?

28:50.920 --> 28:51.920
Five.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.720
Finally I go, okay, smarty.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.720
What color five?

28:54.720 --> 28:59.480
And he looks at me and he goes, none.

28:59.480 --> 29:07.160
So not only did he, you know, use none as a zero-like concept, which we in the West didn't

29:07.160 --> 29:11.480
do till the 1600s, but he figured out how to manipulate me into...

29:11.480 --> 29:13.960
And asking the question he wanted to answer.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.800
But he's using language, that's interesting.

29:16.800 --> 29:21.480
In that case, he seems like he's using language in a meaningful way.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.440
I have to say, just as quick as I...

29:23.440 --> 29:25.640
Are you training this bird to be a synestee?

29:25.640 --> 29:26.640
I'm just...

29:26.640 --> 29:27.640
I can't...

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
Can you train synestee?

29:28.640 --> 29:29.640
Call those.

29:29.640 --> 29:30.640
No, I'm just...

29:30.640 --> 29:37.200
I just wanted to follow up with something because I mean, you also told me these some anecdotes.

29:37.200 --> 29:42.080
I mean, a lot of what happens to us is we see something happen once.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.080
Yeah.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.240
You know, experiment.

29:44.240 --> 29:49.520
But you told me a series of things, similar to this, where you were with Alex when he

29:49.520 --> 29:53.000
chewed up your paper and you yelled at him and then...

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Can you talk to...

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Because this says a lot.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.520
It's similar to what you just talked about.

29:56.520 --> 30:00.760
He had actually had gone out of the room and he had dropped A. I think this is the

30:00.760 --> 30:02.280
sorry one, okay.

30:02.280 --> 30:08.760
So he had managed to climb off his perch and he smashed a coffee cup.

30:08.760 --> 30:13.840
And I come back into the room and there is this bird in the midst of shattered crockery.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.000
And like...

30:15.000 --> 30:21.480
I have to say, I was really careful not to anthropomorphize and to try to be a scientist,

30:21.480 --> 30:26.360
but I come in and it's this instinct of going, you know, the danger thing.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.920
If you came into the room and you saw your child on the floor with shattered crockery,

30:29.920 --> 30:32.720
you're saying, how could you do that?

30:32.720 --> 30:36.640
And then all of a sudden you realize, you know, this is not useful.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.760
So I realized he's...

30:38.760 --> 30:43.040
And not just sometimes you bird, he's scared because this thing has been made a huge noise

30:43.040 --> 30:44.840
and there's all this stuff around here.

30:44.840 --> 30:48.880
And he's looking at me and I pick him and I say, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.600
You know, and then he learned to use this.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.080
There was no contrition necessarily.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.760
But he figured out that if he was being yelled at for something and he said, I'm sorry in

31:01.760 --> 31:08.800
this little pathetic voice, it completely, you know, took down our anger levels.

31:08.800 --> 31:16.640
So it was again a way of learning how to manipulate us using speech.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.440
He may not know what it means, but how many of you...

31:19.440 --> 31:27.760
And others who say I'm sorry all the time and there's no contrition.

31:27.760 --> 31:32.480
Well actually I wanted to kind of attach to that a little bit, which was the study I did

31:32.480 --> 31:35.760
on dogs and whether they have...

31:35.760 --> 31:40.080
Or they do have a guilty look, but whether it indicates that they experience guilt.

31:40.080 --> 31:45.680
But to me it highlights an interesting kind of tension that is coming up here, which is

31:45.680 --> 31:51.600
do they have some emotional experience, which indicates that they have a complexity of mind

31:51.600 --> 31:58.240
that we do and are maybe ruminating on what's been about to happen or did happen.

31:58.240 --> 32:02.600
Or are they just an instinctive actor or is there some manipulation going on?

32:02.600 --> 32:07.560
And so in this study that I did, I just looked at whether this guilty look, the dog show,

32:07.560 --> 32:14.360
which is you might have a dog right if we had a head down and the tail and maybe moving

32:14.360 --> 32:19.680
away from you, actually indicates that they're experiencing something like guilt or whether

32:19.680 --> 32:22.520
it rises from some prompt.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.320
And so I asked...

32:25.320 --> 32:31.000
I went to owners homes, which is a really nice thing about dealing with dogs instead of elephants.

32:31.000 --> 32:36.800
And I asked the owners, they solved in this study and they put a treat in front of their

32:36.800 --> 32:40.720
dog, told their dog not to eat it, left the root.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.920
And we just sort of saw what happened next.

32:42.920 --> 32:46.360
If they ate the treat, I called the owners back in the room and said they ate it and they

32:46.360 --> 32:48.440
were asked to scold their dogs.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.720
If they didn't eat the treat, I called the owners back in the room and I said they were

32:52.720 --> 32:57.200
obedient and they just greet their dogs happily like you do when you come back from the other

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
room.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.760
But of course it's as I called...

32:59.760 --> 33:02.040
I misled the owners in half the trials.

33:02.040 --> 33:06.600
So sometimes when the dog was obedient, I said actually they ate the treat and so they'd

33:06.600 --> 33:08.040
be scolded.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.760
It was very deceptive.

33:09.760 --> 33:14.680
And sometimes when the dog was disobedient, sometimes when the dog was disobedient, they

33:14.680 --> 33:15.680
got away with it.

33:15.680 --> 33:17.880
I said they didn't eat the treat and so they were greeted.

33:17.880 --> 33:20.680
And then I just taped how much...

33:20.680 --> 33:21.680
What the dog was...

33:21.680 --> 33:23.440
Of these conditions.

33:23.440 --> 33:26.840
And what was clear, clear, clear is that they showed guilty look, a little bit of guilty

33:26.840 --> 33:32.640
look all the time, but they showed most guilty look not when they were actually guilty of

33:32.640 --> 33:35.200
having disobeyed their owner and eating the treat.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.360
It was when the owner scolded them.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.160
You could say a lot of things about that.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.720
You could say dogs don't feel guilt.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.520
I don't think I can say that based on that.

33:45.520 --> 33:49.760
But certainly when we think based on that look that we're getting some access into their

33:49.760 --> 33:52.440
minds, that seems to be a disconnect.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.920
On the other hand, what is that reaction?

33:54.920 --> 34:00.560
It's probably a reaction to the unlearn behavior, kind of like I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

34:00.560 --> 34:02.520
to avoid punishment by the owner.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.480
So is that kind of more intelligent?

34:04.480 --> 34:05.480
Is it more clever?

34:05.480 --> 34:06.480
Is it certainly...

34:06.480 --> 34:07.480
Is it less like us?

34:07.480 --> 34:08.480
I don't know.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.480
It's manipulative as well.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.480
You have the tail head.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.400
Okay, I'll tell the fish story.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.960
This is like the big fish story.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.400
So I was as graduate student.

34:20.400 --> 34:25.400
I was doing my PhD and I was working with this young dolphin who I was asked to teach

34:25.400 --> 34:29.640
her to station, which means the dolphin stays in front of you as long as you have a bucket

34:29.640 --> 34:31.120
on the side of a pool.

34:31.120 --> 34:35.040
It's been caught from in the wild, which I am saying this publicly.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.200
We shouldn't be taking dolphins and whales from the wild.

34:38.200 --> 34:41.600
This was a long time ago when people still did it.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.080
She was a young dolphin and I had to teach her to station.

34:44.080 --> 34:49.320
So I handed these big mackerels to mackerel fish, which are like this big, the dolphin's

34:49.320 --> 34:50.840
head is this big.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.960
And I cut the fish up into three sections, heads, middles and tails.

34:54.960 --> 34:59.160
It would be easier for her to eat and it would give me more fish to work with.

34:59.160 --> 35:04.200
And she ate the heads, she ate the middle sections, she spit out every tail I gave her.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.200
So I looked at it.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.800
Maybe it's the fins that are, you know, she doesn't like.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.920
So I cut the fins off.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.720
I fed her the fish and she ate everything.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.000
So I make the joke who trained who here.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.880
You know, she's now trained me to prepare her fish.

35:17.880 --> 35:22.000
Anyway, she had been a smart dolphin and she had learned to station within a day or

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
so.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.640
And I'm feeding her and everything's fine.

35:24.640 --> 35:30.440
But in the course of me training her to station, if she didn't stay with me, I would use a

35:30.440 --> 35:32.880
correction procedure who will 10 to 15 feet.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.800
And I just stand there and stare at her and she'd watch me.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.800
That was my way of letting her know she did the wrong thing.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.520
It was breaking social contact and she couldn't get.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.720
I come back.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.920
It seemed to work and she learned to stay if she didn't want me to back up.

35:47.920 --> 35:48.920
Everything's going fine.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.600
It's two or three or four days down the line.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.800
And by this time now, I throw her.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.360
She's stationing perfectly.

35:55.360 --> 35:59.120
One day I threw her an untakened steak.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.620
She looks up at me.

36:00.620 --> 36:04.760
She spits the fish out and she makes a beeline for the other side of the pool and takes a

36:04.760 --> 36:07.920
horizontal position and just stands there.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
Right?

36:08.920 --> 36:14.200
And I'm thinking, can this possibly be very much like what you talked about with Alex?

36:14.200 --> 36:17.440
And I'm thinking, is she really using this timeout back on me?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.440
Was it a timeout?

36:18.440 --> 36:19.440
I forgot to tell you that.

36:19.440 --> 36:22.760
So, now this is an anecdote and you're not going to write this one up in a paper.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.040
And I was working on my doctoral thesis at the time.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.880
And I thought, wait a minute, maybe I can make this into an experiment.

36:29.880 --> 36:34.120
So what I did was I was really careful over the next couple of sessions to cut all the

36:34.120 --> 36:35.120
fish right.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.880
And she stayed with me the whole time.

36:36.880 --> 36:42.200
But then a couple days later on purpose, I gave her another uncut tale to see.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.200
And don't you know it?

36:43.200 --> 36:45.040
Bum across the side of the pool.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.600
She does the timeout again.

36:46.600 --> 36:50.080
And she did this on three other occasions over the course of the next weeks.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.720
I love this story because first of all, she went to Dolphin gave me.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.080
She was a complete collaborator on this.

36:56.080 --> 37:00.400
And it just goes to show you to me what's the essence of communication and how it develops.

37:00.400 --> 37:05.080
As a graduate student, that was my field, bioacoustics and communication is when children

37:05.080 --> 37:11.960
learn, when we're interacting at home or animals that we're working with in labs or

37:11.960 --> 37:16.760
the field, there's this mutual synthesis of behavior, synchrony of behavior.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.600
We don't know what the other is, what's in the head of another.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.640
You open any communication textbook.

37:23.640 --> 37:26.440
The meaning is not in the message.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.880
It's in our interpretation.

37:27.880 --> 37:32.000
And what true communication in my mind is about is how we synchronize our behavior patterns,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
how it functions.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.600
I'll give you one more example.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.160
Gregory Bates, and many of you have heard of Gregory Bates in a communication theorist,

37:39.160 --> 37:43.560
he talked about the fact that his son and his wife and he, I think it was Margaret Mead,

37:43.560 --> 37:46.320
he was married to at the time, traveled to South America.

37:46.320 --> 37:51.080
His child didn't know any Spanish and they were unpacking their luggage and his child

37:51.080 --> 37:55.000
went out onto the street and he and his wife look out on the street, they're amazed to

37:55.000 --> 37:59.240
see their kid playing kickball or football in the street.

37:59.240 --> 38:04.320
And every so often they hear him yelling, aki aki and the ball gets thrown to the child.

38:04.320 --> 38:08.720
And you know, he's using it and the kid comes back up into the hotel room and Bates and

38:08.720 --> 38:10.520
says, learn that so fast.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.000
How did you learn what a kimen?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.440
He goes, I don't know what it meant, I just saw how it worked.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.120
When anybody yelled aki, they got the ball.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.000
And I think that's very much what Cersei did.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.880
She learned the function and I think that is really how we start to communicate.

38:22.880 --> 38:27.680
And I think, Alex, when you probably talk to people about their dogs and ask how many

38:27.680 --> 38:31.480
of you think they're communicating, they say, yeah, we communicate with our pets because

38:31.480 --> 38:32.480
we do.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.360
They're learning our patterns, we're learning their patterns, it may not mean the same

38:35.360 --> 38:39.960
thing, but there's some organization and pattern behavior that develops.

38:39.960 --> 38:40.960
So.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.680
I just wanted to go back if it's okay for a moment to the question that Ed asked of

38:45.680 --> 38:52.640
you and your idea that you've been somehow or another have developed a different kind

38:52.640 --> 38:56.200
or a more advanced kind of intelligence and whether or not we would think that was true

38:56.200 --> 38:59.240
of humans 5,000 years ago, whether they were smarter.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.040
And I'd like to suggest that actually.

39:02.040 --> 39:12.640
If Alex is the parent, if Alex has children or the children smarter than other parents.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.320
Well, he didn't have children.

39:15.320 --> 39:22.000
And what happened was he, when we had another little bird in the lab, he was so aggressive

39:22.000 --> 39:27.200
that he had this little bird and interrupt all of his sessions.

39:27.200 --> 39:33.080
You know, Griffin learned some things from Alex, but Alex did not want to teach him.

39:33.080 --> 39:37.800
It was only towards the end of his life that we figured out how to see that he would get

39:37.800 --> 39:42.520
a lot more attention if he helped teach Griffin, but that was the end of his life.

39:42.520 --> 39:49.080
But, you know, I mean, I'm sorry, but it's an interesting question.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.400
And the funny thing is that we now have a little female, so there's no aggression.

39:53.400 --> 39:57.640
And that was one of the reasons we got a female to see if Griffin's going to teach her.

39:57.640 --> 40:03.720
But to add to your question, I think, if we look across other animal societies like elephants,

40:03.720 --> 40:09.400
dolphins, dogs, I'm sure, as well, many animals, dolphins, we see that there is what we think

40:09.400 --> 40:13.160
is growing evidence for cultural transmission.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.520
And yeah, but learning through observation.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.520
What do you do?

40:17.520 --> 40:22.600
I'm actually sort of, in spite of cultural transmission, I mean, I think, Ted, I think

40:22.600 --> 40:27.840
if you were here 5,000 years ago, you would have the same low opinion of humans that you

40:27.840 --> 40:29.640
have of elephants.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.440
Because for 5,000 years, they fricking did nothing, frankly.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.920
I mean, the Bronze Age went on for 2,000 years.

40:34.920 --> 40:39.720
50 generations were born, grew up, and died, and precisely the same technology.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.720
I'm just not like it is today.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.720
Today is different.

40:42.720 --> 40:43.720
I agree.

40:43.720 --> 40:47.000
Since the enlightenment, something has changed, but that can't clearly be evolution because

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
it's not enough time.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.480
I mean, now, if you go away for a holiday for two weeks, you come back and you're operating

40:51.480 --> 40:52.480
systems out of date.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.000
I don't know, everything is wrong.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.160
You're not like part of it anymore, you know.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.720
You're hopelessly behind.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.520
But I mean, there were long, long stretches of time while we were upright and had this

41:01.520 --> 41:06.680
very same brain we had now when kind enough and much happened when we didn't really develop

41:06.680 --> 41:10.760
anything of any particular value and just kept beating the crap out of each other in

41:10.760 --> 41:14.040
little trouble, we still do, in fact.

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
So...

41:15.040 --> 41:21.400
But it is an interesting issue is why us, why us with technology, what stopped...

41:21.400 --> 41:24.000
That's a discontinuity, I agree.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
But it's not an...

41:25.000 --> 41:29.920
One or a physical one or maybe even one of cognition.

41:29.920 --> 41:35.600
I mean, it's a discontinuity of, I don't know, it's a certain kind of thinking that may have

41:35.600 --> 41:36.760
been quite accidental.

41:36.760 --> 41:40.640
It's not as though science had a bunch of times and then petered out.

41:40.640 --> 41:46.400
The Greeks had science, but then it kind of stopped after all the Arabs had a very flourishing

41:46.400 --> 41:49.840
science in it that kind of didn't continue in a way.

41:49.840 --> 41:53.320
So so far, we have one that continues and I think that's in many ways what we refer to

41:53.320 --> 41:54.320
when we...

41:54.320 --> 41:59.160
I mean, not just science, physics and all that, but a scientific frame of mind is what

41:59.160 --> 42:03.640
we refer to as a kind of a modern mind and to me that is different and that's what gives

42:03.640 --> 42:08.240
us I think the impression that we're different than so many other animals or cone habitants.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.880
I think about the fossil record for certain other species.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.200
I'm only going to talk about dolphins.

42:14.200 --> 42:17.760
It's the only one I really feel comfortable talking about that I know anything about.

42:17.760 --> 42:23.880
But you know, there's evidence that over time their brains got larger and the bodies remained

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
somewhat smaller.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.440
So brain size has increased.

42:26.440 --> 42:27.440
There's always the...

42:27.440 --> 42:28.440
Dolphins, cetaceans.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.440
Dolphins and whales.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.800
There's always the constraint of with mammals.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.120
They have to be able to pass through a pelvic bone.

42:35.120 --> 42:39.240
But the brains are large and complex and they've increased in size over time.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.240
So that's interesting.

42:40.240 --> 42:45.760
Again, those brains, you know, the overall bodies of these guys are pretty big and they're

42:45.760 --> 42:47.160
in an aquatic environment.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.640
So perhaps they're less constrained that way.

42:49.640 --> 42:55.720
And then also you have arguments that depending on the...

42:55.720 --> 42:56.720
That animals have.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.680
For example, elephants and dolphins have been...

42:59.680 --> 43:04.480
And humans are considered by many of the show the highest levels of...

43:04.480 --> 43:06.600
There's some papers that have come out recently.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.080
And some of that's really been attributed to...

43:09.080 --> 43:11.040
In these groups and things like that.

43:11.040 --> 43:14.280
So there are all sorts of different ways of thinking about intelligence and how we measure

43:14.280 --> 43:15.280
it.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.760
And I'm sorry, I'd go ahead.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.600
I am on the fact that I don't...

43:21.600 --> 43:26.280
Maybe I just disagree with everyone else here that there is just like a linear progression

43:26.280 --> 43:27.920
that man is at...

43:27.920 --> 43:28.920
Humans are at the Acme.

43:28.920 --> 43:29.920
I just...

43:29.920 --> 43:31.880
I actually don't believe that.

43:31.880 --> 43:32.880
I mean, I don't...

43:32.880 --> 43:33.880
How do you feel?

43:33.880 --> 43:34.880
You feel there is a...

43:34.880 --> 43:38.720
As opposed, I don't necessarily mean there have to be multiple intelligences.

43:38.720 --> 43:39.720
I don't...

43:39.720 --> 43:43.360
I'm not sure that I love the word intelligence to describe what any animal is doing, including

43:43.360 --> 43:44.360
the human animal.

43:44.360 --> 43:48.400
But I guess I'm more ethologically driven.

43:48.400 --> 43:52.080
I'm interested in how the animal is fitting into its environment.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.880
And if the question is maybe it's about success, you know?

43:54.880 --> 43:57.720
I mean, if humans are going to survive, or I don't know if we're going to survive for

43:57.720 --> 44:01.120
another 150 years, but there might be plenty of animals who do.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.920
So are they then the Acme of biological, you know, of...

44:05.920 --> 44:06.920
of neural...

44:06.920 --> 44:09.360
Nearly founded organisms?

44:09.360 --> 44:10.360
To me, I'm still...

44:10.360 --> 44:11.360
I feel like it's a very...

44:11.360 --> 44:16.520
Sometimes you squirrels, you know, get through the bird feeder that you've tried every single

44:16.520 --> 44:19.440
conceivable way of, you know.

44:19.440 --> 44:25.320
And if we're talking about your downing, your type of thing, then we see other animals doing.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.440
So there are things which we seem to do alone.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.840
That I absolutely assent to.

44:29.840 --> 44:36.000
But I find the kind of complexities of other animals' behavior to be as radical.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.160
And the fact that we can't go into their minds and say what they're doing in those moments

44:40.160 --> 44:44.000
when they seem to be doing nothing doesn't mean to me that they're doing nothing.

44:44.000 --> 44:49.800
It seems to me that we don't know what they're doing, which is a fault of our mind, not theirs.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.440
I'm just trying to understand.

44:51.440 --> 44:57.600
I thought a moment ago, you didn't agree with that you felt that there was a discontinuity.

44:57.600 --> 44:58.600
Now it sounds like...

44:58.600 --> 45:00.800
I'm not clear.

45:00.800 --> 45:05.960
I think it's an odd way to pose the whole structure.

45:05.960 --> 45:12.160
There either has to be a continuum or not, because we're at the top of it, right?

45:12.160 --> 45:16.840
That there's some progression of sophistication of cognition.

45:16.840 --> 45:21.000
And then the question you seem to be asking is how do we get very top of that?

45:21.000 --> 45:23.840
What is it through some radical thing that happened?

45:23.840 --> 45:26.720
Or is it sort of through small changes?

45:26.720 --> 45:29.040
And I'm saying I don't think we're up at the top at all.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.720
I think it's sort of messier than that.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.720
That's the wrong...

45:32.720 --> 45:33.880
I mean, that's also...

45:33.880 --> 45:36.600
We now know that's the completely wrong way to think of evolution.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.720
I mean, evolution is not a pyramid.

45:38.720 --> 45:39.720
It's a bush.

45:39.720 --> 45:40.720
It's a tree.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.680
It's a plurality.

45:42.680 --> 45:46.960
Every creature that currently exists is at the top of the evolutionary branch that it's

45:46.960 --> 45:47.960
sifting.

45:47.960 --> 45:48.960
Yeah.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
But it's only...

45:49.960 --> 45:51.040
I think you're absolutely right.

45:51.040 --> 45:57.080
It's only when it comes to mentality or cognition that we insist on this more linear idea that

45:57.080 --> 46:00.000
continuity no longer means a tree, which is also...

46:00.000 --> 46:05.200
I mean, we believe in evolutionary continuity, but it no longer means a plurality of continuities.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.760
It means a single one, a single line.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.680
Here's the dumbest thing and we're the smartest thing.

46:09.680 --> 46:13.560
And everybody has some place along the line, which I think is completely wrong.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.560
Why not?

46:14.560 --> 46:16.320
That's not the point of all of the stuff that we do.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.320
I mean, what did you say?

46:18.320 --> 46:20.400
90 million years for the dolphin, humans?

46:20.400 --> 46:21.400
95...

46:21.400 --> 46:22.400
Okay.

46:22.400 --> 46:28.840
280 million for the parrots versus our last common ancestor with a dinosaur is 280 million

46:28.840 --> 46:29.840
years ago.

46:29.840 --> 46:34.400
I mean, yet, I've got this bird that's doing the same thing a five-year-old can do.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
Okay?

46:35.400 --> 46:40.400
I mean, and again, we don't know some of the things that they're...

46:40.400 --> 46:44.640
So why do you have to get it to do what a five-year-old can do and it didn't develop

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
itself?

46:45.640 --> 46:47.640
The ability to do what a five-year-old can do?

46:47.640 --> 46:52.920
Because I gave it a symbolic representation, which is what you give your five-year-old

46:52.920 --> 46:53.920
to.

46:53.920 --> 46:59.760
I mean, you don't put the five-year-old in a cage and say, here's some food and treats

46:59.760 --> 47:03.120
and I'll come back in five years and see what you've done.

47:03.120 --> 47:05.480
I mean, we give it this symbolic representation.

47:05.480 --> 47:09.760
Our five-year-old representation and parrots didn't.

47:09.760 --> 47:10.760
Well, we don't...

47:10.760 --> 47:16.160
You know, the interesting thing is with all of these animals is that we are just beginning

47:16.160 --> 47:21.280
to understand their communication systems and that's a whole mother, totally another

47:21.280 --> 47:23.240
game plan here, is that...

47:23.240 --> 47:24.240
I mean, we've been...

47:24.240 --> 47:29.640
You know, for bird song, we've been sending bird songs since the 60s and we're just now

47:29.640 --> 47:32.080
because we got so much better equipment.

47:32.080 --> 47:35.160
Okay, being able to start to...

47:35.160 --> 47:39.400
Just really start to tease apart what they're doing when they're sitting out there, you

47:39.400 --> 47:43.560
know, it sounds like just pretty song to us, but we're beginning to learn that there's

47:43.560 --> 47:46.040
so much more complexity.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.520
Each song has a different...

47:47.520 --> 47:53.880
I don't want to say exactly meaning because then you think of it as meaning like our language,

47:53.880 --> 48:01.120
but each song has a different effect on the recipient and the recipient responds in a

48:01.120 --> 48:03.720
different way depending on which song it's heard.

48:03.720 --> 48:04.720
I mean, they're...

48:04.720 --> 48:08.720
I used to call it Marsha Ren Poker, okay, because the bird would...

48:08.720 --> 48:13.240
Each bird has like 50 songs and they have them in different orders and the birds know

48:13.240 --> 48:17.400
not only their 50 songs orders, but their neighbor's 50 songs orders and they'll match

48:17.400 --> 48:20.520
them and raise them one, okay?

48:20.520 --> 48:26.520
So you know, you sing your 47 and I'll go, I'm going to sing your 48, but that's my 32,

48:26.520 --> 48:31.000
but I know it's your 48, so I'm going to match you and raise you one to tell you that I want,

48:31.000 --> 48:35.200
you know, your elbow is getting too close into my territory here.

48:35.200 --> 48:39.800
I mean, these are things we're just beginning to learn, so I'm never going to argue that

48:39.800 --> 48:44.240
their communication systems are as rich and as varied as ours.

48:44.240 --> 48:49.400
At this point, it's not clear that they can sit there and tell you what they did yesterday,

48:49.400 --> 48:50.400
okay?

48:50.400 --> 48:59.440
Right, depends on us too, but the issue is that it is more complicated than we thought,

48:59.440 --> 49:04.360
and I don't think...the one thing I'm sure of is that I couldn't have mapped whatever

49:04.360 --> 49:11.320
English I did onto his abilities if there wasn't some basic cognitive architecture there.

49:11.320 --> 49:16.280
I mean, if he didn't have some kind of innate, quote-unquote, sense of same and different,

49:16.280 --> 49:21.520
I couldn't have mapped English terms of same and different onto it.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.040
And that's a really critical point.

49:23.040 --> 49:27.120
I sort of say, you know, again, we're pretty blind and deaf to what they can do.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.760
We can't decode.

49:28.760 --> 49:32.440
We don't have that magic decoder thing with these guys.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
Yeah.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.440
Right.

49:34.440 --> 49:39.000
I mean, we have the sense system compared to a dog, there's like, there's such primitive

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
idiots.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
I mean...

49:41.000 --> 49:43.480
So, I mean, the problem is not the one of them.

49:43.480 --> 49:47.880
It's sort of something that we would all claim that we're against, but which we're all participating

49:47.880 --> 49:52.360
in, and we're not careful, which is a kind of an anthropocentrism, right?

49:52.360 --> 49:58.720
A anthropocentrism doesn't give other creatures human-like qualities, it's just the opposite.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.880
It uses humans as the only way to measure anything.

50:01.880 --> 50:02.880
Right.

50:02.880 --> 50:07.720
Instead of looking at a plurality of cognitive abilities, a plurality of cognitions, a plurality

50:07.720 --> 50:13.280
of consciousness, all the things brain tissue can do in whatever vehicle that happens to

50:13.280 --> 50:15.680
be running in.

50:15.680 --> 50:20.680
That seems to me to be a much more interesting kind of pursuit than worrying about how to

50:20.680 --> 50:29.160
classify this stuff on a scale in which humans sort of denote the top level, some bug, the

50:29.160 --> 50:30.160
bug, something like that.

50:30.160 --> 50:32.160
If this is kidding, we don't have an octopus.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.200
Let me kind of say something to challenge this idea.

50:35.200 --> 50:41.360
Because the reason why, apart from the question of what's actually true about what happens

50:41.360 --> 50:46.920
in human evolution, I've had the experience very often when I, let's say, give a talk

50:46.920 --> 50:48.640
on anatomy.

50:48.640 --> 50:57.480
When someone speaks up in a group and says, you know, we're really not, I've had people

50:57.480 --> 51:00.560
say this to me in a group, in a seminar.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.600
We're really not like monkeys.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.480
We really have no connection to monkeys.

51:04.480 --> 51:08.640
It turns out that they have very religious creationist kind of view.

51:08.640 --> 51:16.360
People often side with Darwin, say, and very sort of come up to me later on and say, wow,

51:16.360 --> 51:18.040
we don't believe in that.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.600
We're not the animals.

51:19.600 --> 51:20.840
We're part of the animal kingdom.

51:20.840 --> 51:25.320
But I've also had the experience on the flip side that if I say to a group of people, you

51:25.320 --> 51:30.560
don't really think that the law of natural selection explains what's happened with the

51:30.560 --> 51:35.320
emergence of complex life forms, particularly the human life form, which by the way, I

51:35.320 --> 51:40.080
have no trouble at all unique for vaccines.

51:40.080 --> 51:44.080
And I think one way that we don't understand birds, I don't think we understand all the

51:44.080 --> 51:45.640
human faculties either.

51:45.640 --> 51:51.000
And when I say that flip side of it, people will often say, you're right, I don't believe

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
it.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
And I've found that to be the same group, we'll go both ways.

51:55.000 --> 52:01.480
In other words, our lived beliefs often don't reflect our intellectual beliefs.

52:01.480 --> 52:05.920
Our intellectual belief in natural selection is often not people's lived belief.

52:05.920 --> 52:11.720
And I want to know why, because the fact is that we all, why is it that, yes, I agree,

52:11.720 --> 52:19.720
birds can do things we didn't dream of 100 years ago, but why is it that a six-year-old

52:19.720 --> 52:22.600
can often outstrip what any bird can do?

52:22.600 --> 52:23.600
Why?

52:23.600 --> 52:26.120
What happened in humans to make them so smart?

52:26.120 --> 52:32.960
Well, I'm not, when I say this, I don't, well, and birds can do things that six-year-olds

52:32.960 --> 52:33.960
cannot do.

52:33.960 --> 52:39.600
I don't mean to, I don't mean to say that humans are better in every respect than animals.

52:39.600 --> 52:41.200
That's not my point of view.

52:41.200 --> 52:47.240
I mean, Darwin remarked that the instincts of bees were as wonderful as human intelligence

52:47.240 --> 52:48.480
in that comment.

52:48.480 --> 52:52.040
He was, Darwin loved the animal kingdom.

52:52.040 --> 52:54.040
He sort of almost worshiped it.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.040
I agree with that.

52:55.040 --> 52:59.600
I think cats, we have three cats, and I think they're unbelievable.

52:59.600 --> 53:04.760
And they're far more sensitive in my home in many ways.

53:04.760 --> 53:09.160
So I'm not saying humans are just somehow better in every respect, but with respect

53:09.160 --> 53:16.320
to the question of decoupled cognizance, something has happened in humans that hasn't

53:16.320 --> 53:17.920
happened with any other species.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.600
And my question is why?

53:19.600 --> 53:21.240
Does not explain it?

53:21.240 --> 53:24.760
I think it only explains a part of it.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.600
It can't explain all of it.

53:26.600 --> 53:30.720
And one of the reasons why natural selection can't explain all of it is because natural

53:30.720 --> 53:37.920
selection as a proposition already presupposes life and a proposition that includes something

53:37.920 --> 53:43.480
like, in this case, life as part of the proposition can't explain something presupposed in the

53:43.480 --> 53:45.280
process.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.760
Natural selection sounds like an abstract principle, but it isn't.

53:48.760 --> 53:55.160
It's a principle that says, hey, if they're a mating pair of birds that create four birds

53:55.160 --> 54:01.600
every year, and the population of birds in a given area, assuming they're no incoming

54:01.600 --> 54:06.360
and outgoing birds, remains the same, that means every year two out of four of the birds

54:06.360 --> 54:07.360
are dying.

54:07.360 --> 54:13.560
It's just a simple randomness principle that the ones that are let it for their environment

54:13.560 --> 54:17.760
die and the ones that are slightly more, it's a randomness principle, but it presupposes

54:17.760 --> 54:22.240
life and life is already moving toward a higher organization.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
The question is why.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
That's completely wrong.

54:24.240 --> 54:27.120
Well, so I'm sorry.

54:27.120 --> 54:30.080
So one of the things that evolution and natural selection...

54:30.080 --> 54:34.920
Before you answer, I would like to hear from everyone on this question, not just told them

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
wrong, okay?

54:35.920 --> 54:36.920
Okay.

54:36.920 --> 54:40.960
So I would just say that I think one of the common errors about evolution and natural

54:40.960 --> 54:47.720
selection is that it's an optimization procedure, that it's optimizing everything that the best

54:47.720 --> 54:51.520
that there is and will continue to improve, that it's an improvement program, and that's

54:51.520 --> 54:54.720
just simply not the case.

54:54.720 --> 55:00.160
That's why 99.9% of the species that have ever existed on the planet are currently extinct.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.840
So it's not very good at optimizing at all.

55:01.840 --> 55:05.920
There's an old joke about this, which is a science joke, so it's not going to be funny.

55:05.920 --> 55:10.160
Don't plan on laughing or anything, but two scientists are out camping one night in the

55:10.160 --> 55:14.400
woods, you know, and the flated night and all of a sudden a bear begins to sort of attack

55:14.400 --> 55:15.840
the tent and rattle the tent.

55:15.840 --> 55:16.840
Well, they both jump up.

55:16.840 --> 55:20.880
One of them starts putting his sneakers on, and the other one says, what are you telling

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
your sneakers over?

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
You can't outrun a bear.

55:22.880 --> 55:25.320
He says, I just have to outrun you.

55:25.320 --> 55:27.360
So you know, right?

55:27.360 --> 55:32.200
So evolution is only optimized to outrun each other, so the other guy is the meal, not

55:32.200 --> 55:34.680
the eater of the person.

55:34.680 --> 55:42.680
So yeah, this is a better joke than I thought.

55:42.680 --> 55:45.600
I didn't make it up.

55:45.600 --> 55:50.040
So I think you will, I just think you have to be careful not to get in there.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.240
So I in some ways agree with you.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.280
I didn't say evolution is optimizing anything.

55:54.280 --> 55:59.160
No, in fact, you might even have a better species than humans that doesn't get selected

55:59.160 --> 56:05.360
next year, I mean, theoretically, because natural selection doesn't allow natural selection

56:05.360 --> 56:07.440
as a principle isn't operating.

56:07.440 --> 56:10.640
I'm saying it doesn't explain the whole question of how life is.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.720
I agree with you because it's not an optimization thing.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.560
It's nothing to do with optimization.

56:15.560 --> 56:19.800
I mean, the fact that we're able to have this round table and smart enough to talk and all

56:19.800 --> 56:24.360
the rest of this kind of stuff could just be some, probably likely is for sure some huge

56:24.360 --> 56:25.360
accident.

56:25.360 --> 56:27.080
It's a good one so far.

56:27.080 --> 56:30.760
I mean, we don't really know how well it's going to work.

56:30.760 --> 56:32.680
I mean, surely it will be extinct one day.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.600
Everything else is why wouldn't we be?

56:34.600 --> 56:37.400
So I'm just suggesting in some ways I'm actually supporting what you're saying.

56:37.400 --> 56:41.160
I wouldn't use evolution to explain a scale of intelligence.

56:41.160 --> 56:44.680
I wouldn't use it actually to explain a scale of anything.

56:44.680 --> 56:45.800
So in that sense, I agree with you.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.800
I just, so I think it's a strong man.

56:48.800 --> 56:50.640
It's all arrow direction.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.880
Evolution or there is.

56:51.880 --> 56:54.000
So what's the purpose of that arrow direction?

56:54.000 --> 56:56.240
Oh, there is no arrow of direction.

56:56.240 --> 56:58.400
So I'm saying it's a sort of a strong man argument.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.000
That's all I'm, my only point is not.

57:00.000 --> 57:06.640
I don't believe evolution has an arrow either, but I believe life itself pushes toward organization.

57:06.640 --> 57:11.680
And I know that's controversial, but the fact is that when you allow people to say, well,

57:11.680 --> 57:16.680
you know, it does kind of appeal, this isn't species don't disappear.

57:16.680 --> 57:22.480
There have been other, there seems to have been a species, an upright hominid that had

57:22.480 --> 57:25.240
a larger brain than us that didn't make it.

57:25.240 --> 57:28.360
So it's not as if something animal is meant to appear.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.560
I'm not even suggesting that.

57:30.560 --> 57:34.640
It does everything we've talked about is based on vertebrates.

57:34.640 --> 57:36.280
I mean, most of our discussion.

57:36.280 --> 57:44.200
And why is it that vertebrates go to, no, I know, cephalopods are amazing, but cephalopods

57:44.200 --> 57:49.200
are not going to go past the design template that's allowed them.

57:49.200 --> 57:53.720
I think some cephalopods appear to be incredibly smart in ways that we, I don't think we should

57:53.720 --> 57:54.720
eat an octopus.

57:54.720 --> 57:57.640
I think they seem to be to be too smart.

57:57.640 --> 58:01.480
And I don't like to eat animals that are, that's smart.

58:01.480 --> 58:10.400
But they have a design that's doesn't, isn't going to go past what their design allows.

58:10.400 --> 58:14.080
In the same way, I think that a bird design can't go past what a bird design allows.

58:14.080 --> 58:17.760
But do you say that you don't know what the design is going to go?

58:17.760 --> 58:18.760
Yeah.

58:18.760 --> 58:22.680
Well, they've been, because it's not, as far as I can tell, I mean, I'm the expert on an

58:22.680 --> 58:23.680
octopus.

58:23.680 --> 58:30.040
But as far as I know, design can't, it can't morph, it can't somehow get bones.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.600
We haven't seen an octopus appear.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.120
Didn't we come out of the water, basically?

58:34.120 --> 58:36.640
Well, no, what do we look like in the water?

58:36.640 --> 58:39.120
No, but an octopus has gone in a particular line of evolution.

58:39.120 --> 58:41.040
It can't go backwards in people's bones.

58:41.040 --> 58:42.040
I'm just saying.

58:42.040 --> 58:43.040
No, but I don't, I disagree.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.520
I don't think that's the case.

58:45.520 --> 58:49.760
I mean, it certainly, it's been for quite a period of time, but there's nothing that

58:49.760 --> 58:56.560
foundationally biologically is against it evolving into something slightly different.

58:56.560 --> 59:04.320
I think that are there, that, you know, there's a pile of scents that sits around and will

59:04.320 --> 59:08.600
only get expressed under certain conditions.

59:08.600 --> 59:13.560
I mean, it's the Darwin's Finches things, where you start switching things around and

59:13.560 --> 59:15.280
then they'll change and back and forth.

59:15.280 --> 59:22.320
Then it got the pie that actually walk sometimes on two of their, you know, legs, arms, and

59:22.320 --> 59:26.320
you could see where bipedal and you could see under certain circumstances that could

59:26.320 --> 59:29.040
be selected for, there might be advantages and things.

59:29.040 --> 59:33.440
I mean, I think we have to be really careful about saying where animals can, how they

59:33.440 --> 59:37.360
can and cannot change and the college epigenetic thing.

59:37.360 --> 59:42.720
What it looks like in the case of human cognition or human mental abilities is, there's something

59:42.720 --> 59:45.600
that's going faster than you could explain by evolution.

59:45.600 --> 59:51.600
Something has developed that you can't simply use an evolution for because there's been

59:51.600 --> 59:53.120
enough time in a way.

59:53.120 --> 59:55.440
And I mean, I agree with you.

59:55.440 --> 59:57.640
My only concern is I feel like it's a strong man argument.

59:57.640 --> 59:58.640
I'm not quite saying that.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.880
I'm saying that a natural selection alone doesn't explain it.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.320
Yeah, I also, but so I was a little concerned.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.440
So what do you mean by life tries to get better or so?

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.440
What did you say?

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.440
Exactly.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.440
About living matter, does something?

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
It verdence.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440
It sounds like it had a point.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:24.240
Well, you know, it sounds nice when you're using a, when we talk the language of science,

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.040
it sounds, you know, we have a sort of, seem to have a preference for sort of arguments

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:33.320
about randomness or, and we tend to get cynical and say, well, human beings at 30, everything

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.320
deteriorates, you know, we're not really meant to be here.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.720
We're sort of meant to die off and we keep our elders alive because it seems more civilized.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:48.520
And so the cynical language, I don't think that's really what's going on with humans.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.680
I think with vertebrates are what they are.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.440
And intelligence has developed because they express a level of complexity that you don't

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.760
find in other animals.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:06.040
I mean, an animal with an external skeleton can't, again, I'm no expert on insects, but

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:11.960
an animal with an exoskeleton sort of is a dead end in terms of design.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.840
But the vertebrate design was so, with the internal skeleton, the internal skeleton,

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:24.400
the musculature on the outside going on to land, which a flexible design that it allowed

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.240
pull, you know, like a book of marvels.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.720
It allowed all these different animals to emerge, which we're looking at and we're

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.800
one of them.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:38.240
And that is based on the complex multi-celled design that we have.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.240
How does life push in that direction?

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.320
Why does it push in that direction?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.760
It's got organization.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.400
Life, we haven't understood what makes life what it is.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:53.560
And one of the properties seems to me is that it is self-organizing and it puts different

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.520
ways of organizing itself.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.920
And I know scientists don't like that, but...

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.240
I can't really understand as a useful expert.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.280
Well, I just can't understand it as a useful explanation.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.440
It looks that way.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.760
Yeah, but you don't defy the second law of thermodynamics.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.440
I don't care who you are.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.080
I don't care how great you think we are.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.440
The second law of thermodynamics, I'm sorry.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.560
What's remarkable about us is that we figured out there's a second law of thermodynamics.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.440
That I will admit to you, that's one of the most remarkable...

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.720
A mentation I can ever imagine, but you don't get away with it.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.800
That's like biblical, second law of thermodynamics.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.120
You don't mess with that.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.200
I just don't think there's any indication that we ever get away with it.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.200
If life is...

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.040
If there's only entropy, if things are only...

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.240
How is it that we're all sitting here and can maintain our organized life forms in such

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.400
a high level even...

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.240
The other word, using up the planet to do it.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240
That's how we do it.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240
We use up the planet.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240
Which is fine.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
I'm not even against that.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.400
You know, I don't necessarily...

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.140
But within reason, I suppose.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.680
But in point, that's how we do it.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.600
The course of our life and species itself could fall apart.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.560
I mean, we're just a snapshot.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.520
I feel like we're very focused in our...

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.640
We're very provincial in our looking.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.000
I mean, of course we're going to be anthropocentric.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.760
We're anthrows.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760
That's...

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:22.140
I think the only thing we can do is be aware, but also the temporal probability.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.300
like we see here and we see, you know, we know what's happening right then and maybe

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.540
what happened yesterday.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:32.940
I mean, actually that is very narrow and what is actually happening in the species or what's

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.260
actually the case with our species I think is very hard to say.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.820
I don't want to say it.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.740
You know, I think we are probably.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:46.140
I'm more of a believer in physics than biology there.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.140
We're falling apart.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:55.580
When I say this organization, I see some people nodding and when I say this, this organization

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.580
is so people.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:05.900
Interesting sort of area of psychology, which I don't know that much about, but it really

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:14.460
is again, a dependent thing, which means the way you phrase a particular question affects

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.100
the kind of answer you get.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.900
And I'm wondering if we're dancing around that a little bit too.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.500
So that there's certain ways you say, well, you know, would you, it's a study about it

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.140
says, you know, there's a certain amount of for doing something.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:32.940
You probably know this better than I and it's like you can say it's that 50% of the people

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:37.100
will get this disease or you could say so many people out of a certain number will get this

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.620
disease and if you phrase it one way, it's much more positive than the other.

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:44.060
You probably can.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:49.580
There's something about being liars, damn liars, mathematicians.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:55.820
But this whole, it's an entire subset of psychology that basically, what do you think in Madison

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.900
Avenue certainly takes advantage of it.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:03.980
So that there are, there are ways of phrasing certain types of questions and you have to

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.380
be very careful about that too.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:07.380
Yes.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:14.620
I mean, I think the danger, I think what Alex Andrews saying is that we are trapped if

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:18.100
we're not very careful in a fairly parochial view of things.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.700
It's very local and it's very hard.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:26.700
I mean, this is why pseudoscience is so, it gets purchased so easily because it's very

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.220
hard not to look.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:33.420
I mean, there's a great story by Wittgenstein, apparently at some point was walking with

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:40.020
a friend and said, it's always a man, people so long to figure out that the earth is rotating

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.100
and the sun is standing still.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:46.220
And his friend said, well, but Ludwig, it looks that way, doesn't it?

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:50.660
And we can see because what would it look like if the earth were rotating and the sun

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.660
was standing still?

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.780
It looks like what it is, you know?

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:55.300
But it does just look that way.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.940
And indeed, it's still very hard to figure out why it is the earth is spinning in a thousand

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.700
miles an hour and the birds and the clouds aren't being left behind.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.740
I mean, really, most people could not tell you how that is.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:10.180
I'm not so sure I could in a way that you would believe me.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.100
So but it's very easy to have these.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.540
I mean, we still all live in a pre-kapurnican world.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:19.260
We're real smart folks sitting in this room and we say, what time is the sun setting?

01:06:19.260 --> 01:06:25.500
Well, the sun's not setting and it's not, you know, but that's the way it goes, you

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:26.800
know?

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:32.260
We live in a Newtonian world and that's not true either, really, but it serves our purposes.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.980
But you're going to have these parochial views and believe there's a lot of truth in them.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.100
And I think that's a potential danger.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.100
You have to be covered.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:49.020
You do have to try and expand it a bit as much as you possibly can, it seems to me.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:56.020
We do, who are studying animals is give examples of animals doing something which seems to

01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:03.860
us who is evidence of a kind of cognition and then maybe somebody will give a counter-example

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.300
of a person doing something like that.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:10.220
And that's also a way of defining our terms.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.460
I mean, we're trying to just get traction and to get any funding or anybody to take

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.940
you seriously when you're dealing with the non-human animals.

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:17.940
That's part of it.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:21.700
But also, what if we all just talked about the mistakes that we see animals make or the

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:26.940
mistakes that humans make and had that be defining of what the species were, we would

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:31.860
look very different as people as opposed to looking at our high achievements and being

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.060
so impressed by our high achievements.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:39.740
I'm thinking about all the mistakes I've recently made.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:45.060
Would that be defining of me as a human being, as a member of the species?

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.860
Would that be any more indicative maybe of what the human is?

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:55.140
Human species and we talk about, well, no animal is a Picasso or a Beethoven or an Einstein,

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.700
but there's only been a Picasso.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:05.140
I mean, the thing is we look at these exceptional individuals and we say, well, humans are capable

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.700
of this because one or two of these individuals have done this.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:14.300
But the average person on the street, I mean, I can't comparatively carry a tune, much

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.820
less do what Beethoven did.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:22.900
So again, we also have to think about it in those ways that we put ourselves on this

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:28.780
pinnacle and also in academia, there's even a stronger chance of this because we hang

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.180
out with all these elites and stuff.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.460
So this is another thing that we have to think about too.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:40.380
I mean, even the psych studies, we talk about now that these students being weird, you know,

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:45.460
up educated, you know, I mean, it's like we're all the studies we do in psychology, they're

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.980
all in, you know, college sophomores, okay, and we try to claim that this is representative

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:50.980
of the human race.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.980
I mean, this is insane.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:58.620
I think one of the themes I think that's emerging or it's conversation from the idea

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:02.860
of plurality and different ways of thinking is, you know, again, we're the ones talking

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860
about it.

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.900
A really broad look and you look at insect societies, you look at the algebra, I keep

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.900
remembering I have dolphins just because I study them.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.460
These are societies and they're in every way.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:17.460
When you look at a dolphin society, they have not altered their environment much.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.620
They can't relate it, but their bodies have changed morphologically.

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:27.900
They've radically streamlined to adapt to their environment and beautifully continue

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:30.060
to change, obviously, as we've seen it.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.420
And they find ways to coordinate their behavior.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:38.900
They show exquisite complexity and they're not destroying their environment.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.700
So you know, again, this sort of gets back to you.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.700
Big brains taking care of their own operating, helping others.

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:52.860
I mean, that's pretty cool in my book about what is sort of evolved and it just hasn't

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.740
evolved in our way.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.420
We've taken another route and we're facing a lot of problems now.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.100
Dolphins may be facing other problems we aren't aware of.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.660
But again, I think we have...

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:07.060
The stream is at the Mark Moffatt who's an entomologist, a specialist.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.860
Have you ever had him at one of these things?

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.340
You should have Mark Moffatt.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.540
Yeah, well, I'll get him to come over here.

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.620
He's busy with his hands all the time.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.740
But Mark points out that there are really only two species on the planet that live in

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:23.660
societies that number into the millions and that are willing to live in a society in which

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:28.300
they don't pretty much know within one or two degrees of separation, at least everybody

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300
in the society.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.620
They don't live with strangers.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.580
So chimp troops and things like that, all number under 100...

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.100
The only two species that are willing to live in vast numbers with strangers all around

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:40.100
them.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.580
They're sitting in a room like full of strangers here, right?

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.660
And it's just us and ants.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.660
And only certain...

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.540
We live in these huge colonies where they just...

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.660
There's no way they know everybody, but they do it.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:52.660
They're fine with it.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:53.660
And us, weird, huh?

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.660
I don't know.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.660
It makes you feel creepy.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.660
That's...

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:09.940
One of the reasons why I originally brought this subject up with Diana.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:14.940
And then you, Stuart, and I think...

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:25.460
I think you were also there when we first discussed this was...

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.860
I was looking at it the other way around.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:35.180
We focused on what animals can do and animals or intelligence and their ability to learn

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.620
and so on.

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:42.940
I was also interested the other way because with my background in psychoanalysis, so my

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:46.620
focus has always been the mind.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:55.180
It has not been on, in what ways, a lot of things that we attribute motivation to are

01:11:55.180 --> 01:12:02.220
really biologically determined just as they are in animals.

01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:09.340
And so a lot of things we do say similar to what you said.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:14.780
A newborn turns towards the mother's breast and sucks on the breast.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:21.860
And in psychoanalysis, there is an idea that from Freud that this is the beginning of

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:26.100
psychosexual development and there's pleasure attached to it and so on.

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.820
And so animals do it too.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:36.780
So my question is, and I wonder if you can say something a little bit more about that.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:43.500
This excessive focus on the mind in understanding people's behavior is incomplete.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:50.100
And how would understanding animals' behavior help us understand more human behavior?

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.820
Can I raise my hand on that one?

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:58.140
So this is something I find really interesting particularly when we get in the area of social

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.500
sexual behavior in humans and other animals.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.580
Obviously, we're a lot more tolerant in our society now than we were before.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:13.540
You look at other animals like binobos, which are very sophisticated primates and dolphins,

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.460
and you look at the development of what we call socio-sexual behavior.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.060
So I'll give you the shortest possible story here.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.020
So we had studied two mothers on their calves in a facility.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:31.740
What you see is that what looks to be the adult sexual behavior pattern and much of

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.260
social behavior develops with mothers and infants.

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.340
They are stimulating their babies, they're nursing their babies, they're nursing their

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:42.580
babies, they're not the ventrum solicitors of babies.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:47.380
There may be some where we don't know where the baby starts nursing, one creases, the

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.620
mother tends to direct it.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:54.540
Then the mother is also stimulating the big genital area with her big genital area.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.540
Then you see these chases that ensue, the baby sprints off from the mother, the mother's

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.460
chasing the baby.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:05.980
As I was watching this, I was looking and I'm saying I'm seeing the courtship behavior

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.740
pattern in the adult pattern.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.620
I found it fascinating because again, when you think about the roots of sociality and

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.020
sexuality, it may come from these very early interactions.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.220
Then we saw these two young children had shown these interactions with their mothers.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.260
Now in their first months, that's how they start interacting.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.140
That's what they know, solicitors.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:31.340
You see this in the wild, it's not just in a captive situation.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.980
We obviously want to keep looking.

01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:36.740
But I think there's a great deal that can be learned about the nature of what, again,

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.660
the socio-sexual behavior.

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:45.900
You look at male dolphins and people who don't know about dolphins say, oh, they're gay

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.020
or they're homosexual.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020
They're not.

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.260
They're interacting socially.

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.700
That is their behavior.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:57.980
And female distress and start soliciting, it becomes reproductive behavior.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:02.140
I think it broadens our view of these big-brained animals.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:08.340
I think in our own species, take away the biblical underpinnings of what we should be

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.580
doing and what we shouldn't.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.620
I think that may be much more natural state.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:16.380
We see with bonobo societies a great deal of behavior with penguins.

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:21.220
We see much more socio-sexual behavior in the animal world.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.660
And humans are part of the animal world.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.660
So when I open her.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:34.020
A lot of things that we assume we are deciding to act in a certain way or do certain things

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.460
are in fact biologically detailed.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.100
It's not like residing.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.660
What's a different meaning?

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:40.660
No, no.

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.660
It's a different panel.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:42.660
You're on the wrong panel.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:53.500
No, but what I'm trying to say is that there's certain that we assume we are an agenting,

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.980
that we really are simply repeating what...

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.980
One of many.

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.540
Yeah, I'm guessing about 98% of the things we do are not.

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:03.540
But that's...

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.540
Yes.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.900
Franz de Valds going to be speaking next week at the American Museum and doing a great

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.900
talk on empathy.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.300
But I'd also say there's another view as to how this kind of thing can tell us about human

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:17.540
behavior, which is actually I think Alexandra's point of view, which is we can learn about

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:23.020
our own behavior by the things we project onto a dog.

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:28.140
So when it comes to domestic animals, of course, we're in a selection seat with domestic animals.

01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:31.900
So we select for things that appeal to us...

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.580
...of lee or food wise maybe, our taste buds.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:40.180
But in the case of dogs that we don't eat, we're clearly selecting for traits that we

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180
find appealing.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:44.100
So this must tell us something about us.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:48.420
And I know you're work enough to know that we make all sorts of mistakes about what they

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.700
do because we've rejected on them, right?

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:51.700
Right.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.500
Many of our projections could probably...

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.620
I mean, could be...

01:16:55.620 --> 01:17:01.460
But most of them really are reflections on ourself, it seems to me.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.740
And as to that question of kind of what looking at animal behavior could tell us about human

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:11.020
behavior, I think because we don't have an actual human mind, we do that.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.540
We just attribute.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:16.100
And as scientists, we say, okay, don't attribute and so just look at behavior.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.300
But so we're kind of...

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300
We're given...

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.180
There's too much richness in the human.

01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.900
We have, we think, access to each other's minds, or at least a way we feel like it's

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.900
going to be roughly analogous to my mind, right?

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.100
And so we don't even really look at behavior so much.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:35.420
I mean, those who look at behavior like an ethologist, a human behavior, I think...

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:40.500
One of those same types of patterns that Diane is talking about with the dolphins, right?

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:47.100
And we recapitulate the kind of behavior, action patterns we have in our early life later

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.100
on.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:53.860
And again, the ones that work to get the mate or get the friendship or get the job, we keep

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.740
those ones and we do away with the other ones.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.660
But it's the same type of thing.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:01.460
It's just that we talk about it at a higher level, right?

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:03.140
And all of those cognitive...

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.140
The words we talk...

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.700
I mean, this is what is so interesting about, you know, as...

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.820
Narrative psychologists, all of us who are looking at non-human minds, are words are human

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.940
words for human development.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.460
When do we get a theory of mind?

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.900
When do we have self-awareness?

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:20.740
When do we develop empathy or secondary emotions and so forth?

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.900
But with all of those, we could say, well, do we really have it?

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.900
You know, theory of mind is one of those great ones where the theory of mind is thinking

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.620
the thing that all humans develop, that we're thinking at about age three or four, what

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.300
other people know or believe that's different from ourselves.

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:39.100
You know, before age three, children aren't really doing that, right?

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:43.300
They're classically egocentric and they think everybody knows what we know.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.100
But at age four, they realize they have to wait until their mother is out of the room

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.700
to cookie, right?

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:51.940
And then they can deceive her because she doesn't know about that.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:55.740
Well, but you could also look at a lot of human behavior and say, are we really acting

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.740
with a theory of mind?

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:02.540
I mean, it's what I'm doing now in my attempt to communicate, taking into account what everybody,

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:07.140
maybe it's imploring everybody else is bringing to the subject so that we are best communicating,

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.540
certainly not.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.420
I'm just talking, you know, and I'm hoping that some of it hits, right?

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:17.220
And I have a general, I'd make a general guess as to what other people's understanding

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:22.740
it, and how they came to their, the words they're using.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.940
But I certainly, I might be in the theory of mind at that level.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:32.380
And so the better way would really be, I mean, I am totally an ethologist, but to look at

01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:40.380
me and just say, how do I change my behavior to best suit situations?

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:45.740
And that would explain to me huge amounts of, you know, what Freud also tries to explain

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:47.740
using the mind.

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:52.020
So Ed, so I, let me give an alternative.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:58.020
You could, I sort of am a human ethologist, as some of you know, I teach the Alexander

01:19:58.020 --> 01:20:00.660
technique and my own ideas on this.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:05.980
So I sort of daily observe people and I teach people performing actions.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:12.620
And one thing that I observed early on as a teacher, and I, as well, is that even a simple

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:18.420
so-called voluntary movement in a human being is not nearly as voluntary as it appears.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:22.620
And you could demonstrate this with someone, you could ask them not to perform an action,

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:27.380
and they'll agree with you that they will not, that they do not intend to and will not.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:32.420
And then you could actually vicariously perform the movement for them, and they will perform

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.580
it against their will very often.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.500
And you're, in my view, by the way, you're demonstrating mind.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.940
I mean, you're demonstrating that they've, there's no way to account, except to say

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:48.420
that they action, you know, borrowing from William James, who described this kind of thing

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:50.620
years ago.

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:56.980
So in even the simplest action, you could describe in humans, you could, you can observe

01:20:56.980 --> 01:21:02.460
something very mechanical and determined sort of.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:09.660
And in that respect, not very different from other animals, the problem is that humans,

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:15.740
unlike any other animal, are capable of observing that and actually raising the process of how

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.060
they do things to a more conscious level.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.100
And that's one thing that I study.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:24.700
I study, I use the word mindfulness, but I study kind of mindfulness as a psychophysical

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:27.820
process, not just attentional.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:35.340
And my question is, if all, if all human behavior can be reduced, or 98% of it can be reduced

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:40.900
to what we see in animals, why is it that we're capable of being mindful about it all

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:41.900
the time?

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:48.380
Why is it that we're capable of actually observing our, let's say, selfish motives and saying,

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.660
I don't want to behave that way.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.740
I actually see that something I want to say is pretty much a need to speak, so I'm not

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.300
going to say that.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:02.020
This quality, this capacity in humans, to me, it separates humans from all the other animals.

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.180
And it separates our behavior from any animal behavior.

01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:06.580
Mindfulness alone.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:15.140
And what worries me is that people will go to a Buddhist seminar, and they say, this

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:16.140
is great.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.080
And then the next week, they'll go to a scientific seminar, and they say, no, we're

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.900
not going to be animals.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:21.900
Well which is it?

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900
I mean, listen.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900
I guess that.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.900
I get that.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.900
I get that.

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.900
I get that.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.980
I'm saying that no other animals can show constraint or conscious thought about self or

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.980
control.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.140
Here, I'll stand on my ground.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:40.820
And no animal is capable of being mindful of practicing conscious attention.

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:41.820
Oh, wait.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.820
What does that mean?

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:43.820
Yeah.

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.820
Let's get into a definition here.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:46.820
Yeah.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.820
Define it.

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:48.820
I don't know what you mean either.

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:50.580
Can you tell us exactly what you mean?

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:59.100
Well, a very simple, you know, sort of in the moment description of mindfulness is simply

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:04.780
doing something and being able to do it, being consciously aware while you do it.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.780
Yes.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.780
Well, wait a minute.

01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780
Let me talk about this.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:14.340
But this is only a very fringe of what humans are capable of.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:15.820
I mean, you're capable of.

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.900
I really don't understand that either.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:21.660
Well, I know, but this is why I think I'm here.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.660
And this is because I noticed that everyone's pointing at me.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:25.940
But you need to articulate a little bit better.

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:26.940
Okay.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.940
But give me an example.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:30.420
Give me a solid example.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:40.220
The other problem with when we try to explain human behavior by looking at animal behavior

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:46.180
is that we segregate the aspects of human behavior that are clearly, in my view, clearly

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.580
different.

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:52.500
And then when you say, hey, this is what I think is clearly different, people say, well,

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:53.780
is that even there?

01:23:53.780 --> 01:24:03.660
Well, mindfulness is not an easy discipline to learn, but we know it can be learned.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.700
I mean, there's just no question about this.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:09.660
We know that martial artists practice it, people in meditation practice it.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.660
So, trying to explain what that is may not be so easy.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:19.340
I believe that there are a number of faculties like that similar to that that aren't not

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:21.460
just mindfulness, but anyway.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:35.220
But what you're trying to argue is that a parrot sitting on a perd would not be mindful.

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.220
How would we?

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.140
Well, I'm not studying parrots.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:42.140
Well, I mean, any.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.940
You know, I study children.

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.420
I study children.

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.100
And I study children, you know, from a fairly young age.

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:57.460
So, in my view, kids cannot even remotely approach what mindfulness is clearly not till

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:03.100
they're in their teens and generally speaking later after their teens cannot even begin

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:04.100
to approach it.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:07.620
So, to me, it's a cognitive skill.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:13.660
And so, because I see it, see it, how difficult it is, you can't even speak of a toddler being

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:14.660
mindful.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:15.740
It's just not possible.

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:19.380
And that's why I'm willing to make the transition to animals.

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:24.620
From what I understand of mindfulness, and it's not something I've got the idea of sort

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:29.540
of monitoring your own feelings and thoughts and becoming more aware of your motivations

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:36.540
and your overall surrounding, it's an expanded awareness of you and one aspect of that.

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:37.540
Okay.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.060
So, it can also be being aware of proprioceptively.

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:48.140
Let's say you're sitting here and you're aware not just having kinesthetic or proprioceptive

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:53.500
input about your body, but monitoring it constantly so that it's something that's always in your

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.500
background awareness.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:59.620
It could be, there are various ways, or you could be focused on someone, as I am, let's

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:03.340
say to you, but I also may be aware of my peripheral field.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.780
And I'm aware of you so that it's something that if I were a martial artist, I can't

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:12.860
do that, so that even when I'm attending selectively, someone could enter the room and I would see

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.820
them enter the room.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820
This is...

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.820
There's no animals going to survive if they can.

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:20.540
No, I know, but yeah, I'll make a distinction.

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.540
Cats, cats, and dog...

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.980
I mean, again, I know cats and...

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.380
Some cats and dogs pretty well.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:30.740
Cats are very, very alert in various ways, but they are...

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.260
I think this is going to elicit a lot of controversy.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:35.180
They are subconsciously alert.

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.420
They can't be consciously alert by definition.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:40.340
Oh, wait a minute.

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.340
I don't understand that.

01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:45.580
Yeah, perhaps, but I'm going to make it.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.980
And I've written a whole book on this subject.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.980
Well, having written a book on this subject actually doesn't make it any less unfounded.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:54.980
Okay.

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.980
You know, the fact that we don't have any...

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.980
It's like we have like...

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:04.860
That's just that lovely thing, which we do with each other when we don't know something

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:11.300
about a topic like the mind of a bird that we just assume there's nothing in there, or

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.780
that it's just going to be some variation of ours.

01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:15.620
I get that, but it's as if now I'm saying...

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.700
It's not that I get that, but it's that is...

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.700
The core of your question, you're saying like the difference is...

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.380
And I could be wrong, so please, correct me.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:28.980
But you're saying the difference is that animals might be alert and yet...

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:33.420
Something that's happening, the periphery, sort of that mindful in the moment thing, but

01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:37.620
the difference is that we are conscious and animals are not conscious.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:41.900
However, I can't know that I'm right about saying that animals are not conscious, but

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.900
that doesn't matter.

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:44.900
Let me...

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.940
I'll tell you why I think there's a...

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.620
The distinction to me is...

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.620
I don't think I'm making an unwarranted assumption.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.060
I'll say why.

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.060
Because we all know...

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.060
We've all...

01:27:55.060 --> 01:28:00.060
I assume everyone here has handled infants and sees how an infant...

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:05.300
So very often, let's say a four or five month old infant is highly alert.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.500
Do you think that the infant has a sense of self?

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.460
In my experience, an infant has a sense of self in the way that we do.

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:18.260
The consciousness that we ascribe to humans to add to humans, in general, I would not

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:19.700
ascribe but to a four month old.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:20.700
I don't...

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:25.900
Say that we do not know if an animal, if a child has a sense of self at that age, now

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:30.020
the way we define it, it seems because we're using specific experiment...

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:31.500
With the five year old...

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500
One could...

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.500
But there's a lot more...

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.180
They don't pass certain tests.

01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.180
That's fair.

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:44.380
That suggests that these kids at four to six months old, and I wish I skimmed just the

01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.540
abstract of this paper.

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.540
I wish I had read it before coming here.

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:51.740
But there was something to do with, you know, attributing something or other.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.540
And they were showing this in a six month old through a looking task.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.220
The surprise about something or other.

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.220
It's not just...

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.300
But since somebody else was doing this, they were checking the...

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.300
The cathekin and EKG type thing.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:13.660
And the brain was triggering in the way that it would only trigger if the child was very

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.060
much aware of what it thought the other person was going to do.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.060
It's like the...

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.060
Okay.

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:22.940
It was something like the person was looking at a box and the person...

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.860
And you put a ball into the box and the cover went over it.

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.220
And the thing was either the surreptitiously taken off or taken off in view or something.

01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:34.860
And the child was either surprised or not at whether the person was going to go for the

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.500
ball because they should or should not think the ball was there.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.740
I'm doing this in a very sloppy way, but I'm trying to give you a feeling for this experiment.

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:49.060
The point was that the child's brain responded the same way an adult's brain would respond

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:54.700
in that situation based on an attribution of what they thought this other person would

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:57.860
expect to find in the box.

01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:58.860
Okay.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.860
Which, when I read that, I went, I want to read the whole paper because...

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.500
They didn't even have the motor skills and the cognitive wear with all to express it.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.460
I mean, comprehension proceeds production in terms of language.

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.460
They're stuck.

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.020
I mean, when we look at animals, we're like looking at pre-verbal babies.

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020
You know, so...

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.140
Just to read down, we are going in a different direction which has to do with the issue of

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.140
consciousness.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.860
But since it's four o'clock, we will stop.

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:20.860
Ah.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:27.980
So, please, here, make your comments brief.

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:29.940
Don't make three different comments.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.940
Just one.

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:31.940
Otherwise.

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:32.940
Otherwise.

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:33.940
Yeah.

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:34.940
I stopped at consciousness.

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:52.940
I didn't plan on this, but just a couple of quick observations.

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:53.940
Just one.

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.940
Just one.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.940
Please.

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:56.940
The mic's not wrong.

01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:57.940
Well...

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.940
It's half of the time I'm making one.

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:05.940
I'm just talking about the other side.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.940
It occurs to me, and I can't be sure that there's been a sense that the understanding

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:15.940
of the design is not taking into account the visceral understanding of geologic time and

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:20.940
everything that they've designed.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:21.940
Yeah.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:22.940
Oh, yeah.

01:31:22.940 --> 01:31:23.940
Okay.

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:24.940
So, I'll just...

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.940
So, that...

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:29.940
It's easy to think that a forum is in a non-changeable or final state if we don't consider it evolution.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:33.020
We consider it evolutionary time over hundreds of millions of years.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:40.100
We can use those numbers, but we have no macroscopic or cognitive experience of those timeframes.

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.860
Quick story to illustrate this.

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:44.820
There's a group of people called the Bajou.

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:46.500
They're on houseboats.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:53.100
They only come to land to trade, fish for their boats.

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:59.660
Their children spend so much time underwater that they see more clearly underwater and

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:02.180
then they do in out of water.

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:08.620
They have fish hunters that can do things without weights, without any apparatus that

01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:13.780
allow them to go down to 80 feet, slow their heartbeat to 30 beats a minute, and stay to

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.900
8 minutes.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:21.260
And if one runs that out over thousands or more of years, you can see physiological

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:25.100
changes in what appears to be an end state of design.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:27.500
So that's just the comment.

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:33.620
And then the other is that about the speciality is that a few months ago I'll send the paper

01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.220
to anyone who hasn't seen it or wants it.

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:44.060
Apparently it looks pretty, pretty, there's a single mutation in a single gene gave rise

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:51.340
to our neocortical complexity over time and that develops at a rate roughly 300% fast

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.940
in the rest of our physiology.

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.780
So that accounts for some of the things you were talking about.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:58.460
That said, here's the question.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:03.900
It's an ethical question because we didn't, we didn't.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:09.540
And this is Sandra, Diana and Irene.

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:15.420
If we got to the point of being able, using epigenetics and other biosynthetic techniques,

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:25.060
to modify that corresponding gene, if it exists, or in non-human species such that we could

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:29.460
artificially accelerate the development of their neocortex, this would be, of course,

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:35.980
vertebrates insephalization, would that be something that any of you would consider doing?

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:38.780
And if not, why not?

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.780
I love it.

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:44.820
Well if it was a pit like takeout.

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.740
But an injection, I'm not having anything to do with it.

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:50.740
Well, I agree.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:34:00.100
I mean, for the speech study, the most dogs, I mean again, I am, it can be a little parochial

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:04.620
intentionally, cognitively in my response.

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:11.580
But I think that part of what works for them is actually not being self-sufficient.

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:17.100
I mean, it is their dependency on it and therefore giving them something which kind of promoted

01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:23.660
their ability to evolve beyond us would not be useful for that species or to my feeling.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:28.500
I wanted to just link that to the difference, the one difference between us and everything

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:35.020
and the other species is that we have this remarkably complex abstract language and then

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:40.820
we can then categorize and refer to the world even if the correspondence with what we've

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:47.820
modeled is not reliable, but that complexity of our linguistic capability is really what

01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:53.980
sets us apart as far as we can tell because no one else is giving, no parents are yet giving

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:54.980
talks at Columbia.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:55.980
Okay.

01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:59.460
I'd love to be able to talk that way and also that I really want to be silenced by the

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.460
way.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.460
Oh God, what if they had language?

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:05.300
Oh, they'd be impossible, wouldn't they?

01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:14.620
I enjoy very much hearing about the tests that you ran measuring the intellectual intelligence

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:15.620
of other species.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:22.980
I'm wondering if anyone is doing any work measuring the emotional intelligence in other

01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.340
species.

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:34.220
It's extremely difficult and I'll say it because when we would, if we tried to do that, we

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:42.580
would be even worse at imposing our patterns on them.

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:47.180
So for example, I can work with the burden, I'll say stop doing that, you're going to

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.100
get bitten and the student says how do you know that?

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.820
And I said look at the body language.

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:56.460
Okay, the feathers are ruffled, the eyes are slitted, the head of the parent versus the

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.460
back of that.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.340
I'm reading his body language.

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:00.740
Now is he angry?

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.740
Is he bored?

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:10.100
I don't know why he's what emotional underpinning is going on, but I can read the behavior.

01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:15.700
And I kind of joke about it that even as humans we're really rotten about understanding what

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:19.540
somebody else is doing and interpreting it appropriately.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:23.180
I mean you'll go to your significant other and say why did you say that?

01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.980
Well I didn't mean to say it that way.

01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:26.460
I didn't remember that.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:32.340
And so it's really hard to do this emotional thing because we're so bad at it as humans

01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:36.380
with one another to impose it on animals I find it's just harder.

01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:38.380
I mean we can read the behavior.

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:44.660
We know what behavioral actions are going to lead to other actions, but that underlying

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:45.660
emotional...

01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.420
I think next time you have to bring your significant others.

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:51.460
Well I no longer have one.

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.420
I no longer have a human one.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.660
There's a reason for that.

01:36:55.660 --> 01:37:01.180
I agree with Irene although I think that as a scientist what we try to do is increase

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:06.180
our powers of observation and our ability to sort of bring together a lot of maybe anecdotal

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.620
information and look at it more systematically.

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:14.180
So for example with dolphins or ant elephants in our field we can watch responses to the

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:17.460
death of a conspecific another of their own group.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.060
And again we don't know what it means, but what you'll see often is things that look

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.380
very much like grieving in humans.

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:29.420
If it's an example is you have eight dolphins in a facility, two are bonded, Spock and Shiloh.

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.420
I'll just give goofy names.

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:32.420
Spock dies.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.740
Shiloh is the one in the group that stops eating, starts sulking and takes a week to

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.380
start eating and getting with the other animals again.

01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.620
And you know when we look at it in human terms it looks like grief.

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.940
What it is to an animal may be...

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:49.740
Or maybe physiological disturbances, all sorts of stressors.

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.100
But that's sort of where we are.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.420
We try to look more systematically at that.

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:59.420
We can look at signs for what we would say are empathy or caregiving or perspective taking

01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:03.500
in dolphins and elephants and binobos, other animals and dogs.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:09.540
You'll see behavior where an animal is injured or ill and the others will give caregiving,

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.460
will hold them up at the surface.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.100
They don't all do it, they don't always do it.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.300
It's very flexible.

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:16.500
It's often to the ones they're closest with.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.340
They'll often do something to provide care.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:23.860
So when we look at those kinds of things or look at a paper came out last year by Plotnik

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:28.740
and Duval where they looked at one elephant showing conciliatory behavior to another that

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:30.020
was distressed.

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:33.340
They put their trunk around the animal and they look at how that happens.

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:38.260
Again, we don't know what's going on in the emotional world of those animals.

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:39.900
But what we do know is they...

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.100
Many animals have...

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:48.380
From rats to elephants to dolphins have similar sub-portical areas in their brain that respond

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:53.460
emotionally in different ways to fear, to caring, for young and other things.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.940
So there's some interesting similarities, whether it's the same kind of emotion, but

01:38:57.940 --> 01:39:01.660
maybe that doesn't make a difference if it's the same because we would never know if it's

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:02.660
the same.

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:04.420
How do you know if it's ever going to be the same?

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:11.780
You know, my question that I asked before you just touched on it, that you said when the

01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:15.620
other dolphin is not eating and so on, you said it may not...

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.540
We don't know what the emotion is, but it may be some physiological response.

01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:22.540
But that's also true with humans, right?

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:23.540
Yeah.

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:28.500
In that sense, we are identical, but we secondarily may have explanations for what we are doing.

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.500
Right.

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:33.460
And also animals, many animals show ulcers under conditions.

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:36.580
And for us, it can come from different things, bacterial.

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:42.500
I'm going to approach this from another angle because I'm coming from another field.

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.220
I'm a painter and art historian.

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:46.980
And I'm interested in...

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.340
Painters often say, I'm only a link in a chain.

01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:55.100
I'm an individual, but I'm carrying on things that have happened in the past and the history

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:56.180
of others.

01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:01.220
So carrying within one is the history of other actions, other developments.

01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:08.460
So the mind is not just a sound, it's an entity, it's an entity, a depository of history,

01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.660
of all kinds.

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:16.140
And therefore, that creates a form of evolution or development, a different kind of form,

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:21.340
but it's a form that we are building constantly on others' lives who have gone through a conscious

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.340
life.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:28.220
And I wonder how you can relate that to the animal kingdom, this history and culture in

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:34.500
which an individual life is beyond their life because they have imbibed other lives, other

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.500
consciousness.

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500
Great question.

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.500
Anything?

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:40.380
A bird song dialect.

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.900
I mean, the birds will learn their area.

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:48.260
It's a cultural tradition.

01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.780
We get a little bit for individual differences.

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:53.020
That's their little take on it.

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:54.420
But it's a cultural tradition.

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:57.380
And you can see the changes over time.

01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:02.540
You can see the evolution of these things based on what's happening in the world.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:09.860
I mean, if the area that they're living in gets more tree-like, they'll have to shift

01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:12.260
frequencies a little bit and things like that.

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:15.940
I mean, that's one version of it.

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:21.220
I went to graduate school with a number of people who believed and espoused that the unit

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:25.380
of interest was really not the cognition and the brain, but a distributed cognition of

01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:26.540
a group.

01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.540
And that's how they studied.

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.580
How do people work together in a group?

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:32.700
It's not one person who's solving the problems.

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:37.260
I, as a human and a tool user, speak most of the tools, which I use.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:38.540
I let somebody else make them.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:42.460
And so it makes more sense to talk about the cognition of a group.

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.140
And you can define the group variously.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:48.420
And I think, in some ways, lots of different animal societies could also be described that

01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:49.420
way.

01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.380
And that is a kind of historical cognition.

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:56.460
In other words, the group operates because lots of different members have different roles

01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:03.020
or understandings such that, as an entire group, they have a cognitive ability.

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:07.460
I think that might be one way to recast the type of thing you're talking about, such

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.940
that it might be relevant for humans and non-humans.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:16.940
I think the idea of also matriarchs, the older females, there's data coming out showing that

01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:23.580
an elephant societies and in cetacean societies, that these female matriarchs seem to carry

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:24.980
the knowledge.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.980
And that's passed down.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:30.140
There's increasing evidence for cultural within these societies.

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:37.980
But this matriarch, the non-reproductive female, leads the group in Africa to the right places

01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:39.740
based on seasons and things.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:46.420
And when those animals from poaching or whatever has detrimental effects on the groups, taking

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:55.500
out males that are male elephants by poachers have effects on the acculturation and control

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:56.500
of the younger males.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:02.100
So these key roles are important, but carrying the knowledge, having a real effect on behavior

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100
of others around you.

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.100
I think it's a great point.

01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.100
Thanks.

01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.100
Thank you.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.300
Do you not see anything about this?

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:17.420
Boy, there's little bits of evidence here and there of this kind of cultural transmission,

01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:23.020
but you don't really find it in humans until you get to pretty modern humans.

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:28.220
I think you have, you could trump me here on this, but I think much like technology in

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:32.340
the Bronze Age, I think art in the Bronze Age are through thousands of years remained

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.700
relatively similar.

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:40.020
All made artifacts for thousands of years, the artifacts all look sort of the same.

01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:45.700
But now we have, now the arts are changing all the time.

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.020
I mean, they move at a much more rapid pace.

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.940
And that is nothing to do with evolution.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.660
That is a cultural thing that humans do.

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:56.580
They move at a more rapid pace.

01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:02.900
Maybe the concept of the individual, which evolve through time, has also changed things

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:03.900
in that way.

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:08.780
And that an individual feels that within themselves, a da Vinci or even earlier than

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:14.460
that, can add a whole new dimension that this given, that aren't part of the canon of an

01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:15.460
age.

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:16.980
But I think there's always been change.

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.580
I don't think the Bronze Age was, I think it was a slower evolution, but it was there.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:24.300
I don't believe there's any stagnant period ever.

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:26.140
I don't believe in vacuums.

01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:32.220
But the concept of the individual, individual life, did change that.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.220
Yes.

01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:41.580
I hope I won't be too unpopular.

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:47.380
If I start out by correcting two things that graded on my ears like fingernails on a

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:48.780
fingernail.

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:54.100
One being that there could be some evolution of human intelligence in the last 5,000 years,

01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:59.140
which will be 5,000 years is nothing in human evolution.

01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:03.740
They're talking about the emergence of a kind of mental…

01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:04.740
Between 100,000.

01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:05.740
So you don't get…

01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:08.740
We changed it to 50 million.

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.740
You don't get upset.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:10.980
No, no, now you weigh up.

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:12.540
No, now you weigh on the other side.

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.540
But we did weigh up.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.540
We said just the opposite.

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.540
I just want to be clear.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:16.540
We said just the opposite.

01:45:16.540 --> 01:45:19.460
It couldn't possibly be evolution in 5,000 years.

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:20.460
All right.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.380
But I mean, they were building pyramids.

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:26.300
They were quite as intelligent as we are.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.980
Have the same exact brain we have now?

01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.620
5,000, we believe it.

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.540
We won't quibble over the time.

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:28.480
But the paintings, the

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:41.180
scale paintings and the shawty paintings were between 30,000 and 40 years ago.

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.980
Neanderthals were still…

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:49.700
We just discovered some new kinds of tools and possibly art in the rudiments of Neanderthals

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:52.620
that died out 40,000 years ago.

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:54.780
I leave that topic now.

01:45:54.780 --> 01:46:02.940
Everything that bothered me was the idea of being upright somehow facilitates the kind

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.900
of intelligence that we have.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:13.940
I needed to think that we had at least 17 different kinds of hominins wandering around

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:18.740
the world that were all more or less upright.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:24.580
And only Homo sapiens came up with what we think we have.

01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:30.180
Antipythicists were creatures like aridipithecus, ramidus and Australopithecus.

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:32.380
All of these creatures could walk.

01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:35.140
They had good hands.

01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:43.820
In fact, it's generally understood by anthropology now that walking upright was not correlated

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:45.980
with intelligence at all.

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:51.380
The intelligence came way after they were all of these upright hominins walking around.

01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:52.380
Look at bono.

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.620
They're all for instance.

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.180
They often walk upright.

01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:58.180
They're very bright.

01:46:58.180 --> 01:46:59.180
They don't do art.

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:01.060
They don't do life.

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.060
So it cannot be…

01:47:02.060 --> 01:47:04.740
But they're not upright.

01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.740
So I'm not sure why you…

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:06.740
They're not actually upright.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:07.740
So what do you mention?

01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:08.740
Oh, they're very often upright.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.820
No, I mean, they're not a fully upright.

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.820
I thought you were referring to a fully upright.

01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:14.820
Well, as fully upright.

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.820
I'm talking about fully upright.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.820
I'm talking about fully upright.

01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:23.820
I thought you just said homo sapiens.

01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:31.820
They're all these people.

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.740
I want to be polite.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:37.580
But you're totally off the beam.

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:42.180
You don't have a grasp of the range of upright creatures that did not…

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.180
I don't understand.

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.180
You're talking about bipedalism.

01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:46.340
We're the only fully upright species.

01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:51.820
There's no debate on this among scientists.

01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.060
We're the only fully upright species.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:55.500
Well, there is debate about it.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.500
But I want to drop it now.

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:57.500
I want to drop it.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:58.500
I want to drop it.

01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.500
I want to drop it now.

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:00.500
You can read my book.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:03.260
And maybe my book is totally wrong too.

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:07.980
Paul Garvin's universe.

01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:10.380
What I really want to bring up is this.

01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:15.180
Because I've been fortunate for the last three years to be the director of a project

01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:19.980
on Alfred Russell for the Templeland Foundation.

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.380
You may not know him.

01:48:21.380 --> 01:48:24.580
Some of you may know he was Darwin's junior.

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:32.180
He was the man that came up with the idea of evolution by natural selection to shorten

01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:33.180
the story.

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.060
In time, Darwin did.

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:37.580
They published it together.

01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:41.060
They share co-credit.

01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:44.580
But they had a very interesting detail in him.

01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:52.620
And that difference of opinion was that Wallace, who was a great naturalist, out in the field

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:59.300
for many years, observed many animals, he drew what I call a white picket fence around

01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:05.820
human mentality, around human consciousness, around human cognition.

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:15.540
He thought that natural selection could not account the kind of consciousness that he's

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.700
talking about.

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:18.820
And Darwin said, what do you mean?

01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:20.220
Everything goes by gradual steps.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.380
There's no great leaps.

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:25.380
And Wallace, I said you don't understand natural selection.

01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.780
Wallace said, I'm the inventor of it along with you.

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:29.660
I understand natural selection.

01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:35.700
And what natural selection says is that a trait has to have a utility to an organism

01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.020
in order to be a person.

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:44.220
Now if you have an ape, said Wallace, wandering around and eating lizards, and like a girl

01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:49.740
that's well surviving and having a social group and having all kinds of behavior, why

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:57.980
would he need to have methadry, why would he need to have methadry, why would he need

01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:07.180
to even need to have the sophistication of language beyond a very, very basic thing.

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:17.500
And he said, you can't, an animal cannot develop something in advance of its needs.

01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:24.340
And Darwin wrote him a famous letter in 18th and said, I hope you have not murdered too

01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:31.380
completely your own and my child, meaning natural selection.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:36.300
Wallace wrote many books on this later, The Place of Man in Nature, The World of Life,

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:39.140
and so on, in which he continued to steam.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:41.540
And you talked about the potential source.

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:43.700
Wallace thought there was special source.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:49.460
Wallace thought there was an infusion of spirit from an unseen universe of spirit, a cosmic

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:50.460
intelligence.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.860
He never used the word God.

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:56.060
He did not like organized religion, but he thought there was some kind of intelligence

01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:05.620
in nature, guiding evolution and responsible for infusing and injecting in humans this

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:11.300
what some call emergent quality that was more than the sum of its parts.

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.660
This is not a question and I don't want to hog the floor.

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:14.660
I've said my piece.

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.660
Thank you.

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:22.660
Thank you.

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:29.660
That was interesting.

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:35.660
That was interesting and fun.

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:48.660
Thank you.
