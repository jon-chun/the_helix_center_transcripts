00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
I'm Rob Penzer. I'm the Associate Director of the Helix Center. Welcome. I want to make

00:05.160 --> 00:11.320
some announcements about upcoming programs before I introduce today's guests. On Saturday,

00:11.320 --> 00:18.280
April 12, physicists Harold Atman-Spacher and Edgar Cheerieri and scientist philosopher

00:18.280 --> 00:25.120
Farsad Mahushen join Jungian analyst Joseph Cambry and Beverly Zabriski in an exploration

00:25.120 --> 00:31.640
of synchronicity on the spectrum of mind and matter. On April 26, join us for women and

00:31.640 --> 00:38.680
science for stemming the tide of gender-based inequity and on May 17, women and the work

00:38.680 --> 00:44.360
world. Also watch for announcements for this year's Helix Center benefit to be held on

00:44.360 --> 00:51.760
May 4 at Ginny's Supper Club at the Red Rooster. And now for today's introductions.

00:51.760 --> 00:59.240
Chip Ganyon is Associate Professor of Politics at Ithaca College. And a long time visiting

00:59.240 --> 01:04.480
scholar at Cornell University's Judith Repie Institute for Peace and Conflict Studies. He

01:04.480 --> 01:08.880
received his PhD in political science with a focus on international relations from Columbia

01:08.880 --> 01:13.520
University where he also received certificates in the Soviet Russian studies and Eastern

01:13.520 --> 01:19.160
European studies. He is author of numerous articles as well as the myth of ethnic war,

01:19.160 --> 01:23.200
Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s which was the winner of the American Political Science

01:23.200 --> 01:28.280
Association's award for best book on European politics and society. And co-winner of the

01:28.280 --> 01:33.840
Council for European Studies' Best First Book Award. More recently he co-edited a volume,

01:33.840 --> 01:38.240
post-conflict studies, an interdisciplinary approach based on a series of workshops he

01:38.240 --> 01:43.000
organized at Cornell. His research is focused on violence that is framed as ethnic and in

01:43.000 --> 01:46.840
particular the ways in which such violence is often the result of an elite strategy of

01:46.840 --> 01:52.160
demobilization. A related research interest is the ways in which elites construct threatening

01:52.160 --> 01:57.360
images of the outside world as a domestic political resource. Another research project

01:57.360 --> 02:02.680
focuses on the concept of religious missionary work as a way to understand democracy promotion

02:02.680 --> 02:08.720
and other secular forms of international intervention focusing in particular on the Balkans.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.960
Leah Greenfeld is University Professor and Professor of Sociology, Political Science

02:14.960 --> 02:22.480
and Anthropology, Boston University and visiting adjunct professor at Lignon University. She

is the author among other publications of nationalism, Five Roads to Mardanity, The Spirit

02:27.520 --> 02:33.400
of Capitalism, Nationalism and Economic Growth, and Mind, Mardanity and Madness, the impact

02:33.400 --> 02:38.120
of culture on human experience, these form of trilogy. The latest volume focusing on the

02:38.120 --> 02:43.240
existential experiences of Mardanity offers a novel interpretation and a causal explanation

02:43.240 --> 02:47.840
of schizophrenia and manic depressive illness. Professor Greenfeld held the positions of

02:47.840 --> 02:52.200
assistant as well as John L. Loeb, Associate Professor of Social Sciences at Harvard University

02:52.200 --> 02:57.440
from 1985 until 1994 when she joined Boston University in her current appointment. She

02:57.440 --> 03:02.920
has also held visiting positions at RPI, MIT and the Accault De Hote et Tous en Science

03:02.920 --> 03:07.720
Societte in Paris and has been a recipient of the UAB Ireland Distinguished Visiting

03:07.720 --> 03:12.080
Scholar Award, fellowships from the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey,

03:12.080 --> 03:16.320
the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars in Washington, D.C., the Institute

Council for Soviet and Eastern European Research and the German Marshall Fund of the United

03:25.280 --> 03:29.760
States. In 2004, she delivered the Gelner Lecture at the London School of Economics on

03:29.760 --> 03:34.400
the subject of nationalism and the mind, launching the research connecting her previous work on

03:34.400 --> 03:40.120
modern culture to a new perspective on mental illness. Excuse me. And in 2011, the Tom Nairn

03:40.120 --> 03:45.920
Lecture at the Globalism Research Center, RMIT in Melbourne. The Least Juliano is a political

03:45.920 --> 03:51.840
scientist at Columbia University where she teaches courses on secession and nationalism,

03:51.840 --> 03:56.320
Russian politics and international relations. She's the academic advisor to graduate students

03:56.320 --> 04:01.120
at Columbia's Harriman Institute for Russian, Eurasian and East European Studies. Professor

04:01.120 --> 04:06.120
Juliano's research focuses on the intersection of politics and identity. Her book, Constructing

04:06.120 --> 04:11.360
Grieven's Ethnic Nationalism in Russia's Republics, examines why some mass populations

04:11.360 --> 04:16.280
in Russia's ethnic republics supported nationalist separation while others remained quascent.

04:16.280 --> 04:23.240
In 2012, the book won the ENMISA Book Award of the International Studies Association for

04:23.240 --> 04:26.320
the best book published over the past two years in the study of international politics

04:26.320 --> 04:31.480
of ethnicity, nationalism or migration. Professor Juliano is currently researching the politics

04:31.480 --> 04:36.640
of blame following natural and man-made disasters in Russia. After working as a consultant in

04:36.640 --> 04:43.240
Moscow and Novograd for USAID on a privatization project in the 1990s, she conducted field research

04:43.240 --> 04:48.300
in Tatarstan, Russia as a Fulbright Hayes scholar. Professor Juliano has taught at the

04:48.300 --> 04:52.320
University of Miami and Barnard College and she currently serves on the advisory board

04:52.320 --> 04:56.560
for the Association of the Study of Nationalities and is a member of the program on new approaches

04:56.560 --> 05:01.880
to research and security in Eurasia. Professor Juliano has a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard

05:01.880 --> 05:06.800
University, the University of Notre Dame and Columbia. She received a PhD in political

05:06.800 --> 05:10.560
science and an MA in international relations from the University of Chicago and a BA in

05:10.560 --> 05:17.360
Russian studies from the University of Pennsylvania. Liora Khan is founder and president of Proof

05:17.360 --> 05:21.960
Media for Social Justice. She works on global projects with Amnesty International and the

05:21.960 --> 05:27.600
United Nations. Her 2007 book, Darfur, 20 Years of War and Genocide, has won several

05:27.600 --> 05:31.760
awards and an exhibition of this work as traveling in the U.S. under the auspices of the Holocaust

05:31.760 --> 05:37.720
Museum of Houston. Her book, Child Soldiers, published in November 2008, features an introductory

05:37.720 --> 05:42.800
essay by Louis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court. She

05:42.800 --> 05:46.840
curated an exhibition on child soldiers in collaboration with the UN's Office on Children

05:46.840 --> 05:52.360
and Armed Conflict. It has traveled to Rome, New York, Bonn, Vienna, Mexico City, as well

05:52.360 --> 05:57.560
as the United States. Miss Khan's film credits include Renee and I, an award-winning documentary

05:57.560 --> 06:01.600
about the life of an extraordinary woman who was experimented on by Joseph Mangla during

06:01.600 --> 06:06.720
the Holocaust. She also co-produced Original Intent, a documentary that explores the judicial

06:06.720 --> 06:10.960
philosophy promoted by President George W. Bush and the Supreme Court justices Antonin

06:10.960 --> 06:16.240
Scalia and Clarence Thomas. She was director of photography at workman publishing in Corbus

06:16.240 --> 06:21.520
as well as working at the New York Times Magazine, Time Magazine and numerous other publications.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.320
She has been a fellow in the genocide studies program at Yale University, where she conducts

06:25.320 --> 06:30.000
research on rescuers and rescuing behavior. She lectures and teaches widely on topics

06:30.000 --> 06:34.680
in human rights and photography and transitional justice. She is a Fulbright senior specialist

06:34.680 --> 06:38.760
and recently taught at University of Haifa and is fellow at the Adrienne DeRosse Child

06:38.760 --> 06:42.640
Columbia University and Cambridge University for social entrepreneurs that involve starting

06:42.640 --> 06:47.800
a network between Jews and Muslims. Miss Khan's recent work has taken to Rwanda, Cambodia

06:47.800 --> 06:53.480
and Bosnia, where she has researched and interviewed rescuers from these gemicides. An exhibition

06:53.480 --> 06:58.120
comprised of photos and texts of these interviews is now traveling in Rwanda, Bosnia and Cambodia

06:58.120 --> 07:02.120
as well as the United States, sponsored by the US State Department. She has developed

07:02.120 --> 07:09.080
a worldwide project on rape and transitional justice with partners, trial and UNFPA.

07:09.080 --> 07:15.360
Nathan Schanberg is a Wallerstein research fellow in psychoanalysis of the San Francisco

07:15.360 --> 07:19.800
Center for psychoanalysis on the faculty at New York's psychoanalytic society and institute

07:19.800 --> 07:23.920
and formerly Freud professor of psychoanalysis at the Hebrew University. He is the author

07:23.920 --> 07:29.600
editor of four books and one novella, educating the emotions on Bruno Betelheim's ideas, lives

07:29.600 --> 07:35.440
across time with Henry Massey, reluctant warriors, the naturations and interlives of elite Israeli

07:35.440 --> 07:41.760
soldiers and Sheba and Solomon's return Ethiopian children in Israel, which was a foundational

07:41.760 --> 07:48.520
study for our recent round table on that subject. He studied at the University of Chicago College

07:48.520 --> 07:53.440
and Medical School where his teachers included Bruno Betelheim and Saul Bello. He graduated

07:53.440 --> 07:58.200
from the St. Louis psychoanalysis institute and he is training analyst of the Israel

07:58.200 --> 08:04.040
psychoanalysis society in IPA and I think most of you know Dr. Edward Nussesian, director

08:04.040 --> 08:11.040
of and founder of the Helix Center. So we'll begin.

08:11.040 --> 08:20.240
So I have a question, what do we mean by fanaticism?

08:20.240 --> 08:21.560
I had the same question.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.040
Because I personally find it a kind of problematic term.

08:24.040 --> 08:33.040
I said what do we mean by fanaticism? I personally find it a kind of problematic term.

08:33.040 --> 08:42.360
Well, one of the best ways of answering this question is would it people who invented the

08:42.360 --> 08:50.480
word meant by fanaticism? Of course now we mean all sorts of things. But it is interesting

08:50.480 --> 08:57.840
that the word only appears in the English language in the sixteenth century. At which

08:57.840 --> 09:14.440
time it basically refers to a sort of abnormal behavior that that characterizes one as mad.

09:14.440 --> 09:20.360
The word mad also appears only in the word madness also appear only in the sixteenth

09:20.360 --> 09:34.360
century. And specifically it refers to being mad as a result of intervention of bad spirits,

09:34.360 --> 09:48.800
demons. But there was actually a mental disease at that time that was diagnosed as a result

09:48.800 --> 10:03.440
of the intervention of demons. But what is much more interesting is that in the middle

10:03.440 --> 10:16.840
of the seventeenth century after the Puritan rebellion and already after nationalism was

10:16.840 --> 10:25.320
firmly established in England that the word fanaticism is used specifically for religious

10:25.320 --> 10:37.440
mania, mania precisely in the sense in which we understand it now in psychiatry. And for

10:37.440 --> 10:53.560
political enthusiasm which is which goes overboard. And it is in this sense of unreasonable enthusiasm

10:53.560 --> 11:04.520
for political causes or religious causes that we mostly understand fanaticism now. Now the

11:04.520 --> 11:12.560
connection between the word itself and the phenomenon that is observed in the sixteenth

11:12.560 --> 11:19.760
and seventeenth century to begin with and nationalism which also is something that emerges

11:19.760 --> 11:29.160
in the sixteenth century in England is therefore very clear. So fanaticism comes into our life

11:29.160 --> 11:36.080
not with any identity. There are always lots of identities and human beings do not live

11:36.080 --> 11:45.640
without an identity. But it comes into our life very specifically with national identity.

11:45.640 --> 11:55.120
And the question therefore becomes what is it in nationalism that provokes fanaticism?

11:55.120 --> 12:01.560
I wanted to take some two different perspectives as I was asked to think about this. One is

12:01.560 --> 12:09.240
a developmental perspective. When do people have the capacity to become fanatical or nationalistic?

12:09.240 --> 12:14.120
Generally speaking it is sometime in adolescence or late adolescence and later. We do not usually

12:14.120 --> 12:20.120
call six year olds or nine year olds fanatical. They can be preoccupied with New York Yankees

12:20.120 --> 12:25.440
but we do not call them fanatical in that sense. So something happens around late adolescence.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.880
I want to suggest and that brings us closer to issues of identity and arrogance and work

12:29.880 --> 12:36.080
on that. So that is one thing to raise. The other is when I was asked again to talk about

12:36.080 --> 12:42.240
this I thought of both Hannah Arendt's opening to her book on Eichmann in Jerusalem and

12:42.240 --> 12:54.080
other times. As kind of the other side of what am I calling, if we do not know what fanaticism

12:54.080 --> 13:00.120
is yet we may clarify that in this meeting. What is the other side of fanaticism in the

13:00.120 --> 13:05.680
20th, 21st century? So Eichmann says in the beginning of her book when cliches and stock

13:05.680 --> 13:12.120
phrases begin replacing critical thinking it is a danger to society. That was one of

13:12.120 --> 13:19.360
the major lessons from watching the Eichmann trial. People will think critically in a

13:19.360 --> 13:25.840
certain way and then start not thinking critically and using stock phrases and cliches. A compliment

13:25.840 --> 13:31.720
to that, again I rent as a political philosopher but a compliment to that is a bellheim's comment,

13:31.720 --> 13:38.440
the subtitle of his book The Informed Heart which describes his experience in Dachau and

13:38.440 --> 13:45.320
experience of others later on in concentration camp is that the danger he thought and great

13:45.320 --> 13:50.480
dark genius of the Nazi invention was to use modern technologies of social communication,

13:50.480 --> 13:58.200
mass communication to influence larger groups in a certain way. The challenge he thought

13:58.200 --> 14:04.280
was not to think of Nazism as a unique experience but one that can be repeated, number one.

14:04.280 --> 14:10.560
Number two, he said the challenge in the 20th century and today is the subtitle of his book,

14:10.560 --> 14:17.720
how do we develop and maintain autonomy in a mass age and by autonomy he means the old

14:17.720 --> 14:25.040
Greek definition, self rule as opposed to I want to suggest fanaticism might be other

14:25.040 --> 14:28.520
ruled as an initial definition.

14:28.520 --> 14:36.320
I can pick up a little bit on that because the work that I do with rescuers is about

14:36.320 --> 14:45.080
how they identify staying with the original group identity instead of going and become

14:45.080 --> 14:50.400
perpetrators and fanatics. Those are questions that aren't asked that often because we usually

14:50.400 --> 14:57.760
think of a group as all the Germans became perpetrators or all the Hutus became perpetrators.

14:57.760 --> 15:06.280
So the questions I ask and then I'm very interested in is why do the Hutus or why are there good

15:06.280 --> 15:14.160
Germans and how they resist being swept up into a fanatical kind of identity. And I find

15:14.160 --> 15:21.000
that a challenge to think about but it's a question that I work on and I think it's

15:21.000 --> 15:26.400
important because we do study a lot about the fanaticism, we don't study a lot about

15:26.400 --> 15:27.400
resisting it.

15:27.400 --> 15:34.920
But what I would say that to resist prejudice one needs to be fanatical. The mother Teresa

15:34.920 --> 15:38.480
is a fanatic about what she did. This is provocative.

15:38.480 --> 15:43.720
No I think what you said about the critical thinking is really important. I think if you

15:43.720 --> 15:48.880
are a critical thinker, really a critical thinker you won't give in to the fanaticism

15:48.880 --> 15:55.400
and I think that's a really important point and I'm really glad you brought that up because

15:55.400 --> 16:04.840
a lot of these authoritarian countries and societies don't install critical thinking

16:04.840 --> 16:12.400
and you've studied all those. You've studied the Balkans and societies that don't encourage

16:12.400 --> 16:17.560
independent critical thinking and I think that's where the danger comes in to become

16:17.560 --> 16:23.120
a nationalist or a fanaticist that you don't think about what it means.

16:23.120 --> 16:29.000
Well it might be useful to define some terms at this point just because probably some people

16:29.000 --> 16:34.440
around this table are using the term nationalism in different ways. And also just on the point

16:34.440 --> 16:41.520
of fanaticism or fanatic as a word nobody's mentioned just a common usage of the term

16:41.520 --> 16:48.040
in everyday life and it seems to me that the way we use it in everyday life is just to

16:48.040 --> 16:53.080
talk about people we disagree with or ideas we find reprehensible whereas everyone here

16:53.080 --> 16:59.040
is using it in a more academic or specific sense. But it can be hard to disentangle these

16:59.040 --> 17:04.480
days the term fanatic is often used to apply to or it follows the word Muslim and it usually

17:04.480 --> 17:11.520
means people who engage in violence or terrorism to achieve their goals. So already we have

17:11.520 --> 17:16.640
different ways of using the term fanatic and different ways of using the term nationalism.

17:16.640 --> 17:21.120
So maybe it would be useful for people to each of us to try to talk about what we mean

17:21.120 --> 17:27.160
by nationalism. The way I think academics study nationalism in a specific time and place

17:27.160 --> 17:32.560
is very different than common place understanding of nationalism which often refers to Nazism

17:32.560 --> 17:37.160
or to some type of more extreme behavior.

17:37.160 --> 17:47.720
So let me try and do that even though I am a fanatical academic one could say by using

17:47.720 --> 18:00.680
fanaticism in the way that you propose. But I'm trying actually to study those phenomena

18:00.680 --> 18:12.720
precisely in the sense in which they are used by people and even if those people who use

18:12.720 --> 18:25.360
them do not define them explicitly to themselves nevertheless when forced to define those terms

18:25.360 --> 18:32.160
and I sometimes force my students for example to try and define the terms they constantly

18:32.160 --> 18:44.200
use they would define it in those very ways. So it is in fact very important to define nationalism

18:44.200 --> 18:56.520
and fanaticism and nationalism contrary to the ways in which it is very often bandied

18:56.520 --> 19:13.120
around by the media. Nationalism refers to our contemporary view of reality.

19:13.120 --> 19:20.200
And my classes I very often ask students and it is a very good exercise. Ask students

19:20.200 --> 19:29.600
in the beginning of the classes to give me a pictogram that is a very very short telegraphic

19:29.600 --> 19:39.160
drawing of the world in which they live. And it is amazing American students, students

19:39.160 --> 19:49.520
in Europe, students in Africa, students everywhere basically come with the same drawing and

19:49.520 --> 19:59.040
this drawing reflects the essence of nationalism because our contemporary world is defined by

19:59.040 --> 20:06.760
nationalism. Nationalism is the cultural dream of contemporary world as we live in it.

20:06.760 --> 20:17.920
And what is this drawing and what is this world? We see the world unlike people in other types

20:17.920 --> 20:27.680
of societies and in other historical periods. We see the world as first of all this world,

20:27.680 --> 20:40.000
this globe, the world of our empirical experiences, the world of living people, this earth in

20:40.000 --> 20:47.800
distinction to religious people who see this earth, this world of the living people only

20:47.800 --> 20:57.640
is a very very small piece of a grand huge world most of which is transcendental. And

20:57.640 --> 21:07.960
we see this world as the source of all law, of all truth and of all meaning while they

21:07.960 --> 21:17.040
those other people see the grand transcendental world with God or gods in it as the source

21:17.040 --> 21:28.440
of all meaning, all law and all truth. In addition, we in contemporary people, modern

21:28.440 --> 21:41.000
people defined by nationalism, safe society is based on two principles, on the principle

21:41.000 --> 21:48.040
of popular sovereignty and on the principle of the fundamental equality of membership

21:48.040 --> 21:59.480
in the nation. And we see the world as divided into nations. Nation is defined precisely as

21:59.480 --> 22:09.400
a sovereign community of equals. Now clearly, the Iranian nation, a sovereign Iranian community

22:09.400 --> 22:16.720
of equals would be very different from the American nation, a sovereign American community

22:16.720 --> 22:26.560
of equals. Nevertheless, as sovereign communities of equals, they are both national societies

22:26.560 --> 22:35.680
and secular societies because even though religion plays very important part in both

22:35.680 --> 22:45.040
in different ways but in both because we are focused on this world. When the individual

22:45.040 --> 22:53.160
in monotheistic religions in particular, when the individual is determined religiously

22:53.160 --> 23:00.960
and sees the world as a religious universe, grand transcendental universe in which this

23:00.960 --> 23:10.440
Earth is only a tiny part, then the most important things for this individual be here. Muslim,

23:10.440 --> 23:21.320
a Jew or a Christian would be his or her soul, salvation and eternal life after death. What

23:21.320 --> 23:31.320
is happening in the few years before death is really not that important. For us, the

23:31.320 --> 23:41.240
modern people based on nationalism, the only important thing is what happens in this life.

23:41.240 --> 23:48.720
We really do not care at all. Even those of us who consider ourselves religious, we do

23:48.720 --> 23:57.520
not really do not care at all about what happens after death and we do not care at all about

23:57.520 --> 24:06.840
our meeting with our maker and what he has to think about our actions here. That is why

24:06.840 --> 24:16.600
we are all Muslims, Christians, doesn't matter, are so tremendously politically activist in

24:16.600 --> 24:25.880
our lives. Such activism was simply impossible in the different religious conception of the

24:25.880 --> 24:35.000
world. So nationalism, basically it is this new perspective on the reality that first

24:35.000 --> 24:42.560
emerges in England in the 16th century and then spreads through the entire world. More

24:42.560 --> 24:50.960
or less now it is spreading through the entire world. And it brings with it some wonderful

24:50.960 --> 24:58.520
things, wonderful things. It brings with it first of all democracy. It also brings with

24:58.520 --> 25:07.600
it economy oriented towards growth and with this much greater wealth, it also brings with

25:07.600 --> 25:15.680
it science, science which was impossible when we were religiously oriented because the empirical

25:15.680 --> 25:20.920
knowledge about this world was of no importance.

25:20.920 --> 25:25.120
Yeah, interrupt your second because I am a little bit still stuck with your original

25:25.120 --> 25:33.280
comment and I cannot get it out of my mind. What you were objecting or you were saying

25:33.280 --> 25:40.160
of a problem with the term. Maybe you can link to nationalism and the way nationalism

25:40.160 --> 25:44.600
is used generally is somewhat different than what Leah is saying. It is more attachment

25:44.600 --> 25:51.000
to a nation defined in ethnolinguistic terms, attachment to a territory which is narrower

25:51.000 --> 25:57.160
than the definition that you are giving. And the problem I have with the term fanaticism

25:57.160 --> 26:01.280
is it is almost too easy or these people are crazy. We don't have to understand what is

26:01.280 --> 26:05.520
going on with them. Why are they acting this way? The other thing is it tends to lump

26:05.520 --> 26:12.560
people into groups. So for example I start my book out with in Serbia in the media which

26:12.560 --> 26:18.920
was controlled by the government. The images that you saw through the 80s and early 90s

26:18.920 --> 26:23.280
were terrible. They were just Serbs are being slaughtered in Croatia, women and children,

26:23.280 --> 26:28.560
Serbs are victims, etc. You would expect that that would create sort of the solidarity in

26:28.560 --> 26:32.560
a sense of high sense of groupness among Serbs who would then. But in fact what happened

26:32.560 --> 26:39.200
is when the government called up young men for the draft in Belgrade, the capital city,

26:39.200 --> 26:42.760
80 to 90% of them refused to go. They went into hiding or left the country. In the country

26:42.760 --> 26:46.360
as a whole it was 50%. And the reason it was lower in the country as a whole is people

26:46.360 --> 26:50.120
live in villages and it is not quite as easy to get away because of the social networks.

26:50.120 --> 26:54.760
So that tells us something else is going on. This is not fanaticism. This is something

26:54.760 --> 26:58.280
that the government is trying to get people to do. They are using images and trying to

26:58.280 --> 27:02.960
use fear and emotion to get people to do things but it wasn't really working. Now obviously

27:02.960 --> 27:08.880
some people did go to the front and the question of why they did that is a valid one. But I

27:08.880 --> 27:14.560
start with the anecdote about so many young men refusing to fight because it really puts

27:14.560 --> 27:18.760
into question a lot of the images we have about conflicts like the ones we saw in the

27:18.760 --> 27:25.760
former Yugoslavia and other places as well. Does that go along with what? Can I ask you

27:25.760 --> 27:33.080
a question about that? How does that relate to the paramilitaries in Bosnia? Do you think

27:33.080 --> 27:40.720
those images created a more national identity of the ones that were fighting in Bosnia?

27:40.720 --> 27:45.320
Well the paramilitaries that were sent into Bosnia from Serbia and from Croatia during

27:45.320 --> 27:50.320
that phase of the war were in every society and you have groups of guys who were just

27:50.320 --> 27:57.880
into that kind of violence and killing. What were they motivated by? Maybe some of them

27:57.880 --> 28:01.520
but a lot of it wasn't. It was just the thrill of being a hero wanting to have action in

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
your life.

28:02.520 --> 28:09.800
There are shivls addressed that with the German soldiers though. What motivated them? When

28:09.800 --> 28:16.200
they were asked to study the captured German soldiers, young men, and they knew they were

28:16.200 --> 28:22.400
losing. This was in 1945, I think. And shills and jonamoots were clever enough to say how

28:22.400 --> 28:27.520
come these guys are fighting so hard still? And what they found when they interviewed

28:27.520 --> 28:33.600
if I remember correctly what they found was the major motivation was not for Germany,

28:33.600 --> 28:39.240
not for Adolf Hitler. It was their buddies in their units. And this is what I found in

28:39.240 --> 28:45.280
studying the Israeli soldiers, not to that degree. To a great degree I studied soldiers

28:45.280 --> 28:52.520
in elite units. I remember one of them said to me, the first year of his training he said

28:52.520 --> 28:56.880
he would say, I will fight for my brothers, I will die for my brothers. He said he didn't

28:56.880 --> 29:00.000
feel it until the end of the year and then he realized he really would.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.600
Right. And this is regular soldiers but you asked me about the paramilitaries which were

29:04.600 --> 29:09.680
not regular soldiers. These were groups who did a lot of criminal, a lot of the war crimes

29:09.680 --> 29:16.840
were done by paramilitary groups. They were associated with some of the political parties.

29:16.840 --> 29:21.280
But the point is yes, they did awful things but they were a very small minority of the

29:21.280 --> 29:27.480
guys who were potentially going to go fight in the war from Serbia. Now if you're in Bosnia

29:27.480 --> 29:32.000
itself, you're in a different situation. The war is happening in your country. And to

29:32.000 --> 29:36.720
understand that, I won't go into great detail now, but there was a long campaign to create

29:36.720 --> 29:42.080
a climate of fear. And even in that people had to be forced, not everyone. Obviously

29:42.080 --> 29:45.520
there were small numbers of people who were really into it but people had to be forced

29:45.520 --> 29:50.040
to sort of separate. And the violence was actually a means of separating people who had been

29:50.040 --> 29:57.240
organic communities before. So I'm talking about this because when we look at a war like

29:57.240 --> 30:00.400
that it's easy to say, oh they're fanatics, they're crazy. But in fact if you sort of

30:00.400 --> 30:04.400
look at sort of a micro level, there's a lot of different things going on. And the problem

30:04.400 --> 30:08.400
with the term fanatics is it makes it too easy. They're all foaming at the mouth militia

30:08.400 --> 30:12.680
which is appealing to them as serves but that's not what was happening. And so my problem

30:12.680 --> 30:17.440
with the term fanatics is that it's sort of the way it's commonly used. It's used as

30:17.440 --> 30:21.400
sort of the shorthand that means they're just kind of crazy. Which is not...

30:21.400 --> 30:24.680
Well, there's such as fanatic about teachers.

30:24.680 --> 30:33.120
But I want to... Because you were making an interesting point distinguishing the modern

30:33.120 --> 30:41.680
past from the very religious. And how does that play into this issue that they're describing?

30:41.680 --> 30:49.600
Yes, let me continue. So this is a long story unfortunately. I'm sorry for taking so much

30:49.600 --> 30:59.840
time. But nationalism brought to us lots of wonderful things but it also brought us some

30:59.840 --> 31:07.400
absolutely horrible things. And the most terrible things, the most terrible problem that nationalism

31:07.400 --> 31:15.880
has created, it brought to us schizophrenia and demonic depression. That is, together

31:15.880 --> 31:23.600
with nationalism, they're emerged at the very same time in 16th century England. They're

31:23.600 --> 31:30.880
emerged as a new mental disease. We know that this disease is new because out of the very

31:30.880 --> 31:38.600
large vocabulary for mental diseases that exist at the time, no word seems to capture

31:38.600 --> 31:47.000
it and new words are invented to capture. And the new words that are invented are madness

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
and lunacy.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.360
But that doesn't... Sometimes you have new words for old phenomena.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.360
What in this case?

31:55.360 --> 32:00.600
Let me mention the Malius Maleficorum which was well before the 17th century.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.760
I'm talking about 16th century, the beginning of the 16th century.

32:04.760 --> 32:10.700
But in the Malius Maleficorum which was in the Deval text, yes?

32:10.700 --> 32:16.640
They describe what we would today call psychosis, usually schizophrenia. But they don't use

32:16.640 --> 32:21.040
those words, they use things about inhabited by the devil or the witch's and so on. So

32:21.040 --> 32:24.880
just because a new word is invented doesn't mean that it's a new phenomenon.

32:24.880 --> 32:31.160
In this case I'm talking about a new phenomenon because yes, there was psychosis, there was

32:31.160 --> 32:38.440
something new that emerged that wasn't like lots of other psychosis, many of which were

32:38.440 --> 32:46.760
indeed interpreted as fanaticism, as Maleficians, demons.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.560
Those people were called among other things, dewony, et cetera.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.920
Yes, but what emerges is something completely different.

32:54.920 --> 33:02.360
That emerges and what is remarkably striking, it is so striking that not only new words

33:02.360 --> 33:11.960
emerge, but a completely new discourse emerges in jurisprudence, in medicine and in theology.

33:11.960 --> 33:19.000
The first hospital, the first hospital in the sense in which we understand a medical establishment

33:19.000 --> 33:27.440
for treatment of disease is emerges at which hospital is that it is Badlam, the hospital

33:27.440 --> 33:31.440
for those madmen.

33:31.440 --> 33:39.640
And ulegislation emerges which never existed, which treats only specifically those madmen,

33:39.640 --> 33:45.120
not demoniacy, not the other psychotics, but only those.

33:45.120 --> 33:51.360
What is so specific about them, what is so, and of course the entire Elizabethan and

33:51.360 --> 34:01.640
then Jacobian literature, including Shakespeare, which is very important, is focused on madness.

34:01.640 --> 34:08.240
The four great Shakespeare's tragedy are all focused on madness.

34:08.240 --> 34:11.280
It is a new phenomenon.

34:11.280 --> 34:19.400
What is so specific about this phenomenon is that it is seen as an existential experience

34:19.400 --> 34:22.560
because it lasts forever.

34:22.560 --> 34:32.920
When one first is affected by it, it will not disappear with age, it will not disappear

34:32.920 --> 34:35.080
with certain physical conditions.

34:35.080 --> 34:45.320
All the other say causes are either age related or have certain other biological conditions

34:45.320 --> 34:49.080
affiliated with them.

34:49.080 --> 34:57.080
And either in death with those other conditions or in cure with those other conditions.

34:57.080 --> 35:03.880
Those seem to be those that later were called schizophrenia and manic depressive illness,

35:03.880 --> 35:15.600
precisely diseases that until now exist without a known organic basis.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.640
They become the basis of psychiatry.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.200
Now what happens with that?

35:19.200 --> 35:21.840
And why nationalism?

35:21.840 --> 35:30.000
Because they seem to be related very, very tightly to the problems with the definition

35:30.000 --> 35:36.040
of individual identity that nationalism creates.

35:36.040 --> 35:46.560
By defining all the members of the nation as equal, it places the burden for the definition

35:46.560 --> 35:52.640
of the individual identity on the person.

35:52.640 --> 35:59.880
And for very many, this burden seems to be too much.

35:59.880 --> 36:06.600
And indeed, when we analyze schizophrenia and manic depression, we can see how great the

36:06.600 --> 36:11.960
self problems are in those diseases.

36:11.960 --> 36:18.040
Now in all the other societies, the individual's position was defined by birth.

36:18.040 --> 36:24.680
If one was born a daughter of a shoemaker, it was clear that one would then become the

36:24.680 --> 36:28.760
wife of a shoemaker and the mother of shoemakers.

36:28.760 --> 36:33.440
And what one is supposed to do in life was absolutely clear.

36:33.440 --> 36:38.920
Two such details as what kinds of clothes one would wear, what kinds of food one would

36:38.920 --> 36:44.720
eat, what kinds of holidays one would celebrate.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.120
So what defined by birth and by God?

36:48.120 --> 36:51.320
The place where God has placed you.

36:51.320 --> 37:00.720
But now everyone can be whatever one wants and one has to define oneself.

37:00.720 --> 37:09.400
And very often one feels that one made the wrong choice and experiences problems with

37:09.400 --> 37:13.440
oneself, hates oneself.

37:13.440 --> 37:24.360
It is from this problem with individual identity, specifically from the complex of inferiority

37:24.360 --> 37:27.160
that fanaticism emerges.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.160
Sankhand.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.160
What do you think?

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
What kind of essay question?

37:30.160 --> 37:31.160
Yes.

37:31.160 --> 37:36.440
I wanted to ask a question because her work is really, I mean, talking about, it relates

37:36.440 --> 37:43.760
to the work that you've done and why some naturalists support separatism and why some,

37:43.760 --> 37:47.800
the work that you've just been doing, I think that really relates to sort of what Leah is

37:47.800 --> 37:52.680
saying, why some can sort of break away like me, my work and why.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.200
And especially, of course, what's happening today in Russia and the Ukraine.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.680
I would love to hear what you have to say about that.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.360
Well, I mean, one of the other big questions that was posed to us on this panel is when

38:02.360 --> 38:08.360
do members of a group form or when do people become members of a group and then when does

38:08.360 --> 38:09.760
that group maybe become fanatical?

38:09.760 --> 38:11.680
Is that the second question?

38:11.680 --> 38:16.120
But yeah, I think it's really important just as it's important to be careful about using

38:16.120 --> 38:24.560
the term fanaticism as a way of labeling something we don't understand and labeling a form of

38:24.560 --> 38:29.400
violence or willingness to give one's life or take a life based on an ideology.

38:29.400 --> 38:33.800
That's often the way I think we come in a complex way that we use fanaticism.

38:33.800 --> 38:37.520
For example, we don't really talk about Patrick Henry, give me liberty or give me death as

38:37.520 --> 38:42.280
a fanatic or we don't talk about students who gave their life at Tiananmen Square as fanatics.

38:42.280 --> 38:48.760
It's usually something that embodies an ideology that we just don't get or don't agree with.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.520
Well, do you think they are?

38:50.520 --> 38:52.480
Do you think they are?

38:52.480 --> 38:53.480
Fanatics?

38:53.480 --> 38:58.800
Well, I guess if we use the term as willingness to die, which seems sort of like irrational

38:58.800 --> 39:01.760
behavior, it can be defined as fanatical.

39:01.760 --> 39:06.560
But the problem with that term is that you are saying that person is a believer in an

39:06.560 --> 39:13.520
ideology or a member of a group only because they believe in this ideology and you're

39:13.520 --> 39:17.640
not taking into consideration that there can be other motivations for that kind of behavior.

39:17.640 --> 39:24.880
Even in the case for something that appears to be as extreme as a suicide bomber or a

39:24.880 --> 39:27.920
member of Al-Qaeda who's part of 9-11.

39:27.920 --> 39:33.480
There could be other motivations, some of them rational, some of them of the kind you

39:33.480 --> 39:35.280
describe that soldiers face.

39:35.280 --> 39:40.400
The group in group love or affiliation that motivate people to give their life on behalf

39:40.400 --> 39:45.040
of their brethren or the people they consider theirs.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.040
Can I?

39:46.040 --> 39:50.400
Let me take from my perspective as an analyst now just a couple of thoughts.

39:50.400 --> 39:55.800
One is to use a turn to a developmental perspective to look at Erickson's work on identity and

39:55.800 --> 40:01.680
identity formation to look at Erickson's ideas and his book Escape from Freedom, which

40:01.680 --> 40:07.280
I think you alluded to that some people can't tolerate the responsibility that comes with

40:07.280 --> 40:10.560
the democratic freedom.

40:10.560 --> 40:17.200
And he suggests that the challenge for democratic societies is when you have external freedom

40:17.200 --> 40:22.280
then to develop internal freedoms and a sense of responsibility over one's actions.

40:22.280 --> 40:27.080
And from his talking about something that happens in adolescence, late adolescence in

40:27.080 --> 40:28.080
general.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.120
But the nature of Erickson's work, and he was the master of writing about identity a man

40:32.120 --> 40:36.360
who never knew who his father was and when he was in analysis with Anna Freud said, I

40:36.360 --> 40:38.120
have a chance to find out where my father is.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.120
And she said, don't.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.120
You can't.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.120
You're not allowed to.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.120
And he didn't.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.680
And regretted listening to her the rest of his life.

40:44.680 --> 40:49.680
Who named himself by his last name, Eric's son, because he didn't know who his father

40:49.680 --> 40:50.680
was.

40:50.680 --> 40:54.440
He was the master of identity in a sense.

40:54.440 --> 41:00.360
And he talks about the importance of adolescence as a time to begin to assemble like Legos

41:00.360 --> 41:09.440
or something and concretize and solidify who I think I am, who I belong with or to, and

41:09.440 --> 41:15.960
beginning to extend my belonging system from my family to outside family, friends and peers,

41:15.960 --> 41:17.840
groups and such.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.840
That's just one place to start.

41:19.840 --> 41:24.000
And then we can look at adolescence and ask them, whom do you consider part of the group

41:24.000 --> 41:26.640
and who's nuts about this?

41:26.640 --> 41:27.640
Who goes way overboard?

41:27.640 --> 41:30.640
Or I'll give you another example in a moment.

41:30.640 --> 41:34.560
But Erickson, even he pointed out that there were cultural differences that surprised him.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.920
When he moved to the States, he was impressed and surprised and talked about in his book

41:38.920 --> 41:45.320
Identity and Youth Formation that American youth were more interested in being part of

41:45.320 --> 41:50.480
a group than his experience in Europe, his experience, I'm not saying European youth.

41:50.480 --> 41:56.600
In Europe as a vonderfulgal before he went and joined Anna Freud's kindergarten to teach

41:56.600 --> 42:02.320
with Peter Blos, who was a faculty member here, it was important to be independent and alone

42:02.320 --> 42:04.320
and self-ruling and against us.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.920
And he comes to America and he finds youth don't value that as much.

42:08.920 --> 42:12.040
And he's puzzled and I don't think he used the word concern.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.120
It was Eric Fromm who was concerned about that.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.520
So one place to start is that period.

42:17.520 --> 42:23.040
Then another example of cultural difference I'll mention of the issue of fanatical.

42:23.040 --> 42:27.200
So when we had the second Lebanese war, I went up north.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.480
I was volunteering as a physician.

42:28.480 --> 42:30.200
I was teaching at the university at the time.

42:30.200 --> 42:34.000
But I volunteered as a physician because I wanted to meet the soldiers I had interviewed

42:34.000 --> 42:36.680
in my study as they came back from Lebanon.

42:36.680 --> 42:37.680
That was the way I could do it.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.120
It was to go up north.

42:39.120 --> 42:42.720
And when they came back, and these were guys who were in elite units, they were put into

42:42.720 --> 42:47.920
Lebanon three days, 72 hours, fight and then pulled out.

42:47.920 --> 42:54.160
And they described real disarray as Israeli government tried to run the war from Tel Aviv.

42:54.160 --> 42:55.160
Real disarray.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.160
But I won't go into that.

42:56.160 --> 43:01.720
What shocked them was in fighting what was called Hezbollah, there were two groups of

43:01.720 --> 43:03.680
soldiers they fought.

43:03.680 --> 43:11.920
One was a massive young man running at them, shooting without aiming, sacrificing themselves.

43:11.920 --> 43:17.200
And behind them were snipers who would use the guys running in front to identify where

43:17.200 --> 43:20.480
his early soldiers were and pick them off.

43:20.480 --> 43:25.280
But my soldier said they couldn't get their heads around, these guys running in front.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.160
It didn't feel like a war.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.000
It felt like a slaughter to them.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
And that ran counter to their own identities.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.520
So there was a cultural difference.

43:33.520 --> 43:40.560
Or when there was a mother of a suicide bomber who lived in a village just opposite my apartment

43:40.560 --> 43:48.840
in Jerusalem, and her son shoots a bunch of yeshiva boys and is killed.

43:48.840 --> 43:53.400
And she drapes her, I could see her house was draped in big Hamas green flags and says

43:53.400 --> 43:58.000
I have, and she points to her seven year olds and I have another one to sacrifice.

43:58.000 --> 44:02.880
And my Israeli students said they don't get this.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.760
So they don't get what?

44:04.760 --> 44:08.920
They don't get how my mother could say, my six year old, I have another six year old

44:08.920 --> 44:09.920
to sacrifice.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.440
What are you saying that though publicly?

44:11.440 --> 44:13.880
It doesn't matter.

44:13.880 --> 44:19.720
No Israeli mother I knew would say that I knew or was advertised as saying that publicly.

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
That I knew.

44:20.720 --> 44:23.360
There may have been some who might have but none that I knew.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.480
My point is that when you ask, you ask the raise the question of fanaticism and how do

44:27.480 --> 44:32.600
we define it, I'm reminded of when the Supreme Court, nine justices all mail at the time,

44:32.600 --> 44:37.400
were asked to study pornography and they were asked how do you define it?

44:37.400 --> 44:38.920
And one of them said I forgot who.

44:38.920 --> 44:46.000
I thought Justice Potter said, I knew it when I see it.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.160
Not a bad place to start.

44:47.160 --> 44:50.040
I would disagree because you're seeing something you don't understand.

44:50.040 --> 44:51.480
Okay that seems like fanaticism.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.720
That doesn't mean that's what's going on.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.440
You don't understand.

44:54.440 --> 45:00.320
Robert Pape, Mia Bloom have done books on suicide bombing that go into great detail explaining

45:00.320 --> 45:04.160
what's behind this thing that seems insane to us and fanatical.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.640
And so this is my problem with fanaticism.

45:05.640 --> 45:06.720
It's like, oh they're fanatics.

45:06.720 --> 45:07.720
That's all there is to it.

45:07.720 --> 45:11.280
So maybe but if you just assume that you're not really going to understand what's going

45:11.280 --> 45:12.280
on.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.280
Where do they see themselves?

45:13.280 --> 45:15.520
How could they're human beings like you and me?

45:15.520 --> 45:18.040
How could some human being be put into place when they're doing that?

45:18.040 --> 45:21.440
That's the question to ask rather than to just assume or to use the term.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
Which is sort of what you're saying.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.240
I know it when I see it.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.640
I know it when I see it and let's find out what's behind it.

45:26.640 --> 45:34.160
So like when Bethlehem and Janowitz studied US soldiers returning from World War II to

45:34.160 --> 45:40.000
look at prejudice and they found 44% of US soldiers were prejudice against blacks and

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Jews.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.160
And they were very stereotyped.

45:43.160 --> 45:47.200
Blacks smelled bad, had big genitals and would rape their wives.

45:47.200 --> 45:51.560
And Jews were very smart and would steal the white out of your eyes and take your jobs.

45:51.560 --> 45:54.480
That was fairly stereotypical among them.

45:54.480 --> 45:58.400
So they came out of figure 44% prejudice like that's scary.

45:58.400 --> 46:03.880
But then they listened to the interviews which were done on wire recorders.

46:03.880 --> 46:08.360
They found that it was 14% there were four groups in the 44%.

46:08.360 --> 46:14.520
14% were what they called hardcore prejudice who said if I could kill them I would.

46:14.520 --> 46:20.520
The only thing that stops me is the law, the reverend and my wife.

46:20.520 --> 46:27.680
It's that 14% that Peter Fonigy recently referred to as malignant prejudice as supposed to what

46:27.680 --> 46:33.120
Peter says what we mostly all have is what he calls benign prejudice.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.640
So the issue is not prejudice or not.

46:35.640 --> 46:36.640
Peter suggests.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.520
You're connecting fanaticism with prejudice?

46:39.520 --> 46:40.520
I am.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.080
Do you agree with them?

46:43.080 --> 46:46.080
Well, again, I'm not going to use the word fanaticism myself.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.960
I mean, I understand what you're saying and people act like that but I won't use the term

46:48.960 --> 46:52.200
because of the, so let me just give another example from Serbia.

46:52.200 --> 46:56.360
I mean, again, the image of the people who did go off to fight that they were just like

46:56.360 --> 47:00.040
these kind of, they were just going, oh, and they just want to go kill people are different.

47:00.040 --> 47:04.200
In fact, if you look at the discourse they were responding to, it was very clearly a

47:04.200 --> 47:06.200
discourse of injustice.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.440
They were convinced and they were motivated by horrible injustices that they believed

47:10.440 --> 47:15.400
that they were being told were being committed against people, women, children, innocent

47:15.400 --> 47:17.520
civilians for no other reason that they're served.

47:17.520 --> 47:21.080
So yeah, there's an identity, there's an identification but it's not just sort of like

47:21.080 --> 47:22.160
these people are crazy.

47:22.160 --> 47:26.400
They're like, there's an understandable motivation that I think any of us could understand if

47:26.400 --> 47:28.440
we put it in those terms.

47:28.440 --> 47:34.560
And so again, the idea is to understand why people go off and fight wars that from our

47:34.560 --> 47:38.520
perspective seem like these people are crazy, ancient haters, they're killing each other.

47:38.520 --> 47:43.160
Actually if you look at the sort of on the ground processes, it's very understandable.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.800
You don't have to agree with what they're doing.

47:44.800 --> 47:49.520
It's very understandable and you can't say it's a group against a group, right?

47:49.520 --> 47:54.000
If you have 80% of Serbian guys not wanting to fight, if embossing a people are sort of

47:54.000 --> 47:57.680
forced to fight and they're sort of like put in situations where there's no choice, something

47:57.680 --> 47:59.120
else is going on there.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.480
It's not just identity.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.720
Identity is obviously the category that you belong to is important.

48:03.720 --> 48:07.000
But to use Brübaker's terms, groupness is not automatic.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Groupness is something that has to be created.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.600
And even when there's a high sense of groupness, everyone in that group or in that category

48:12.600 --> 48:15.240
is not going to be responding in the same way.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.960
And even a majority may not.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.440
So I think the link.

48:19.440 --> 48:26.320
So are you saying the modern man, the modern us that we don't like to kill people?

48:26.320 --> 48:29.000
By and large we don't want to kill people.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
I'm not going to generalize.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.880
But then some of us or some people become part of some group for whatever reason and then

48:37.880 --> 48:39.440
they're willing to do that.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.440
Take that step.

48:40.440 --> 48:46.920
I think people in general, some people are willing to kill for things they believe deeply

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
in.

48:47.920 --> 48:53.560
I mean, if you join the US Army and are willing to do that then no one questions that.

48:53.560 --> 48:58.360
So you're not a fanatic if you're in the US Army and you go out and you kill that part

48:58.360 --> 49:01.080
of your job.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.800
So then at which point do you become a fanatic?

49:03.800 --> 49:08.080
I'm not going to use that term.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.080
Sorry.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.880
In Colombia.

49:10.880 --> 49:15.680
And actually we should not generalize.

49:15.680 --> 49:19.040
But we should explain certain trends.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.560
There are different trends in society.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.760
No society is one trend.

49:24.760 --> 49:26.840
There is no such thing.

49:26.840 --> 49:35.480
So let me first address the problem of age and adolescence and second the problem of

49:35.480 --> 49:37.560
cultural differences.

49:37.560 --> 49:43.040
They're obviously both age and cultural differences plain to that.

49:43.040 --> 49:50.560
And as they overlap in very different ways they create those specifically active groups.

49:50.560 --> 50:00.800
So the problem with individual identity and nationalism are particularly sharp, acute,

50:00.800 --> 50:08.040
and cause particularly many problems as we Americans know probably better than any other

50:08.040 --> 50:13.280
people during other lessons.

50:13.280 --> 50:22.720
Young adults is precisely the age when severe mental illness is usually diagnosed in this

50:22.720 --> 50:24.640
society.

50:24.640 --> 50:35.560
But in addition to that we have now in universities according to the latest surveys.

50:35.560 --> 50:43.800
Twenty-five percent, it was twenty several years ago, but now twenty-five percent of students

50:43.800 --> 50:54.920
which means one in four of our students who is severely depressed, clinically depressed.

50:54.920 --> 50:58.840
This is one of those diseases, right?

50:58.840 --> 51:06.640
And hates his own guts, first of all completely maladjusted and of course hates the guts of

51:06.640 --> 51:08.960
everyone else being severely depressed.

51:08.960 --> 51:11.200
Do you give me the reference on that?

51:11.200 --> 51:13.160
Yes, I will give it to you.

51:13.160 --> 51:15.720
I don't have it right now, but I will give it to you.

51:15.720 --> 51:22.640
It is a special college survey of 2012.

51:22.640 --> 51:25.440
The latest data, I'll give it to you.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.800
It is in my book actually the reference.

51:28.800 --> 51:39.240
Well, so it is at this time indeed when we have most of those problems.

51:39.240 --> 51:41.720
Now what happens in the United States?

51:41.720 --> 51:52.960
In the United, we are talking of course about a much larger group, again, Kessler's surveys,

51:52.960 --> 52:01.560
National Institute of Mental Health, the recent that around fifty percent in American population

52:01.560 --> 52:03.760
are somewhat mentally ill.

52:03.760 --> 52:10.240
So we are not talking, we are talking about those colossal horrendous figures.

52:10.240 --> 52:16.880
So we are not talking mostly about really severely ill people.

52:16.880 --> 52:25.760
We are talking about enormous millions and millions of fellow citizens who experience

52:25.760 --> 52:29.400
terrible general malaise.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.760
Now what happens in the United States?

52:31.760 --> 52:37.560
In the United States, which is the individualistic society, I define it as such because of the

52:37.560 --> 52:39.360
type of nationalism.

52:39.360 --> 52:43.040
I can go into that.

52:43.040 --> 52:52.560
In this society, really severely ill people who are not taken care of would end like Adam

52:52.560 --> 53:00.600
Lanza or other shooters in schools and in colleges.

53:00.600 --> 53:04.280
This happens in our society constantly.

53:04.280 --> 53:08.440
It seems to be a particular American pastime.

53:08.440 --> 53:14.800
But in other societies, in other societies, in collectivistic societies, such for example

53:14.800 --> 53:20.080
is Germany or is Serbia or is Russia.

53:20.080 --> 53:28.600
They are likely to engage in collective action, not in individual.

53:28.600 --> 53:31.240
Excuse me, Russia just had its first school shooting.

53:31.240 --> 53:32.240
Oh, it did.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.240
Some places, yes, it did.

53:33.240 --> 53:39.840
And some countries in northern Europe are copycat.

53:39.840 --> 53:41.720
I'm going to add something.

53:41.720 --> 53:44.200
Just footnotes about that.

53:44.200 --> 53:50.600
Diagnosis is a mess in American society, contemporary's country, except since the time

53:50.600 --> 53:56.120
of the Bloyler, we are pretty good at diagnosing men and oppressive illness and remain so and

53:56.120 --> 53:58.360
we are good at diagnosing true schizophrenia.

53:58.360 --> 54:03.720
Those are the two diagnoses that have remained from the time of Bloyler and the Switzerland

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
to appear.

54:04.720 --> 54:08.360
And as I recall, I haven't kept up with the epidemiology.

54:08.360 --> 54:10.880
The rates are fairly consistent.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.880
And I mean, let me finish.

54:12.880 --> 54:17.960
But I don't understand that I think you are trying to make the point that I'm still not

54:17.960 --> 54:19.720
catching it.

54:19.720 --> 54:29.680
If you are saying fanaticism is a consequence of mental illness or are you making a broader

54:29.680 --> 54:31.680
point that I'm not catching?

54:31.680 --> 54:32.680
Yes.

54:32.680 --> 54:33.680
Well, let me start again.

54:33.680 --> 54:34.680
No, don't start again.

54:34.680 --> 54:35.680
That's been launched.

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
Don't start again.

54:36.680 --> 54:37.680
I've been there for years.

54:37.680 --> 54:38.680
Try to go to the conclusion.

54:38.680 --> 54:39.680
Yes, maybe you want to.

54:39.680 --> 54:51.720
I don't know.

54:51.720 --> 54:55.240
There is a general idea that in a three years society more difficult for a clear identity.

54:55.240 --> 55:01.360
In general, in a society, in modern society, it's very difficult to form a clear identity.

55:01.360 --> 55:08.200
But people with problems with identity, in liberal societies such as the United States,

55:08.200 --> 55:11.080
are going to act on their own.

55:11.080 --> 55:12.880
They're going to erupt on their own.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.880
Can I interrupt on this?

55:13.880 --> 55:18.440
Because the fact you talked about collectivist societies, they act together.

55:18.440 --> 55:22.320
So in Serbia, these paramilitary groups often were people like this, not only, but people

55:22.320 --> 55:23.320
like that.

55:23.320 --> 55:25.000
But they weren't just acting on their own.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.040
They were brought together by particular people in the government who wanted this kind of

55:30.040 --> 55:32.360
people to be willing to do this kind of almost.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.360
Exactly.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.360
It was working.

55:34.360 --> 55:35.360
I was working.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.360
And I mean, you interviewed.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.760
I've interviewed a lot of those people.

55:38.760 --> 55:44.800
I've also, I mean, I think what I'm interested in about what everybody's saying is, and especially

55:44.800 --> 55:50.320
what Chip was talking about, how, I mean, I don't know that much about Serbia more about

55:50.320 --> 55:55.960
Bosnia, but why was there, I mean, I see it as they were nationalists.

55:55.960 --> 55:59.800
I'm not talking about fanaticism, fanaticism, whatever.

55:59.800 --> 56:04.200
I mean, that to me is much more relevant to the work that I think the three of us are

56:04.200 --> 56:05.200
doing.

56:05.200 --> 56:11.480
But why, and you talked about images, how did the people resist those horrible images

56:11.480 --> 56:16.600
and all of the propaganda that they were throwing out saying they were killing your neighbors,

56:16.600 --> 56:18.920
you're going to be killed in your, it would happen in Rwanda too.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.720
I mean, they, in Rwanda, they were saying, you know, your neighbor's going to come and

56:22.720 --> 56:23.720
stab you in the back.

56:23.720 --> 56:28.680
I mean, that's how they got a lot of the Hutus to, you know, kill each other because they

56:28.680 --> 56:31.040
were scared and it was a propaganda.

56:31.040 --> 56:32.520
So it did create this political...

56:32.520 --> 56:36.520
What are they saying that, the people who were saying that, what were they saying that?

56:36.520 --> 56:37.520
They were saying that.

56:37.520 --> 56:38.520
Why were they saying that?

56:38.520 --> 56:42.920
They were saying that because they wanted them to get, you know, pick up arms and kill

56:42.920 --> 56:43.920
the other.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.920
They didn't like the other...

56:45.920 --> 56:46.920
What was the game?

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
Power.

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
It's all about power.

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
It's all about power.

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
They were in power.

56:50.920 --> 56:53.800
France and the United States was pressuring them to have elections which they would have

56:53.800 --> 56:54.800
lost.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.800
And they were a piece of money.

56:55.800 --> 56:59.080
And this is a way to sort of say, you know, to shift the focus.

56:59.080 --> 57:01.520
But it's really about exploiting the identity.

57:01.520 --> 57:02.520
Yeah.

57:02.520 --> 57:08.920
And what I'm interested in, what you were saying was how, I mean, this large number of

57:08.920 --> 57:15.160
Serbian, you know, in Serbia resisted those negative stereotypes and the propaganda.

57:15.160 --> 57:18.200
If you think about what Leah was saying, I mean, some people are going to be more apt

57:18.200 --> 57:24.640
to be really motivated by those kinds of images and not question them because of their own

57:24.640 --> 57:26.160
personal issues.

57:26.160 --> 57:30.400
Other people were very skeptical of them and didn't believe what the government...

57:30.400 --> 57:35.400
And in fact, we can say the majority of young guys who were being called up, they had their

57:35.400 --> 57:40.000
own lives just like no one wants to go and give up your girlfriend and your VCR and

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
your...

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
And their jobs.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.280
Jobs if you had one, but still to go off, especially if you're skeptical.

57:46.280 --> 57:49.360
And so I haven't seen any actual study of...

57:49.360 --> 57:53.640
Well, actually there is someone who she hasn't published yet, but she did interviews with

57:53.640 --> 58:00.240
volunteers that is guys who volunteer to go fight and resistors the draft dodgers.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.400
And she did a really interesting study of that.

58:02.400 --> 58:03.400
But I think...

58:03.400 --> 58:04.400
I think the...

58:04.400 --> 58:07.400
I would say that those ones that were doing those were mentally ill.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.400
So I mean...

58:08.400 --> 58:10.160
What did you say there?

58:10.160 --> 58:15.680
I mean, from what I gather from them, maybe I'm completely off, there's a lot of mental

58:15.680 --> 58:19.800
illness in some of those people that have went off and I mean, most of them are...

58:19.800 --> 58:24.240
Well, I'm saying, look, let's look at it from the other point of view, right?

58:24.240 --> 58:31.480
If we have 20% which is an enormous amount, by the way, the rates, they increase continuously.

58:31.480 --> 58:34.560
It stopped in England, but not in this country.

58:34.560 --> 58:42.320
So if we are talking about 20% of ill people, we have 80% who are well.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.160
We have 80% who are well.

58:44.160 --> 58:47.600
A person, I remember an example from...

58:47.600 --> 58:49.960
Well, I'll interrupt you for two seconds.

58:49.960 --> 58:50.960
We're talking about...

58:50.960 --> 58:56.240
So the work that we're talking about is why people do these things in conflict and violence.

58:56.240 --> 58:57.240
So is that...

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
And I'm just trying...

58:58.240 --> 59:02.760
I'm not to be rude, but just to bring it back to what discussion and what Freud and Einstein

59:02.760 --> 59:09.320
were saying about violence, would you say, and other people agree, that those people that

59:09.320 --> 59:16.160
do extreme violence have a mental illness that are not exhibiting social behavior?

59:16.160 --> 59:18.560
And I throw it out to the group.

59:18.560 --> 59:24.040
Well, I remember that very famous nationalist, Russian nationalist, Karam Zim from the very

59:24.040 --> 59:28.080
beginning, who said, very, very good thing.

59:28.080 --> 59:37.120
A person who is happy about himself would find good things everywhere.

59:37.120 --> 59:45.320
People who have a stable and satisfactory individual identity would not participate in

59:45.320 --> 59:47.360
those actions.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.240
There are many such people.

59:49.240 --> 59:51.240
However, now scientists...

59:51.240 --> 59:58.640
For instance, don't even start with Aijwan.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.440
When you read his documents, you see how absolutely mad he was.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.720
Okay, so let's go on to a level...

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.720
But I wonder if we could get back to it, at least if she didn't get to answer a question.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.520
Because here you have cases where it seems like it's the same, but very different outcomes.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:22.760
Well, I guess you're asking about violence, but we could also ask a little bit, broaden

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.080
the question, actually the way it was posed here, to us, which is, when do people join

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.120
groups that have a common sense of identity?

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.280
And then when does that group maybe become phonetical?

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.680
Or when does the phonetical book maybe become violent?

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:45.160
Well, I think that the way, just like earlier, we were talking about how the label of fanaticism

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.120
is maybe not so helpful in allowing us to understand human behavior.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:57.280
I think often the label of ethnic group, or even group, is not so helpful in helping us

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.480
to understand people's behavior, especially with regard to supporting nationalism or supporting

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.800
what's being called in our society, ethnic violence.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.160
And there are many reasons for that.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.080
So we were starting to talk about that before.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.400
When you asked what are some of the reasons, I mean, at a most basic level in Yugoslavia,

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.680
you could say first of all, Serbs or Krazar-Baznins had multiple identities.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.880
This is the basic point that people are familiar with.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:30.040
People have multiple identities, young man, husband, father identities, regional identities,

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.040
urban identities, identities as a professional, identities as a communist, or an incipient

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.160
Democrat.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.400
And whether one of those or another of those is going to be the one that informs their

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.640
political behavior is an open question.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.080
But now that there's been violence there, we tend to look at it as a place where ethnic

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.760
identities are always the paramount identity.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.920
And that move obscures more than it reveals because we tend to think, well, people there

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.120
are members of ethnic groups, and that's how they condition all of their political and

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.120
social behavior.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:07.720
When it wasn't the case before, the war isn't the case after the war.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:14.160
So that's one kind of simple way of thinking about how ethnic group label can impede our

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.000
understanding of why there's going to be violence in one place or another.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.880
So like ships work because I'm not going to describe your work for kids.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:30.160
You know, basically try to show why the ethnic identity came to the fore or how in some ways

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.080
the understandings of the past were brought into the present by political entrepreneurs

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.960
and political leaders in order to mobilize people to support, to feel like they're part

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.080
of an ethnic group and then to support violence.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.840
So then why were there different outcomes in Russia?

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.840
Well, good question.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.200
That's a question that I spent many years working on for my book.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.320
And so I studied why do people support nationalist movements in some cases and not in other cases.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.040
And I looked at a bunch of cases you never heard of, a bunch of places you never heard

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.480
of because there wasn't violence and there wasn't strong nationalist mobilization.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.000
Now the one people probably heard of is Chechnya because there was a war that's been labeled

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
an ethnic war or a nationalist war because Chechnya wanted to secede.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.720
And I compared it to the other republics within Russia, especially Tatarstan where I did my

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.040
research, which was quite nationalist but that didn't go all the way towards separatism

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.400
and had decreasing levels of support for the opposition nationalists that were trying

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.440
to create a statehood.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.160
And then I compared to a bunch of other republics that are not on many Americans radar screen

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.640
because they had very weak nationalist movements despite the presence of ethnic entrepreneurs

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.560
or nationalist leaders in all of these places.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:47.400
And sort of a long story but a lot of this has to do with why we first of all might expect

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.480
there to be nationalist mobilization or support for nationalism.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.720
We expected, a lot of people expected it in Yugoslavia because of what had happened in

01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:06.520
the past there and the kind of, how can I say, that coming and going of politically relevant

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:12.640
ethnic identities in modern history in that region of the world and in the Soviet Union,

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.720
I mean in Russia we might have expected it because we just saw the Soviet Union collapse

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.920
along ethnic lines in part because the Soviet state actually unintentionally reinforced

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.200
certain kinds of national or ethnic identities and in a way told people that certain territories

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:34.880
belong to them and suggested that if political conditions would allow it, meaning a weaker

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:43.080
authoritarian center, then there could be a chance for nationalities, Ukrainians, Kazakhs,

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.960
and Estonians to get their own state. So it was a big fear in the early years of Russia

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.520
that some of the ethnic groups in Russia would do the same thing.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.840
And I think that, or the thing I argue which is probably not so popular among in common

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.480
understandings of nationalism because people see nationalism everywhere, support for nationalism

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.040
everywhere, support for the idea of a nation state. And the idea of a nation state as Leah

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.040
described is so powerful in the modern times, that's why you have all these nationalist

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:15.680
movements, but actually to get people to support nationalism when it might mean risk to themselves

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.880
could mean death, right, could mean more, or it could mean something lesser than that,

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.840
like losing your job or just coming out on the wrong side of a political competition

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.880
and supporting the wrong horse, it's actually harder for, harder for nationalist entrepreneurs

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.880
or politicians to mobilize people behind nationalism than I think is commonly understood.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.280
And several reasons for this have to do with the fact that one, people have multiple identities,

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.040
they have multiple political identities, they think about things in different ways. And

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:51.960
so to get people to support nationalism is a very strong idea that one, we are a group,

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.120
this is the, we are a national group, this is the main group that should matter to you,

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.280
and two, this group needs to have its own state and needs to fight for its own independent

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.400
state. So it's not easy, it's not like saying, you know, would you like to join a political

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.200
party, it's a strong commitment. So to make people perceive their national identity as

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.760
paramount compared to all of their other identities or as the way in which they should interpret

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.360
all of their experiences is not necessarily an easy thing. And nationalist entrepreneurs

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:25.480
can't just appear, I think, and say, you know what, you are, um, ta-ta, or you are

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:31.920
a cha-chan and therefore you should support a nationalist state. Now for some people, it's,

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.240
they're told a certain story about their history and how their, their glorious statehood was

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.360
denied and that makes sense. And for other people they say, well, no, I'm not just ta-ta,

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:45.280
or I'm not just ta-chan, I'm also a Russian, or I'm also a Soviet, or I'm also, um, you

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.560
know, a professor, or I'm also a worker, and I've got to go to work right now. So I'm

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.680
not sorry, I don't have time to go to your demonstration. Sort of daily choices like

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:58.040
that make it a lot harder. So I think nationalist entrepreneurs have to introduce a whole way

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:05.360
of dividing up the population that exists into categories and diminishing other identities

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.520
and helping people perceive information in ethnified terms.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.560
And if I can add here, violence is a really crucial way to do that. So the violence preceded

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:17.080
the solidifying ethnic identities that didn't follow from it. Sort of the violence and

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.040
the war is what created that kind of higher sense of groupness.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.400
So is nationalism in decline? Well, like I've got them, they're about to have a referendum

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:32.240
on. I wouldn't say it seemed to claim, but I would say that is a different union.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.840
European Union is not nationalism, it's regionalism. Oh, you mean that the resistance to the European

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.840
Union? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, those are, that's a little bit of a different question because

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:48.360
those are solidified nation states where people have a citizenship and a strong sense of being

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.640
a member of a state. And then it's more about modern day interests and what the European

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:58.880
gives versus a lot of the issues that a incipient nationalist movement is trying to convince

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:04.080
people is the right way to see the world. So in places where there wasn't a state and

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.280
if elites appeared and tried to convince people that there should be a state like among Kurds

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.680
and in Iran or Turkey, it's actually hard, that's my argument. I'm not talking about

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:19.240
established nation states. It's actually harder than it would seem to an outsider to mobilize

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:24.840
people. And I think, okay, so ships and violence, this is a really critical way in which people

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:31.040
can form a sense of groupness. And another thing that violence does is define a group

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.360
of people as a victim. So defining a group of people as a victim is a critical step and

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.040
that's a step that needs to happen. So how do you do that? That's often why you see violence

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.080
because then you get the state to respond and create victims and that can help congeal

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:49.760
a sense of a nationhood. And I think that's what happened in Chechnya. There was not so

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.840
clear that there was, Chechen nationalism was strong before the Russians invaded, but it's

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:59.320
not so clear that it would have lasted or that there would have been sustained support

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:06.400
for nationalist state in Chechnya when the leader of that state was terrible authoritarian

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:11.120
leader. But then Russian army comes in and starts killing you because you're a Chechen

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.720
and suddenly that becomes your most important identity and you feel a sense of bonding to

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.800
other Chechnya and it really created a very strong support for nationalism. So then we

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.840
can just think about other ways that victimhood is created. And in my book I talk about a lot

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.160
of the ways that entrepreneurs talk about the creation of victimhood is through whether

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.640
people are prevented from fulfilling their life in a way that is meaningful to them,

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.120
like getting a good job, having their children get good jobs, having high status vis-a-vis

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:45.400
the other groups in their society. And so when an entrepreneur can come in and place

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:51.240
blame on the central state or on the ethnic other in the state for blocking people's

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.640
life chances or denying them the jobs or denying them the best apartments, these are

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.880
the kinds of rhetoric that were around in Russia that went part of the way, a long way

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.480
I argue toward film ending support for or creating a sense of groupness, ethnic groupness

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.520
and film ending support for nationalism. What about injustice?

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:18.400
That isn't injustice. It's a personal and an injustice that's framed by the leader as

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:24.520
an ethnic injustice because you're told look you can't get a good education, you can't

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.120
get that education, you can't get that professional job, you can't get that white collar job because

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:35.320
you're an ethnic minority. And to the degree that that message is convincing, it's powerful

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.200
right? It could be true. It might not be true. It was important when people start to believe

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:45.360
that it's true and perceive that it's true and it can create a sense of victimhood and

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:50.680
a sense of groupness that can then be mobilized by political leaders in support of well now

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.320
look at how our group has been victimized if we had our own state. Here's the solution,

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:00.040
we have our own state, we won't be a victim anymore. We can get the best jobs or we can

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:08.440
get the best apartments so we can remove ourselves from years of oppression from the ethnic other.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.160
And in that way it's really critical then to get a state. But is that always an easy

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.960
message to sell? I think not. And it's not always clear what the message should be and

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:22.760
nationalist entrepreneurs and politicians aren't geniuses. Some of them may be. Some of them

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.680
are better politicians than others but they're not necessarily always aware about which message

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.240
is going to take root. They don't exactly know how to frame it. They're not always strategic

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:39.000
about it because they may be a true believer in nationalist ideas and they may just go out there

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.440
and talk about what it meant to be an oppressed member of the nation three centuries ago and

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.520
that may appeal to some intellectuals but it's not going to appeal to high schoolers or college

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.920
kids and so they're not going to support nationalism. I just think there's a lot of roots to nationalism

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.560
and a lot of roots away from nationalism and political entrepreneurs have their work cut out

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:08.360
for them to try to find the right message and to try to work with people in a society that has

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.760
certain kinds of identities and other ones that might oppose those identities. And in modern societies

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:21.160
I think it's a harder sell than it might have been in an agrarian or in a kind of society

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:28.120
that's transitioning to modernity. So in about five, ten minutes I'm going to ask the audience

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.120
for questions so this is your last chance to put your ideas out if you haven't yet.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.800
Well, you know as I said before I mean I appreciate what you're saying. I mean I work in

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:49.400
more agrarian, I mean we're wanting an agrarian society so it's much more, it was much more,

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:54.600
it was easier for them to be manipulated, it was easier for them to get the word out. I mean they

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:01.080
have lots of ways to manipulate them to have them rise up as a group. You know the Hutus really...

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:08.840
What kind of ways? Radio, lots and lots of propaganda, tools, yeah tons and as I said before,

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:18.360
like in Serbia and in Bosnia they thought they were going to be killed. And so I mean my question

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:25.720
is always you know that group identity sort of changed to be you know they were neighbors,

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:34.200
they celebrated together, the Muslims and the Serbs in Bosnia celebrated, they were

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:43.080
live next door to each other and you know one of the rescuers that I interviewed in

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.280
Wanda said you know we were one minute you know you're a human being and the next minute you're

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:55.000
a cockroach. It's the same thing as in you know so to make them sub-human they were really good at

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.680
that in Germany and in Bosnia and in Rwanda they were really really great propagandists in doing that

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:10.200
but you know why did the one neighbor say you know they still are human beings and how can you,

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:16.440
how can one day one be a human being and the next day they're not. And so those are the kind of

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.200
people you really want to look at when you're talking about let's not use the word fanaticism

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:27.880
but when they're going to commit you know this antisocial kind of identity incident or

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:33.720
post-social identity and that I think is really important to look at and there's lots of examples

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:41.400
in every society that have these you know sort of nationalist violent cultures that had happened

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:47.160
in conflict. And just to pick up on that I think the information sources is crucial so again if

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:54.600
you look at the micro level in Bosnia what was used were social networks, informal social networks,

01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.160
fictive kinship groups, bus drivers who had who knew people all along their roots and that was

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.800
that was the that was sort of how information flowed into the society so you're listening to

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.720
people who you know and you kind of trust and you hear hey there's a list that the Muslims have

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.280
made of all the Serbs are going to be killed in this town and it's like that's insane they would

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.720
never do that but you're hearing it from people that you kind of trust because they're part of

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.480
your social network and that's when doubt comes in and fear and if you're going are you going to

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:26.760
risk it right so it's a very complex process again it's not this simplistic you push a button and

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.200
everyone starts foaming it's a very sophisticated actually social process on the ground that that

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:37.480
leads to these kinds of communities that that come apart and then the violence comes in with

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.040
paramilitary groups and then in terms of who commits violence I mean a lot of what's going on as

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:47.480
personal grudges let's say I hate you because you stole my girlfriend when I was in high school and

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.520
you just happen to be a Muslim I'm a Serb and now it's open game on all Muslims I can take out my

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:59.640
personal a lot of it as personal grudges a lot of it is resentment you know and some of it may be

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.800
sort of national nationalism but that was not there was definitely not enough nationalism on

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.960
the ground to explain what happened nationalism defined in terms of an attachment to a particular

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:14.360
what happened between what happened between Turkey and Armenia it was apparently whatever was

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:23.240
decided was decided centrally but it was carried out in territories quite far from the center

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.200
so now let's carry it out by the government I mean the Turkish government carried that out

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:36.440
it wasn't I don't think in Armenia it was paramilitary it was really no but the local people started

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:42.680
fighting it yeah but I think one of the things that happens in these cultures that have had conflict

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:49.640
is that especially in the case of Yugoslavia before the war before Tito you know put it together

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:57.000
he said we're one Yugoslavia and they never were able to talk about the old grudges that they had

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.400
I mean the Serbs well the Serbs in the I mean they were killing each other they hated each other

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.480
actually the Serbs in Kross there was never violence between Serbs in Kross until 1906 under

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:11.240
the Austro-Hungarian I'm talking about the World War II I'm talking about World War II and so and

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.560
they did it and they're still doing it in Rwanda killing each other all the time right and there

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.120
was never discussion about that one more to happen there were discussions each of the republics

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.360
learned about the sins of their own nationalists but I'll also say in the most ethnically mixed

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.760
regions of Croatia there was a huge very high 50 percent intermarriage rate of Serbs against Kross

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.960
you don't find that if there's like this festering so and for what I you know talking to people

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:38.440
there for them before the war they're like that's ancient history you know and then I remember

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:42.120
talking about the war in Lebanon oh that they really that would never happen here you know this is a

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.520
totally we're in a different place and yeah that was history but that was then and so the point is

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.320
the violence didn't sort of bubble up from people wanting it really was central it was a central

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.600
project and they used many mechanisms to sort of tap into the way same thing in Rwanda and many

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:01.240
of these conflicts that are called ethnic conflicts you know the existing relations on the ground is

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:09.480
not enough to explain what happened even in places where there are historical grievances so yeah you

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:19.960
want to say something before we know no I'll leave it all to questions okay please come to the

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.840
you remember this is the panel we were Stephen Pinker's results from his latest book that

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:36.840
violence has greatly declined over the centuries and if so how does your research and your various

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:45.000
theories account for that that's a controversial book and it ended from a brilliant man it reminds

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.560
me though Sally Provence who was an infant researcher Yale used to point out that during before the

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:54.840
French Revolution they used to play football with infants throwing them for one to the other breaking

01:18:54.840 --> 01:19:02.680
their bones so there may he may be right about let's say a lack of caring about the other but we've

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.960
gotten so much better at killing people were far better at it in terms of numbers than we used to

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:13.960
be but killing many fewer people I mean it's I mean at one time you know Europe had wars all the time

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.840
before killing each other a hundred years war I mean as bad as this now is nothing compared to

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.960
like it was in the past I'm not good at the numbers but I understand between Mao and Stalin they did a

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:29.640
very fine job in the millions and tens of millions but I you know I would I don't know us pinkes his

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:39.080
numbers yeah what when is he saying it started to decline from the beginning with civilization

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:45.800
I think 20th century I think we have kind of a movement about what the 20th century is going to work

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:52.120
while he's not just talking about wars right he's talking about just violence in general

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.240
yeah aggression

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:05.320
this build-up of people have each other fanaticism or whatever is it helped or hindered by social

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:15.880
media this is a big debate yeah it's a great question it's a big debate and you know usually

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:22.040
the debate in political science is about whether social media is is helping mobilization and popular

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:27.320
understanding suggests that it did help mobilization and anti-authoritarian mobilization in Egypt

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:32.840
then others argue not we could extrapolate from what I just talked about personal information and of

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.840
person you know if we're happening now and they were Facebook and all of these social media on the

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.600
one hand you would have information about what's actually happening in a place we'll know it's not

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.760
what they're saying on the other hand you might be hearing from your friends about things because

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.640
it's sort of again that rumor network so I don't think I want to take the disinformation

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:58.280
so to cut it away we just had a panel at Harriman about I guess it was about demonstrations and

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:05.160
also Ukraine and this subject came up a little bit the idea that well rumors can still spread in

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:11.560
fact social media can help them spread and rumors may not be productive and but then participants

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.880
or people who are very well informed about what's going on Ukraine said actually they think Twitter

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.800
in particular is very helpful in dismissing rumors because a journalist was there speaking

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:27.000
Russian journalist and she said that her friend was inside the ring of fire or right outside the

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:36.200
in Ukraine that the demonstrators built and if a rumor was begun by the state which the state

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.960
in many of these places are putting rumors out via Twitter she could just ask her friend who's

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.160
right there they could go over and look so I think this assumes a very small geographic area

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:50.200
and then they can all say to each other oh there is saying that there's going to be a bomb

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:56.280
in an hour at this site but actually we went and checked and there's no bomb and that we can sort

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.920
of figure out that that Twitter post was from the government and they're trying to they're trying

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:06.920
to make us scared so some people you know I think it's an open question some people feel like Twitter

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.320
can be very useful and others feel like the state is so self-effaceable by Twitter

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:22.440
I'm looking at my iPhone and it defines a fanatic as a person with an extreme and and by the way this

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:30.440
definition is throughout the the internet here a person with an extreme and uncritical enthusiasm

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:38.840
or zeal as in religion or politics and it seems to me that the most important word that you all

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:46.760
have mentioned is the word critical that the lack of a critical approach to anything is what may breed

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:53.880
an excessive irrational zeal which is another word that hasn't come up so I want to ask that my

01:22:53.880 --> 01:23:03.080
question is isn't educated I mean just as far as curing is concerned is an education and critical

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:11.000
thinking the greatest goal in order to diffuse various kinds of whatever fanaticism is if it's a

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.680
bad thing to reduce it and with a lack of education it seems to me or with a considering continuing

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:25.400
and persistent deficiency in education around the world it's going to be very hard to like

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.680
these things out correct I don't know that I agree with that because you mentioned I mean the

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:34.200
early on you said oh well you know in the US we have critical thinking we're individuals but the

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:40.680
places like Russia and Serbia where it's more collectivist there but in fact Serbia is a

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.240
authoritarian society the education system is not about critical thinking it definitely wasn't

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.480
and yet you have 80 percent of the guys who refuse to go along something else is going on and in

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.560
this country in other countries where you have a good education system there are people who

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.080
fortunately we're not in a situation where I don't think it's going to go to violence but there are

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:03.080
people nevertheless who are followers of I think uncritical views of things that are could be

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:09.080
called nationalism in particular but some people were killed in Texas or somewhere after the 2011

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:14.680
bombings that people just went and found Muslims and yeah there's that too I actually disagree I think

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:19.400
if you it's an education and a certain kind to think about what choices what right choices you

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.960
make and what wrong choices you can make and if you talk about you know you're talking about the

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:29.240
other and dispelling stereotypes and dispelling you know but they didn't have that in Serbia so

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.760
how do you explain that so many people refuse to go and I don't know it might be economics was

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.800
with Serbia in a bad economic situation probably not what it's actually I don't know anyway

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:45.960
the point is yeah but I do I really do think that teaching certain I think teaching critical

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:52.920
thinking to to people in positive role models and pro-social behavior which we don't is really

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:59.880
important I don't think I know I know I'm just questioning like okay it seems like the basis

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:07.000
of fanaticism we've all kind of understood as something where our value system it has to do with

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.080
our personal values and I'm just curious if if we're thinking then that the whole world like there's

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:20.280
a universal value system that everyone's supposed to be abiding by. I want to add something in

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:25.560
response to that to the previous question also about critical thinking because I do depending on

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:30.200
how one and I'm thinking of a democratic society I'm being real parochial I'm thinking of democratic

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:41.000
societies now and the idea of being somehow to teach in the academics and or otherwise how to think

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.160
autonomously critically but there's one more ingredient that I want to add that's recent

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.960
Paul Ekman and the Dalai Lama wrote a book a few years back on negative emotions looking at it

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.400
from a Western and a Tibetan perspective and one of the components of that that Ekman is now coming

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:03.720
out with a new book on this alone was the Dalai Lama's emphasis upon compassion for all sentient

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:11.080
beings all not just other people all sentient beings and the challenge from the Dalai Lama was

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:18.520
to Paul who's a research psychologist he says it is compassion and emotion and Paul spends much

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:25.960
of this book explaining why it's not an emotion and but it can be taught. I agree with that totally

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:33.160
and being able to teach that whatever that means and it may change the idea of what teaching is

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:39.160
to be able to experience a sense of feelings for someone else and the other person's suffering

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:45.320
not only would be instructive but they've done several studies in California using that in the

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.760
school system teaching teachers both meditation and compassion and they found less

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:58.440
violence fighting among the kids in those classrooms compared to control classrooms.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.040
So the implication is that there's like a universal system of values.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:07.640
Well that's a dilemma I am just saying that according to the little bit fanatical in and

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:17.800
you know what Ekman of the Dalai Lama says there's something that can be fundamentally

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:25.000
human across cultures that can be fundamentally human. I mean please I think every culture

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:32.040
values human life. The problem isn't so much education because you could be educated the

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.440
problem is what is the situation in the places where we see I think what is the actual structural

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.640
situation that people are in right what is the economy like what are their day-to-day lives

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:45.560
like what is going on in terms of the information they're being fed regardless of how educated they

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.520
are you know if I I'm as educated as if I heard that someone went and killed my entire family and

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.640
everyone on my street or something I would have a reaction right so my point is I'm not against

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.800
education obviously and all of this is great but we can't just reduce it to oh people aren't

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:05.240
educated because if that were true we wouldn't be able to explain Serbia and other places where

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.200
it's if it's a small I'm not saying that and the idea of Betelheim and Jenna Woods's book is that

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:15.400
there's a balance between inner life and social and political laws and regulations you know when

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:20.600
the Nazis or the Zars said we're suspending laws for a while so you can have a pogrom it doesn't

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.400
matter what inner life is like think bad things happen so I agree with that but I'm just responding

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:30.520
that that there's something that we might be able to do and the word education when I was in Israel

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.920
one of my students said to me your actually was a soldier said you don't understand what we mean

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:42.120
by education because I said you know where did you go to school and he told me school isn't that

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.400
I said okay thank you now we'll turn to this I was interviewing he said well I didn't finish

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:51.640
my education there's two different Hebrew words for education right it's hadraha and his his

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:56.680
point was that the second word for education is what we would call development of character we

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.800
don't have a that's good enough for it and he considered and a lot of my soldiers considered a

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.800
fundamental part of their education which we don't have an American I went to public school we

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:14.600
we didn't have an American public school developing character that's it there is a character education

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:24.600
movement but okay I don't even want to get into that yeah hi I'm actually from Pakistan so I just

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:33.480
recently moved to the United States to pursue my college so I just wanted to ask something I've

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:40.600
actually seen I'm going to use the word fanaticism in the most colloquial terms that I can so I have

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:48.520
or rather radicalization but whichever I've actually seen one of my friends go through it so I was

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:56.200
just wondering isn't do you think fanaticism and nationalism is the same because we're right now

01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:04.440
a couple of days ago our government finally conducted an airstrike against the Taliban and

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:12.280
it's I think it's always been really hard for our government because for us we identify with them

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:18.360
because of religion because we have the same religion but when they start attacking our constitution

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:25.400
it becomes a nationalistic problem and since they recently did that attack our constitution

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.160
our government thought it was okay to strike against them and that's nationalism is that a good way to

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:39.000
counter what we usually call fanaticism by nationalism I mean I'm sure you people have studied more about

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.120
these things I'm just telling from my personal experience what I've seen

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:50.600
what the question is whether they should have had an airstrike is an airstrike

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:59.880
justified when you have it is it is it the same thing it's not the same thing what do you study

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:07.400
what do I say I'm a liberal arts major liberal arts major study everything come to Boston University

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:16.120
I would love to we'll talk about that it's it's not something that you can learn in three seconds

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.000
okay I mean the question is is this faction of can the action of a state be fanatical is that

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.320
kind of what you're asking yeah pretty much I don't think most people would use it that way but I

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.000
mean then you could also ask well what's the difference right why is the state doing this the

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.240
state obviously feels it has a rationalize fanaticism to if you well it's not rationalizing it's not

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:43.720
saying it's okay it's understanding why it's happening right you can still condemn it say this is wrong

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.160
but the point is it's important to understand why it's happening what are the conditions

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.000
so your friend I had obviously know nothing about your friend but what what's going on with this

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.280
person in terms of the lives when you said education she went to the same school as I did we pretty

01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:02.760
much had the same stimuli if you say to through media and everything but she turned out different

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.160
than I am and though that's why I'm not against education but I don't think education is enough

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:12.520
because this is one yeah kind of what you know so I guess the I wouldn't I understand what you

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:17.000
saying about fanatical but I the reason I don't like the word is because it just that's it fanatic

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.160
end of story they just sort of went off the deep end and there might be other things going on

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:27.880
something your mental health states can go off the deep end to your mental health helps thank you

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:38.040
I've enjoyed the discussion but my head spins with the contradictions and depending what data

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:47.400
set you draw from you come to at least the divergent the position so I'm very very taken with the

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:54.120
idea of reflective functioning and how it affects fanaticism but does it cause fanaticism or is

01:32:54.120 --> 01:33:01.720
it the other way around is there a breakdown Thomas Kohl had just wrote a book called the German

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:11.080
Generation in which he brings to it a lot of his father's legacy and he talks about this generation

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:17.160
before World War II that came out of World War I and he asked the question you know these are

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:26.440
interviews post World War II and he asked what it enabled them to do and not surprisingly given

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:36.600
his background he says well it was a loss of empathy these soldiers could not imagine being in the shoes

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:47.000
of themselves being the people they they persecuted so then what causes this loss of empathy and

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:57.880
that becomes is it a psychopathic leader a suggestion of the nationalistic entrepreneur that's there's a lot of

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:05.240
evidence for that and it was all there a kid where my mouth style and you go down the list but then

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:13.800
there's contradictory supposition at least as I read it on Timothy Snyder and Neil Ferguson talking

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:26.440
about the worst atrocities occurring in the context of a breakdown of authority I'm thinking about

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:35.320
the idea I heard this wonderful idea about 10 years ago that I I've never heard since or replicated

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:41.400
just not always heated this idea the term that I heard was actually to give credit that was a

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:49.240
professor of globalization at Yale named Arparad Arparaj I can't get his last name he used this term

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:57.560
predatory identity suggesting the kind of person who cannot tolerate the existence of another and

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:07.240
therefore had to use violence to destroy the other and I just you know I was just so taken by that idea

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:18.200
but I haven't seen much develop out of it in contrast Eddie Cohen who was a major in the IDF

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:27.880
and the mental health brigade treated Israeli soldiers and the question is was there breakdown

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:37.880
of function of seeing and identifying with the humanness of of the Palestinians there they were

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:46.200
fighting or was it the other way around so I think we have such a confluence of contradictions here

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:57.160
that I think the only way out of it is to do what what you're doing which is to stay with the data

01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:04.760
and generate more and more data sets and try to draw from it meaningful explanations and I know the

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:12.520
ones kind of my identity kind of makes me gravitate toward but and which I become passionate about

01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:19.160
but that makes me suspect them more than more thank you can I just I could just make a comment on

01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.800
yes sure I want to make it clear that you know if you look at the conflicts we've been talking

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.800
about it's not because the leaders are crazy and just doing things I'm not saying that they're

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.880
totally mentally healthy either but in all of these situations you have structural situations it's

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.120
not just one person like Milosha Vich there's a whole structure in place that's being threatened

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:41.240
by changes and my argument is a lot of the violence is used to demobilize populations that otherwise

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.960
would be mobilizing for these changes right violence is a way using violence long identity

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.480
lines the kinds of things we've been talking about is a way to stop that kind of mobilization in

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:53.720
order for them to restructure themselves to put themselves in a better situation to simplify

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:59.320
so I think unfortunately the media here does portray leaders as these crazy psychopaths and

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.760
they're doing it just because they're crazy I'm not saying that they're totally sane but there's

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.000
actually very instrumental reasons why these conflicts happen why they start them and why they

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.720
why they why they construct them that way so okay

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:24.040
hi first just a comment about benign prejudice which is not always so benign if you're the target

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:29.480
of it so I just wanted to throw that in there but that's not really my question I worked with

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:38.120
veterans here a lot and I talked to them daily and I asked them a lot about what they do what

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:44.760
and I've also learned from working with veterans and reading about it um apparently during World War

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:52.040
One and World War Two when they interviewed soldiers returning they found that only 20

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:58.280
actually shot to try to kill someone I mean that's incredible if that's true but I got this through

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:05.880
some military so around the time of Vietnam they decided we had to do something about this so in

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:11.000
fact the military is very ahead of a lot of us in terms of the science they're looking at they

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:18.520
decided they had to change this so they changed the way they trained our military to dehumanize

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:26.120
objectify the enemy and in fact calling them the enemy and now we're at the point where 80% of

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:33.880
the soldiers will shoot to kill that's big change but also what I was surprised didn't come up I

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:42.120
never heard in all this discussion the word patriotism and uh as a New Yorker and also working with

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:52.440
veterans um I wonder if patriotism is just nationalism that we believe in or convince people because

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:58.840
that's a lot of what a lot of people signed up for military is having more trouble now because now

01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:04.520
that they don't have 9-11 to manipulate it's harder to get but they've learned a lot of other things

01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.120
like that in poor neighborhoods where connections and brotherhood is missing they will go in and

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:18.680
the how they they recruit by which is most likely to get the person to sign up so in poor neighborhoods

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:24.440
they go in and say we will take care of you will be a good parent for you and other places they

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:30.520
might say we're going to give you a job you know or in some other parts of the country they might

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:37.880
say you really have to do this for you know patriotism or whatever but I just wondered your

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:45.720
thoughts about patriotism that's basically my question thank you anybody this is the way

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:53.960
um the word is used in the nationalism which is ours is patriotism nationalism of the others

01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:02.040
patriotism of the others is nationalism right this is how it is it's a it's an everyday

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:07.560
understanding of the term nationalism so as academics we're studying a political phenomenon

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:12.120
and the term patriotism pride in being a citizen of a state is something very different it's a

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.880
sentiment or a feeling or it's just a different it's a it's a different thing a different category

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.400
of thing or you could say patriotism is a part of nationalism but nationalism in an academic

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:30.440
sense or kind of what what we're talking about is is a more of a first of all either an ideology

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:36.200
that there is a nation and that it deserves to have its own state or its political action and

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:42.200
mass behavior toward fulfilling that that ideology so it's not that we're making a um

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:48.280
patriotism is part is not I mean sort of that connection to a state and some states are defined

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:54.200
in particular ethno linguistic ways right is really stupid nationalism and what if you're an

01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:04.200
Israeli what the Palestinians do is tell like the rest of the

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:09.720
world is bad and nationalism you know that because we are judging nationalism sometimes to be bad

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:15.880
that we would say patriotism is bad it's a distinction between pride and being a citizen of state

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.160
although the Russian Patriots I'm sorry they're nationalists right

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.720
Patriots okay question to pose not to be answered just to ask because we as though

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:30.760
the leora and chit one of the one of the findings out of the janowitz in battleheim study was that

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:38.120
that 14% group that had severe prejudice um they spontaneously mentioned and later on they

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.600
interviewed them more systematically many of them these are all men of course many of them

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:48.440
reported severe physical abuse by their father in childhood and they didn't find that in the

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:55.640
remaining group so my my question is have other people looked at that systematically

01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:03.960
since then this is a study back in the 40s and 50s see please I don't see these are

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:10.280
yeah that's not my that's not my work the work that I do is why people don't do those kinds of

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:16.040
acts and in a lot of it is familiar like your family has had those values and you would have

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:22.760
done the saving you know active saving because your family's done it religious reasons it's not

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:28.440
you know as base as you know because you've been beaten up or stuff like that but but it's also

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:36.440
it really is you know there's several reasons you're a risk taker you're morally religious

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.920
like there's a great example of a in the holocaust of a nun he was completely anti-semitic I don't

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.760
know if you know this story hated hated hated Jews but because she was so religious she saved many

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:54.600
many people many Jewish people because it was against her religion and so I mean that's a really

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.960
good case of showing how you could be prejudiced but sort of overcome it for religious reasons

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:08.600
and you know the other reasons so the risk takers moral religious and you know families have done

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:15.160
those kind you know examples of you know positive post-social behaviors so I don't know about that

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.840
at all you might be willing to answer it I mean that's much as rescuers but people who refuse to

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.680
go along I haven't actually I'm not really aware of any studies like that on the interesting

01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:28.120
other side you know 14 percent of the guys who were some the most religious right I ready to act

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:31.960
on it yeah I don't I don't know any studies that go into that depth about their personal

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.360
background yeah okay thank you very much

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:43.160
I was wondering if I should make the point that I feel that we didn't discuss the first

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:50.360
unit that we are exposed to which is our family unit and if your parents are to teach you compassion

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.640
and cooperation and a healthy self-esteem that you may be much less likely to get swept away with

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:04.680
fanaticism and behaviors that can hurt other people in future that's what that's our first unit yeah I

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:10.680
mean that is actually I mean that's actually true I mean one of the rescuers that I interviewed was

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.560
an Italian guy who had saved some children and he never ever told his family because his his brother

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.720
was in a prisoner of war and he would have been able to get him out and he was 92 when we interviewed

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:30.920
him he just the children found him finally through Yod Bisham and when he talked about it he said

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.600
after we did the interview actually he said you know I have to tell you this that I never told

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:45.160
anyone in my family but I found out recently that my sister saved our Jewish dentist so it was

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:52.120
definitely there was many many examples of people saving because their family had positive role

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:58.520
models and that is really what you would teach you would teach about positive role models and

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:04.600
you know that you can do this behavior without looking at the really horrible horrific kind of

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:10.680
behavior I think and that's pretty you know easy to teach it's not easy but that's what we teach

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:20.520
one of the things that I was wondering was do you think that there is a physiological neurological

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:28.520
propensity that we can be born with and I'm not seeing nature versus nurture type of thing but

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:36.840
based on Phillips and Bartos Stanford Prison Experiment and how he assigned they just neutral just you

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:43.880
know took kids from the campus and put them in a situation that signed certain ones to be guards

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:52.520
and certain ones to be prisoners and some of the guards became fanatical in the very worst worst

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:56.600
sense and they weren't given any more prodding they weren't given any more

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:06.680
incentive than anybody else but they got much more swept up into it and I'm just wondering if I mean

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:13.480
it is an identity it's an identity with being a guard and and that's you know same thing as a

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:19.880
nationalism or it's what they identified with zealously so I was wondering do you think that there is

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:25.000
beside the things that you were talking about which are very interesting factors and motivators

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:32.600
do you think that there is something maybe genetic something neurological that would

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:41.880
make one person more prone to hop on that bandwagon or to be more malleable to that

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.680
that would be my question the other just not a question but I think that you're giving fanaticism

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:53.560
that word just the word a very bad rap because when you think of Nelson Mandela he was a fanatic

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:59.640
he want I think that's just my opinion and I don't think

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:05.320
Leo says he's a fanatic teacher so I don't think I mean but you said that mental illness and you

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:12.280
know all that and I just wanted to say I can think of I mean back to Galileo you know heliocentric

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:19.800
and universe he was a fanatic about that so I think that there can be good it's not an oxymoron

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:24.360
I think you could have a good fanatic but anyway my question just was do you think that there is

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:30.840
something that we can be born with to be hardwired to become fanatical it's my question you are the

01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:38.440
MD really this is too complex a question except a simple answer okay interesting things about

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:45.000
humans usually aren't explained by a single gene and a slap upside the head of a kid is very

01:47:45.000 --> 01:48:02.760
persuasive whatever their genetic background thank you
