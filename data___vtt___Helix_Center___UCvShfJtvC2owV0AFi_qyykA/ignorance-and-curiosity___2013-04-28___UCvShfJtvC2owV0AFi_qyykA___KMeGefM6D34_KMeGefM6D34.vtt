WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
There's ASEAN Director of the Centre, welcome to today's programme on ignorance and curiosity.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.840
Before we get going, I'd like to make a couple of announcements.

00:09.840 --> 00:18.000
On May 11th, the programme is going to be on synthetic and systemic biology, which has to do.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.600
You can't hear me?

00:21.600 --> 00:28.600
I'll try it this way.

00:28.600 --> 00:41.600
On May 11th, the programme is going to be on systemic and synthetic biology, which has to do with genes and disease and all sorts of other interesting things.

00:41.600 --> 01:01.600
On June 8th, we have a programme on altruism and empathy. In October, we'll have something in September, but in October, we have a weekend programme in collaboration with the Agalmo Foundation of Geneva.

01:01.600 --> 01:08.600
It's going to be called on art, psychoanalysis and neuroscience or science in general.

01:08.600 --> 01:18.600
It's going to take off from some of the ideas of the well-known cultural historian, Abby Warburg.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.600
That programme will involve probably three to four round tables and a wrap-up.

01:24.600 --> 01:31.600
And the night before it, there will be a rock concert by the neuroscientist Joel Lidou.

01:31.600 --> 01:41.600
Joel Lidou is also going to do a programme here on May 16th, which is a Saturday evening.

01:41.600 --> 01:48.600
Again, it will be a musical programme interspersed with talk on neuroscience.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.600
I think that covers it.

01:51.600 --> 02:02.600
Tonight, today's, I'm going to do a very brief introduction of the participants today, who all have very long resumes, as you can imagine.

02:02.600 --> 02:07.600
And I will start with Heather Berlin, who is sitting right there.

02:07.600 --> 02:14.600
She's a cognitive neuroscientist and assistant professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Mount Sinai.

02:14.600 --> 02:28.600
She works on the complex interactions of the human brain and mind and is interested also in the neural basis of consciousness and dynamic unconscious processes.

02:28.600 --> 02:38.600
Susan Engel, who is sitting there, is a senior lecturer in psychology and founding director of the programme in teaching at Williams College.

02:38.600 --> 02:48.600
Her research includes children's narratives, play the development of curiosity, and more generally teaching and learning.

02:48.600 --> 02:59.600
Stuart Fierstein, who is sitting right here, is the chair of Columbia University's department of biological sciences, where he studies the vertebral factory system.

02:59.600 --> 03:07.600
He has a book out called Curiosity and... No, what am I saying? It's the other one.

03:07.600 --> 03:19.600
It's on ignorance and how ignorance drives science, which is connected toward organising, thinking about and organising today's round table.

03:19.600 --> 03:27.600
Paul Harris is a developmental psychologist with interest in the development of cognition, emotion and imagination.

03:27.600 --> 03:42.600
He's held a number of positions at various universities from Amsterdam to London to Oxford, and he's currently the Victor S Thomas Professor of Education at Harvard University.

03:42.600 --> 03:53.600
And Alan Hirschfield, who is sitting there, is a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and an associate of the Harvard College Observatory.

03:53.600 --> 04:04.600
There are books from the participants that are out there, and I'm sure they will sign it for you at the end of today's meeting if you decide to purchase them.

04:04.600 --> 04:10.600
So with that, we will start today's round table. Thank you.

04:10.600 --> 04:23.600
Well, all right, I'm going to just kick it off quickly because I have a current event to kick it off if that's all right, Ed.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.600
So I'm an inventor of obituary reader.

04:27.600 --> 04:34.600
I love biographies, but I don't think I have the time to read biographies, so I read the abstracts, which...

04:34.600 --> 04:49.600
In any case, yesterday morning, I opened the paper to find that the notice of the passing of Francois Jacobe, famous French geneticist, who discovered regulatory genes.

04:49.600 --> 05:08.600
He was the one who understood for the first time that there's two kinds of genes, two kinds of gene products, one is the one product of genes that the stuff were made of, and the other kind of product or proteins that go on to regulate other genes to turn them on or turn them off, and thus making a liver cell, a liver cell, and a heart cell, a heart cell.

05:08.600 --> 05:24.600
So anyway, he and his collaborator, Jacques Monot, won the Nobel Prize for this work and so forth. Anyway, he passed away last week, actually, but the notice was in the Times yesterday, and our proposal of ignorance, and the way I think science works based on ignorance

05:24.600 --> 05:38.600
even more than knowledge, is this quote from Jacques Cope that he wrote, I believe in his book, I'm not quite sure what's wrong, I think it's from his book, Possibility, the Actual and the Possible.

05:38.600 --> 05:44.600
This is what he said, what mattered more than the answers were the questions and how they were formulated.

05:44.600 --> 05:55.600
For in the best of cases, the answer led to more questions. It was a system for concocting expectation, a machine for making the future, I think that's a fabulous phrase, by the way.

05:55.600 --> 06:08.600
For me, this world of questions and the provisional, this chase after an answer that was always put off to the next day, all that was euphoric. I lived in the future.

06:08.600 --> 06:30.600
That's a good way to live. So I think that's interesting, this idea that somebody, you know, John Keats in a famous letter to his brother, to his brother, 100 years or so ago, whenever Keats lived, concocted this idea of negative capability, this idea of living among

06:30.600 --> 06:48.600
mysteries and obscurities and questions without being too irritable about it, without driving you crazy, but really being a way to be comfortable with ignorance, to be comfortable with the unknown, to be comfortable with uncertainty, which I would say is where all the good ideas come from.

06:48.600 --> 07:03.600
I mean, that's where the frontier is. It's what we agree on is not so important. It's what we disagree on. What we agree on just goes, you know, nobody talks about that. So we only just talk about what we disagree on, and that's where the interesting stuff is. It seems to me.

07:03.600 --> 07:12.600
I mean, I think we would all agree that that's so an interesting case. I'll ask you the business actually. An interesting case is the Higgs boson, right?

07:12.600 --> 07:27.600
Discovery of the Higgs boson, which everybody's thrilled about, but there are a lot of physicists that think of Stephen Weinberg in particular as this interesting quote saying, well, it's great that we discover this thing, and it's everything we'd hoped it would be, but actually it's not giving us any new ideas.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.600
And there's a certain kind of worry in the community. There's more anxiety over knowledge than there is over ignorance, it seems.

07:32.600 --> 07:46.600
Yeah, anxiety, perhaps excitement. I mean, to answer the question, well, even a long posed question is often quite a letdown unless it leads to further questions.

07:46.600 --> 07:57.600
So in physics, in my field of astronomy, that is the regular way of occurrence. I've looked into the history of astronomy since the time of the ancient Greeks.

07:57.600 --> 08:09.600
And, of course, in retrospect, the ignorance just stands out so clearly, and yet at the time it wasn't seen.

08:09.600 --> 08:26.600
So I think scientists like Weinberg, like all scientists today, and like all explorers of nature ever since, at least the time of the ancient Greeks were quite comfortable with the idea that there is going to be a lot of science.

08:26.600 --> 08:44.600
There is going to be a lot of failure along the way, and that what appears to be certain in terms of our conceptions about the universe can be overthrown and have been overthrown on regular occasions.

08:44.600 --> 09:10.600
So I don't know if this particularly answers your question, but I've always found this consistent, long-running record of failure in science to be the most inspiring aspect of what scientists do, that we're not just looking at individuals, but globally, the entire field of science.

09:10.600 --> 09:25.600
Much of it is lack of success until there is an advanced discovery, and what we tend to get from the textbooks are the successes.

09:25.600 --> 09:35.600
All of the failures, all of the hard work by the anonymous people, for every one Einstein, there are a thousand others whose names we've done.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.600
There are a thousand Einstein's dining in failures too. Einstein failed regularly.

09:40.600 --> 09:45.600
Right, and in a big way at the end of his career.

09:45.600 --> 10:04.600
So I like thinking about the global aspect of ignorance, curiosity, scientific study, and how as a species, we accept that science is a risky venture, and you're not always going to make it.

10:04.600 --> 10:12.600
You're not always going to make it to an answer in your generation, or the next generation, or even in centuries.

10:12.600 --> 10:27.600
So I think we're sort of at that point in terms of Higgs boson and dark energy and all these mysterious entities and force fields that we apply labels to, but that's temporary.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.600
We don't really know what they are, what they will be.

10:30.600 --> 10:39.600
But the thing in science is that revision is a victory. It's one of the few places where revision is a victory, not some ole, but to spin this another way now.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.600
But I think the way that scientists think is more the, it's an exception to the norm.

10:44.600 --> 10:57.600
I mean, the brain doesn't like ambiguity, and it tends to want to fill these gaps, and there's also sort of psychological studies that show that, you know, there's a missing part of a shape and the mind will fill it in.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.600
And that's closure, and there's a sense of satisfaction when there is an answer.

11:01.600 --> 11:11.600
So the brain will take ambiguous situations and create one solid percept, and that's the way it likes to function, and most people want answers to questions.

11:11.600 --> 11:26.600
So I think the way that a scientist's mind works, that it's driven by what's unanswerable, and that's what keeps it going, is quite unique, actually, because most people that causes a great deal of anxiety, particularly people on the more anxious side of the system,

11:26.600 --> 11:35.600
or more anxious side of the spectrum, you know, I work with patients with OCD, it's a compulsive disorder, and they want answers, and if they don't have closure, it can be very frustrating.

11:35.600 --> 11:43.600
So I think that this drive for the unknown is a unique characteristic, and it's not in everybody.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.600
I'm not sure I agree.

11:45.600 --> 11:55.600
So, I mean, the discussion so far is focused on science and the extent to which it's special, but if you look at young children, they ask thousands of questions.

11:55.600 --> 12:03.600
I don't see them driven to neurotic anxiety by the fact that sometimes they don't get a full answer.

12:03.600 --> 12:16.600
So I would go even further back and say, actually, that science has to be humble and see itself as part of a much broader human capacity, actually, to ask questions, both of ourselves and of one another.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.600
This is not something you see in other species.

12:19.600 --> 12:35.600
But if you notice that I think it has to do with brain development as well, a lot of what closes us off to things like being more creative and spontaneous is activation of certain prefrontal cortex areas that the older you get, the more developed the prefrontal cortex is,

12:35.600 --> 12:48.600
and it tells you kind of quiets down that inquisitive sort of person that wants to go out and explore the childlike person because you get these rules based on society, like, no, that's not acceptable, or that's irrational.

12:48.600 --> 12:58.600
Now we know that during certain states like daydreaming or in certain states of hypnosis, or even during REM sleep and dream, those parts of the prefrontal cortex are deactivated.

12:58.600 --> 13:12.600
They're quieted down and it allows for this more creative, spontaneous mind to take over, which is more of a childlike mind because the prefrontal cortex isn't fully developed until about the age of 25, and that's when people start becoming more and more closed off, I think.

13:12.600 --> 13:24.600
I would put it a little differently because I would suggest that it's not only is there not a strong, an absolute distinction between scientists and everybody else.

13:24.600 --> 13:34.600
After all, that's an institutional sort of construction with all kinds of practices that have been built up and praised and rewarded, and so it's got all kinds of other things going on.

13:34.600 --> 13:51.600
But even within non-scientists, there's a continuum. So while I agree that almost all children, almost all, are incredibly inquisitive, it's a slow and complicated process by which some people become less inquisitive and other people do not.

13:51.600 --> 14:03.600
You don't have to be a scientist to be a curious grown up, and the process by which that happens, I think there are a lot of forces that are at work in sort of winnowing down what seems to be a problem.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.600
What seems pervasive and robust in infancy and early travel?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
I think you're absolutely right.

14:09.600 --> 14:23.600
There are some paradoxical things, and I would like to just say this because I think it touches on your ideas about ignorance, that the kind of ignorance you are talking about is an ignorance that comes from having a lot of knowledge.

14:23.600 --> 14:30.600
In other words, you first learned a lot, now you sit back as a big professor and say, you know, it's great to be ignorant.

14:30.600 --> 14:39.600
But the fact is, so there is an issue there in the sense that the child doesn't have much knowledge.

14:39.600 --> 14:46.600
So for a child to be curious, it's easy. For us to be curious is harder.

14:46.600 --> 14:56.600
And then it takes even further than that a certain development, before we can say, well, I'm so curious that now I've decided from my curiosity that I'm in fact ignorant.

14:56.600 --> 15:04.600
So, yes, I think you're right. Clearly you read my book, thank you.

15:04.600 --> 15:13.600
And it's certainly true that scientists don't have the corner on ignorance, as well they shouldn't.

15:13.600 --> 15:25.600
I mean, there's a little bit of a worry actually that maybe ignorance too easily belongs to sort of the elite scientist, the person who has the degree, who has the knowledge, now gets to claim that they can have ignorance,

15:25.600 --> 15:38.600
which should not be the case. So the worry is that only I think what Heather said is it in science versus in this kind of science versus the rest of the public, you see the more relief than you do anywhere else.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.600
But there really is a continuum.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.600
So I'm ashamed to say I haven't read your book yet. Oh, I just bought it.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
You bought it?

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
Give me a pick.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.600
That's not mixed too.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.600
Now you're not my fault.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
It's rich now.

15:51.600 --> 15:59.600
But I'm curious about the term ignorance because I think of it a little differently and maybe I'm wrong.

15:59.600 --> 16:10.600
Because most people are ignorant actually, if you look, not people in the wrong God knows, but in general, most people aren't even uncomfortable with their ignorance.

16:10.600 --> 16:18.600
So to me, one of the issues is who is motivated by their lack of knowledge, by their relative lack of knowledge.

16:18.600 --> 16:30.600
I wanted to say that just as a sort of caveat, it's not that only scientists are motivated by curiosity, but I think certain personality types are driven by wanting to understand more.

16:30.600 --> 16:39.600
And those types of people will probably be drawn to fields like science and going to experimental kinds of careers because of that drive.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
But I think it has to do with also personality.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.600
But it could be historians.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.600
Yeah, or lawyers.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.600
Yeah, I agree.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.600
Academics.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
People who are curious.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.600
But not everybody has that drive.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.600
I've spoke to people and said, what keeps you going?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
Why do you keep going after this?

16:53.600 --> 16:55.600
It doesn't pay a lot.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
But there's some intrinsic drive that wants to understand more.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.600
So there might be personality differences as well.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
Yeah, I know.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
I'm going to follow up on that.

17:04.600 --> 17:10.600
Yeah, there's whether it's history, science, the arts.

17:10.600 --> 17:18.600
There is a certain pleasure in the doing, in the action of whatever endeavor it is.

17:18.600 --> 17:28.600
Without so much attention paid to the ultimate goal, of course, many scientists want to achieve a discovery.

17:28.600 --> 17:39.600
But in my historical research of astronomers in the 1800s, many of them are pursuing merely fine, fine measurement with no hope.

17:39.600 --> 17:46.600
No hope whatsoever ever discovering another planet or what galaxies are or anything of that sort.

17:46.600 --> 17:59.600
But when you read of their work, tedious, tedious work freezing themselves outside in the north of England in the middle of winter.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.600
It's very cold there, right?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.600
It's very cold.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.600
It's very damp.

18:02.600 --> 18:16.600
And the joy, the joy that they express in their notes at just adding a decimal point to some arbitrary seeming number, which decades later may turn out to be quite crucial.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.600
So you're just going to be the pain in the neck.

18:21.600 --> 18:31.600
Because there are also plenty of scientists who aren't that curious and who are motivated by a wish for success or another publication or they get stuck just trying to prove that they're right.

18:31.600 --> 18:45.600
So I think to the extent that science or scholarly pursuits celebrates and rewards curiosity and institutionalizes it, that's interesting and significant.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.600
And maybe there's a higher proportion of curious people in academia.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
Certainly life is made up of practices.

18:52.600 --> 19:05.600
So if you're in an environment where you're rewarded for your curiosity and you practice it regularly, it gets stronger or gets more robust.

19:05.600 --> 19:17.600
But I would say that while there may be a greater proportion of curious people in academia, there are plenty of really curious people who are not in academia and who express it in all kinds of non-scholarly ways.

19:17.600 --> 19:22.600
And like I said, there are plenty of people in academia who are not all that curious.

19:22.600 --> 19:28.600
So I would just be nervous about us elevating academia unwarrantedly.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.600
Well, the people I'm talking about are not academics.

19:31.600 --> 19:38.600
They're backyard amateur astronomers who, of course, happen to be independently wealthy, so they can pursue these.

19:38.600 --> 19:46.600
Well, but you can take somebody like, I kind of agree with you in this area that sometimes that's the way science goes.

19:46.600 --> 19:57.600
So I mean, Kepler, a famous astronomer from many years ago, spent what, like eight years or six years fighting with eight minutes of arc in the sky, which is about a quarter of your thumbnail when you hold it out.

19:57.600 --> 20:03.600
But Newton's, well, the Copernican predictions were off by about eight minutes of arc.

20:03.600 --> 20:11.600
And Kepler just wouldn't let it go, and that's because everybody was involved in circular orbits, the tyranny of Plato's circle or whatever.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
And Kepler showed that they were elliptical.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.600
The only way you could explain it was that orbits were elliptical.

20:16.600 --> 20:21.600
That not happened, it's not clear that Newton would have figured out the laws of force and so forth.

20:21.600 --> 20:29.600
So, but Kepler was just happy to keep fighting with these six little minutes of arc over eight years or eight minutes of arc for six years.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.600
I forget which it was, I get them confused.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.600
But so that often happens.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.600
So I have a question, maybe sort of for the two of you, because you're both in education.

20:37.600 --> 20:49.600
Don't you think to some extent this notion of curiosity and this idea that Heather has also that that the eventually the frontal cortex kind of takes over and maybe dampens it a bit?

20:49.600 --> 20:53.600
Is this reflected in a terrible way in the way we educate kids?

20:53.600 --> 20:59.600
I mean, in the second grade, all the kids are interested in science or something like it, something akin to it.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.600
They're all curious.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.600
They're all inquisitive. They like to screw around with things.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.600
They like to see what happens and kind of blotion up or whatever and all that stuff.

21:06.600 --> 21:13.600
But by eleventh grade, we pretty much drained all the interest in science and things like that right out of them.

21:13.600 --> 21:19.600
We have this amazingly efficient educational system for draining all the interest in curiosity,

21:19.600 --> 21:26.600
and presitiveness, and science out of them in favor of what a colleague of mine calls the balemic method of education,

21:26.600 --> 21:31.600
which is to jam a whole bunch of facts down there throughout here, and I'll let them puke it up on an exam over here.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
Then everybody goes home with no appreciable gain, right?

21:34.600 --> 21:38.600
So this is a terrific question, and Susan is writing a book about the answer.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.600
What's your answer?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.600
Yes, it's turning to you.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.600
Oh, right. Well, I am still in the middle of writing the book, so I don't have the answer.

21:48.600 --> 21:56.600
But I do think that our educational system works against curiosity.

21:56.600 --> 22:02.600
I think one interesting question is why some kids remain curious in spite of school.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.600
It's sad that that's the way you'd have to phrase it, and I have some thoughts.

22:06.600 --> 22:13.600
I mean, look, there are a lot of reasons why schools sort of push against discouraged curiosity,

22:13.600 --> 22:18.600
and some are almost inevitable, and others are not.

22:18.600 --> 22:23.600
I mean, I don't want to take up too much time, but there are some ways in which just being in a group

22:23.600 --> 22:30.600
and learning things that everybody thinks you should learn pushes against being able to pursue an interest you

22:30.600 --> 22:36.600
and spend hours fiddling around with something or stay with one line of inquiry,

22:36.600 --> 22:44.600
and it goes back to your original sort of the way you framed it, which is that in general school rewards what you know,

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
not what you don't know.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.600
And that's not terrible. It's just complicated.

22:49.600 --> 22:55.600
I mean, we do want people to know things, and as you said, it's very different to be to embrace some amount of ignorance

22:55.600 --> 23:03.600
when you know a lot and you want to know more than to embrace ignorance and just not want to know anything more.

23:03.600 --> 23:08.600
And so we want to encourage people to know things, and schools push people to know things,

23:08.600 --> 23:16.600
and the trick is how to push for that and still encourage or nurture a sense of inquiry.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.600
And I do have thoughts about that, but that's another question.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
What's the trick?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
It's not a trick.

23:23.600 --> 23:30.600
It would require a big rethinking about what schools do and how they're structured.

23:30.600 --> 23:37.600
So let me throw an example at that because I teach introductory astronomy to non-science students,

23:37.600 --> 23:41.600
have been doing that for 35 years.

23:41.600 --> 23:47.600
About first 28 of those, I did it in the way that everybody has always done it,

23:47.600 --> 23:56.600
and it was extremely, extremely boring for me, for the students, and tests indicated nobody learned anything.

23:56.600 --> 24:05.600
But this was... This was... This was the... I'm very slow thinker, but I eventually did realize that

24:05.600 --> 24:10.600
I was not in any way enabling their curiosity.

24:10.600 --> 24:17.600
If we consider that every child has an innate curiosity up to a certain age,

24:17.600 --> 24:26.600
I would see these college students just appear to have no interest in what was going on

24:26.600 --> 24:29.600
other than what is going to be on the test.

24:29.600 --> 24:39.600
So I changed the entire course out of desperation because I couldn't go on with the lie.

24:39.600 --> 24:49.600
So what the students are doing now is they are essentially recreating, at least in a symbolic sense,

24:49.600 --> 24:59.600
all of the astronomical advances that have been made since the time of the ancient Greeks up to the discovery of the expanding universe.

24:59.600 --> 25:04.600
They work in groups. The entire class is working together.

25:04.600 --> 25:12.600
It is somewhat mathematical, which freaks out quite a number of the students,

25:12.600 --> 25:23.600
and I get a lot of opposition in the beginning, but after a while, after they see that their entire social circle in that classroom

25:23.600 --> 25:26.600
is doing the same thing and struggling together.

25:26.600 --> 25:35.600
After they get a bit more familiar with the mathematics and they see that I'm not throwing calculus at them or anything like that,

25:35.600 --> 25:39.600
I sort of see that spark of curiosity coming back.

25:39.600 --> 25:46.600
They ask questions of me, of the teaching assistant, to try and get to the answer.

25:46.600 --> 25:53.600
And what happened to them in the interim before I got them?

25:53.600 --> 25:57.600
I don't know. I'll tell you a story that I'll explain it.

25:57.600 --> 26:04.600
So I was in a fourth grade science class from watching a group of kids do a very cool hands-on activity,

26:04.600 --> 26:13.600
and they had to do with sort of inventing for themselves or seeing how Egyptians had invented wheels,

26:13.600 --> 26:18.600
and they had ramps, and they had wheels, and they had a little string, and they had a worksheet.

26:18.600 --> 26:24.600
And they were supposed to come upon this great discovery in the same way that the Egyptians had,

26:24.600 --> 26:27.600
and they were supposed to sort of answer some questions on the worksheet.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.600
And they were working in groups, so everything looked good.

26:30.600 --> 26:38.600
You know, hands-on, lively groups, and one group got distracted by trying some things that were not on the worksheet with the equipment,

26:38.600 --> 26:43.600
and they started to hang in the bar up and down and swing ahead and try stacking things,

26:43.600 --> 26:51.600
and the teacher came over and saw them getting sort of off topic, and she said, kids, kids.

26:51.600 --> 26:55.600
I'll give you time to experiment at recess. This is time for science.

26:55.600 --> 27:01.600
She was a really nice teacher, and they were having a great time.

27:01.600 --> 27:06.600
But what they weren't doing was that she saw that as a waste of time instead of thinking,

27:06.600 --> 27:11.600
how can I teach these kids to ask a series of good questions, and then pursue the answer?

27:11.600 --> 27:14.600
But it's not enough. You see, the motivation just sort of drain away.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.600
Well, it's not just motivation. School has to add something.

27:18.600 --> 27:23.600
And what it can add is teaching kids how to, I think, I don't know what you think about this,

27:23.600 --> 27:27.600
how to ask questions in a slightly different way than they would have on their own.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
Well, I'm still up to teaching them.

27:29.600 --> 27:34.600
Well, I was wanting to pursue Alan's curriculum a little bit more,

27:34.600 --> 27:39.600
so is it the case that you would sometimes present them with the history of the subject,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.600
and they rediscover it?

27:42.600 --> 27:47.600
And to what extent is it that they struggle to make certain observations

27:47.600 --> 27:49.600
that were previously made and were difficult to make?

27:49.600 --> 27:54.600
And to what extent is it that you also, in addition, once they've arrived at a certain point,

27:54.600 --> 27:58.600
invite them to say, what is the next question?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.600
Because that seems to me, what is the next question?

28:01.600 --> 28:04.600
Seems to be a much more delicate, pedagogic art.

28:04.600 --> 28:09.600
To nurture a student's ability to pose the next question in light of what they've established,

28:09.600 --> 28:13.600
is something which I think schools don't do very successfully.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.600
I mean, to be fair to teachers, that few of them are research scientists.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.600
I think also an important point is to just keep in mind that it's not a one-size-fits-all,

28:22.600 --> 28:26.600
so there are many individual differences, and I think different learning,

28:26.600 --> 28:31.600
different training styles are going to be better for different types of people.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.600
And I think we're all born into this world.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.600
We don't know how we got here or why we're here,

28:36.600 --> 28:40.600
and people are very curious in the beginning and ask lots of questions.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.600
And then you go through the educational system, and a lot of that is being out of you,

28:43.600 --> 28:46.600
so you're taught to learn things by rote memory and regurgitate it.

28:46.600 --> 28:50.600
But some people maintain that curiosity throughout, and it continues,

28:50.600 --> 28:54.600
and it can be reinvigorated by things like what you're doing.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
But not everybody does.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.600
Not everybody continues to ask questions.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.600
I know for me, I was educated in the American system here,

29:01.600 --> 29:04.600
and it was a lot of the memorization and just do well in the exams.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.600
And then when I went to graduate school at Oxford, where you spent a lot of time,

29:07.600 --> 29:10.600
it was a whole nother system.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
And for me, it was so refreshing.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.600
They gave us all this freedom. There was no exams.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.600
And it was, you were allowed to just go wherever your curiosity took you.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.600
And for me, I really thrived.

29:19.600 --> 29:25.600
But I had other colleagues of mine, they really struggled in that system

29:25.600 --> 29:27.600
because they didn't know how to navigate it.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.600
And I'm sure you've been there for many years.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.600
People who spend years and years and years doing their PhD

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
because they have no structure and they need the structure.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.600
So I think that kind of open system, where you're free to ask questions,

29:37.600 --> 29:41.600
it works for some types of minds, but not all of them.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.600
And it's important to keep that in mind.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.600
Not everybody is going to thrive in the same kind of structure.

29:46.600 --> 29:51.600
Yeah, I guess I would say, in addition to our wanting to emphasize the fact that

29:51.600 --> 29:56.600
you have to maintain curiosity as a motivational factor.

29:56.600 --> 30:01.600
Beyond the motivational factor, I do think there's an intellectual art

30:01.600 --> 30:04.600
in framing the next question.

30:04.600 --> 30:09.600
And of course, the next question is framed in the light of actually very often,

30:09.600 --> 30:13.600
not ignorance, but a deep knowledge of where the subject is at,

30:13.600 --> 30:17.600
and what would be tractable next.

30:17.600 --> 30:23.600
And I mean, I guess I would venture to say that some of us, I'm sure,

30:23.600 --> 30:26.600
do that, try to do that as advisors of doctoral students.

30:26.600 --> 30:32.600
But I think it would be nice if we sometimes did it as teachers of 11 year olds

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
or teachers of four year olds.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.600
So I guess I see something of a blend here, perhaps,

30:37.600 --> 30:42.600
because I don't think you can get to having students sophisticated enough

30:42.600 --> 30:45.600
to ask the next question, to think to the next question,

30:45.600 --> 30:48.600
simply by laying out, here's a so-and-so facts.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.600
Now, you know these facts.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.600
You should be able to figure out the next question.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.600
Because in point, in fact, many great scientists have it.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.600
I mean, there's no reason whatsoever by Darwin could not have figured out the gene.

30:59.600 --> 31:04.600
He had all the knowledge that was needed to figure out the gene and never did it.

31:04.600 --> 31:10.600
I mean, he did something pretty good, but he was never able to get to that next step.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.600
The gene was just never, somehow or another, available to his intellect,

31:14.600 --> 31:16.600
or his particular line of questioning.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.600
What I do think you can do though...

31:17.600 --> 31:20.600
Would you say that he didn't actually pose the question?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
Oh, no, he did. He did pose the question.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.600
So it does, as he was asking the right question.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.600
Well, he's asking the wrong question, as it turned out, or pursuing sort of...

31:27.600 --> 31:28.600
The wrong...

31:28.600 --> 31:31.600
Yes. And I mean, maybe there was no shortcut, and maybe it was just an

31:31.600 --> 31:34.600
unconscionable hypothesis for him.

31:34.600 --> 31:38.600
But I think that the way you can maybe train this is, to in fact,

31:38.600 --> 31:43.600
I always like to say recreate the ignorance of a particular moment of discovery.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.600
I mean, one of the great tragedies in science, and seems to be for scientists,

31:46.600 --> 31:50.600
since these days, is that the bigger the discovery you make,

31:50.600 --> 31:53.600
the more quickly it just becomes part of the mainstream.

31:53.600 --> 31:57.600
It's forgotten, it's been some big deal discovery, you know,

31:57.600 --> 31:59.600
because that's what we do in making an animation.

31:59.600 --> 32:04.600
But if you can go back to that kind of moment of ignorance before the discovery was made,

32:04.600 --> 32:08.600
then I think you develop in students not only the knowledge,

32:08.600 --> 32:09.600
now they're going to get this knowledge.

32:09.600 --> 32:14.600
So, I mean, there's Galileo's formula for acceleration, gravity, and all that.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
It has a time thing, and it's one of my favorite examples.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.600
It has a unit of time, and a time squared, in fact, right?

32:20.600 --> 32:24.600
So you can say this is in giving the equation, and you can tell them about the balls dropping

32:24.600 --> 32:27.600
and the inclined planes, if you can keep them awake that long, right?

32:27.600 --> 32:29.600
Or you can say, well, here's the thing, though.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.600
Galileo didn't have a watch, or a timer.

32:32.600 --> 32:36.600
The best he could do was a sundial, the best he could do was an hour,

32:36.600 --> 32:38.600
but it takes the big balls an hour to drop, you know.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.600
So how did he time that out?

32:40.600 --> 32:45.600
Now you can begin to see students think about how you would solve a problem at a level,

32:45.600 --> 32:49.600
and I think if you get them to solve those problems coming up then,

32:49.600 --> 32:53.600
first of all, they'll remember the equation, and secondly, they'll begin to develop a sense

32:53.600 --> 32:58.600
that you find things out by solving problems, you find things out by asking questions,

32:58.600 --> 33:01.600
and then you get more knowledge, you ask more questions naturally.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
Just as a matter of curiosity.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.600
Yeah, because this is the process.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.600
I have a question for you.

33:07.600 --> 33:13.600
So is it the case that Galileo solves the measurement problem by transposing it

33:13.600 --> 33:16.600
from a vertical drop to an inclined plane, or is that a mischievous?

33:16.600 --> 33:17.600
That was two ways.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.600
One was he used as pulse as a timer.

33:19.600 --> 33:23.600
He realized he could use as pulse, and then a pendulum swing as well.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.600
But finally, even that wasn't fast enough, and so the problem was,

33:27.600 --> 33:30.600
like I said, as students, he had the slow gravity down.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.600
Well, how do you slow gravity down?

33:32.600 --> 33:36.600
Well, an inclined plane is where you drop a ball from here to there,

33:36.600 --> 33:41.600
or you can send it down that same vertical, but much more slowly by sending it down a long plane,

33:41.600 --> 33:42.600
and then he could measure that.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.600
But it seems it's more than just curiosity.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.600
It's creativity.

33:45.600 --> 33:49.600
I mean, these are creative minds, and you need to be able to think outside the box.

33:49.600 --> 33:53.600
And also not to poo poo, the fact that learning the facts is very important.

33:53.600 --> 33:57.600
I mean, just rote learning facts is important to get to that point.

33:57.600 --> 34:03.600
So we have to find a system that also encourages that, because you can't just start out with nothing.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.600
But once you know all these facts, the people who make the great discoveries,

34:07.600 --> 34:09.600
a lot of it is these flashes of insight.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.600
And I think a lot of that, you consciously take in all the information,

34:12.600 --> 34:16.600
and then the unconscious kind of moles it over, and it has a much larger capacity than conscious thought,

34:16.600 --> 34:21.600
and it can make irrational connections between things that the conscious mind won't allow.

34:21.600 --> 34:26.600
That's why they say take in the information and then sleep on it, and then usually you can wake up with an answer.

34:26.600 --> 34:31.600
So I think it's a combination of minds that have done all the hard work and taken in all the information

34:31.600 --> 34:35.600
and then allowed the unconscious to kind of mull it over, and then come up with creative solutions

34:35.600 --> 34:37.600
that not everybody can come up with.

34:37.600 --> 34:41.600
That's why we point to these examples as being so extraordinary, because they're so unique

34:41.600 --> 34:44.600
to come up with these solutions way outside the box.

34:44.600 --> 34:50.600
From the teacher's perspective, it's a lot easier to teach a body of proven facts

34:50.600 --> 34:56.600
than to say conduct an experiment, a series of experiments with the students certainly

34:56.600 --> 35:02.600
at the elementary school or middle school age, because often the experiments don't work.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
They don't come out right.

35:04.600 --> 35:13.600
The care that the, well, the Galileo's put into assuring that there are no effects that are mucking up the results.

35:13.600 --> 35:21.600
But I would suggest something, a slightly different emphasis going back to your answer to Paul's question,

35:21.600 --> 35:30.600
which is that part of what everybody's describing is the pleasure of thinking, of working through a problem,

35:30.600 --> 35:33.600
because it's not just the question, right?

35:33.600 --> 35:38.600
It's then using what you've learned to ask it to think about building the next question.

35:38.600 --> 35:45.600
And partly we have the problem of figuring out how to get kids to do that in more and more sophisticated,

35:45.600 --> 35:55.600
knowledgeable ways as they get older, but partly it has to do with helping children sort of who might not otherwise discover the pleasure of that.

35:55.600 --> 36:02.600
So if you grow up in any one of your households, you're going to be around parents who encourage that kind of thinking out loud

36:02.600 --> 36:07.600
and who model the pleasure of thinking out loud or pursuing a problem.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.600
But many kids don't grow up in families like that.

36:09.600 --> 36:17.600
And so then the teacher has another problem, which is to make his or her classroom a place where thinking is pleasurable.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.600
And in order for that to work, the teacher has to feel that thinking is pleasurable.

36:21.600 --> 36:28.600
So then you're trying to figure out, I mean, and that's a worthwhile task for anybody who wants to take that.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.600
How to get teachers to fill that one?

36:30.600 --> 36:31.600
There's a serious balance problem, right?

36:31.600 --> 36:36.600
Do we all worry about, at some point you have to try and admit some facts to people, right?

36:36.600 --> 36:39.600
I mean, I have to learn some things.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.600
I mean, scientists have to know a lot of stuff.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.600
So do lawyers, so do engineers, so do doctors and accountants and all.

36:45.600 --> 36:49.600
But knowing a pile of stuff doesn't really make you a scientist lawyer.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.600
I make you a geek, basically.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.600
So there has to be something additional to it.

36:55.600 --> 37:01.600
And I think there's a relatively, well, there's a very important question as to what are the relevant facts to teach?

37:01.600 --> 37:04.600
Why have we chosen the ones we've chosen?

37:04.600 --> 37:11.600
I mean, I, there's a fellow named Paul Lockhart who wrote this wonderful little book pamphlet almost called The Mathematicians Lament,

37:11.600 --> 37:15.600
and I recommend, very highly to everybody, it's a bit of a rant, but it's a great rant.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.600
And I mean, he asked you a very simple question.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.600
Why do we teach algebra?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.600
Who in this room uses algebra?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.600
Do you use algebra anymore?

37:23.600 --> 37:24.600
I mean, a few people.

37:24.600 --> 37:30.600
But that's a small number of people, actually.

37:30.600 --> 37:33.600
You use algebra in the, I mean, he gives us great examples.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.600
You know, the reason they tell you that algebra is so great is because we're able to figure out problems like,

37:38.600 --> 37:41.600
Marcy is two years older than she was when she was twice her age.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
How old is Marcy?

37:42.600 --> 37:47.600
I mean, who would have access to that kind of information and not just be able to say, Marcy, how old are you?

37:47.600 --> 37:51.600
You know, I mean, it's ridiculous, of course.

37:51.600 --> 37:58.600
But the reason I bring this up is that mathematics is an area where you can just think and come up with things.

37:58.600 --> 38:03.600
There can be little problems and you can kind of think and try things at relatively little cost.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.600
I mean, you don't have to have a lot of experimental equipment.

38:06.600 --> 38:11.600
You can have a pencil and paper and draw some things or this or that and say, well, how come it works out this way?

38:11.600 --> 38:19.600
Or, you know, why is it that the squares of every odd and the odd numbers make squares of all these sorts of funny numerical things?

38:19.600 --> 38:21.600
And they're just thought problems.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.600
They won't help you balance a checkbook, but who does that anymore either, you know?

38:25.600 --> 38:28.600
And so who needs algebra?

38:28.600 --> 38:33.600
If you want algebra great, then I want to be there and available to you if that's where your thinking takes you.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.600
But I don't think we teach math.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.600
I mean, math is the worst of the subjects.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.600
We just kill people and everybody hates math.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.600
And they're taught to hate math.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.600
For no reason at all.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.600
It can be a great deal of fun.

38:44.600 --> 38:52.600
The rant against the rant, I algebra trigonometry arithmetic.

38:52.600 --> 39:01.600
It doesn't, I don't see the particular area of mathematics as being significant, so you're never going to use algebra.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.600
Well, why do people exercise?

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
They go running.

39:04.600 --> 39:08.600
They're never going to chase down prey for you anymore.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.600
Well, they might be running away from them.

39:11.600 --> 39:26.600
So what I do see, again, in my own students, and what I suspect is true is if you do a lot of mathematical, quantitative thinking, I think it's good exercise for the brain.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.600
So I agree with that.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.600
It's just a question of should we just be teaching the rules of algebra?

39:31.600 --> 39:33.600
Should we get to the bottom?

39:33.600 --> 39:34.600
Well, fully not.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
But do you know that's how it's taught?

39:36.600 --> 39:41.600
Yes, yes.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.600
I think there's no question that education can be improved.

39:44.600 --> 39:51.600
And there are so many methods of teaching math that are making it so that the students have more curiosity.

39:51.600 --> 40:05.600
But isn't there at some level a certain degree of contradiction between curiosity and knowledge in the sense that if I want to know how to make a difference,

40:05.600 --> 40:08.600
I want to know how to go to Third Avenue.

40:08.600 --> 40:13.600
I'm going to be curious about how I'm going to leave this building and go to Third Avenue.

40:13.600 --> 40:19.600
The moment I know how to go to Third Avenue, I'm no longer curious about going to Third Avenue.

40:19.600 --> 40:25.600
So little kids, they have very little knowledge, and so they have curiosity about a lot of things.

40:25.600 --> 40:34.600
As they get more and more knowledge, some of that curiosity inevitably, whether it's the prefrontal or whether it's just the way you're getting more knowledge,

40:34.600 --> 40:35.600
diminishes.

40:35.600 --> 40:48.600
So the issue seems to me to be how to maintain, nevertheless, despite that natural diminution, a certain amount of question asking and curiosity.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.600
And that in a way requires...

40:50.600 --> 40:51.600
There is some evidence.

40:51.600 --> 40:57.600
So the developmental evidence is roughly as follows.

40:57.600 --> 41:06.600
Let me just step back a moment and sketch one educational philosophy, which I think in some sense relied on children's questions.

41:06.600 --> 41:15.600
So if you look at progressive education, both in this country and in the United Kingdom, the idea was that young children are indeed spontaneously curious.

41:15.600 --> 41:24.600
So they would come to you with questions, but rather than answer them, you would provide them with the raw material so that they could go off and answer them,

41:24.600 --> 41:33.600
whether it was dissecting a dead rat or playing with matches so that they could figure out what burns and what doesn't and so forth.

41:33.600 --> 41:38.600
Trickier these days in safety-driven preschools.

41:38.600 --> 41:44.600
At any rate, I actually don't think that is the ideal way to nurture children's curiosity.

41:44.600 --> 41:45.600
So what is?

41:45.600 --> 41:52.600
Well, if you look at the data, it looks as if children do indeed vary in the number of questions they ask.

41:52.600 --> 42:00.600
And it turns out that children who ask questions often don't show satisfaction with the answer.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.600
It triggers more questions.

42:02.600 --> 42:09.600
So if anything, I think the way to nurture children's questions is indeed to answer them to enter into a dialogue with them.

42:09.600 --> 42:16.600
And you see that, you know, if we look at people's family background, and this echoes the point that Susan was making,

42:16.600 --> 42:28.600
I think those families where conversation is seen as a vehicle for exploration rather than as a regulatory activity,

42:28.600 --> 42:34.600
telling the child what not to do or what to do, as long as it's seen as a vehicle for exploration,

42:34.600 --> 42:42.600
then I think you don't actually dampen children's curiosity by giving them an answer because, as we know, as scientists,

42:42.600 --> 42:47.600
no sooner have you got the one answer than it provokes further questions.

42:47.600 --> 42:53.600
So I think in that sense, there are deep continuities between the way that children function intellectually

42:53.600 --> 42:56.600
and the way that scientists function.

42:56.600 --> 43:04.600
I guess where we're stuck though is in asking, well, how do we transpose what some children are lucky enough to enjoy at the family dinner table

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
to what goes on in school?

43:06.600 --> 43:15.600
And there I think we meet some of the challenges that Susan was talking about, and I guess one challenge, especially in this country,

43:15.600 --> 43:23.600
to be honest, is true in the UK as well, is that we've set up educational achievement in terms of testable knowledge.

43:23.600 --> 43:30.600
And my own children have complained about the fact that their teacher is so keen to move on with the curriculum

43:30.600 --> 43:34.600
that when one of them asks a quirky question, the teacher is inclined to say,

43:34.600 --> 43:40.600
I'm sorry, we don't have time for that because we have the end cast to deal with or whatever.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.600
So I think that's really true.

43:42.600 --> 43:50.600
And actually listening to you talk about scientific endeavors, what struck me was the amount of time they take,

43:50.600 --> 43:56.600
both time from one scientist to the next as we inherit the good questions and data of previous scientists

43:56.600 --> 44:08.600
and also within our own bodies of work, and the great enemy of scientific achievement, but also of education, is efficiency.

44:08.600 --> 44:15.600
And we have a school system that's driven by efficiency, and you can hear it echoed in the things that teachers say,

44:15.600 --> 44:19.600
like I don't have time for that, and you can see it in the way that schools are structured.

44:19.600 --> 44:27.600
And so one, you'd have to change your thinking about efficiency, about what needs to be done in those 12 years of schooling,

44:27.600 --> 44:30.600
because it's not efficient to pursue a line of English.

44:30.600 --> 44:35.600
I asked a more fundamental question, you'll never find an answer as far as I know.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.600
Why do school last 12 years?

44:39.600 --> 44:42.600
I mean, I've never found an educator that can tell you why it's last 12 years.

44:42.600 --> 44:43.600
I can tell you.

44:43.600 --> 44:44.600
Does no educational answer.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.600
That's right.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.600
That's right.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.600
It's an economic answer.

44:47.600 --> 44:52.600
But the economics have changed since we started school lasting 12 years.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.600
I mean, the economics are completely different.

44:54.600 --> 44:59.600
It's actually, you could go much longer to school because there's no job out there for you anyway.

44:59.600 --> 45:01.600
I'm going to stay in school a little longer.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.600
I mean, you know, we don't have to rush our way through it.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.600
It's not going to have asked university people out there,

45:07.600 --> 45:09.600
well, how come it takes four years to get an undergraduate degree?

45:09.600 --> 45:11.600
Are you saying it should take less or more?

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
I don't care.

45:12.600 --> 45:18.600
I just want us to think about it instead of just keep doing what we've been doing.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.600
I mean, it seems like nobody's ever thought about it.

45:20.600 --> 45:21.600
Yeah, I've thought about a lot.

45:21.600 --> 45:25.600
Or whatever did think about it is gone and they let leave anything behind.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.600
I always wish that I could get like five PhDs.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.600
You know, like life is the time constraint really, right?

45:32.600 --> 45:35.600
Because I want to know, you know, all these interests, you know,

45:35.600 --> 45:38.600
as I got older and went through education, I had to cut things out.

45:38.600 --> 45:44.600
You know, I started out, I was acting and painting and playing the violin and science and psychology.

45:44.600 --> 45:49.600
And then I had to gradually first the violin went, you know, and then the theatre went.

45:49.600 --> 45:53.600
And then the painting went because I had to sort of fine tune and get become an expert in something.

45:53.600 --> 45:57.600
But I wish I could go and get a master of fine arts now and do this and do that.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.600
But life constrains you.

45:59.600 --> 46:04.600
So there is that natural time history, but my biggest question is as time goes on,

46:04.600 --> 46:08.600
information keeps getting, information keeps increasing.

46:08.600 --> 46:12.600
So the real problem is how do you, and history keeps increasing?

46:12.600 --> 46:14.600
I was thinking about, you know, more and more events.

46:14.600 --> 46:19.600
So you have to kind of curtail a lot of information and just pick out the most relevant bits.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.600
And how do you fit that all in to 12 years?

46:21.600 --> 46:26.600
And the other thing, well then as the internet grew, you know, I just have to look up things in the encyclopedia.

46:26.600 --> 46:27.600
But now you can get information very quickly.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.600
So although information is increasing, we have greater access to it.

46:30.600 --> 46:33.600
And a lot of people are teaching themselves at home the information.

46:33.600 --> 46:35.600
So then what's the job of the teacher?

46:35.600 --> 46:39.600
I mean, why go to school anymore when the lectures are posted online?

46:39.600 --> 46:40.600
You can just read it online.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.600
What does the teacher do?

46:42.600 --> 46:46.600
And does it help, you know, organize the information in a meaningful way?

46:46.600 --> 46:51.600
And these are just questions that I've been asked of myself lately.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.600
Why are you all looking at me?

46:53.600 --> 46:55.600
Well, I don't know, but I think you're right.

46:55.600 --> 47:00.600
I mean, in the age of Google and Wikipedia, the business plan of the university for sure isn't going to hold up anymore.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.600
We just can't sell the facts at these outrageous prices anymore.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.600
They're available.

47:04.600 --> 47:08.600
We have to be adding something else to all this.

47:08.600 --> 47:09.600
Or it's not going to use.

47:09.600 --> 47:15.600
I mean, I would say that what we have to add is to instill in students a taste for what's beyond the facts,

47:15.600 --> 47:19.600
or if you will, ignorance for questions, for getting past the facts.

47:19.600 --> 47:26.600
I think that there, I would object to the idea that there's either facts or a taste for more as the two options.

47:26.600 --> 47:32.600
Because I think what we're seeing, and I think this is very clear if you look at young kids,

47:32.600 --> 47:37.600
I think this is what Paul was saying, is that there's a process to asking questions.

47:37.600 --> 47:42.600
And actually, I don't think anyone would want us to go on having a mind of the three-year-old.

47:42.600 --> 47:45.600
So there's some good development that takes place.

47:45.600 --> 47:50.600
And you ask questions in a different way, and you seek answers in a different way one would think as you get older.

47:50.600 --> 48:00.600
And I'm sure everybody, everybody, your teachers, that no one thinks that they're, I don't think any of us either give a taste for more or give facts.

48:00.600 --> 48:07.600
There's also the skill of asking more penetrating questions, of attending to finer distinctions.

48:07.600 --> 48:09.600
We haven't talked about that at all.

48:09.600 --> 48:16.600
But the more you know about something, you don't know where Third Avenue is, and then you know it.

48:16.600 --> 48:20.600
But by then, by the time you know it, you could be attuned to other unexpected things.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.600
That's true.

48:21.600 --> 48:26.600
You know, what's along the street, and why is that person doing what they're doing at the corner, and so forth and so on.

48:26.600 --> 48:37.600
So those kinds of, those sort of pieces of how one pursues knowledge, I think, can be taught and do need to be taught.

48:37.600 --> 48:48.600
And that's not simply inspiring children, nor is it sort of filling them with facts. It's guiding them in how to ask questions and then how to seek answers.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.600
I agree with you, actually.

48:50.600 --> 48:56.600
So I have this argument with students all the time. I teach neurosci, I teach cellular neuroscience, some of molecular neuroscience.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.600
I mean that sounds terrifying, right? Terrifies me a little bit.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.600
And, and, but I argue, I always have arguments with these students.

49:02.600 --> 49:07.600
You know, they said, well, why do we have to know these, these details? Why can't we look those up?

49:07.600 --> 49:11.600
Don't you think you should be teaching us the big concept, you know, that, that cover these?

49:11.600 --> 49:15.600
And I argue with them, and I say, absolutely not. Big concepts you should flee from.

49:15.600 --> 49:23.600
They're just a bunch of propaganda. This is just somebody's idea about how to organize these facts, but maybe there's a better way to organize them.

49:23.600 --> 49:31.600
I think what you need to know is, is this an apocleft, 0.22 or 2 or 20 microns, you know, in size.

49:31.600 --> 49:36.600
Because if you know that, then you can think about the kind of questions that are appropriate to something that size.

49:36.600 --> 49:43.600
And that, that leads other things. You know, the concepts are a bad idea. I hate teaching concepts. I think it's the worst thing you can do.

49:43.600 --> 49:47.600
I really, I think they're propaganda, you know. They just hold you back.

49:47.600 --> 49:53.600
So in that sense, fact, a very freeing. I agree they permit you to ask questions, as long as you present them that way.

49:53.600 --> 50:01.600
But it sounds to me like it or not. You're also offering them an intellectual novel to emulate. Right?

50:01.600 --> 50:06.600
You're being somewhat iconoclastic about the field within which you operate.

50:06.600 --> 50:13.600
And students also learn to be question-asking and curiosity driven by virtue of that kind of osmosis.

50:13.600 --> 50:18.600
I mean, so there's a sense in which, well, we're asking this question, how do we nurture curiosity?

50:18.600 --> 50:22.600
How do we answer? How do we get children to ask questions? How do we get students to ask questions?

50:22.600 --> 50:30.600
I think there are lots of intangibles about how you do it. You, partly, you try your best to embody it.

50:30.600 --> 50:37.600
Yes. There's one other little story that a very famous neurobiologist in Allen Hodgkin at Cambridge

50:37.600 --> 50:40.600
for many years discovered how the action potential works in brain.

50:40.600 --> 50:47.600
Anyways, an electrophysiologist, and I knew a postdoc who was in his lab. He's now dead many years, but who was in his lab.

50:47.600 --> 50:53.600
He said, the thing about Allen was he would come in every morning and he would walk around from one experimental setup to the other.

50:53.600 --> 50:59.600
We'd student had some experimental setup and had some showed him some results in the experiment work to go very good, very good to keep on

50:59.600 --> 51:03.600
until he ran into somebody whose experiments weren't working.

51:03.600 --> 51:08.600
And then he would take off his jacket, sit down like his pipe, because in those days he could smoke in the lab, you know.

51:08.600 --> 51:13.600
And sit with the student for an hour. He was only interested in the stuff that didn't work.

51:13.600 --> 51:18.600
That's where the cool stuff was. So, you know, it worked. Yeah.

51:18.600 --> 51:26.600
You know, you made a, I think Enrico Fermi, you said, tell the students if you do an experiment and approve the hypothesis, you made a measurement.

51:26.600 --> 51:30.600
If you do an experiment and it doesn't prove the hypothesis, you made a discovery.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.600
And that's, so in the end, that's what you want to do. And you're right.

51:33.600 --> 51:42.600
I mean, you have to pay more attention to the struggle than to the one where the student who just pops off the answers, because they're particularly good at memorizing.

51:42.600 --> 51:57.600
I think the other piece of that, though, which is really interesting, if you look at one really interesting model of early development is the children apprentice themselves, or the adults sort of pull children into an apprenticeship relationship.

51:57.600 --> 52:04.600
And that doesn't just happen. And this country, in fact, it particularly happens all over the world where there's non-formal schooling.

52:04.600 --> 52:15.600
And kids learn alongside of a grown-up who's doing the thing the kid is supposed to learn. And of course, that involves watching someone do the thing that you're supposed to learn how to do.

52:15.600 --> 52:20.600
And the thing you're doing becomes explicit. It's sort of displayed.

52:20.600 --> 52:25.600
We haven't used that model very well in our formal systems of schooling.

52:25.600 --> 52:31.600
So we learn all the stuff. We figure out the experiment ahead of time, not in college, but in K-12.

52:31.600 --> 52:39.600
And then kids get some very digested version of it. And teachers dread, even at college often, is the question they don't know the answer to.

52:39.600 --> 52:49.600
But you could argue that what kids at any age can learn most from is watching the grown-up solve the problem, think out loud, answer a question.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.600
Or confess ignorance.

52:51.600 --> 52:58.600
And then think and say out loud, I mean, the best professors I ever had were the ones who said, let me think about that.

52:58.600 --> 53:03.600
If I think this, if I do this, if I were to draw on that piece of information.

53:03.600 --> 53:10.600
So there, it's not only what you're encouraging in the student, it's what you're willing to display or make explicit in an educational setting.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.600
Is the outcome of these other systems known?

53:13.600 --> 53:14.600
No, where's this?

53:14.600 --> 53:25.600
Well, we know that in a large number of places where there's non-formal schooling, kids get good at the things that they're learning by apprenticeship.

53:25.600 --> 53:36.600
The question is, so you could get good in certain communities in Mexico at weaving if you weave alongside the expert weavers or in other cultures at drumming or whatever it is.

53:36.600 --> 53:48.600
The question I think that we're asking is, is that a good model for something a little less concrete and finite, like scientific knowledge or being curious?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.600
I think that's a question.

53:50.600 --> 53:51.600
I think that's a question.

53:51.600 --> 53:57.600
There's also, there's just fiscal constraints. So I think, of course, the best type of learning is going to be one-on-one mentorship.

53:57.600 --> 54:05.600
But when you're stuck with these big universities, there's one professor teaching to 300 students in an introductory course.

54:05.600 --> 54:20.600
It's very difficult to get that really important one-on-one kind of mentorship, whereas when I switched over to the Oxford model where they have a tutorial system, which is amazing, you read this essay, you go and you meet with your professor one-on-one and you discuss it and the ideas.

54:20.600 --> 54:32.600
I mean, but that's just not fiscally possible. I mean, there's Sarah Lawrence College, which is here tries to maintain that Don system where everybody has one mentor and they can learn from, but it's very, very expensive to maintain.

54:32.600 --> 54:40.600
So I think the question is, how do you get some of the good aspects of that kind of mentorship relationship in these situations where you have classes that are hunted?

54:40.600 --> 54:42.600
I think you can use other kids to do it.

54:42.600 --> 54:54.600
So I think that's one of the great tricks. I mean, I'm not the first person to say this, I think, but I think one of the mistakes we make actually in our educational system now is that we educate kids all at the same age all the way through school.

54:54.600 --> 55:00.600
You go through school with kids all at the same age. I mean, that's also who decided on that exactly?

55:00.600 --> 55:09.600
So we could take Stuart's point to say that children will no longer have 12 years of education. They'll just have one year, but it's going to be very, very intense.

55:09.600 --> 55:31.600
If we look at the entire educational arc from kindergarten on, if the end point is going to be a cellular neurobiologist, I mean, kindergarten, I guess you have the broadest possible education with great flexibility, and there's some sort of geometric analogy.

55:31.600 --> 55:39.600
There's some sort of narrowing and specialization until you wind up with one of you. But...

55:39.600 --> 55:43.600
What was the one thing that was a great deal about almost nothing?

55:43.600 --> 55:49.600
What would the end point is, say, a blacksmith?

55:49.600 --> 56:12.600
I don't know if these converging educational models, how can it serve both at the same time? I think there's a great model of what should be taught and how it should be taught, and when the specialization should occur to accommodate every single person's ultimate career aspiration.

56:12.600 --> 56:25.600
Well, in that sense, I think the European system is a little bit better, because in the American system, it's kind of like all American, but sort of the Rhodes Scholar model, where you should have a good and a whole variety of different things.

56:25.600 --> 56:31.600
And so you first come into school, you don't even have to declare a major, you can take all these classes, and eventually you whittle down.

56:31.600 --> 56:40.600
But you actually don't get as much expertise as in some of the European system, where you go into school knowing what you're going to be studying, and you're just taking classes in that area.

56:40.600 --> 56:50.600
You can take some classes outside of that. But you get these really highly specialized people, not just academics, but if you go to the mechanic in Germany, they know everything.

56:50.600 --> 56:59.600
They have these specialty schools. So not everybody has to go, they're just model in America. Everybody needs to go to these colleges and get this degree and be multifaceted.

56:59.600 --> 57:06.600
But that might not necessarily be the best model. It might be better to have these really highly specialized people know a lot about their particular field.

57:06.600 --> 57:12.600
Not everybody needs to know about ancient Greek history to be an educated person.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.600
We still have vocational.

57:14.600 --> 57:21.600
Yeah, but they're not as, I know in Europe they're much more common and they're prestigious too.

57:21.600 --> 57:33.600
I mean the vocational schools, you go to some shop owner and they really know and they care about all the stuff that it is, whatever they might be selling, which is different here.

57:33.600 --> 57:48.600
Well, I would argue though that we wouldn't, I wouldn't want an educational system that only cultivated or mentored or embodied curiosity for the people who are going to go on and get a graduate degree.

57:48.600 --> 58:00.600
So I would say that whether you're going to become, there's a beautiful piece by Rebecca Mead and the New Yorker from about a year ago that talks about college education and says this much better than I could.

58:00.600 --> 58:12.600
Society would benefit from everyone having this cultivated and by cultivated I mean modeled and taught and guided K-12.

58:12.600 --> 58:18.600
No matter what your job is going to be, you know, blacksmith could be curious too.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.600
And so...

58:20.600 --> 58:22.600
That's a very blacksmith swelled anymore.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.600
There are.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.600
Sure.

58:24.600 --> 58:39.600
But I mean I'm not saying cold curiosity, of course, K-12, but I think when you go on to the higher education, why not specialize in things rather than still keeping it all open and all decide maybe when I'm a senior, if I'm going to major in whatever.

58:39.600 --> 58:50.600
You know, I mean I'm not saying cold curiosity but maybe have specialization slightly earlier on.

58:50.600 --> 58:54.600
Do you want to take questions? Do we take questions?

58:54.600 --> 58:55.600
Yeah.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.600
If you're ready, we can't.

58:58.600 --> 59:01.600
I guess if you're okay with me.

59:01.600 --> 59:15.600
Michael Sacks, I guess one thing that came across seemingly was about the recognition of a need of desire to acquire basic knowledge.

59:15.600 --> 59:25.600
Obviously that's the way our school system or educational system has been structured and then we have curiosity as something else.

59:25.600 --> 59:44.600
But could it be, and it really ties into the issue of the efficiency of the educational system, that part of the cure lies in how that basic knowledge is presented from K-12, which is to say, and even some language that you use,

59:44.600 --> 59:51.600
it was as if the knowledge is here and it's very, very specific, be it science, be it history.

59:51.600 --> 01:00:00.600
But the thing that would be perhaps stimulating would be the way that was presented, in a way that it's presented in a context,

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:09.600
where not it's history rather than just looking, learning dates, battles, kings, queens, to understand what they would have.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:21.600
So the question is simply, can things be changed by addressing the way that basic knowledge is presented,

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:32.600
or would that lead to too much discussion and therefore go against the concept of leading to educating people?

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600
Susan.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:41.600
Yeah, I actually don't think that children learn facts and then learn to think well about them or ask questions about them.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:48.600
I think that, and if you think about how kids get expert at the first things they get expert at in early life,

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.600
they learn a little, then they do a little with it, then they learn a little more, I mean in all domains of life, you know.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:04.600
And so it's, I would dispense with the whole idea that first anybody learns about any facts and then learns to be curious about it

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.600
or use the facts to ask questions.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.600
That would be clear that I'm fine.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.600
But I'm really saying it's the way it's taught.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
Yes, we agree.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600
It's the way it's taught.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.600
Can you please not interfere?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
Let me do it.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.600
It's also, I would say quickly, it's also the way it's evaluated.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:33.600
So if you have an evaluation system which assesses children's ability to supply answers, you will not be interested in children's ability to answer, ask questions.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600
Exactly.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600
Hi.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:45.600
I'm hoping to redirect the conversation just a little bit away from children in the educational system to a comment that you made very early on, which I found fascinating.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:02:01.600
I'm hoping to redirect away from children in the educational system to a comment that you, a fascinating comment that you made early on, which was the difference among adults as far as level of curiosity.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:11.600
And you had said that as a function of age, there's a more active prefrontal cortex which results in less curiosity and less creativity.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:24.600
But I'm wondering if there are any other thoughts in terms of what would make the difference between people who are naturally more curious, whether they're scientists or artists, whatever versus those who are not.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:31.600
So for that, I mean, I can tell a little bit of what I've been looking at recently is the neural basis of spontaneous creativity.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:43.600
So people who are really good, for example, like jazz improv or, you know, theater improv or freestyle rappers, even compared to the sitting down and thinking about something and writing out a poem, for example.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:55.600
And what studies have found using things like fMRI is that during those moments of spontaneous creativity, where people almost say they're in a flow and it feels like things are coming from someplace else or outside of them.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:01.600
And you might say that's related also to people at these moments of insight where things just kind of emerge.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.600
What was found is that there's increased activation of this part of the prefrontal cortex called the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which is sort of right here.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:14.600
And there's actually decreased activation of what's called the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, which is normally turned on.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:23.600
And so normally you have these sort of thoughts that are coming from a bit outside of awareness, so they're self-generated, they're stimulus independent.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:39.600
So internally generated thoughts that are then kind of that are activated by medial prefrontal cortex that are then kind of modulated or modified by activation of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, which is kind of like, you can think of it almost like a super ego or something.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:49.600
If you want to put it in psychoanalytic terms, you have these sort of id drives and impulses coming up and you have the super ego saying, wait, no, that doesn't conform to rational thought or to societal rules.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:57.600
And you kind of call down people so they become less and less eager to perhaps express these unconventional thoughts.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:11.600
But when they're in these states of flow or creativity, that sort of self-critical part of the brain is turned down and it allows this free flow of thoughts to come out, which can lead to things like insights or creativity.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:22.600
So I think that there are individual differences perhaps in the capability of turning down certain self-critical parts of the brain that will kind of put a damper on curiosity.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.600
And brains are different, personalities are different.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:36.600
But I do think there is an age difference that when you get to a point where that prefrontal cortex is fully formed, it becomes more difficult to allow that spontaneous freedom.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:45.600
A lot of people say it's good to get into a childlike mode if you want to become creative and kind of turn down the prefrontal cortex and allow yourself to kind of free things up a bit.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:53.600
But can I quickly read this other line from my favorite obituary of this week?

01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:05.600
Talking about how we got this idea, Dr. Jacob said he had been watching a dull movie with his wife Liseon in 1958 when he began daydreaming and was struck with an idea of how genes might function.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:11.600
So I think I've just thought up something important to control her.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:18.600
Okay, next question.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:27.600
The Myers-Briggs pipe indicator reports to measure virtually every person precisely on the scales we've been talking about here.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.600
On the intuitive versus sensing scale, it's I think a preference for concepts versus very concrete facts.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:46.600
And on the thinking on the perceiving versus judging, it's a propensity to be curious and want more information, constant want more information, and a judge who wants to have certainty, wants closure.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:06:05.600
So rather than talking about whether the school system should go one way or the other, shouldn't we really be talking about how the school system adapts to the different traits each person has and best develops their propensity, whatever they tend to be on those scales?

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:15.600
That's what I was saying before, is that their individual differences in certain educational models are going to be better for certain personality types versus others.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:29.600
And even the other big five personality traits, people who are higher on open mindedness are going to thrive in different types of educational environments than people who are low and open mindedness and perhaps high on neuroticism.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:36.600
They just want to know the facts and they want to know, am I going to get a good grade and that will give them their learn best in that model.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:42.600
But it's hard, you can't tailor an education system to individual differences unless you start separating people out.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.600
Do you have any ideas about this?

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:58.600
I guess I'm slightly nervous about this because the history of educational research is replete with schemes for individual differences, whether we're talking about how a gardener's multiple intelligences or visual thinking versus others.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.600
And I think that's a very important thing versus analytic thinking.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:27.600
So I guess at the very least I would want a school which was rather flexible in what it offered for particular children rather than being too sure of itself in identifying what type of child this particular child is because I think that way can also close off conceptions of what children are capable of.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:34.600
I'm currently a student of undergraduate psychology at the Sonoma Institute of Adelphi University.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:40.600
So this is coming more out of my own personal experience in observations and it is the actual empirical research.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:53.600
What I've noticed is that the continuum between people who just want the memorization and to get a grade versus the people who really want to learn has really become very disproportionate.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.600
And in my observations it's been sort of going into two camps or?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.600
It's yeah, it's really it's.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:12.600
And what I've seen is you see more people who are more interested in the grid and less interested in learning when the professor will thrust the PowerPoint out in front of the students.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:25.600
And I guess my question really is is the PowerPoint killing creativity and curiosity in universities throughout the United States and the world.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:38.600
But seriously I was almost brought to tears by this talk because it literally speaks to everything the education of the educational system is deficient in.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.600
Well I never use PowerPoint.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.600
I go over the lecture on it but I never teach with PowerPoint. I never use it in teaching.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:09:02.600
I prefer the board and I think it's I don't know I feel like I have a better connection with students when they see it develop on the board and I misspell words and I get chalk all over me and I'm a wreck and I think that's useful for them.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.600
And I think it's just let you kind of go.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:15.600
I think it depends how you use PowerPoint. And if you basically project your lecture notes on the screen that's certainly not a wise use of PowerPoint.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:25.600
But it lent itself to some animation some level of entertainment that I think students are more used to.

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:32.600
I wish that we could sort of have a Hollywood set with special effects and all that kind of stuff.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:44.600
I mean to to immerse students I feel like that the standards are very very high in terms of what students are expecting expecting for an educational presentation.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:55.600
I've got a solution to this. What I do is to invite the students they work in pairs and each week they do the presentation typically a PowerPoint.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.600
But there's so much more skill than me that it works for.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
That's very good.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.600
Okay.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.600
I'm going to move away from the microphone now. There's a reason my professors limit me to three questions per class.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:14.600
Just real quick to share I've been studying education for like 3540 years.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:24.600
The father of compulsory education was actually French general Napoleon who used the military training system for no other purpose than to create soldiers from little kids.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.600
The Germans copied him. We copied the Germans.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:37.600
If the standing at attention drills and all of that feels like it's the army it is because it is the army and had no other purpose than to do that.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:45.600
And just real fast again no academic I have ever talked to has known the origin of the word that's been studying for a lifetime which is intelligence.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.600
The etymology real fast.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.600
Intelli means between the other half the word is laigier which means to choose.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.600
Intelligence means to choose between.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:09.600
But the point that the question that I like to ask and I'm going to challenge you on this because I've developed a DVD based curriculum that's going to major distribution called eye openers or mind openers.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:20.600
To help kids that have a variety of attention learning problems because as you move your eyes sometimes it's called EYE IYOGA you build up attention and focus like a muscle of your body.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:29.600
And with this whole thing that you've been talking about with the brain that in an almost state of nature you can't see without moving your eyes.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:39.600
But we lock up our eyes on static letters and we actually atrophy our natural awareness because in a state of nature when your eyes are, peripheral vision is open the old days they used to call it samurai vision.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.600
A human being is naturally capable of being aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:54.600
Now in the work that you do, could you just imagine by doing simple eye movements and exercises that go back in India for 3,000 years?

01:11:54.600 --> 01:12:04.600
A normal human being could expand their creative imagination by 700% which is our normal natural ability.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.600
Now in the work that you do, would you like to know about that?

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:15.600
Would you think it would be meaningful to expand your creative imagination by 700% that has nothing to do with studying or reading?

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.600
It's just the way we were born. Any answers?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:36.600
Let me, I think I hesitate to answer the final somewhat rhetorical question but let me just step back and say a word about your first point.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:52.600
I do think the way in which education you started us off has spread from Western Europe imported into America and as you say it's a rather regimented activity.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:13:06.600
And for better or for worse the West has now exported it throughout the world and so we see increasingly in India, Indonesia and so on and so forth.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:20.600
Cultures which had different notions of how knowledge is transmitted, borrowing this Western model where you sit peers in classrooms with a single teacher and you examine them at the end of the year and then you have certificates at the end of it.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:39.600
And there's a sense in which it's very difficult to know how to stop this machine but it is an enormously powerful machine and I think part of what we've talked about today reflects the good and the bad aspects of that machine.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:53.600
I just add something to that actually going back to something Heather said which is formal education for everybody is a very new idea and we may not be very good at it but we haven't been trying for very long.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:09.600
Ted Sizer who was a really incredible educational thinker used to say he started the coalition schools and when people would criticize him because they weren't doing as well as he had first thought he'd say look we haven't cured cancer yet but we haven't stopped trying.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:24.600
And the same is true of the educational model that we're trying to use it's fairly new to try to educate everybody to a certain standard and in our society in particular we're trying everybody includes a lot of different kinds of people.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:39.600
And so I just I mean part of this is not we shouldn't be too down on educators or educational institutions we're just starting actually. Okay, but essentially you did not answer my question. Sorry.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:58.600
I'm sorry that I said the natural way the neurologist here our brains are put together that a human brain can be aware of seven streams of awareness the answer to your quick if your question is our people interested in learning more about that as a curious group of scholars were always interested in learning more about everything.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:10.600
Okay, let's go to the next question. I just have a little video up on YouTube call. No, there is no there is no such self no no.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.600
Please don't do any self promoting.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:27.600
Somebody gets a client about you. It's next question. Next question. Next question.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:33.600
You were meant is this thing on. Yeah. You were mentioning about algebra and why we needed.

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:46.600
In the eighth grade they taught me the quadratic equation, which was very boring. I understood it, but it was very uninteresting. So I asked my math teacher, what is the purpose of this.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:54.600
And he said, well, if you want to launch a missile to the moon, you need to know this.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:12.600
There you go. I've lived quite a few years since then, and I've never had a chance to use it. As a matter of fact, if I constructed a missile to shoot to the moon, I'd probably become a guest in Guantanamo Bay.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:23.600
So the reason you see is that we're, you see the first 12 great years of education. The education you get like medical school or whatever, that's for a particular profession.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:33.600
But the first 12 years of education, we're told it's to educate the kids. But that's just a byproduct. That's not the purpose of the first 12 years of education.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:49.600
The first 12 years of education is to assign status. And it's a lot easier to grade an algebra test than a history test or a test on how you deal with people or what your philosophy is.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.600
So do you have any idea how to address that? Well, no, and I hope maybe you don't. I'm not going to promote any videos.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:07.600
I have you. No, but I think you have hit on what I consider probably to be what's really the problem to solve in education, which is not so much what we should be teaching on.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:13.600
We shouldn't be teaching. We go back and forth that. But it's the evaluation issue. And that's what we haven't figured out.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:25.600
We don't have a good way of evaluating what we're doing. And so we take the simplest things to evaluate, like, you know, teach from the text and then give to a tag.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Give a test because those are the things that are the easiest to evaluate. But they're actually also the most useless.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.600
And I agree with you much of what we actually evaluate. I wouldn't call evaluating. I would say it's weeding.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.600
We're weeding people out for this or the other thing. That's what these tests do.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:52.600
I would say actually going back to your point that we don't even really know or have a shared understanding of what the purpose of education is anymore.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.600
I told you it was always to establish what your...

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.600
Well, okay. I was waiting to find out today.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:06.600
Even when they first had school, they gave you school. I think two or three years. You learned how to do arithmetic, how to read, how to write.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600
That's it. You're gone.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:13.600
Can I stick up for algebra for a second though? I think...

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:22.600
Algebra is getting a bad name. Now, you don't know what is going to spark your curiosity until you're exposed to it. I, for one, love math.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:30.600
I think it's a language of the universe. And I was really excited and inspired by it. And even though everybody said, oh, you know, I hate math, you're going to hate that class, I'm glad we had it.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.600
And I think that people don't know what's going to inspire them unless they're exposed to it. And learning those equations, it's a mind, it's a mental exercise.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.600
And you seem like such an ice lady.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.600
And we have the next question. You might not use it. You might not use it, but it doesn't mean that it's not important.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:52.600
I would say that in high school, I was asking, why do I have to read Shakespeare? I don't understand anything that he's saying.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.600
But I came later to understand more, at least, and appreciated more.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.600
Could be that whatever is gained from algebra is later appreciated.

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:16.600
Back to the topic of ignorance. And I was very struck at how quickly the conversation focused on education.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:24.600
I actually worked in academia after being trained to be a musician.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:36.600
And I don't have a degree, but I've worked for people who do. And I'll tell you a secret part of my life.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:41.600
I chose to stop doing science, even though it made me very excited.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:51.600
And the reason what made me stop is because the scientific method is an illusion.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:20:00.600
If you really think about it, you have a protocol, which could be a creative protocol that nobody else has thought of.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:08.600
But you need controls. So let's say you come across a phenomenon during your study that doesn't spit the protocol.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.600
Or it cannot be proven through control. It's positive or negative.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.600
Well, what happens is it's labeled artifact.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:24.600
Then the scientific community decides collectively, okay, this is artifact, so it means it's meaningless.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:34.600
So I just bring this up to bring to mind, you know, and I please forgive me all you academics.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:40.600
My father was in academic. And he was very upset when I chose music.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:50.600
But I bring this point to sort of shock you that it's not too late to open your eyes.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:59.600
It's never too late to realize that you have a sixth sense. There might be no sign of the other five, but that's a joke.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:06.600
Seriously, we have been endowed with a tremendous power.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:12.600
And that power, you bring up education. That power is, we're born with that power.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:22.600
And I feel that education should be based on happiness. Do what makes you happy.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.600
You know, if you want to...

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.600
Well, then we just don't be drug addicts, I think.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.600
The only sensible thing to do, in my opinion.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.600
I disagree, because I...

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:38.600
So I just like to say, I don't know personally any scientist that used the scientific method.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Basically, we just fart around and do our best and see what comes up.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.600
I mean, that's really the method that we use.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.600
I would say, I would quote Richard, to some of you, Richard Feynman on this.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:57.600
Richard Feynman's idea about science was, the purpose of science is to keep you from fooling yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:03.600
And that's really all that's required of it. So you use control experiments where they're valuable, so you don't fool yourself,

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:10.600
always being incredibly suspicious of yourself, knowing you'll be fooled just like that in a minute.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:16.600
But otherwise, I don't think any... I don't know any scientist, at least, who stick to the scientific method.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:23.600
First of all, none of us will live long enough. Who has the time to do a control and another turn in and back to the control and test all the variables you do now.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:25.600
Take forever.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:34.600
I may painter an art historian, and I went to a progressive school when I was in high school.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:41.600
And so I have a lot of interest in two problems, which I mentioned here, which can't possibly cover it in depth,

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.600
but just I'm bringing them up and maybe it'll be a question, maybe it won't.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:54.600
One of them is, again, I don't really think we yet understand... We don't really understand yet the individual ability for comprehension.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:02.600
The individual structure of brains. How certain individuals understand a problem, how others understand a problem.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:10.600
And a lot of learning problems come from different timelines, so it's very hard, again, to have a collective way of approaching students.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:22.600
But we have such large classes today. There's this mass culture. So it's harder and harder now to get into the intricacies of how we find out things and how we slowly learn things.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:29.600
An example is I studied art history and it was taught in a very dry way in my years.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:38.600
And then later I was reading Merlot Ponti about the body and the mind and the eye, and it becomes much more comprehensible.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Some people have already brought up this point that we learn in so many aspects of our being.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.600
It's such a unity of the mind, the heart, the physical being.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:53.600
And this is one of the most complex things to inculcate with various students.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.600
And the other issue I want to bring up is the interdisciplinary.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:05.600
In the golden ages of the past, the great ages, there was always a connection between the sciences and the arts.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:17.600
Of course, knowledge was less than it is today, but I still think we have a very important task to introduce different fields that students should study different fields.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:24.600
I once taught a class called 1912 and I invited every discipline to talk about the year 1912.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:32.600
And the most amazing things came out from scientists, to poets, to composers about what was happening in that year.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:42.600
And I still think we need more of a comprehension of the intercesses and connectivity of the what knowledge we have in this present time.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:48.600
So these are just two issues that if anyone wants to make any comments about them.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:55.600
They're extremely good points. I'm not sure I could comment any further on.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:03.600
I agree with you. They're both correct.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.600
How are you?

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.600
Okay, that's a lot of pressure.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.600
So my question starts from the beginning. How do we make more of this?

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:20.600
But how do we do this for people my age? I mean, one of the biggest benefits of sitting here is that as far as I know none of this was scripted.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:29.600
And one of the things that you probably yourselves enjoyed was the fact that you could connect ideas and thoughts that you were necessarily thinking about and you created almost like a web of ideas and knowledge.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.600
And this is a web that captures the people in the audience. We all like it because we get stuck to this information.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:41.600
But you can't just teach the facts, right? That's something that doesn't necessarily work for me when you mentioned that you don't like teaching concepts.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:48.600
For me, the first thing that came to mind was Karl Marx. That's kind of not really a fact thing. That's more for me.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:53.600
When I did it, it was more like philosophical exercise of the mind.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:58.600
It's just ideas and talking about it and saying, what can we do to understand this?

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:05.600
So how do we create that sort of environment where you aren't necessarily diminishing the importance of the facts,

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:12.600
but you're creating an environment where the facts don't tell the whole story, right? That's what this was sort of about.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:19.600
You sort of just had an ongoing conversation. But as far as I know, I'm younger than all of you, so I'm not sure how I fit into that.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.600
Do you mean it in the classroom?

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:28.600
I mean, I'm not from New York originally, but it seems like everybody here has kind of blocked off.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:35.600
I have to look for events like this just so that I can stimulate my own mind or spend hours in front of TED Talks trying to figure out what's going on in the world.

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:45.600
So how do we create an environment where information is readily available, but conversation isn't trying to share these ideas and play off with them

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.600
and have that intellectual exercise. That builds curiosity, that builds creativity.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.600
You don't have that. You have the tests. Like he was saying, you have the people who go in.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:00.600
And they think, if I get my degree in four years and I walk out here with a degree in finance or whatever,

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.600
then I'm going to make a lot of money. Okay, cool. Now what? That's your life.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.600
I think that you brought up a really important, really interesting issue, which is the role of conversation.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:18.600
Certainly, some of us here have been very interested in that early development, the role of conversation in early intellectual development.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.600
So some kids hear a lot of conversation at home.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:29.600
And all most kids, at least as far as the data show, I think you'd say this was right here, participate.

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.600
Don't just hear, but participate in more conversations at home than they do when they get to school.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:44.600
So one of the problems is how, you said it, is how to create conversations that people can either watch or better yet participate in

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:51.600
as they continue on in life. And that's a very, that's a beautiful, I think very interesting way of framing an educational problem,

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:57.600
which is how do we build conversations into K-12 education and or into college?

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:03.600
I used to say, oh, I used to say, oh, I got my education, you know, despite my education, right?

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.600
So I thought, you know, a lot of what I learned in college and through school was like things that I went off and did on my own.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:13.600
And it was a lot of self-motivation. But that being said, I think having an education is a privilege.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.600
I mean, people in other countries who don't have access to this, I mean, they would do anything to get access even to books, right?

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:26.600
So, I mean, I appreciate what's available, but within the system, I think there's a lot of room for individuals to go out and seek and find, you know, find a mentor.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:41.600
The things I remember most from college are my mentors, are the professors who kind of, you know, took me under their wing and going to conferences outside of school and learning things, you know, outside of the formal, but I still needed that structure to gain access to those other things.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.600
So I think it's within being within the system and then being creative and exploiting it in a way.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.600
And I think it takes a self-motivation to do that, but people who are really curious will do that.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:29:00.600
And I think professors and educators should make themselves available for students who really are wanting more than just the formalized class system.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.600
Are you old enough to drink?

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.600
Well, I mean, I recommend the local pubs to tell you the truth.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:09.600
I am.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:10.600
You want to know that?

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.600
No, seriously.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.600
And I think that's at one time what the purpose of a pub was.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:22.600
And you know, not one with loud music, but one where you can go and talk and have a conversation with people.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:31.600
There's some websites certainly in the UK, maybe here too, where there's a philosophy topic and you converge on the pub and you discuss the philosophy topic.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:42.600
Well, I mean, I went through college and one of the things I did realize was that a lot of the things that involved social interaction, it's almost like a requirement for that alcohol to be there, personally, rather go a block over and get a cup of tea.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:55.600
But one of the things, another thing that I mentioned about conversation was that the idea that when a professor is instructing, sometimes the presentation also focuses too much on the end of the line.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:00.600
They're giving that this is where we are and the information spectrum in this field.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.600
No, and this is what we got to.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:11.600
And if a professor were speaking of the ideas as though they're re-exploring them as they're presenting them, that gives the individual not just the

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.600
end of the line, but that journey there.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.600
And if you can.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.600
That's why I'm so interested in the history of science.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.600
I think that's the story and you're right.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:31.600
I mean, if you just say this is what we know about the moon and the galaxy and the sun now, you have no sense of where that came from or how long it took to the moon.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.600
In the age of tribes to focus on storytelling.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.600
I don't know why.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:49.600
It's also true, though, that I think maybe you wouldn't do this, but I know that some students, when they get the opportunity to evaluate a professor at the end of the semester, they're not necessarily so enthusiastic when it's been exploratory and uncertain.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.600
So there are many students who do actually look for closure.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.600
So you may be not one of those, but I know they exist.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600
No, my evaluation.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.600
We have to move on.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.600
My student evaluations went down.

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:06.600
Because the students had to work harder to achieve the grade.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.600
Hello.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:11.600
I'm not using that.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.600
Oh, that's good.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:16.600
Gosh, I had a whole thing that was worked out that I was going to ask.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:20.600
And then this conversation about drugs, maybe I want to ask a totally other question.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:26.600
I feel like they're too much to talk about.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:47.600
But I'm going to go with the original thing, which was you were talking about the nature of creativity and where it originates in the brain and this idea of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex getting into a childlike mode and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex as being the thing that kind of mediates that or makes you more aware of what's happening.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.600
That was what I understood.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600
That was basically right.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:53.600
Well, that's the turning down of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and the turning up of the medial.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.600
So less inhibition and more creativity, essentially.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600
Yeah.

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.600
Yeah.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:10.600
So I'm just going to speak for my own experience here as a musician, a lifelong musician, and a lifelong musician and a cook.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:20.600
So I do a lot of things that involve creativity but also require a certain level of theoretical knowledge to be able to execute them and to be able to see through various ideas.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:28.600
But I was confused. What struck me about what you said was the idea that creativity is stimulus independent.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:40.600
I'm just going to go ahead and say what I'm thinking about that because through my own experience, I would say that there's nothing that's stimulus independent.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:46.600
It's not that you're not interacting with the world outside and responding to it.

01:32:46.600 --> 01:33:00.600
But that moment of when you're sort of in this flow state, a lot of what's coming up or let's say you're a jazz musician and you're having to come up with a new note structure.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.600
But it has to still conform to certain rules.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.600
It has to be within a certain key or you have to know where the notes are.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.600
And so you are interacting with the environment.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.600
But coming up with that novel note structure is internally generated.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:21.600
So it's coming from a place, when I say stimulus independent, you just think of that it's internal generation of creating a new thought or an idea.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.600
Or you know, you know, these freestyle wrappers, they have to come off the cuff.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600
It has to rhyme. It has to go. The words have to make sense.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.600
It's not random words coming up or random notes.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.600
But they're still internally generated.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.600
And then at the end, there's the structure put onto it.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.600
But there's not it's not stimulus independent in the sense that you're not interacting with the world.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:54.600
Okay. Well, then if you are to look at like in terms of what is qualified as creative, like, you know, you may say that freestyle wrappers that have to rhyme or jazz musicians that have to play within a designated key structure are being creative.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.600
But the fact is they are being created within a particular set of constraints.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.600
Maybe that's dorsal cortex or whatever.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:07.600
But like, you know, there's a decided rule to the setting that's being created within parameters.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.600
But so an interesting thing to look at. And this is where my experience lies.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:18.600
I mean, I've learned a lot of jazz theory of I've learned and read a good amount about food science, whatever.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:27.600
Where creativity for me is always like it's free jazz is really hard.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600
That's what I'm trying to say.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:41.600
It requires a certain degree of creativity that is not just about reacting to stimuli and it's not just about generating internal like internally generating content.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:55.600
It's about basically, yeah, like when you're in flow for me, it's about, yeah, listening to that constant that voice or whatever that means sight.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:04.600
But then, like say I'm playing saxophone by myself, then you hear your own externalizations and you respond to those.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:13.600
So it's essentially a feedback loop that's being created by your own perception and expression of your thoughts.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.600
So even though it's reacting to stimuli, the stimuli are self-generated.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.600
Yeah.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600
And so it's like...

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:25.600
And then they're modified with what the output is. So if you realize you made it, you could do revision.

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.600
So you made a bad mistake or you said a bad word or you did a bad note.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.600
You modify that. So you're constantly monitoring your own output.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.600
And it's structured, but it is internally generated.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.600
Yeah.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:48.600
I think what you're sort of saying, if I could still do a couple of words, is that you need a certain amount of discipline to experience real freedom.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
That's actually the odd one.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.600
No, what did you say?

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600
Okay.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.600
And here we go.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.600
You tie it with that way.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.600
And this is where it comes back to the original question about education.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:07.600
So one thing that I've been just consistently frustrated with in my own education is what you were talking about, which is the idea of what should come first.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.600
Facts are curiosity, right?

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:13.600
Like kids need to be imaginary and creative when they're young.

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:18.600
If they're not led to do that, then they become repressed and they play drugs.

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:19.600
And they can trust.

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:22.600
They turn to music and bad kids, you know, whatever.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.600
But like, the point is like, I think that's a school.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.600
I've always felt that school should follow that same model.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.600
Like it should be about playtime first and then saying, and here's how other people have done it.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:37.600
Check it out and continue to ask yourself if there are other ways to do it.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.600
Because there are myriad ways.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.600
There are a million ways to get the third avenue.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.600
So we will stop there and go to the next question.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.600
That's a good one I don't know.

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:50.600
I don't like that.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:37:07.600
One I just want to make a comment which everybody knows, but obviously none of this could be talked about without talking about the economic structure that makes our schools, or you know, we don't want to say makes our schools what they are, but certainly it's a very powerful force.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:30.600
Not only in schools, but what we do to the whole notion of curiosity, especially if we look at America and we move on about that, but certainly even the whole mission of the university, is it a place to help people think becomes citizens of America citizens of the world, or is it a place to fill a cog in the corporation and build, you know, I think those are really different philosophies of education and certainly very powerful in America system.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:53.600
The second thing I want to say is very different. I'm a psychoanalyst and I sort of want to hear more psychoanalytically. We should know a lot about ignorance and curiosity of a very different kind at an individual level where, at least in my experience, obviously anxiety works against curiosity, both consciously and unconsciously in tremendous ways.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:06.600
And I think that you see that at the level of the individual and at the level of society when everyone, you know, is terrified, is there a job out there, it's very hard to say, should I just want to follow my bliss and be a history major and do this and that.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:21.600
I think that adds to the individual pressure when there is that kind of anxiety as well as unconscious anxiety that I also think, starting from a very young age, can get in the way of the capacity to learn and be curious.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:43.600
And there are many different ideas about this, but one of them also brings me back to what has been touched on in many ways here, but it's the whole idea of learning about curiosity within a relationship and not in a concrete sense of about being in a relationship, whether it's my relationship with a patient and knowing that some of their fears,

01:38:43.600 --> 01:39:06.600
my belief and capacity to engage them is going to be part of what is going to allow the two of us to work together and to be able to begin to look at the anxiety and look at what makes it so frightening to learn, in that case about oneself, which can also, I might add, open up one's capacity to want to learn many other things, that learning of self-choriosity.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:24.600
Now, I'm not saying that obviously everybody isn't going to be an analysis to say the least, but the idea of what comes out of the, as has been mentioned, the parent child relationship, the enthusiasm, belief of the teacher with the students, sitting in a bar, the conversation,

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:41.600
this opportunity for conversation of sort of what is going on in our brains and our minds together that may facilitate greater openness, creativity, curiosity that, you know, obviously got somehow that that was alive in each of you here.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:55.600
So, I would say two things, maybe there's no need to say anything actually, she didn't really ask a question.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:13.600
We maybe have not completely decided what it is we expect out of an educational system, and so we've heard that somehow or another comes to us through these sort of military systems and that there's still some of that. I've heard it suggested that a lot of it comes to us through the English system when England was an empire,

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:31.600
and England had this empire to run, stretched all the way around the world, but they didn't have telephones, they didn't have an internet, they didn't have email, and so how do you get that done? How do you get that done efficiently? Well, you get a cadre of people who all know how to read and write and spell and do math in exactly the same way,

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.600
and then you send them off to do those jobs and you don't have to worry about them, they are literally cogs in a machinery.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:50.600
We have largely that sort of an educational system today where we have very distinct things we expect you to know by second grade, my third grade, my fourth grade, whatever, and that's because we're turning out some sort of a, you know, a role-filling person.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:56.600
That's not, I think, what we want, but as the geneticists say, you always get what you select for.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.600
You mean that as a warning, of course.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:12.600
I was going to actually say something a little different, which now I'll say it. I'm very interested actually in curious about what more clinically informed people have to say about anxiety, because my understanding of this,

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:20.600
developmentally there are two opposing things you could say about the role of anxiety. One is, I think there is some evidence and I'm trying to write about it, we'll see if I'm successful,

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:30.600
that a certain level of security, secure attachment in toddlerhood promotes exploration. We know that already, that's well established, but I'm trying to make a link to sort of curiosity.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:42.600
On the other hand, the old, the classical definitions of curiosity in the developmental literature suggest that curiosity is the urge to resolve uncertainty or explain the unexpected.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:52.600
Those are two of the well-known definitions of curiosity, which suggests that a certain amount of anxiety makes you try to get an answer.

01:41:52.600 --> 01:42:09.600
And so, if you're talking about very anxious people, where it's a broad sort of description of their, all their experience, I can understand why if you're too anxious, you sort of shut down and you don't seek the unexpected or the unknown.

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:19.600
On the other hand, having a little bit of anxiety is one way to explain curiosity is that it's a response to a little bit of anxiety.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:30.600
I guess I would wonder if curiosity is more a response to something vital, vitality, or some...

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:41.600
Curiosity usually, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, other people, but usually there's something you don't know and you want to know it, and so you have to find an answer to it.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:50.600
Well, you know, historically in psychoanalysis, at least my personal experience, was that it was the other way.

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:59.600
The idea in psychoanalysis was that you sit behind the patient, you ask the patient to say whatever came to their mind, and then you made an interpretation,

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:04.600
meaning you then said something to the patient that the patient himself did not know that.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:22.600
So, in essence, that method of doing the work, to me at least, blocked the analyst's curiosity, because the analyst had the answers and fit whatever the patient said within a schema that he had studied and made.

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:36.600
So, some years ago, I, in fact, wrote a paper about this and encouraged that the analyst should focus more on making themselves curious and making the patient curious about himself,

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:48.600
but not in the way that Heather described before in terms of what she called the superego, namely self-critical way, because as long as you're self-critical, you learn nothing about yourself.

01:43:48.600 --> 01:44:01.600
The only way you learn about yourself is by being curious in terms of understanding why you did something, you felt something, you behaved in a certain way.

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:10.600
If you do that without criticism, inevitably, you get more control over anxiety, and you get more knowledge about yourself.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:18.600
For a child to pursue their curiosity in a school environment can be a very risky social action.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:26.600
I mean, there are very few students who are willing to ask the questions and make a fuss and badger the teacher, whatever.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:36.600
I think most students, I'm an astronomer, what do I know, but in my experience, most students probably want to fit in.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:45.600
I think that's one of the more important social agendas of middle school and high school, less on mistake.

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.600
Then I think that may cover a large large fraction of students.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.600
So we have three more questions, and then we stop.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.600
Please make them brief, because we are running out of time on order.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:01.600
I have a general question for all of you and a very short specific question for one of you.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.600
How can we deal with societal anxiety?

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:25.600
I mean, if we all agree that, or general tendencies to agree, that there's a balance in education between facts and difficult work of interpretation, which is hard to evaluate, which is even, and any evaluation.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:37.600
Detective evaluation requires some subjectivity, so you're worried that the teacher may be being fraudulent, trying to claim that her, his students are doing better, and society is afraid of being defrauded.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.600
Society is anxious about that.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:47.600
If you can come up with a better way of measuring critical thinking, that's great.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:46:01.600
What you can't, is there any way, either on this issue or on others, to address the degree that society, that societal fear forces a dumbing down?

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:13.600
The very specific question to you, sir, is were you being intentionally self-contradictory in order to provoke, or is there some way that I'm missing?

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:33.600
If you want students to know that a structure is 0.2 microns rather than two microns, because they want to know which questions they should be asking about that structure, is not the idea that some questions are more appropriate for different-sized structures.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.600
Is that not itself a general concept, which is what you were saying you shouldn't be focusing on?

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.600
Excuse me.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.600
You better answer the first part.

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:54.600
So, I went to a very interesting talk in the course of this week, given by a Finnish educator about the Finnish educational system.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:01.600
It's worth thinking about the Finnish educational system, because if you look at international comparisons, it's typically number one or two.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.600
Lack of poverty.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.600
But, you said lack of poverty.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:14.600
Lack of, once you normalize for poverty, it's still good, but the difference becomes much less, and the difference between the US and other developed nations becomes much less.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:26.600
Okay, we could discuss exactly what the causes are, and I agree with you that their success is bound up with a lot of other social indicators.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:40.600
But I think what struck me most about this particular spokesperson was his emphasis not on pursuing more and more refined tests, even more sophisticated ones for critical thinking.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:48.600
He emphasized the extent to which in Finland there's deep trust in the professionalism and integrity of teachers.

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:56.600
And sadly, in this country and in the UK, I fear to say, we've moved away from that trust.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:06.600
So, it's interesting that you use the word, we might be subject to fraud, or how can we get a truly valid test.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:18.600
So, you can also say we should calm down a little bit and reinvest trust back in the classroom. One last point he made, which I thought was absolutely fascinating.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.600
He talked, and I took it to heart as an early childhood educator, so to speak.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:31.600
He said, a lot of psychologists and educators in the United States are concerned about how you make children's school ready.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:44.600
As if, in some sense, it was the child who had to be measured and tailor-made for the school, whereas, of course, you could turn it around the other way.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:49.600
You forgot. I was hoping that would happen.

01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.600
You're doing so.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.600
One of you left off, right?

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.600
No, no, sorry.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:57.600
Come on.

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:07.600
I'm not sure what exactly the question was, but I don't think there was a little inconsistency. I'm always a little inconsistent because I just talk.

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:19.600
No, I don't think that, I don't think it's a concept, except to say that if you think a concept is the size of things, the scale of things matters in the way you think about them, that's a concept.

01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:27.600
Everything's some kind of a concept.

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:34.600
As a concept is, you go to general rule and you want to know under what circumstances and to what degree it's applicable.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:39.600
Then I don't think that, then no, I don't think that's what I meant.

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:50.600
What would you want the purpose of public education to be and how would you evaluate it?

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:57.600
Well, let me give a slightly light-hearted answer, but I think maybe it's in the spirit of this afternoon.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:10.600
One of the things I think we would want, and of course we never evaluate it, is that pupils emerge with the ability to enter into a lively conversation, an enjoyment.

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:18.600
I have to say the best thing I've ever heard said about this was by the woman who's the president of Barnard, whose name just went right out of my head.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:28.600
She said the reason you'd like to get an education is to make the inside of your head an interesting place to spend the rest of your life.

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:32.600
That's pretty great.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:40.600
I just want to reiterate that the education, the reason why when I went over to England and it was a different model, it was so stimulating for me.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:50.600
It was all the things that I had access to outside of the university, all of the people that were there collected in this amazing place that I had conversations with at pubs.

01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:59.600
Somebody had said to me, you come and talk sort of as a boy and then you leave as a gentleman, you learn how to become a better person just by having these interactions with the people.

01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:06.600
The other thing about the education, it gives you access to a whole group of like-minded people that you can have discussions with outside of the classroom.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:12.600
That's just a large part of the education as is the formalized education in the classroom.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:16.600
I'm sure Stuart knows you also learn how to drink.

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:23.600
It's critical though, I hate ignorant drinkers. The one place I will not brogue ignorance with is drinking.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:27.600
You're also playing girls and girls playing boys.

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.600
Yeah.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.600
I think it's great.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600
We'd better get to the next question.

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:39.600
So this is fraction of people who have, I'm tempted to be loud.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.600
It will record.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.600
It will record.

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.600
Oh, you're recording.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:46.600
Okay.

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:53.600
So this is a fraction of people who seem to thrive or for not knowing, move around trying to find out.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:59.600
And no sooner do you find out something that you got something else that you're questioning and so forth.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.600
There's this fraction.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:08.600
And there's this curiosity in terms of what goes into or what accounts for this particular tendency,

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:28.600
which tends to be different from where most folks are at, and some kind of desire to expand the fraction or pull more people into this process of wanting to seek questions,

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:31.600
you know, to thrive off of our ignorance, right?

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:41.600
But I'm questioning, aside from you just having a curiosity around why that is what it is, why do this?

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.600
Okay.

01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:46.600
For what purpose other than your own curiosity?

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:57.600
Chances are, whatever new developments, new capabilities are generated from anybody who becomes so expanded.

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:04.600
So expanded by your quest to expand their capacity to seek, right?

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:16.600
That in all likelihood, the results of what gets generated will be utilized by folks who don't necessarily have that particular set of motivations,

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:26.600
but have a whole lot of practice or knowledge around how to utilize people who have those kinds of motivations in order to accomplish their particular reject.

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:33.600
Their particular reject is so I'm raising the question, why do this?

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:47.600
Well, a short answer, I mean, has an astronomer everything that I do and my colleagues do has virtually, there's no practical value.

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:57.600
I mean, which, we readily admit, at least some of us do, the ones who are honest.

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:07.600
The ones that I have talked to and myself included, I don't know, it's not a complete answer, but we can't help it.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:19.600
It is somehow just deeply ingrained that we want to seek more knowledge or be in this kind of activity of investigation.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.600
I'm clear that this is fraction of the channel, you just driven it back to the money.

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.600
Okay.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.600
That's it.

01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:44.600
When I'm closing is the question of why are you interested, if you are interested, in expanding the numbers of people who might engage in this.

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:54.600
If you don't already have some clear purpose as to what that would be for, other than just doing it, you know, for the sake of doing it.

01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:57.600
Well, let me answer.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:08.600
In fact, part of my job as a professor and my colleagues is to decrease the number of people who join our ranks.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:17.600
I mean, we have in the physics department about one third, I guess, of our students drop out before they graduate,

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:25.600
or they just pursue other activities that they're like better.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.600
I don't think it's like we're trying to gather everybody to do what we do.

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:32.600
We certainly are interested in letting them know.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:40.600
But the conversation today, the thoughts that touched education, had to do with the notion of how to make people be more curious, more creative.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.600
Right, but not necessarily a scientist.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:47.600
I'd like to give an answer from Benjamin Franklin, our founding fathers.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:53.600
Franklin, as it turns out, was in Paris at the time, he spent a lot of time in Paris, you know.

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:59.600
And he witnessed the first time, the first human flight, and it wasn't fixed with an aircraft, it was hot air balloons.

01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.600
Nonetheless, it was the first time human beings lifted themselves off the face of the planet.

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:11.600
And this is, by the way, a well-documented story, not just some cukianic note that I'm making up, it's in his biography and all that sort of thing.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:19.600
And he's standing next to some Frenchman who asked him at a time, well, this is a lot of fun, this looks interesting, and it's cool, but really, what good is this?

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.600
What good is this likely to be? And Franklin's answer was, what good is a newborn baby?

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:30.600
What uses a newborn baby? I mean, frankly, they're not very useful. They're a pain in the ass.

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:36.600
But a few of them turn out, and thankfully they do, and we have all this to thank them for.

01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.600
And so you'll never know just looking at a newborn baby.

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.600
Can I just add one thing, though? I don't think you're answering the question, if I may say so.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:49.600
That's OK, it's still a good story, wasn't it?

01:56:49.600 --> 01:57:01.600
So, on the way here from Boston, I was reading a book that I recommend to everybody, it's called, Don't Sleep There, There Are Snakes, and it's shit.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:05.600
It's my... It's embarrassing, it's my wife.

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.600
Say hi, just gets me in the mood at all.

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:21.600
So, anyway, this particular book was written by somebody who started off as a missionary,

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:29.600
went to a South American Amazonian tribe called the Binhaday, who had been very difficult to contact,

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:33.600
and whose language was very, very difficult to understand and transcribe.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:42.600
Anyway, in the course of his stay among the Binhaday, he loses his Christian faith, but he becomes fascinated by this culture.

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:53.600
One of the things he describes in a very fascinating way is actually the fact that they live, and he analyzes this,

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:59.600
both with respect to their cultural practices, but also the language that they use, they live very much in the moment.

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.600
They do not think about the past, they do not really think about the distant future.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:14.600
Their memory goes back as much as can be offered by living eyewitnesses, so they have no myths, no fiction, no history, no religion,

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:22.600
other than a kind of very here and now belief in the existence of certain spirits, which they claim to actually see.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:31.600
Anyway, what struck me was that in the course of living among these people for about 30 years, ever at the linguist,

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:41.600
comes to value their way of life, which in a way undercuts everything we believe in in the West.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:47.600
And so, to that extent, they might well say, what is the use of a newborn baby?

01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:54.600
Well, they might say, in some sense, it's the celebration of life here and now, and that's all that we need.

01:58:54.600 --> 01:59:06.600
But we academics, for whatever reason, are stuck thinking about the next question and how it could be different and how we should analyze it.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.600
Can I say something more hopeful a little bit?

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.600
People have said to me, you know, what are you doing?

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.600
They call it mental masturbation, right?

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.600
It's just for your own self-simulation, and why are you doing this?

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:20.600
It has no practical, you know, because my passion is trying to understand the neural basis of consciousness,

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.600
and people are like, that has no practical value at all, and I go into the formalized system.

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.600
Now, I mean, I'm in a medical school and I want to do research in this area, and people say, well, you can't.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:34.600
It's not practical. It has to be, you know, and I each funded it has to have practical applications to treat psychiatric illness,

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:39.600
and that's just trying to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge is a waste of time.

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:45.600
And my response to that is that I think that as I said in the beginning, just bring it back,

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.600
the norm is not to go and really be exploratory and ask all these big questions.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.600
A lot of the sort of beaten out of you over time, and we're taught to just do what's practical,

01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:00.600
and the reason why we should encourage people to be more curious and exploratory is that that's where the big discoveries are made.

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:07.600
The people who think outside of the box, the people that go against the grain and do things that are not practical,

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:11.600
that's where these unconventional things and that can actually eventually help people,

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:17.600
and big advances in science are done by people who are thinking outside of the box and who are being curious.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.600
So, as you said, maybe there's no use for babies in the beginning, but every so often one of them might be really special.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:27.600
So we might as well invest the resources in them because that one might have a large impact.

02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.600
Okay. Thank you very much.

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:39.600
Thank you.
