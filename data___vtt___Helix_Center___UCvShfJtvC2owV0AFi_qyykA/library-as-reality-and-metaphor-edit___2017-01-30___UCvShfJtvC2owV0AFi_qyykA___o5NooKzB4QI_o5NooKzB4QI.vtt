WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
What was your work before you entered our recovery?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, we're going to get started.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome everybody.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I'm Rob Penzer.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm the associate director of the Helix Center.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Before I introduce today's participants, I'd like to give you some

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
heads up on upcoming events here.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
Next month, February 11th, we'll be talking about pain with

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Apgar, Opcarian, Ina Belfer, Anis Dijdaveric, and Rebecca

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Seal, and Maureen Stratford.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Then on February 25th, we have a program on the displaced

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
and the other.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
Later this year, in March, we'll be talking about music and

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
healing.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
In April, we have two programs, one on nanotechnology and one on

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
design and nature.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Then in May, our final program for the season will be on

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
mathematics and the National Institute of Mental Health.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
For further details, visit us at our website, helixcenter.org

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
on Facebook and Twitter.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
If you're not on our email list, please sign up on our website

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
for timely announcements.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Now today's program, the Library is Reality and Metaphor.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
To my right is Anthony Grafton, the Henry Putnam University

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Professor of History at Princeton University.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
To his right, Carol Mandel, Dean of the NYU Division of

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Libraries.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
To her right, Alberto Mangoyle, writer, translator, editor,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
critic, and director of the National Library of Argentina.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Next to him is Daniel Goroff, Vice President and Program

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
And next to him is Ken Sonar, Arthur K. Watson, Chief Librarian

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
at the Thomas J. Watson Library of the Metropolitan Museum of

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Art.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
So I've asked our participants to just start wherever you think

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
you'd like to.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, I'm happy to start as a practitioner.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
And one aspect of this exercise that I've found striking

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
particularly is how unsettling it has been.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
Thinking about the wide variety of metaphors for libraries, not

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
to mention librarians, which inevitably I can't help but

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
take personally.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.000
And the fact that it's such a multi-valent, evanescent,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
complex variety of metaphors that are used for libraries that

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
are invoked for libraries, it even calls a static just to talk

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
about that.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
I think my point is electronically made.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
But all kidding aside, perhaps in the situation we find ourselves

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
in or I find myself in, we're looking for somewhat more

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
fixed points.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But even putting that aside, the complexity involved in

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
considering the multi-valent nature of libraries metaphor has

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
been a little bit more unsettling than liberating in terms of

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
imaginative thinking goes.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
I guess I know the topic is libraries metaphor, but the other

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
powerful aspect to me is library is icon in the iconography of

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
libraries, which is closely related.

03:42.000 --> 03:50.000
And for me, it's just been a privilege to live at the turn

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
of the century because we've been forced to get at the heart of

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
the meaning of library in order to make the transformation.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And that's been so exciting.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And what's been amazing to me is that while a lot of the

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
literary work about libraries metaphor actually conflates

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
library and book, the public image of library is much more

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
generous and broader, which is why public libraries are jam-packed

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
with people engaging in different ways, why thousands and

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
thousands and thousands of students are in my library every

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
day, even though circulation of books is tanking quite a bit.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
And so I think that there's something very powerful about

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
connecting to knowledge and connecting to community and

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
intellectual connection that's quite deep in what people think

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
about with libraries.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
When you said making the transformation, can you say more

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
about which transformation?

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Well, I guess it's the fact that the book has been the

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
predominant knowledge container for so long that many people

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
have the image of libraries as containers of books because

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
books are where the knowledge is and then you come to use the

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
book and that's, but now that we see how many containers of

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
knowledge there are, and it's almost opened up older forms

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
as well.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
People are more generous in their ideas about the knowledge

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
and images and the knowledge and the proprietary and the

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
knowledge and archives and the knowledge on the Internet and

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
that suddenly expecting it all to come together, giving

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
libraries a much bigger preservation and connection role.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Did that make sense?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Did that answer your question?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yes.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
I think that the idea of libraries, I can,

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
libraries, metaphors, is all contained in an essential

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
definition of library of which I think the symbol is

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
Alexandria, of which we know so little.

06:17.000 --> 06:24.000
But in the universal imagination, Alexandria contains all the

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
libraries to come and every society picks the image of the

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
library that better suits either its real identity or its

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
imaginary identity.

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
And so in our century, we like to think that the library has

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
been transformed into this generous place which, as you

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
said, realizes that information is contained in so many

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
containers.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
But that was true in Alexandria where there were no only,

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
not only scrows, but tablets and maps and drawings and

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
objects and all these things that contain our memory.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
If I can be personal for a moment, I suddenly found myself

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
less than a year ago at the head of a national library.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
And I thought I had an idea of what the library was and what

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
a national library was and how a national library should

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
reflect the identity of its society in full.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
However, I hadn't paid much attention to the particular

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
situation of this country, of Argentina.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
To be the head of, say, the Library of Congress, which is

08:04.000 --> 08:09.000
the equivalent of the national library of the states,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
Carla Hayden has a wonderful, I think, very powerful vision

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
of what the library could be.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
But she has an idea of the situation in which she finds

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
herself.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And I won't define it for you.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You know it well enough.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
But in Argentina, it is a very different situation.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
It's a political situation that is not interested in culture.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
So you have the library, the national library, as an

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
important symbol of the identity of a society that doesn't care

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
about the library.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
It still cares about the symbol but doesn't care about the

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
library.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Let me give you an example and then I'll let you talk.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
The other day I met Richard Ovenenden, the head of the

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
board, and he was telling me in passing that they got a

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
grant of 25 million pounds.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
Our annual acquisition budget is $50,000.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
That tells you a lot about the importance of the library as an

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
intellectual place in Argentina.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
The library has been entirely detached in a metaphorical sense.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
The metaphor has taken off in the practical application.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Nothing entirely because the idea stands that the library is

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
important as a symbol.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
But when you ask a politician to put their money where their

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
money is then they turn their heads and talk about something

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
else.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Essentially I think that if we look at the positive side, it

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
shows how flexible the image of a library can be in so many

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
different contexts.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
I would love to have a discussion around how the way in

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
which we look at the library defines us rather than we

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
defining the library.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
I think that's an interesting place to take the discussion.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
One way in which we used to define ourselves is we were all

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
library people in the 60s and 70s which might have been the

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
height of the old technology.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
The library was the Willie Sutton principle.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Knowledge was in the books.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
You went to get winchles guide to reference books which got

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
you to bibliographies and it was all very kind of 19th century

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
and stable.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
It had certain advantages which the current economy of

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
knowledge really lacks.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Not only were students in the library but professors were in

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
the library.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
The academic work was modeled by professors for students who

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
were at the next desk in a way which is almost inconceivably

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
rare now.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
There are ways in which we need to think about whether that old

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
image had its values that now need to be resurrected in different

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
forms for a different way of housing and spreading knowledge.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
You can't bring back the library of the 60s.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Bringing back a model where people of different ages work

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
together would have a lot to be said for it.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
I think trying to identify those missing pieces is really

11:57.000 --> 12:03.000
helpful because so much of what we do is new models of what we

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
need.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
That certainly is one example that has to happen in different ways.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
It has to happen in the nature of instruction, the kinds of

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
things that are given and the way those are discussed, bringing

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
research into the curriculum and then working through it.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
It doesn't happen by the side by side.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Although sometimes it does too because the research is such a

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
different activity and research team.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
We try to provide spaces where research teams can work in

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
that way.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
We go into classrooms and bring that together.

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
It's helpful actually to hear people talk about, well, even so,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
here are some of the things that are missing because we do have

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
to try to get at those.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
One of my colleagues at NYU, a historian at NYU, brings

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
her students, makes them come into the library just to smell

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
the books.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It's a connection.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
We've lost forms of knowledge that she feels that you need to do.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
The data, as you say, is the lost connection because they are

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
there, the books and the virtual library and the objects.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
It's a question of reminding ourselves that they are there.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
The National Library of Copenhagen is a beautiful building

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
that's divided into the lower part is computers and students

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
and readers and professors use that virtual library.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
The second part is called the dead books because they are all

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
the books up to the mid-20th century and most of them haven't

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
been catalogued so they can't be used.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
They're called dead books.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
So the readers work under the shadow of these ghosts that are

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
not conjured up.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
They are there to be conjured but the librarians don't make

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
the effort under the misapprehension which is a very

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
common misapprehension today that the Internet has everything

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
and the virtual library has everything.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
And of course it doesn't.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
We all know that.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
And I think that Grafton is right in the sense that we have to

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
reclaim the virtues of a library that was used at a certain

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
time and perhaps at other times.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
And that doesn't mean leaving aside the new technology on the

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
country.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
It's joining everything together.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
We don't have to be monogamous in the library.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
Your comment about the person who brought people to smell the

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
books, I mean, all faction is so strongly tied to memory.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
And what about the idea of the engagement of the senses that

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
a library provides that someone sitting at their computer

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
terminal accessing the Internet doesn't quite bring about

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
all the experience and the sensory modalities that are

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
engaged have a role to play in what the meaning of the

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
library experiences.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
There's some interesting disagreement about that.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
On the one hand, I mean, such research as I've read

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
suggests that you don't read on screen the way you read on

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
paper and that what you read on screen doesn't stick to your

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
long-term memory in the same way.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
You're actually using a different bit of your brain.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
And that's why it doesn't stick, seem to stick in the same way.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
You're using the bit of your brain that does computation rather

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
than the bit that you use for an elaborating.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
That's at least what they find when they see what lights up.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
On the other hand, I have friends among the science graduate

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
students at Princeton who are obviously star young

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
scientists and a couple of them come from my Alma mater,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
the University of Chicago.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So they're also great readers.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
And they have told me quite insistently that they don't

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
buy this for a moment, that they never read anything except on

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
a screen and their command of what they read, which is highly

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
technical and demanding, is extremely tight and precise.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And they've given me some demonstration.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
So their view is their minds have been rewired to work in a

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
way that fits contemporary media.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Speaking to researchers at the University of London,

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
Ontario, who are mapping the brain, they told me that

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
physiologically the reading on a printed page and the reading

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
on screen functions differently because the eye doesn't read

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
continuously, but in jumping movements called saccade.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
So on a printed page, it always lands on something that's

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
there, while on the screen it can land at a moment where the

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
screen flickers and unconsciously we see an app that

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
we see an absence.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
So it's a different form of reading.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
But that the brain becomes rewired.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
The brain can do extraordinary things when one door closes,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
the brain opens a window.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.000
And for instance, my son does everything on his little gadget,

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
send letters, listen to music, watch films, make coffee,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm not sure.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
But yes, and everything happens in a way that for me is

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
impossible and too old.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
My son being trained as a pilot was able to read Moby Dick and

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
a palm instrument in all of the waste time between possible

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
sessions.

17:59.000 --> 18:07.000
But as to this physicality, I was thinking about your question

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
about what the library says about us.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
And it made me think of our rootlessness and our even

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
homelessness sometimes.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And then I was thinking about the thousands of students that

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
turn up in the library on college campuses.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
And having been involved peripherally in the design of several

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
libraries recently on college campuses, I've come to find

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
that they're not used the same way that they were in the past.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
And I've heard story after story of students, especially during

18:39.000 --> 18:44.000
exam periods when the library might be open even 24 hours, who

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
turn up in the afternoon with a bag.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
And they pick out a comfortable chair and a corner and they

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
set themselves there and take out their drinks and their

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
supplies and so on.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And study the way we always studied for a few hours.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
And at some point they disappear and come back in their

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
pajamas and spend the night.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Either studying some of the time, sleeping some of the time,

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
but staking out that home in a way in the library has become

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
part of the culture, perhaps because they have no place else

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
to go.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It's amazing to me.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
I've been astonished at, and I think it is the power of what

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
library means as a place to work.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
And as we were going through our turn of the century transition

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
and planning our renovations, and we did a lot of study of who

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
was the library for.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
We interviewed just hundreds of people and distinguished

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
faculty and they all said physically, physically, the

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
library is for students, not resource wise, but physically.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
We have library for students, we are in our office, we can get

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
everything electronically, make sure you page stuff so people

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
can get it to me.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
I'm not leaving my office, I have everything set up.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
But the students, what we have actually specialized in, and

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
this goes back to your question, I don't know whether it's smell

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
or companionship or what it is, it's definitely electric

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
outlets, but they are definitely, you find them, you know.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Just like in airports, wherever the outlet is, the person is,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
and no matter how uncomfortable the spot.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
But we actually realized that one of our services was space as a

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
service, and that one of the things we had to design was space

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
for intellectual productivity.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
And we actually have principles, we devised, we've, you know,

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
observed and we've changed things, and we've got sizes of work

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
stations and distances from people and all kinds of things and

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
different configurations, because you don't want just want, and

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
actually one of the things that we've done is promulgate this

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
across campus, because there's no room in the library for everybody

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
who wants to be in the library.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Just try coming in, you're walking over bodies, and you know,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
and this is the library where the circulation, as I said, and so

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
what are they doing there, why are they there?

21:19.000 --> 21:25.000
And, but as we design new campus buildings or convert spaces

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
in certain areas, they're trying to create some of the same kind

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
of spaces for inspiration, spaces for intellectual productivity.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
Whether that really will work, or whether it has to have the name

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
library on it, that remains to be seen.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I think this is a very positive trend, and increase in gate

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
out is perhaps almost always a good idea, but I think it's

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
to a point, but I think it's also symptomatic of the change in

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
metaphor, and the fact that the metaphor has been desacralized,

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
and it's no longer the common, almost cliche metaphor of library

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
as temple, as holy place, with its appropriate architecture,

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
with the point that Professor Grafton was making a minute ago,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
with the professor, priest, and the student,

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
the acolyte, and all the metaphors line up perfectly.

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
Now we've shifted to a desacralized situation where the most

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
appropriate metaphor, perhaps, and not in all in a disparaging

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
or negative term, is library as office space.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And that's a shift in metaphor.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
I would say there's, I would argue a little bit to qualify that,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
but there is a way in which the library is a particular form

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
of temple. It's the temple of Iskulepius where you went to

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
incubate to spend the night in the hope that something would appear

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
to you, ideally Iskulepius himself, who would say your throat

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
hurts gargle, as he actually did.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
And I think that that is also what they're doing, and I think to that extent,

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
the books retain some kind of air of sacrality, and you

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
spend the night there because the books are there, even if you're not

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
consulting them.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
And I think picking up on your metaphor of the office and the idea

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
that the space still remains in some sense sacred,

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
I would say that while now one certain use of a library

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
is coming to the surface, the workspace, not necessarily

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
the taking of books and reading books, part of the mission of the library,

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
perhaps has to be bringing the faithful to the temple,

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
as to say, educating new readers.

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
One of the huge challenges the National Library has is

23:57.000 --> 24:07.000
procuring more readers. We have, I'm afraid to say too many readers,

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
because we have had to extend the reading hours to midnight.

24:11.000 --> 24:17.000
It's always full, but as you have pointed out, the borrowing of books

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
declines in number. So how do we make that those who come to the library

24:22.000 --> 24:29.000
borrow books, and how do we create new readers in the outside world,

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
people who are not readers? My son again, I'm sorry to quote him,

24:36.000 --> 24:44.000
so many times. When he was about 14, he was a great video game player.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
And I've never played a video game in my life.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
So he asked me to accompany him once to a video game arcade.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
So I said, well, sure, do we buy a ticket to go in?

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
He said, no, we can go in and, and all these machines,

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
well, do we, do we queue? Do we get a token to play the game?

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
Do we put our name? I realized I didn't know the ritual of the place.

25:13.000 --> 25:19.000
And most people have never been in a library, and certainly don't know

25:19.000 --> 25:28.000
the ritual of the place. How to bring people to the library to read

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
is the big question. Of course, I don't have an answer.

25:32.000 --> 25:38.000
I'll be glad for any advice you can give me.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
Even getting the elite students at a great university or users of some place

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
like the Met who are pretty much all very highly trained to use books when they

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
should is non-trivial. Cambridge has a routine in the history

25:53.000 --> 25:59.000
faculty for MA students. They're given on Friday what are called research challenges.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
And they're problems that cannot be solved with any resources on the Internet.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
The only way you can solve them is by going to every library in Cambridge.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
And it strikes me that, you know, even at the elite level, most of us aren't doing that,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
and most of our students aren't, in fact, getting that kind of training.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
But when you go to the vast, hungry public, that's a huge problem as well.

26:24.000 --> 26:32.000
We are going to start a program next year, and I will let you know in a couple of years if it works.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
A teacher came to me with a suggestion.

26:37.000 --> 26:46.000
She had been a teacher for 30 years and realized that the children coming out of school

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
couldn't read or didn't want to read.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
And very few had reading passion had become readers.

26:55.000 --> 27:02.000
And she realized also that it was less the fault of the students' intelligence certainly,

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
or having books at that disposal or coming from homes that didn't have books.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
Rather, the problem was that the teachers weren't readers.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
And so they were asked to teach reading when they didn't care about reading.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
They weren't passionate about reading.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
And she created a program to teach teachers how to become readers.

27:27.000 --> 27:36.000
And she's doing this in a small area of the province of Buenos Aires, and it's working marvelously.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
So I'm going to try that the National Library extend the program to the country.

27:42.000 --> 27:50.000
And I hope we will be able to bring some more readers to the library that way.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
But I'll tell you in a couple of years if it works.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
I guess we don't see our mission as creating readers.

27:58.000 --> 28:07.000
We see our mission as creating knowledge seekers and helping them seek knowledge in whatever way they need to.

28:07.000 --> 28:12.000
I mean, our clientele are engineers and scientists and artists.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
And reading is wonderful, but reading is not everything.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
I would use sacrilege words.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I can't believe I said that.

28:22.000 --> 28:34.000
But also, we do see a difference in international students from American students in terms of being acclimated to libraries.

28:34.000 --> 28:47.000
You know, there is a wonderful history of public libraries in towns across the United States and children being read to and going to libraries.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Of course, there are many.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
We wish there were more.

28:50.000 --> 28:58.000
And we find a difference in the comfort levels that American students come into the library with.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Still, they need to be taught research.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
They need to be taught that the Internet isn't everything.

29:03.000 --> 29:16.000
But there's a level of comfort in the nature of books, libraries, information that sometimes even at the graduate student level, we have to acclimate students too.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
You're separating the seeking of knowledge from reading.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
No, I'm just saying the bra.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm not saying one is a kind of broader umbrella.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
And that I see reading as a subset of that.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
And how so?

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
Because when you say reading, I assume you mean reading a whole book.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
If you don't mean that, then I don't mean that.

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
So I'm not worried because those people seek knowledge and reading the briefer sense all over the place.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
Well, exactly.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
And reading has always been that.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
You never, in few cases, only concentrate on books.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
You become a castle-born.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
But in that case, yes.

30:04.000 --> 30:14.000
But most people have a vaster area of exploration, which includes, of course, books.

30:14.000 --> 30:20.000
But then the books serve to find a guide in your life experience.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
And you get knowledge from other sources that you read as well.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
We read the world.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
We read the gestures of people.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
We read in a much larger sense.

30:33.000 --> 30:43.000
So I take objection about this division between seeking knowledge and reading.

30:43.000 --> 30:54.000
Even in oral societies, there is a form of reading without which the society cannot survive because it cannot communicate.

30:54.000 --> 31:06.000
I want to come to the defense of this group that we disparaged a little who used the internet and feel that everything is there.

31:06.000 --> 31:18.000
And all of the world's information is there because all we're doing is applying the same metaphor that a previous generation applied from the started when you wish.

31:18.000 --> 31:31.000
And Alex Andrey started with Bibliotheque and Universales started with the ideals of what a Harvard Library should be, et cetera, what the New York Public Library should be.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
So it's the same metaphor that's applied to a different format.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Misguided then and misguided now.

31:40.000 --> 32:00.000
But there's a consistency in the metaphor which I find fascinating because there's an impulse to want it all there to have your Bibliotheque and Universales in between boards, that your keyboard, enwitener, just as long as someplace.

32:00.000 --> 32:12.000
The Library of Babel which is completely useless because it contains everything. So it contains text that cannot be read.

32:12.000 --> 32:22.000
It contains misinformation. It contains, for instance, the true catalog of the library and millions and millions of false catalogues.

32:22.000 --> 32:49.000
So it's completely useless. But in spite of that, I think we have an impulse to face the chaos, the absurdity, the meaningless of the universe with a hope that this institution can lend it order, can give us a map for this thing that is mapless.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
And I think that metaphor can be very useful.

32:55.000 --> 33:06.000
The difficulty with this, I mean, I'm very sympathetic to this notion. It goes back to Erasmus saying that old dysmonetius is building a library without walls.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Yes.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
And that's perhaps the closest thing to what the internet seems to provide.

33:11.000 --> 33:20.000
The difficulty is the radical lack of curation of so much that's on the internet.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
The reason the thing the library offered was not just knowledge, but curated knowledge.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
And you can never curate everything.

33:28.000 --> 33:41.000
Princeton's copy of Norman Cone's book, Warrent for Genocide, has marginal notes by someone who took it as proving that the protocols of Elders of Zion were genuine, which is the reverse of the argument of the book.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
So it doesn't matter what you do. You can't keep readers safe.

33:44.000 --> 33:57.000
Nonetheless, anyone who just works as much as I do with Google Books knows what it's like to work with a magnificent, endless, and totally uncurrated body of material.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
And it's not like going to what's on the shelf in the library.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.000
Not too similar of the work that the librarians at Alexandria did.

34:07.000 --> 34:25.000
They had 20 or 100 versions of Homer, and they had to edit one that was more or less coherent and more or less factual.

34:25.000 --> 34:31.000
What metaphor of the library do you think your students would choose?

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
That's a really good question.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
I think it means community and knowledge sharing to them.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Like Erasmus.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, I think that's what I think that is the undergraduates.

34:46.000 --> 34:54.000
The graduate students would have a much more knowledge-based metaphor, much more of what we think.

34:54.000 --> 35:02.000
But I think the undergraduates, it's a different kind of place.

35:02.000 --> 35:12.000
And the place and engagement metaphors and the inspiration metaphors would be stronger than the knowledge and organization of knowledge metaphor.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
My own sense, for example, is that browsing doesn't go on a lot.

35:17.000 --> 35:26.000
And since every library is now read...

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
But the history stacks, the literature stacks don't get much browsing.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
You never see people there with a heap of books.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
And one reason for that is the library is so incomplete.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Even a very big one.

35:40.000 --> 35:50.000
Our graduate students see it as a transfer center where they're mostly going in and getting books from other libraries ordered electronically rather than depending on what's there.

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
And the place that supplies them to various indices and the transfer center is a great...

35:57.000 --> 36:06.000
And the transfer center to all of the really powerful digital databases that we're paying for in which the graduate students use very skillfully.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Exactly.

36:07.000 --> 36:16.000
You're right about browsing. I, oddly enough, have the privilege of granting stack privileges because we're a closed stack library.

36:16.000 --> 36:26.000
And when I grant these stack privileges, it presses up against the notion of metaphor because the recipient doesn't think they've reached paradise.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
They're convinced they've reached paradise.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's no longer metaphor.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
It's actuality.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
And that is the elimination of borders.

36:34.000 --> 36:54.000
It's the elimination of borders giving access to the stacks, which is so important nowadays because picking up on what you were mentioning about whether the fact that we are nomadic makes the...

36:54.000 --> 37:04.000
It gives the library a certain sense.

37:04.000 --> 37:09.000
I'm puzzled by a paradox that the Hebrews who are nomadic people hold the book.

37:09.000 --> 37:21.000
The book is a library as the monument of their society, the identity, the place to which you go, in which you always are.

37:21.000 --> 37:43.000
While the Greeks who wrote all their stuff, their letters, their documents, their literature, they wrote it down, they didn't care for the library as much as a center of the identity of their society.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
For Athens it was the temple.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
It was the agora.

37:49.000 --> 38:18.000
I don't know how to explain that, but just to point out the paradox, and that in our time where we are a world of refugees and immigrants and transients, maybe the library can give people with changing nationalities a sense of place.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
Well, that's been true for the public library in America for many deaths.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
The library did in the most glorious way.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
In Queens, right? In Queens? In the early generation?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
In 42nd Street.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Absolutely.

38:34.000 --> 38:45.000
Perhaps there's something to the ark, as the holder of this girl that goes with all of our church metaphors and the sacredness of all of this that goes way back.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
Yes, perhaps it's that.

38:50.000 --> 39:13.000
But there is something about the publicness of a public library, and it's very existence that regardless of what else goes on inside and how that's transforming, that the fact that we are a society that values that, that put resources into the building

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
of public spaces like this, I think says something very important to this day.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
And of course, we have to think about Andrew Carnegie and the role of philanthropy in all of this.

39:28.000 --> 39:36.000
But still, the political economy of all of it is, I think, quite important.

39:36.000 --> 39:48.000
I think about public goods, not in the sense of the public good as a kind of aspiration, but as a kind of commodity.

39:48.000 --> 40:01.000
A public good in the sense of a bridge or a lighthouse or a vaccine discovery or, you know, other things like that that have two qualities.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
One is in the technical sense that economists use the term public good.

40:05.000 --> 40:15.000
One is that it's non-rival, which is to say that if one person uses it, there's still just as much left for everybody else.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
So a lighthouse is a good example of that.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
And that it's non-exclusive.

40:22.000 --> 40:28.000
That once it's there, you can't really easily keep people out of it.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
So you can keep people out of the stacks.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
But I'm talking about public libraries here.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
And those are, that inclusivity is a marvelous symbol.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
But because of those two characteristics, public goods are notoriously hard to finance.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Everybody wants to free ride.

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
And we have to turn either to the government or to philanthropy in order to produce these kinds of public goods.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
And sometimes I worry that as a society we've forgotten how to do that.

41:01.000 --> 41:08.000
And when I walk past the library, I say maybe we once knew, maybe we'll remember again,

41:08.000 --> 41:18.000
and maybe keeping up these kinds of benefits to society is something that we can all be reminded of.

41:18.000 --> 41:28.000
What's been impressive to me is that it could change any day, of course, but the remarkable health of public libraries.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
There was a moment of despair.

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
And really quite a resurgence, town after town after town supporting it.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Because it's been so important to community.

41:40.000 --> 41:47.000
And it's to make almost counterintuitive in this day and age, but deeply heartening.

41:47.000 --> 41:54.000
And it seems to be so deeply connected to the American ideal of self-improvement.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
And the library is the place where you can do that.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
So I hope that persists.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
It's a refuge from the market system.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
And you can put it there.

42:07.000 --> 42:16.000
A good example of the use of a library as a metaphor for the American society, because elsewhere in the world is completely different.

42:16.000 --> 42:28.000
In Colombia, which has the best library network in Latin America, and perhaps one of the best in the world,

42:28.000 --> 42:38.000
they have developed with very few resources a library network that has gone into the Sierra and into dangerous places.

42:38.000 --> 42:44.000
And where they have gone, violence has dropped by 70, 80%.

42:44.000 --> 42:54.000
With the Carnegie idea that the government puts half and the community puts half, whether it's in services or money or anything.

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
So these libraries become symbols embraced by the little villages or the native groups.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
And the change is extraordinary.

43:07.000 --> 43:17.000
So the libraries are seen, perhaps as light houses, but also as sanctuaries, places of sanity.

43:17.000 --> 43:27.000
Now, of course, in other places, if something different in France, censorship started entering the libraries,

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
not in the sense that Darnton gives it in the 18th century, but in Sarkozy's France.

43:33.000 --> 43:43.000
So a mayor of France, for instance, decided that the public library would not have works by North African writers,

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
and eliminated those from the library.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
So that is another metaphor for the library.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
The library has an exclusive identity.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
It's my identity, and I don't want any of your stuff in it.

43:59.000 --> 44:09.000
But it also implies a question about what is the role of private libraries, especially when you have government interfering with...

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Yes.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
And the history of private libraries and preserving knowledge, and any thoughts about that?

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Well, most public libraries begin as private as it is.

44:20.000 --> 44:30.000
There's often a correlation, isn't there, with countries that have great book shops and private libraries and don't have necessarily great public libraries?

44:30.000 --> 44:39.000
Italy, when I first lived there, had incredible book shops now mostly gone, and incredible private collections.

44:39.000 --> 44:47.000
But there were individual research libraries, which were fantastic, but just finding a general collection where you could work was extremely difficult.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Exactly.

44:48.000 --> 45:01.000
Well, but it makes me think of Robert Putnam's work about civic organizations, and how countries, as a whole, even politically seem to be able to function better,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
where there are more of these working civic organizations.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And that may be theater groups.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
It might be red cross groups.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
It could be all kinds of things.

45:10.000 --> 45:18.000
But perhaps libraries belong in that category as well, as in a sense, engines of social capital.

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
There are places where we learn how to communicate with one another, we learn about how to relate to one another, we learn about other cultures,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
ideally, if you're not in France, in that particular city.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
But you learn about how to do things as a group.

45:33.000 --> 45:45.000
And even literally how to build an institution that doesn't rely on the normal sorts of market forces, the normal sorts of financing.

45:45.000 --> 45:56.000
And that to me is really quite important, as I was starting to say before, it's almost a refuge from the usual market system that so pervades what we do these days,

45:56.000 --> 46:07.000
that you can go and read a book about Paris and not be immediately bombarded by advertisements for flights to Europe.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Right?

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I'll see cases.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Yeah.

46:11.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, and we've recently witnessed the defeat of a real experiment in America to build a commercial market based third space in the vast mega bookstore,

46:25.000 --> 46:33.000
which rose and for some time appeared to be out doing public libraries, especially for the middle and upper middle classes.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
It's the copy.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
Yeah, but also more amenities and a richer selection of new books.

46:39.000 --> 46:49.000
And that experiment has clearly failed and is clearly basically dying, which once again just emphasizes the deep importance of what you're saying.

46:49.000 --> 46:58.000
There's another element that I want to bring in that I'm realizing is culturally different.

46:58.000 --> 47:13.000
So American librarians, and to some extent British, and there are in a few other places, but not universally, are not just keepers and preservers of things,

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
but are passionate about the sanctuary concept, are past, shown about the inclusivity.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
They're passionate about open access and when you were talking about restricted books.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
So, you know, the American Library Association's freedom to read foundation would be all over that public library.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
I mean, you sort of can't really do that.

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
I mean, you can try that in this country and librarians will be lobbying all over the place as they are on, you know,

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
with issues related to privacy and access to library records and things like that.

47:47.000 --> 47:59.000
And I've been told, you know, by folks about how amazed people are at the effectiveness of librarian lobbies because, you know, librarians, how can you say bad things about them?

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Yeah.

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
So, and I think that that is also part of the culture that is not probably true internationally.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
Because you have to have a strong economy to have power with an intellectual group.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
It's a luxury.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Nevertheless, Columbia has it.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Yeah, it does happen.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
They're brave too.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
They are very brave.

48:25.000 --> 48:33.000
Can I share with you a metaphor, if that's what it is, that I heard fairly recently from a friend who's a colleague of Carols,

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
named Michael Stuller, who's the Dean for Collections there.

48:38.000 --> 48:45.000
And I see him a few times a year as my conduit into academic library world and because of his very good humor.

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
And he came up with a, back from a meeting and he came up with a phrase that knew would shock me.

48:51.000 --> 49:02.000
And there are many librarians of research institutions these days, actively having conversations about what shall we do with all of our books.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
It's his market driven.

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
It's fundamentally about real estate.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
They're trying to grapple with questions and I'm with the momentous.

49:10.000 --> 49:15.000
How many copies do we need of various books, journals, titles?

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
Can we have regional centers?

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
And the term that he knew would make me spill my soup was.

49:24.000 --> 49:35.000
Librarian referred to their collection as underperforming assets.

49:35.000 --> 49:45.000
A sure way to get the attention of the faculty on our campus is to tell them that you're moving books to a storage warehouse.

49:45.000 --> 49:28.000
And believe me, you hear from everyone about how impossible that is and how ridiculous and, but I think the experience of the

49:28.000 --> 49:35.000
institution is a very important thing.

49:35.000 --> 50:04.000
And most of the libraries is that when everyone goes ahead and does it with some of the books, as long as there are provisions for recovering them quickly.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
That is wildly successful.

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
And people are glad to have the space for other things.

50:10.000 --> 50:24.000
But there is this holding on tight to the physical presence of it that I certainly understand, but it's different from throwing them away.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
You're accessible with a click of a computer key.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
So that's different.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
But it's not easy to get books away.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
No, it's not.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Actually, I had a huge mathematics library that I wanted to give.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
And even the university libraries wouldn't take it.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
I'll take it in Shanghai.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
That's tough.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
We will take it too.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
No, I actually sent some of them to a different place.

50:50.000 --> 51:00.000
Because in that sense, I love an anecdote of Nicholson Barker.

51:00.000 --> 51:11.000
He was looking for a book, and he discovered that the only copy was at the Boston Athenaeum, published in the mid-19th century.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
So he went to the Boston Athenaeum, also the book.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
It was there.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
They gave it to him.

51:17.000 --> 51:24.000
And he noticed that he was the first person to take it out for 100 years.

51:24.000 --> 51:30.000
And he said to the librarian, you know, I'm the first borrower.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
And the librarian said, of course, sir, we bought it for you.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Books are very patient.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Absolutely.

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
I always feel I'm liberating them when I take a book out for Princeton for the first time.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
And it gets its stamp and it leaves the library.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
Yes.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
So, I mean, there are some difficulties.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
I mean, here's one that I haven't seen written about.

51:56.000 --> 52:05.000
But when we began at Firestone to have real space troubles in the 70s, naturally, one of the things we did was to get rid of big multi-volume things.

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
And big multi-volume things are not, in fact, they need to be browsed.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
Digital browsing is not very effective with that kind of thing, and you often get the wrong volume when you order one to be brought back.

52:19.000 --> 52:27.000
For example, we had the whole Algama in Alito-Autut's item, which was the TLS of 18th and 19th century Germany, right in the stacks.

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
And in fact, nothing has replaced having the whole thing as an asset.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
We had to do it, but that's a real loss.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
You zapped another paradox of the library under the shadow of Alexandria as well.

52:41.000 --> 52:50.000
You have to have everything, and the definition of the library is a collection that always exceeds its base.

52:50.000 --> 52:56.000
No matter if you have a hundred books, you find that the shelf is too small.

52:56.000 --> 53:06.000
Do we think that, and you started to allude to what I think,

53:06.000 --> 53:14.000
that the library metaphor can be so powerful that it's too often applied to the Internet.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.000
And you talked about the difference in curation and the difference in gaps,

53:20.000 --> 53:26.000
and that in a way it's been a somewhat destructive metaphor because of that.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
I don't know how to get around that or out of that, but it's, you know, it's...

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
It shouldn't? Yeah. Yeah. What would you call it?

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
I mean, it's a kind of library.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
The blank?

53:44.000 --> 53:52.000
So it does seem to me that the way we do Internet research is the way we manufacture things.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
That is, you go when you need something. It's on time.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
You don't stockpile anymore.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
Whereas classical library research was much more a matter of systematic stockpiling,

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
but there wasn't really another way of going at it.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
But you wouldn't have kept absolutely everything.

54:08.000 --> 54:14.000
Perhaps a comparison, it's not necessarily a metaphor for the Internet.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
It would be something like the Genetas.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Yeah. Yeah.

54:18.000 --> 54:37.800
The room in the

54:37.800 --> 54:38.800
room.

54:38.800 --> 54:39.800
So it's really good.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.800
There's a lot of rubbish in there, of course.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.800
But you can do new kinds of research.

54:44.800 --> 54:45.800
Absolutely.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.800
And perhaps the Internet is something like that.

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
That's beautiful, yes.

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
I think Carol does have a good point.

54:51.800 --> 54:58.800
There are finding another metaphor and not imposing an older metaphor on the information

54:58.800 --> 55:03.800
that the Internet provides because it's misleading.

55:03.800 --> 55:10.800
And even the digital public library is a classic case of a well-intentioned effort

55:10.800 --> 55:21.800
that was so confined by the traditional notion of librarian metaphor that perhaps the result

55:21.800 --> 55:25.800
or the product they were after wasn't as successful as it might have been

55:25.800 --> 55:31.800
if they could have taken a fresher look and not have been so constrained by the traditional metaphor.

55:31.800 --> 55:36.800
But also like any metaphor, there are parts of it that hold and parts of it that don't.

55:36.800 --> 55:43.800
And we tend to take for granted since it's relatively new that what we put into the Internet

55:43.800 --> 55:46.800
is archived and will be there forever.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.800
Yeah, absolutely.

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
And it's not.

55:48.800 --> 55:54.800
And I need only to remind you of the scientists who have been over the last few months,

55:54.800 --> 56:04.800
desperately and quickly trying to retrieve data from government websites that they fear will soon disappear.

56:04.800 --> 56:08.800
We have this problem in another area.

56:08.800 --> 56:14.800
I've been collecting for the library writers' archives.

56:14.800 --> 56:23.800
And we're young countries, so we have 150, maybe 200 years of written material.

56:23.800 --> 56:32.800
But the last two generations, all their correspondence, all their manuscripts are electronic.

56:32.800 --> 56:42.800
We have some success bringing to the library the electronic material manuscripts.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.800
Well, that's not called the manuscripts, drafts of books.

56:46.800 --> 56:55.800
But the correspondence is very difficult to collect and choose from.

56:55.800 --> 57:02.800
We can't ask the writers to spend an enormous amount of time filtering their correspondence.

57:02.800 --> 57:06.800
We can't do it because we're going to very private things.

57:06.800 --> 57:08.800
And we haven't found a system.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.800
But we know that we have to collect it.

57:11.800 --> 57:20.800
And I was speaking to somebody at the Library of Congress about this because they have obviously the same problems.

57:20.800 --> 57:22.800
Google's already doing that for you.

57:22.800 --> 57:24.800
They're reading everything.

57:24.800 --> 57:25.800
They're reading everything.

57:25.800 --> 57:27.800
But are they preserving it?

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
And I think...

57:28.800 --> 57:30.800
Well, you say can make money on it.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.800
Exactly.

57:32.800 --> 57:41.800
I think, and that's a place where we don't have the commercial resources.

57:41.800 --> 57:50.800
And it is an area where libraries are under-resourced and even the Library of Congress because we do have to preserve the Internet.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.800
We do have to preserve email.

57:52.800 --> 57:56.800
And then we need electronic technological tools to mine it.

57:56.800 --> 58:02.800
Because as you say, we can't curate it in advance. We have to be able to save it on moss.

58:02.800 --> 58:06.800
And then we have to be able to thread through it electronically.

58:06.800 --> 58:22.800
And I am encouraged every day at developments and new professions that we hired a digital archivist about four years ago for just exactly the kinds of material that you are.

58:22.800 --> 58:28.800
Well, there is a method, as you say, for people's manuscripts and records.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Email.

58:29.800 --> 58:34.800
There's a group convening now that's working on email very strongly.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.800
Right.

58:35.800 --> 58:36.800
You let me know where that is.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.800
I'm kind of obsessed.

58:37.800 --> 58:42.800
This is my new cause about Internet preservation and digital preservation.

58:42.800 --> 58:46.800
And it's a huge challenge.

58:46.800 --> 58:55.800
There was a conference recently of kind of very techie types talking about reconfiguring the Internet into something that would self-preserve.

58:55.800 --> 58:58.800
But we are a long ways, I think, from doing that.

58:58.800 --> 59:05.800
But there will have to be technological solutions, but they need to be pressed by archivists and curators.

59:05.800 --> 59:07.800
And so we need to work together in this.

59:07.800 --> 59:14.800
And where the clock is ticking as with all those government sites, everybody is madly downloading.

59:14.800 --> 59:33.800
And then once we find a method to do that, we will have to go to the bureaucratic aspect of this and have, for instance, a legal deposit include things like blogs and certain correspondence and so on.

59:33.800 --> 59:35.800
But we are far from that.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.800
And we've lost an enormous amount.

59:37.800 --> 59:38.800
Oh, yes.

59:38.800 --> 59:39.800
Yes.

59:39.800 --> 59:40.800
Yes.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.800
We won't get back.

59:41.800 --> 59:52.800
So I should have said at the beginning that although I work at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, that nothing I say is necessarily the opinions of that foundation, although it should be.

59:52.800 --> 01:00:06.800
But one of the projects that the Sloan Foundation helped with, in addition to, of course, the Digital Public Library of America and many others, is the Internet Archive.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.800
And that was before I joined the foundation, but I think it's something to be proud of.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.800
And I believe that we had some hand in it.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:26.800
And the best part of it, and one of the favorite names of any foundation project that I know, is that they have something called the Wayback Machine.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:35.800
And for those of us who grew up watching Peabody and Sherman, right, the Wayback Machine is just what it sounds like.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:51.800
And just the same as in the cartoon, where you're able to, not with everything completely, but that's certainly the aspiration, that you're able to look at what a given website was on a given date in the past.

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:57.800
And the thing about IA though is, it, you know, really, it's one guy's vision.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800
It's Bruce Smith.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
Yes, it is.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.800
And thank God.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.800
You know, we're with the little help from his foundation.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800
Yeah, right.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:14.800
It wasn't all his dollars, but, and we start cultural institutions still have a caught up with that.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:25.800
You know, I mean, we're working with him all the time, but that was, that was just the luck of one visionary individual.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:33.800
Well, no, it's the luck of our culture that we've been able to start doing that, and we need to think about how to do it more.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:43.800
And I would just mention that the foundation is also quite interested, not just in saving books and websites and all the rest, but also research data.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:52.800
And research data can be enormously taxing to sort through to make it useful to preserve it.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.800
So these are all questions of the provision of public goods.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.800
Do you have an office, a group of people working on this?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.800
Where does this happen?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:09.800
Well, there's the Alpha Pissant Foundation is a small office, not far from here.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.800
And there are a handful of us who think about, well, as I put it, we're in the public goods business.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:24.800
And I have a colleague, Josh Greenberg, who's very, very much involved with all of these things and knows much more about libraries than I do.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:36.800
And we try to very strategically do some of the things that a private foundation can do that neither the government nor the market system will take care of.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.800
The Mellon Foundation did.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.800
And of course, we're not the only one. We work with other foundations.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.800
But it's one of the reasons why these things have happened in America.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:57.800
It's really an accident of our tax laws that there have been these foundations and that Carnegie saw to spend some of his fortunes on libraries and so on.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.800
So it is something not to be taken for granted, certainly that I appreciate.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.800
And are you sharing this with other countries?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:15.800
Yes, there are conferences on, and actually the European Union has done a certain amount of work in this arena research as well.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:27.800
And on the, your library is probably not a member, but could join the international Internet Preservation Consortium, which is.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.800
So, and I'll send you a few weeks.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.800
Yes, I will send you a few weeks.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.800
But there's, there's, as a historian, I mean, I do see some wider problems.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.800
One is that more of the net is, of the web is closed and open.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.800
And nobody, no public agency is tasked with preserving that.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:53.800
And if you want to know, I mean, most of the data moving digitally, electronically, are not publicly accessible.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800
Right.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:06.800
And that's a big part of the history we're living. That's where all of those credit card purchases that you make, which allow corporations to know where you are and what you do.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.800
And, you know, all of that is also part of the history of the moment.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.800
And I don't know how it will ever be as visible.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:18.800
I'm in the preservation business, so please don't misunderstand me.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:31.800
But is it, is it perhaps because we're looking at the Internet as a library that we're expecting the same conservation and preservation issues as a library?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:38.800
If we saw this as something else, and I don't have a good suggestion, what could we...

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:48.800
I'm thinking of it more as documentary archival resources.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:58.800
But documentary archival resources that you talked about not being able to pre-select, but having to vacuum in somehow and then process somehow.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.800
So I don't think it's the library part, but that's a good question.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:15.800
And I think the struggle about Internet is what... If we could say... We do need a metaphor for the Internet because we can understand better what the IT is, we might be able to grapple with it better.

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:23.800
And of course, as you all know better than I do, we've always lost a significant or majority of what was created.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:28.800
So losing things is something that we've been used to for the past time.

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:38.800
But the difference is you can't find it in an attic later. I mean, this is the thorny part is the absoluteness of it.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.800
But maybe I don't want to give up the metaphor of the library entirely.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:55.800
Because, again, Alexandria, we think that Alexandria was lodged in a corridor of the museum,

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:01.800
which was the house of the Muses and the Muses' mother was never seen in memory.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:18.800
So it has that connection to memory. And so perhaps what we want to preserve is an effort of not allowing ourselves to forget more that we need to forget.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:25.800
I agree. The impulse is powerful. Just like the impulse for the universal library is very powerful.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.800
Absolutely. So it comes back to the word curation, which I think is very, very important in all of this.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:37.800
But it also comes back to this false impression that we have that it's all free.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:47.800
So I'm going to contradict a little of what I said before about the financial considerations being something that we don't have to worry about.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:58.800
The library is, again, an example of something with very, very large fixed costs to get a library going and very small marginal costs.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.800
To have one more person read another book is really essentially costless.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:11.800
Or to have one more person walk into the library at NYU is virtually costless.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:17.800
And so you begin to post one more thing on the internet and so on.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:22.800
So you begin to think of this as really being costless, but it's not.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.800
It's really very, very expensive. And those fixed costs have to be somehow dealt with.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.800
And this is one of the great problems of our time.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:35.800
Because if you think about it, many, many public goods have that character.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:41.800
And it's one of the things which we previously thought of as commercial goods.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.800
So, for example, the very first copy of a newspaper is hugely expensive.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.800
All of the time and effort that went into that.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.800
The next few copies, almost truly.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:08:04.800
The first working pill that comes out of a big pharma is fabulously expensive.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:11.800
And so when you think about the economy like this, and it's part of the technological transformation

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:17.800
that we've been through, is that we get fooled into thinking that another piece of writing,

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.800
another piece of data, another piece of almost anything that we do that's

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:28.800
technologically and electronically like this, we don't have to worry about the cost.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.800
And we don't have to make the hard decisions about what to keep and what not to keep,

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.800
and what's worthwhile and what isn't worthwhile.

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:44.800
And so that's a real danger in all of this, both from a financial point of view,

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:53.800
and how we're going to do important things to society when the technology has turned around so much of this.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:59.800
But it's also just the way that we think about things and the way that we don't value

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:04.800
some of the things that really are valuable, like a writer's letter to someone.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.800
It just seems like another...

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:15.800
Except, as we all know, we don't know what is valuable until we know that we have lost it.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:23.800
Someday in the future, the recording of this conversation will be absolutely essential

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:28.800
because Ken will have the made president of the United States,

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.800
and this is the place where he took that decision.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.800
We don't know if that is going to happen.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.800
I hope for your sake that it won't.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:41.800
But that's actually part of the economics of information altogether.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:49.800
One I mentioned before is that makes it so peculiar as a commodity.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.800
One is that you don't use it up.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.800
One is that it's hard to keep people from getting on it.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:59.800
But another is that you have no idea what it's worth until you've already consumed it.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:07.800
Which is the reason why if you just go at these things with commercial sensibilities, you are in trouble.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.800
We do have some paradoxes.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.800
One of which is in some ways the Google library is the...

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.800
Until the power goes off, it's the safest library there's ever been.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.800
It's multiplied back up, it's constantly refreshed, it's in these enormous server banks all over the world.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.800
There's actually never been as safe a library.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800
Until Google gets bored?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.800
Yes, until the power goes off.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.800
But also it's in the hands of a commercial act.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.800
Absolutely.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.800
But in addition to that, it's also the worst curated such collection.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.800
So it's safer than Widener.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:56.800
One really bad explosion in the boiler system and Widener is a thing of the past.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:02.800
And yet Widener is the greatest curated collection of information there is anywhere.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.800
I think this is very little understood in the world that we...

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.800
Google is spending an enormous amount of money to keep this sort of cod thing,

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.800
which they're obviously not going to complete as they had planned.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:28.800
At this point they must just be trying to decide what's the least embarrassing way to give it to HathiTrust or something like that and stop.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800
But yeah, I think it would be really...

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.800
It's one of these things that would be so wonderful if you could get some of this information into the public realm.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.800
Because I think it's very little known and understood in even the wider sort of thinking, reading public.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:51.800
And that's another aspect of the internet that makes it not a library.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.800
It's so predominantly commercial.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800
Yes.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:01.800
And we think of Google as the air we breathe that we can't live without.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:09.800
And you know, it's got a board and income and it could just go like that and change everything if it shows.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:19.800
Another difference is that there is a hierarchy of truth in a library that doesn't exist on the internet or barely.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.800
So all these alternative facts that we are seeing now.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:36.800
In a conversation the other day, a phrase stuck with me that the library is the place of evidence.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:45.800
And it seems so important to remember that a library is a place where you have a collection of facts.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.800
Some facts contradict each other.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:13:00.800
You have lies of course, but there is a system of curating that filters most of it, not everything.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:12.800
While on the internet I can find proof that the earth is flat and know nothing to contradict it unless I look for it.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:19.800
So perhaps the idea of the hierarchy of truth is part of the difference.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.800
The library also places unequivocal demands which the internet doesn't.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:34.800
When I was learning my field my supervisor was the great Hannah Holborn Gray who later became president of the University of Chicago.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.800
And we had a very good library at the University of Chicago and the new area bit down the road.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:46.800
And every week Mrs. Gray would give me readings and I would read primary sources in Latin and then there would be the secondary sources.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:48.800
There was a book in English, it wasn't very good.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.800
It was a book in French, a little better but not really good.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.800
It was a book in Italian, that was okay, but the book in German.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.800
That was always the right book.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.800
And that's how libraries work.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.800
They challenge you with this polyglot varied, tiered world of very edition.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:10.800
And the internet again doesn't really work that way. You can make it work that way if you want.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.800
But it's not designed to do that to you in quite the same way.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:26.800
Perhaps going back to the idea of metaphor, the internet has not yet found excellent librarians.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:39.800
Because I'm far from being an expert. I don't know what the country of expert is because I am the country of expert as far as the internet is concerned.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.800
And I use it very rarely and it frustrates me enormously.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:54.800
But maybe my son tells me that it's because I haven't found the right search tool if I'm using the right term.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.800
I haven't found the right librarian.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:04.800
It's as if I went into a library and I'm looking for something and the catalogue is not enough.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800
I need a reference librarian.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.800
And that is what I don't find on the internet.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.800
The internet is dynamic and constantly changing.

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:28.800
So that's what makes it totally uncontrollable in the way that reference books and refereed articles which went by a much slower rhythm were.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:38.800
A stable text is not the right way to try to control what's coming out and becoming accessible on the internet.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.800
You have, we don't have a librarian. We all understand that.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:49.800
What you have are very, very clever advertisers who know every click that you're making.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:56.800
So they'll know as much about what you're doing as your librarians have printed and know what you're doing.

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.800
But they won't advise me a librarian.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:04.800
They'll direct you but they will not advise you with any sense of benevolence.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:11.800
You'll have to explain to me how that happens because I haven't found it in a way that's satisfying.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.800
Because no one can make money on that.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:15.800
Right.

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:16.800
There we are.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:22.800
To the extent that the internet is able to make money, they're very good at doing that.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:31.800
Because they follow your clicks. They read not literally but they browse your email and they know about what sorts of things you like.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:43.800
And there are these very fast auctions to decide exactly what advertisement to show to you, given your past and given all the records of what you've done on the internet.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.800
And indeed all the records of things that you haven't done on the internet that are also taken into account.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.800
So there is a very, very finely developed system of making recommendations.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:02.800
Not just for what the next video is that you should order but for everything that you want to do commercial that someone can make money on.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:14.800
The issue is that the kind of scholarship, the kind of curation, the kind of work that libraries do, the kind of thing that we value because that's who we are, you can't make money on that.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:20.800
It's the antithesis of the library because it's not the information and the content that's curated.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.800
It's you, you're rated.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.800
That is very good. That is excellent. That explains it.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.800
And much of the best material on the internet.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:39.800
In the first years of printing, one of the ways that quality was maintained, the printers could not afford to hire characters of the quality that they needed.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:45.800
One of the best ways that you did that was by getting a Franciscan to be your corrector.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:50.800
Because proofreading is an ascetic task and the Franciscan would just be doing his job.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.800
And you really couldn't give him any money because he was a Franciscan.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:12.800
And many of the websites that I use, if you're interested in Latin texts written in the Renaissance, you go to White Trash Scriptorium, which is a text entirely made and curated by one noble person who likes to put up texts of Latin authors.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:24.800
You go to the Shakespeare Institute in Birmingham, which happens why the Shakespeare Institute in Birmingham to have an updated, dynamic list of Latin texts available on the web.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.800
And these things, it really is the equivalent of those Franciscans.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:34.800
These things are done by people who sacrifice themselves because they somehow enjoy or feel virtue is doing it.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:53.800
But I've thought about this for scholarly work in the context of mathematics because Google will probably not, in any time soon, develop, find search tools for looking for formulas or theorems or any of the rest of it because they really can't make money.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.800
But isn't this actually work?

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.800
This is really essential.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.800
So that's a kind of an extreme case.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.800
The dual infomititions use the internet to call it out.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:11.800
They certainly use the internet and it's certainly fantastically useful to be able to pull up papers and from scattered journals here and there and all of the rest of it.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.800
But it's not so easy to find what you want.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:28.800
And so there have been a number of grants, maybe the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, to try to fill in this gap in, say, mathematical search because the commercial interests and others won't do it otherwise.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:37.800
Isn't Wikipedia the mathematical definitions there are maintained as accurately and updated by mathematicians?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800
Yes.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.800
So Wikipedia for math is a reliable reference in a way that it isn't for history.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.800
It is not for literature.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.800
No, or history, or classics, or most other things.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.800
No, it's rather well curated.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.800
And there's a lot of mathematics that you can learn there.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:20:02.800
And duty requires me to mention that the funding and shaping of Wikipedia was another thing that the Sloan Foundation was very much involved with.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.800
And if you think about public goods, and I'm not sure how to mention this, I just did mention it.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.800
That was when I'm not sure how to measure this.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:17.800
But there are people who say that Wikipedia is the largest public good in the history of mankind.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.800
I don't know how you measure it.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:30.800
But it certainly is some kind of public good that's rather significant and perhaps overused or misused, but still really pretty terrific in many ways.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:37.800
How much there's no objection, I think, you have some nodding heads on that, I agree.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:44.800
Oh, I think we're all totally dependent on Wikipedia even when we're infuriated by some of its rules.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:56.800
I'm struck by how much we're talking about the Internet, and you were asking before for metaphors for the Internet.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.800
And I'd like to say the opposite.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.800
I don't want any more metaphors for the Internet.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:09.800
I'm afraid that the Internet is becoming a metaphor to us for everything else, in the same way that perhaps in an earlier age that the Internet is becoming a metaphor to us for everything else,

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:22.800
in the same way that perhaps in an earlier age that the assembly line became a metaphor, consciously or not so consciously, for many, many things,

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.800
and the educational system was arguably put together with that kind of metaphor in mind.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:38.800
I want metaphors for other things, because it's so taken over the way that we think about the world that I'm not worried about getting a metaphor for the Internet.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:51.800
And metaphors for other sorts of things that are also compelling, that are also capture people's imaginations, and that make sure that they know that there are other ways of thinking about the world besides clicking on something.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.800
But that's because you're a mathematician, and you use an exact language.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:07.800
We who have to use the language of words, because it's so unreliable, we have to go to metaphors to have that.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.800
No, I wasn't saying anything about the power and importance of metaphors. I believe in that deep.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:19.800
I was saying that I would rather spend my time looking for metaphors for other things besides the Internet.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:20.800
But I was like...

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:27.800
Because the Internet itself is already becoming such a powerful archetype, such a powerful metaphor, and everyone's thinking.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.800
I was trying to find a metaphor for the Internet that would put it in its place.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:34.800
Well, I would settle for that. That's fine.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.800
But I don't know what that is.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.800
I'm talking, as you say, so much about the Internet.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:51.800
But I suspect that the next generation, or the generation after that, will look at the Internet and look at it in the same way that we look at the typewriter now.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:23:05.800
I don't know... I'm told that there are new technologies that are being developed that won't use the Internet, will use something like the cloud to communicate with the chip in our brain.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:11.800
I don't know if this is science fiction or wishful thinking.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.800
Or the opposite of wishful thinking.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:25.800
Well, on that unsettling note, I'm going to open things up to the audience here.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:26.800
I'm checking our brain.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.800
You'd like to ask a question, but please line up the microphone.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.800
Please keep it in the form of a question.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:58.800
I would like to find out if anyone here thinks there might be a way to establish a library for artwork.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:04.800
I live in a community where a lot of artists continue to make art.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:15.800
And I have seen a lot of the art that they produce go into dumpsters when they die.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:22.800
And I realize you talked about curating.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:41.800
And I'm really not talking about making a museum. I'm talking about making a place that has a curated, but much larger and much more inclusive selection of the works, visual knowledge.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.800
It's not only words. It can be visual.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.800
And that's what visual artists do.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.800
I would anyone like to talk about A.B. Warburg.

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:02.800
You mentioned Warburg.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
It was a way of...

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.800
Why don't you answer the question?

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:20.800
Warburg's library was organized first via the associations of visual images that were meant to lead you into language.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.800
It's an interesting question.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:28.800
Earlier we were talking about how people like to browse images.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:39.800
And is that another way to organize a library in terms of not just through initially language, but images as Warburg?

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:49.800
And the real thing, not reproductions, not books about art, but the art itself.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:26:06.800
I think your concept of art as physical visual document, as opposed to art as revered object in a museum, is a very interesting one.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.800
And we seem to have this kind of extreme of...

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:26.800
Libraries and museums have these different traditions of the way they catalog, make things available, hoard and bring out for exhibits versus begging people to use all the time.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.800
And so that is actually the first time I've heard somebody interested in the arts.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:44.800
How can I say willing to talk about art objects as documents and not quite as sacred?

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:58.800
So the question then is, they're still extremely cumbersome, expensive documents to store, maintain, index catalog, provide access to.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:12.800
So if you think that digitized images of them would not be a substitute, because there are great image libraries, then back to the public good issue.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.800
Is there a compelling enough argument that would gain sufficient philanthropy to do that?

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:20.800
I think it's a great concept.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:37.800
I've really never heard it. I think we make art objects overly special in that sense, and we don't have enough museums and historical societies set up with study centers where you can really learn from them.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:51.800
There's a model in your historical societies used in their loose center and a few others are adopting it, but that was still expensive to create and produce.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.800
So I think it's back to the... what is the inspiration to get that paid for?

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:01.800
That's a very challenging question. What do we retain? What photographs do we retain? What paintings do we retain?

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:06.800
We'll retain your maybe pictures, but we wouldn't necessarily retain money.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.800
I tell you you're elected president.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.800
We do not have an exchange.

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:20.800
You did emphasize that libraries do curate. So you do make decisions.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:40.800
It seems to me there could be decisions, restrictions, a structure for creating a place that does represent in a much larger scope the visual production of what we do.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.800
So it seems like it could be done.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.800
Can I make a tangential remark about visual items?

01:28:52.800 --> 01:29:06.800
So we've been a little bit critical of the way the technology is working and not working for us, but the fact that you can do visual search on the Internet is extraordinary.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:20.800
That is just unbelievable. And the idea that photographs or pieces of art can be readily identified as a kitten with a sunset behind it.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:35.800
Right. This is... when it comes to cataloging and you think of the kind of work that's traditionally been done to assign a few words that you could use to search into a physical card catalog.

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:40.800
Or in others kinds of search engines and key wording and things like this.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:59.800
The idea that artificial intelligence by training it on millions of examples is then able to identify these visual physical other kinds of images is really something very different in the management of information than what we've seen before.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:13.800
And to me, it's like magic. There are dangers in there, things get wrong, and when you start to classify other than photographs, if you start classifying people and their creditworthiness and everything else like that, I get a little bit worried.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:28.800
But it's simply in terms of the kind of function that we thought about doing for books, for literature, for that we can now do something like that and have that kind of search for images is, as I say, like magic.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:32.800
It's akin to the magic of the unconscious.

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:41.800
I mean, when Freud talked about primary process for a second area, and the thing presentations, as opposed to word presentations, is very resonant with that.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.800
Quite literally, this is not formalizable. There are no rules.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:52.800
No one sat down and wrote down kittens look like this, sunsets look like this, and so on.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:31:01.800
It's just that the machines have learned how to do this much the way that a child might learn how to do it.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:19.800
I wonder whether one way to think about these similar differences and different roles, the libraries and the internet plays today is to consider the difference between knowledge and information, where there's a level in the library of curation.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:33.800
So, in a sense, you can say that information has been distilled into knowledge, and some God has created and curated and selected particular pieces to be deposited.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:44.800
And the question is that clearly in the internet, that is not the case, and that's why we have a whole collection of information, whether it's reality or alternative realities.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:32:02.800
And the question is whether there is a way to curate the internet or at least exist a certain aspect in which it could play the role that libraries have played up traditionally until not too long ago.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:09.800
Thank you.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.800
Any takers?

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:19.800
Well, we might not be able to find a metaphor for the internet, but we have to break it down.

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:35.800
And of course, many libraries, organizations, institutions are using the internet in a very effective way that evolves from the processes and the ideals of library work.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:57.800
So it very much is happening, but there's the commercial dimension that you've spoken about so clearly, and the not-for-profit motivated dimension in which a much of what you describe, I believe, is happening very effectively.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:07.800
I think the internet is trying to cultivate citizen curation quite a bit, which seems the only way to tackle it.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:10.800
But as we see, that's a mixed bag.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.800
That's the good and the bad of Wikipedia.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:19.800
It's so vast that seems the only way to tackle it.

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:25.800
So there's some citizens, and then there's other citizens as they engage in that citizen curation.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.800
And there's certainly subsets of curated things on the internet.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:49.800
One of the things we try to do in working with students is help them recognize the sources of content on the internet and which of it has had some kind of authoritative or curatorial hand and which has not.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:34:02.800
The curation of Wikipedia is really something quite marvelous and really not perfect, as we said before, but really quite marvelous and the social engineering of that has been thought through very carefully.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:17.800
And I would just, since we've been drawing these distinctions between commercial considerations and more public interest ones, if it got out that a single curator for Wikipedia was being paid,

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:21.800
I think the model would be over the next day.

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:28.800
People are doing it because they're not being paid, because they feel this kind of calling.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.800
And that's one of the reasons why you can trust it.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.800
Because it's not commercial.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:36.800
Exactly so.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:48.800
So they're asking you for a donation.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.800
Right, they're asking you for a donation, but it's not a commercial endeavor.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.800
I mean, they do, as I said before, there are large costs to these things, and it has to be born somehow.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:17.800
And so coming up with sustainable business models for the provision of public goods is something that any one of us who cares about these things, and particularly those of us who are reading grant applications all the time, have to worry about.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:25.800
And so the fact that there is this roundswell of people who are willing not to be free riders, right?

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:42.800
I mean, that's the issue with all of this, that if you free ride and take advantage of all these sorts of resources without anyone ever wanting to pay for them, then we're in big trouble.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:44.800
Yes, please.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:36:08.800
So to pull together a number of other questions that have been asked or answered or discussed, there's a concept of archives as resistance, and particularly in contemporary archives that are being collected almost as we speak in every country of the world where wars are going on,

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:19.800
people are photographing, people are taking notes, and people are giving oral histories as events are occurring.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:37.800
And the way history and the way we think of historic libraries, for the most part, is history gives historically the view of the, not of the vanquished, but of the victor.

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:59.800
And so these enormous collections that are being curated, many of which are being put on the internet, but others of which are being given to foundations often, and sometimes foundations work with universities which then digitize the collections,

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:11.800
and so that they're available in multiple formats, seems to be, in a sense, another metaphor being created of archives as resistance.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:27.800
And historically, in order to find these hidden works, let's say, it could take, you know, going to 50 libraries around the world and then trying to put things together.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:44.800
You said something which I found fascinating early on, I mean I missed the first part of this discussion, but you seem to make a distinction between knowledge-based archives and reading,

01:37:44.800 --> 01:38:04.800
which I found so startling, because the hints that are given sociologically in terms of political science, any other method, or in terms of postmodern readings of literature, of poetry,

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:21.800
of all kinds of things for new clues to things that had just been considered anecdotal, for instance, or even new clues, you know, when Homer wrote about the origin of the Etruscans,

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:40.800
he said they were starving Turks from Lydia, and that part of his historical writing was simply denied, and then, you know, a couple of thousand years later, the evidence is there, from DNA, from different readings of archaeology,

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:54.800
so they're, you know, from textiles, you can find bits and pieces of information from, I mean, from multiple resources, and even in terms of talking about contemporary art,

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:11.800
this discussion has been going on for 30 or 40 years, every art meeting talks about what to do with contemporary people's art, so now there are ways to break down that art into,

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:27.800
in the conservation field, this has been a big issue in terms of funding archival sources, funding libraries versus funding museums versus funding historical venues,

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:38.800
and sometimes there are things written, let's say, on paintings, so you could say this is a historical resource that should be put in a library,

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:52.800
or in other venues, you know, you can't really break down, there are multiple ways to look at all these things, anyhow, I would like to hear, you know, some comments on all these things, but I would like you also, in particular,

01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:11.800
to expand on what you said, because I found that terribly distressing to hear someone so central to these discussions saying, oh, there's reading, and then there's knowledge-based material.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:31.800
Well, the reading part is because I felt we were being too focused on books, that's all, and that defining, that defining, you know, reading, and that a culture of reading is only if you read a book, I felt was too narrow,

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:41.800
and that it denied all the other collecting, and the importance of all the other collecting that you are, in fact, describing.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.800
But is that true? I mean, there's so much-

01:40:43.800 --> 01:41:00.800
Well, we were, so then we had a discussion about whether how we were using the word reading, that's all. Yeah, so, I mean, that's, it was in the context of this conversation about how we were using the word reading.

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:11.800
Well, in terms of archiving as resistance, there's a certain sense in which it certainly is. It's resistance against the ravages of time.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.800
But I think you were also talking about the political sense, perhaps. Yes.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:23.800
And I was in an interesting conversation just yesterday, when somebody said, well, who's archiving the women's march?

01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:32.800
And I thought, oh, my goodness, that's a really good question. And so there are attempts already to begin doing that.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:40.800
But I would add that the Digital Public Library of America, and once again I would say that my colleague, Dorne Weber, is the expert about that.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:52.800
But I know that one of the original ideas of that was to be able to collect some of the artifacts of small libraries that are scattered through the library.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:42:10.800
That are scattered through the United States, the sorts of not history written by the victors. But the rest of it, this, and to digitize that and to make it centrally available catalogued in a way that people who are interested in what goes on historically,

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:15.800
other than in the Great Halls of Power would have access to it.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:27.800
So most research libraries at this point have, not most, but a good number, very active web archiving, curatorial programs.

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:42.800
And definitely human rights is a big huge one. There's a whole set of libraries working in human rights arena in particular, and trying to divvy up the territory of different kinds of political sites, etc.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.800
So there are things being missed all the time, and then things being very consciously grabbed.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:54.800
I can't tell you who went right for all the women's movement sites, but there's quite an effort in that.

01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:01.800
And this stuff is really hard to manage. We have the Archives of Occupy Wall Street.

01:43:01.800 --> 01:42:46.800
That's probably the most difficult collection that we have to deal with, because also of the artifactual elements of that as well as the

01:42:46.800 --> 01:43:07.800
archive.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.800
And collecting it was really quite an interesting process.

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.800
So libraries are being faced with very new kinds of collecting.

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:25.800
But I think most, at least, academic librarians would be right up there talking about the importance of this kind of content.

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.800
It's interesting you mentioned that you have every, correct me if I'm wrong, but you have everything on Occupy Wall Street.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.800
But we have their archives.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:50.800
Except for the library, because the library had such metaphorical potency that it was discarded by the New York City Police Department, which is another illustration of the power of these metaphors.

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.800
Absolutely ritualistic act.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:01.800
There's a double problem, because the Archives of Power can't be dismissed either.

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.800
They have to be read against their grain as well as with it.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.800
And that is, I think, a huge worry.

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:17.800
As in the current political climate, it's not at all clear that national archives will retain the kind of political independence that they have, in many cases, been able to assert.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.800
I think they're going to be under tremendous pressure.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.800
Well, that's where your librarians will march in the streets.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.800
I hope so.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:28.800
Another question?

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.800
Yes, I have a question.

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.800
I assume you're sort of microcosm of librarians across the country.

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:38.800
And I would wonder if circulation is down.

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:41.800
I don't know if Ken and I want that responsibility.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:50.800
If circulation is down, how has that affected your work vis-a-vis publishing houses and all kinds of things that have a direct impact?

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:58.800
Do you order less books and do you get better quotes from the publishing houses?

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.800
It's a big business and I worry about it.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.800
So that's a very huge question.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.800
It's very huge redundant, but it's a huge question.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:16.800
And I'm also the NYU Press reports to me, so I'm a publisher too, so I have to think about that quite a bit.

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.800
And publishing is certainly changing.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:28.800
It's able to make its way by selling fewer books, by selling electronic books, by having print-on-demand.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.800
The whole economy of publishing is quite different because of the ability to do print-on-demand.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.800
So publishing is adapting.

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:41.800
I think the independent bookstore was something we're speaking of, curation.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:47.800
It's something to worry more about, although that's seeing a tiny resurgence, I hope that stays.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:57.800
But publishers themselves fortunately, there have been a lot of changes in the costs of the business and the models for the business.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:08.800
And some of the things we don't like, the conglomerations and things like that, that publishers have been very at, well, are being agile in managing that.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.800
Libraries absolutely do buy fewer books.

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:18.800
It's also subject specific because there are more art books published than ever before internationally.

01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:30.800
Our circulation has tripled in the past five years and so has the number of outside researchers, and we added 23,000 books to the library last year, plus digital collections, etc.

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:38.800
So each subject area has its different trends, ours is the idiosyncratic trend.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.800
Because of the image.

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.800
Yeah.

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:54.800
I think most of us in humanities are being affected by the multiplication of journals, which are very expensive and which drive books out of the budget between the databases and the journals.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.800
Those are growing exponentially and there just isn't much left.

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:08.800
So, we still buy books, but we don't have the kind of representative collection that we would have had 50 years ago, and nobody does.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800
But you can get your hands on what you need.

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:20.800
You can get your hands on what you need, but it's soon we're going to be at a moment where Cambridge University press produces one copy of the book, which Harvard buys, because only Harvard can afford it.

01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.800
I mean, there's a spiral going on, and it's not going to end well.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:35.800
I mean, we're down to, you know, the library sales of a typical university press book are down to two or three hundred copies.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:44.800
But most university presses have adapted to the kind of mixed books and the costs of what they're doing.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.800
Most of them are still open.

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.800
They have, and they haven't.

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:51.800
I mean, one of the things they don't do is the kind of curation they used to do.

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.800
They don't.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:56.800
They don't have a free, and that they've maintained, but nobody copy edits anymore.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.800
Not quite.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:47:58.800
Yes.

01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.800
We, at the National Library of Argentina, we've gone in the different direction.

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:13.800
I've increased the number of characters and editors, but I have dwindled to almost nothing, the printed books.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.800
We're doing everything digital.

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800
We're saying this.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:19.800
I feel like the Pope defending Islam.

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.800
But we have to do it.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.800
But on the question of journals, there's also the word bundling that comes up.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:40.800
And there used to be many, many cross-subsidies, which were ways of providing public goods that happen because of bundling of one sort or another.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:48.800
And the drive towards the commercial, the drive towards doing everything digitally has made people,

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.800
I mean, if you think about your cable substitution, right?

01:48:51.800 --> 01:49:00.800
The cost of adding another channel is virtually zero, but the cost of getting all of that to you, the fixed cost of doing that is very high.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:07.800
And again, we're at a loss as to how to price these things in a way that does what society needs.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:16.800
And once you start unbundling all the cross-subsidies in a research hospital, or all the cross-subsidies in a research university,

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.800
then you may be left with only the things that make money.

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.800
And that's scarce.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.800
Yes.

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.800
Yes.

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.800
We'll have to end it.

01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.800
One more?

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.800
Yes, quickly.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.800
Yes, your question, please.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:36.800
The need of the library is that we store everything.

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:39.800
What about the possibility of ephemera?

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:42.800
Is there a line we ever draw?

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.800
The obvious example is what happens to a Bernini fireworks show.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.800
If it happened today, we can photograph it.

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:56.800
But perhaps it was intended to ephemera and legitimately remains ephemera.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.800
And this might put a limit on what we're talking about.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.800
Thank you.

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.800
Well, it depends on which ephemera.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:11.800
We have lots of 17th century fireworks shows because the prints, which record them, are extremely valuable.

01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:17.800
They're curated and kept, probably more than 21st century fireworks shows.

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:25.800
But I think ephemera goes back to the whole world of ephemera on the web, some of which are of great value and interest,

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:34.800
and which are certainly not being preserved at the level that would make everybody feel happy and confident about them.

01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:43.800
As time goes by, the notion of what has to be preserved of ephemera changes.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:49.800
I'm sorry to keep talking about the National Library, which we're doing many things.

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:59.800
I've assigned a group of photographers to go out into the cities and photograph graffiti,

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:07.800
because we had no records of the graffiti, because of course, up to a few years, it was considered just vandalism.

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:14.800
So this is an example of what we can do.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.800
But we now have a metaphor for the Internet fireworks show.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.800
I don't know if that's practical.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.800
That's a good one.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:35.800
Please join me in thanking our discussions today for the professor.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:55.800
That was fun.
