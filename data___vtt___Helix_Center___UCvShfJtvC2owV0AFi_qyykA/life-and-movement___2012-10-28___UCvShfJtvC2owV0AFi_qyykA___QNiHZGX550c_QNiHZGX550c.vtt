00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
I want to welcome you to this roundtable at the Helix Center.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.080
I'm Ed Nursecien, the Director of the Center.

00:09.080 --> 00:16.960
Today's roundtable and tomorrow's on men men competition was proposed and organized by

00:16.960 --> 00:20.920
Maxinshes Johnson, who is here.

00:20.920 --> 00:27.000
Just one announcement is that the program we have with the program tomorrow, we end the

00:27.000 --> 00:38.800
October month and then in November we have a roundtable on animal language.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.960
So I will introduce Maxin and then she will introduce the other participants.

00:43.960 --> 00:50.160
Maxinshes Johnson is a philosopher whose first life was a dancer, choreographer, professor

00:50.160 --> 00:52.920
of dance and a dance scholar.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.720
She has an ongoing courtesy professor appointment in the Department of Philosophy at the University

00:58.720 --> 01:05.720
of Oregon and she has published numerous articles and a number of books.

01:05.720 --> 01:13.120
Her books are The Roots of Thinking, The Roots of Power, Animate Form and Gendered Bodies,

01:13.120 --> 01:19.560
The Roots of Morality, The Primacy of Movement and the Corporal Turn and Interdisciplinary

01:19.560 --> 01:21.240
Readers.

01:21.240 --> 01:26.600
She received an MA in dance and a PhD in dance and philosophy from the University of Wisconsin

01:26.600 --> 01:30.480
where she also studied evolutionary biology.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.200
She was awarded a distinguished fellowship for her studies of xenophobia by the Institute

01:36.200 --> 01:42.120
of Advanced Study, Durham University, the United Kingdom in its inaugural years, the

01:42.120 --> 01:46.400
team of which was the legacy of Charles Darwin.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
Maxin.

01:47.400 --> 02:00.880
Thank you and I'm going to just stand up for this part because I want to introduce all

02:00.880 --> 02:02.880
of you to everyone here.

02:02.880 --> 02:12.320
But first I would like first to thank Ed Narsesian and Mary for their wonderful hospitality.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.360
It's been quite extraordinary.

02:14.360 --> 02:20.360
I want also to thank Robert Pinser for all of his work on the website.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.720
I don't know who Robert Pinser is but.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.720
Couldn't be anything.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.720
Ah.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
Pardon?

02:26.720 --> 02:27.720
Could I?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
Could I?

02:28.720 --> 02:29.720
Sit through.

02:29.720 --> 02:30.720
Thank you.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.720
Ah.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.720
Thank you.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.720
Yes.

02:33.720 --> 02:44.320
For anyway, the website and all of the emails that were sent out in terms of the website.

02:44.320 --> 02:50.000
In terms of this roundtable discussion.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.320
I also wanted to mention that I was delighted that the Helix Center had started again.

02:56.320 --> 03:01.600
I think it's just a wonderful institution and I hope it thrives and continues because

03:01.600 --> 03:09.200
I think it's a great wonderful thing to do for the community and for being open to the

03:09.200 --> 03:10.760
public as it is.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.800
I think it's really quite a unique institution.

03:14.800 --> 03:22.000
So I would like to just say yay for the Helix Center.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.120
I also want to say that one of the participants cannot be here tonight.

03:28.120 --> 03:35.280
Linda Kapourial, she has a very highly seriously injured hamstring and she could not make it

03:35.280 --> 03:39.560
from Renslauer Institute.

03:39.560 --> 03:43.800
So she will not be joining us.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.000
Jesus Yalundein.

03:47.000 --> 04:01.080
We have a somewhat, actually I guess, an international duo of participants.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.560
Jesus is from Spain and from the Basque country.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.560
Is that all right?

04:06.560 --> 04:07.560
Yeah.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.000
It's really strange to know that doesn't it?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.240
He is an associate professor of philosophy.

04:13.240 --> 04:21.120
He teaches very widely in the area of philosophy, everything in epistemology to the kind of

04:21.120 --> 04:27.600
lowly subject of aesthetics in philosophy.

04:27.600 --> 04:38.240
And he was awarded various distinctions awarded to him from the university, one of which I

04:38.240 --> 04:39.440
can't remember the name.

04:39.440 --> 04:46.520
It's the Samuel Ege Graf Faculty Achievement Award in 2008 and 2009 and the Allen and Pat

04:46.520 --> 04:49.800
Kelly Faculty Scholar Award.

04:49.800 --> 04:53.800
So he has been very active in promoting philosophy.

04:53.800 --> 05:04.320
His main area of interest in terms of his life as well as his, both academically and real

05:04.320 --> 05:08.320
life, is sports.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.920
And as he put down in his self description, it's his main interests are in pedaling and

05:13.920 --> 05:17.960
swimming.

05:17.960 --> 05:26.200
I want also to introduce Scott Kelso, who was founder and director for 20 years of the

05:26.200 --> 05:32.560
Center for Behavioral and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.840
He has had a highly distinguished career.

05:36.840 --> 05:48.680
This serves both in Dublin in a newly...

05:48.680 --> 05:51.760
Derry.

05:51.760 --> 05:59.160
In Ulster, he has a visiting professorship there as well as his continuing studies and

05:59.160 --> 06:03.840
work and supervisions at Florida Atlantic University.

06:03.840 --> 06:10.360
He's well known for his book on dynamic patterns and his more recent book that he co-edited

06:10.360 --> 06:17.600
with somebody from Denmark on complementarity.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.720
So I also want to introduce...

06:19.720 --> 06:25.400
I have never had this pleasure before, but I want to introduce my husband, Albert A.

06:25.400 --> 06:33.280
Johnstone, who is going to fill in as needed for Linda.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.480
I'm sorry, really, that all of you weren't present at the very lively discussion that

06:38.480 --> 06:44.280
we had over dinner because I thought that we should all meet beforehand and have some

06:44.280 --> 06:47.520
kind of interchanges because no one knew each other, really.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.720
I knew them, but they didn't know each other at all.

06:50.720 --> 06:57.240
And we had a very wonderful, lively conversation at dinner time thinking about what we would

06:57.240 --> 06:58.560
talk about here.

06:58.560 --> 07:04.560
So that said, I hope I didn't leave anything out.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.880
So we were going to talk about life and movement.

07:08.880 --> 07:14.200
And there are a few remarks that I just want to make just generally before we start.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.560
And that is that to begin with, we are all movement-born.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.240
We are precisely not stillborn.

07:22.240 --> 07:28.600
The second thing that I would like to say is that movement forms the eye that moves before

07:28.600 --> 07:33.600
the eye that moves forms movement.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.360
The third thing I'd like to say is that infants aren't pre-linguistic.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.720
Language is post-kinetic.

07:43.720 --> 07:52.880
I think those are major insights that can be empirically demonstrated and empirically

07:52.880 --> 07:57.720
investigated for the benefit of all.

07:57.720 --> 08:07.120
Oh, I should also mention that just by way of, in case I have any lapses or stumblings,

08:07.120 --> 08:14.480
we are from the central Oregon coast in a little village called Yahats, which is called

08:14.480 --> 08:17.160
the gem of the Oregon coast.

08:17.160 --> 08:21.120
And it took us 21 hours to get to New York.

08:21.120 --> 08:26.120
And we arrived at six o'clock this morning, and we had four hours sleep.

08:26.120 --> 08:31.400
So if I have lapses, I hope you will please forgive me because it's just a matter of lack

08:31.400 --> 08:38.640
of fortitude and 82 that can be quite telling.

08:38.640 --> 08:46.440
But anyway, I wanted to mention too that the last chapter of the primacy of movement in

08:46.440 --> 08:52.120
this expanded edition that came out in 2011, that the last chapter, which is part of the

08:52.120 --> 08:59.560
expanded edition, starts out with a sentence that movement is coming to the fore, though

08:59.560 --> 09:03.480
it's not yet called by its real name.

09:03.480 --> 09:12.280
It's very often talked about in terms of embodiment, embodied subjectivity, embodied self, embodied

09:12.280 --> 09:17.000
experience, and lo and behold, even embodied movement.

09:17.000 --> 09:25.480
And that really you can find in the notable neuroscientist Francisco Varela in an article

09:25.480 --> 09:31.440
he co-wrote with Natalie Depros, who's a well-known French philosopher.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.160
And you can find it as well in a book called Embodied Cognition, which is written by a

09:36.160 --> 09:40.280
psychologist by the name of Raymond Gibbs.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.000
So the term embodiment is bandied around a lot.

09:45.000 --> 09:52.600
I call it a lexical band aid because what it does is just, you put it in front of something

09:52.600 --> 09:56.640
and it's supposed to make everything okay because it comes from the body.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.760
So you can talk about embodied language, you can talk about embodied anything, and it doesn't

10:01.760 --> 10:09.600
really elucidate what it is that you're focusing on in the way that, with the amplitude that

10:09.600 --> 10:12.000
it can or should be.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.200
Something similar can be said in terms, from my way of thinking, in terms of an inactive

10:18.200 --> 10:26.920
approach, which also slides by the realities of movement because it ends up being not only

10:26.920 --> 10:33.000
an active approach but in terms of inaction, but then you have to embed the body and you

10:33.000 --> 10:42.920
have to extend the mind and you have to, what is the other thing that they talk about?

10:42.920 --> 10:49.840
Well just embodied minds, they talk about embodied minds which are embedded and then extended.

10:49.840 --> 10:54.440
So anyway, they're not really, to my mind, getting at the heart of movement, which is

10:54.440 --> 10:56.720
dynamics.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.480
And until you realize that movement is about dynamics, it seems to me that you don't really

11:01.480 --> 11:06.840
get to understanding movement at all.

11:06.840 --> 11:12.800
And in terms of the life and movement, Roundtable itself here tonight, it's interesting that

11:12.800 --> 11:16.720
someone when it was mentioned that it was going to be about life and movement, that that

11:16.720 --> 11:24.080
was the title, someone said, oh you're going to talk about animal communication.

11:24.080 --> 11:29.520
Life and movement has, pardon?

11:29.520 --> 11:37.520
That has to do with, life and movement has to do with us as living, moving beings.

11:37.520 --> 11:45.840
So I think it's really important that we bring this topic up for discussion.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.440
Then I just wanted to mention a few quotations.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.680
One is from Aristotle.

11:51.680 --> 11:56.440
Aristotle wrote that nature is a principle of motion and change.

11:56.440 --> 12:04.240
We should therefore understand what we mean by motion because otherwise nature would not

12:04.240 --> 12:07.160
be understood at all.

12:07.160 --> 12:13.400
The second person that I'd like to just refer to is a philosopher by the name of Edmund

12:13.400 --> 12:22.040
Husserl, who is the founder of phenomenology, who said and wrote about the fact that I move

12:22.040 --> 12:26.600
precedes I do or I can do.

12:26.600 --> 12:32.120
But what he meant by I can do is not simply I can run and I can jump and I can do these

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
things.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
But I can calculate.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.880
I can judge.

12:35.880 --> 12:42.200
I can do all these things, but in the beginning everything precedes from I move.

12:42.200 --> 12:48.480
All of our repertoire of I cans is generated on the principle of I move.

12:48.480 --> 12:57.040
And finally I would like to cite Darwin, who wrote that experience shows that the mind

12:57.040 --> 13:03.400
cannot be understood by attacking the citadel itself.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.080
And is a function of body.

13:07.080 --> 13:14.760
We must therefore understand, no, we must therefore find and argue from some stable

13:14.760 --> 13:25.680
foundation from which, I got that mixed up, we must bring some stable foundation from

13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
which to argue.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.840
We must bring and he underscored stable.

13:29.840 --> 13:35.400
So that was, experience shows the problem of the mind cannot be solved by attacking the

13:35.400 --> 13:37.120
citadel itself.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.400
The mind is function of body.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.640
We must bring some stable foundation to argue from.

13:43.640 --> 13:48.600
Now I wouldn't say that we need to argue from that, but we need to show it.

13:48.600 --> 13:55.440
And the problem is that what, I mean if you say to somebody what study movement, how can

13:55.440 --> 13:58.480
you study movement, it won't stay still.

13:58.480 --> 14:05.520
So with that, we will start our discussion.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.960
And hope we can pin it down.

14:09.960 --> 14:16.160
So I thought that we might start out with this question of life and movement with respect

14:16.160 --> 14:21.440
to, I didn't finish introducing Bert.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.920
Is it fine?

14:22.920 --> 14:29.800
I'm having one of my lapses from, Bert is a philosopher, also a courtesy professor at

14:29.800 --> 14:31.080
the University of Oregon.

14:31.080 --> 14:41.000
He's currently writing a book called the Pan-Culturality of, on the Pan-Culturalt Human.

14:41.000 --> 14:49.320
And he's just published an article having to do with emotions, which ties emotions to

14:49.320 --> 14:55.280
basic somatic responses, which is a very interesting article and it's published in a journal called

14:55.280 --> 14:57.960
Whoser All Studies.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.440
Sorry.

15:01.440 --> 15:06.360
So we're starting our session then on life and movement.

15:06.360 --> 15:12.000
And the first question that was generated was what is the nature of life and movement?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.240
And as I said, I think that our clue comes in dynamic.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.760
So do you want to start in, Scott?

15:18.760 --> 15:26.400
But just to follow up with Maxine, it's a pleasure being here this evening.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.560
It's very courageous that people want to Friday evening to come and talk about this

15:30.560 --> 15:34.120
topic and discuss it.

15:34.120 --> 15:44.760
Just to grind what Maxine has been saying, I am an experimentalist in a way of matters

15:44.760 --> 15:47.320
of movement.

15:47.320 --> 15:56.520
And I want to tell you about a little study that was done, I think, by...

15:56.520 --> 15:58.320
Okay.

15:58.320 --> 16:03.560
Caroline Rové-Kagier.

16:03.560 --> 16:12.240
And just to make it clear what we're talking about here in terms of dynamics and coordination,

16:12.240 --> 16:18.640
little babies, two months old, spontaneously kick.

16:18.640 --> 16:23.880
And when they're comfortable and fed, they kick quite a lot.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.280
Well what Caroline did was very clever.

16:27.280 --> 16:36.880
She tied a string to the toe of the baby and connected it to a mobile.

16:36.880 --> 16:42.320
And so when the baby kicked, the mobile moved.

16:42.320 --> 16:52.080
And at a certain point in time, about 13 or 14 weeks of age, the baby realized this is

16:52.080 --> 16:54.840
me doing that.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.800
Right?

16:56.800 --> 17:06.520
So now the baby sees what psychologists might say a connection between what they're doing

17:06.520 --> 17:08.840
and what they're seeing.

17:08.840 --> 17:12.560
And in fact it's a very lawful relationship.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.360
You move, the mobile moves, the mobile moves, you move.

17:17.360 --> 17:21.120
It's a coupled dynamical system.

17:21.120 --> 17:26.600
So when you hear about motion and dynamics, you often think about physics.

17:26.600 --> 17:29.640
But actually that's only part of the story.

17:29.640 --> 17:34.640
The part of the story has to do with the dynamics of the coordination.

17:34.640 --> 17:41.760
And in this case, as a scientist you ask, what are the relevant quantities that describe

17:41.760 --> 17:47.960
this coordination between the organism, in this case the baby, and the lawful effects

17:47.960 --> 17:54.400
that the organism has on his or her world and vice versa.

17:54.400 --> 18:00.720
So when we talk about dynamics, or at least when I talk about dynamics, I'm often talking

18:00.720 --> 18:09.120
about coupled dynamical systems and the scientific questions are, in terms of understanding,

18:09.120 --> 18:15.680
what are the relevant quantities that wrap up or capture the coordination, and then what

18:15.680 --> 18:18.080
form did the dynamics take?

18:18.080 --> 18:25.200
And that means that actually you would want to, if you could, formally write equations

18:25.200 --> 18:29.040
of motion for the relevant quantities.

18:29.040 --> 18:34.000
Let me just say a few further words about this.

18:34.000 --> 18:42.440
I often tell my students, because when people think about motion, they think about physics

18:42.440 --> 18:44.000
typically.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.480
But that's not what we're talking here about tonight.

18:47.480 --> 18:55.200
We're talking as Maxine has written beautifully about, we're talking about animated motion.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.680
We're talking about agency here.

18:58.680 --> 19:04.880
We're not just talking about movement as some disembodied state of affairs, but rather we're

19:04.880 --> 19:11.080
talking about voluntary, purposeful activity.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.000
And often that's spontaneous and we can go on and talk about that.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.680
So the key point then is how do we understand purposeful animated movement?

19:24.680 --> 19:30.480
You might say, well, we have the physics of the inanimate, actually we've got very beautiful

19:30.480 --> 19:33.560
descriptions of that.

19:33.560 --> 19:39.160
But isn't it strange that we don't have a science of the animated movement?

19:39.160 --> 19:46.640
And could it be actually that this is something we just take for granted so much.

19:46.640 --> 19:51.040
It's so much a part of us that we take it for granted.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.280
And so we don't see the mystery in it somehow.

19:54.280 --> 20:02.600
We've lost the ability to look at something and see that this is a mysterious process.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.440
How does it really work?

20:04.440 --> 20:10.680
And this little example of the baby suddenly realize movement forms the eye that moves

20:10.680 --> 20:18.000
before the eye that moves forms movement in sheets, Johnson terms, is exactly like that.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.960
This is the origins of agency here.

20:20.960 --> 20:26.800
And the origins of agency in this case comes by virtue of a coupling between the organism

20:26.800 --> 20:28.480
and the environment.

20:28.480 --> 20:35.440
And the quantities that capture that are what science wants to go after, actually, in well-defined

20:35.440 --> 20:38.040
experimental conditions and so on.

20:38.040 --> 20:44.560
So you might just say one or two further words about this because there is an issue here

20:44.560 --> 20:48.120
because movement is so much a part of all of us.

20:48.120 --> 20:53.600
There are facial gestures, the way you speak, the way you sit, you're shifting pastures,

20:53.600 --> 20:54.600
all of this.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.360
It's part of this.

20:56.360 --> 21:03.280
You might say, well, you know, I want to study the real thing.

21:03.280 --> 21:09.400
You know, I want to study it in the wild, as it were.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.440
And of course, that's interesting to do that.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.320
And people are doing that.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.480
And there are fields, for example, in sports.

21:17.480 --> 21:26.160
There may be a segue into Hissus, but they're studying that in real world settings.

21:26.160 --> 21:31.560
But in science, the progress has always been that there has to be an abstraction somehow.

21:31.560 --> 21:36.920
You see, going back to Newton didn't give you the laws of motion for a falling leaf.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.840
The reason is that the falling leaf, if you look around you today in New York City, how

21:41.840 --> 21:43.000
do leaves fall?

21:43.000 --> 21:46.920
Well, they tumble and they rotate and sometimes they go straight down.

21:46.920 --> 21:53.320
Depending on many, many factors, and the leaves are different, and so on.

21:53.320 --> 22:00.880
So the point is that the apocryphal story of the apple falling on Newton's head was the

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
abstraction.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.840
That's the key thing.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.280
He abstracted out of that the notion of a point mass.

22:07.280 --> 22:13.560
He ignored friction, for goodness sake, which is something that we would find very difficult

22:13.560 --> 22:19.400
to ignore, a natural property like that.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.840
And that's how he got to the essence of the problem.

22:22.840 --> 22:27.720
Or Galileo rolling a ball down an inclined plane.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.760
Somehow now from there you go to the motions of the planets.

22:30.760 --> 22:36.320
This is what one would say a science of movement could be about.

22:36.320 --> 22:46.040
Just to say we need to see what the abstractions are so that we can do the dynamics on those

22:46.040 --> 22:51.360
relevant variables.

22:51.360 --> 22:58.880
In my own case, the inspiration for that came from a very, very strange place because when

22:58.880 --> 23:06.000
I was a graduate student in Wisconsin, people were talking about movements as strings of

23:06.000 --> 23:14.080
reflexes or as a consequence of cybernetic devices that have reference mechanisms and

23:14.080 --> 23:19.600
comparators, and you compare feedback to those reference mechanisms, and you adjust the program

23:19.600 --> 23:21.440
of movement and so on.

23:21.440 --> 23:32.160
But none of this actually gives you much insight into the nature of spontaneous movement behavior.

23:32.160 --> 23:39.600
And actually for that one had to go to other places I think and ask in general, how do

23:39.600 --> 23:44.000
patterns in nature form spontaneously in the first place?

23:44.000 --> 23:48.040
And there you have to broaden the entire issue.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.920
So perhaps that is enough.

23:49.920 --> 23:58.520
I think the key point here is that agency arises out of a coupling with the world, and

23:58.520 --> 24:05.400
that to do a science on that you have to find out what the relevant quantities are and their

24:05.400 --> 24:06.400
dynamics.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.080
You cannot say this is a force, this is an amplitude.

24:09.080 --> 24:16.360
We don't know often what the relevant quantities are to proceed and do scientific research.

24:16.360 --> 24:22.000
And the third thing would be that let's not take the whole thing for granted because that's

24:22.000 --> 24:26.680
what we've done, and the whole issue of agency is tied up with movement and we have to make

24:26.680 --> 24:28.880
the appropriate abstractions.

24:28.880 --> 24:32.480
Do you want to respond to that, Jesus?

24:32.480 --> 24:35.480
Well, I know someone said response and they elaborate.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.200
I'll take that maybe, compliments what you're saying.

24:39.200 --> 24:44.120
As Kat is talking about the abstractions and the calculations, right, that you go into

24:44.120 --> 24:49.480
movement and you abstract what's common to it and how things coordinate and systems and

24:49.480 --> 24:50.480
so on.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.480
Can you hear back there?

24:51.480 --> 24:52.480
Can you hear me there?

24:52.480 --> 24:53.480
Oh.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.480
Okay.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.120
Adolphly louder.

24:56.120 --> 25:00.200
But I guess we're on coming from somebody who looks at philosophy and sport together.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.680
I want to bring more of a qualitative aspect of things.

25:02.680 --> 25:07.480
Instead of so much the quantity and look at in terms of formula which are very needed

25:07.480 --> 25:09.200
to understand things on one level.

25:09.200 --> 25:14.680
I want to maybe capture what does it feel like to do something and what does it call

25:14.680 --> 25:16.120
it to come from.

25:16.120 --> 25:21.400
And maybe to bring it back to the issue of coordination just today or I was waiting for

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
dinner.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.600
I went for a little walk.

25:23.600 --> 25:28.640
And I saw this young lady with a little puppy.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.960
She wasn't walking the dog.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.520
She was running the little dog.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.040
They're right down the street.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.280
She's laughing and they're both kind of doing like little tag team.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.280
She runs ahead.

25:36.280 --> 25:41.080
She keeps, you know, and just looking at her and the puppy running in many things.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.680
What is this about life and movement in this image right here?

25:44.680 --> 25:49.320
And the way I look at it, it would be in terms of, and maybe you can tell me what are

25:49.320 --> 25:52.600
the underpinnings and how this works at a deeper level.

25:52.600 --> 26:00.080
But the way I look at it was in terms of, well, there's a certain exuberance to life.

26:00.080 --> 26:04.280
An exploration of possibilities, if you will, of what's possible, the puppy is trying to

26:04.280 --> 26:05.600
see how to move in the world.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.880
It's running around and doing different explanatory movements.

26:08.880 --> 26:13.720
There is also an expansion of the possibilities of those movements that comes with that as

26:13.720 --> 26:15.720
well.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.320
And as well, there was a coordination.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.840
They had to coordinate two of them so they couldn't hang up with each other.

26:20.840 --> 26:26.200
So if I look at coordination at a higher level, it's a way they are collaborating.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.800
And the way, for example, the philosophy of sport, we look at this, it's quite a long

26:29.800 --> 26:30.800
time.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.920
People looked at movement in sports or in other aspects of life in terms of competition,

26:35.920 --> 26:38.400
in kind of zero-sum game.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.480
Some have to prevail here and so on.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.120
And there are new models that are coming out to try to explain more in terms of collaboration

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
or cooperation.

26:45.120 --> 26:51.720
They're trying to say, well, the fact that there may be two athletes or two beings trying

26:51.720 --> 26:56.440
to be in the lead, like the puppy and the young lady, doesn't mean that they have to

26:56.440 --> 26:58.200
be a winner and a loser.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.280
There could be a way of cooperating such that both of us win, but we have to come out with

27:03.280 --> 27:04.280
different frameworks.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.080
And here's the quality, right?

27:06.080 --> 27:12.880
To some extent, in you pushing me and me pushing you, we bring the best out of ourselves

27:12.880 --> 27:15.320
in whatever activity we care about, for example.

27:15.320 --> 27:20.440
And I think something important about movement, the way we experience it as human beings, is

27:20.440 --> 27:24.760
the fact that it's meaningful to us in a very, very concrete manner.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.320
When we're moving about, there are some movements that speak to us.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.400
If we walk in, it could be a skating dancing, swimming, or something else.

27:32.400 --> 27:37.880
There is a way to explore the richness of life in this way, I think.

27:37.880 --> 27:42.160
And it seems to me that by looking at this in different levels, whether we're looking

27:42.160 --> 27:48.440
at it with mathematical equations or trying to look at it from a choreography perspective,

27:48.440 --> 27:53.600
as a choreographer, as an athlete, there are ways to try to understand movement that pay

27:53.600 --> 27:57.440
attention to what it is like as a lead experience.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.880
And to do that, I would like to say that we also have to, in addition to doing laboratory

28:01.880 --> 28:05.640
experiments, which I think are very needed to understand what happens really at the inner

28:05.640 --> 28:07.720
working, so to speak.

28:07.720 --> 28:13.160
I think it's also important to look at practices that show us maybe movement in different gradations.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.360
And that's why I'm just going to give you a sports, for example.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.600
You have the level from an office to an expert.

28:18.600 --> 28:23.840
I'm very interested in extra movement, people who do things to an extremely good level of

28:23.840 --> 28:24.840
things.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.760
Could be a dance writer, an Olympic athlete, a choreographer, or could be maybe someone

28:28.760 --> 28:33.840
who maybe makes a source for cabinets.

28:33.840 --> 28:36.320
But they have particular movements, home to perfection.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.360
What does it tell us about what's possible for us to move like?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.960
I think in a way they are also inspiring to us.

28:41.960 --> 28:46.880
So the way I look at it also is not so much in terms of dynamics, but also in terms of

28:46.880 --> 28:49.040
high matters for our existence.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.080
I find that it's coming very inspirational.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.160
They show us different ways to move that we didn't think of otherwise.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.760
Well, I never thought of moving that way, maybe.

28:56.760 --> 29:01.520
So the way that I'm interested in looking at movement, and I think that it's important,

29:01.520 --> 29:07.200
and I may come to respond to it later, and so on, is how certain activities, what I like

29:07.200 --> 29:14.080
to call active pursuits that happen through movement, help us to nurture a way to excel

29:14.080 --> 29:17.920
as beings that, you know, in a way we're put together to move in the world.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.840
I think life and movement, they are in a way to sass with the same coin.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
Life expresses self-removement.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.840
It can be otherwise.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.680
The moment you have passivity, you have death.

29:27.680 --> 29:28.680
Okay?

29:28.680 --> 29:34.440
So I think by trying to explore these possibilities, and exploring life also in rich and sour

29:34.440 --> 29:41.600
lives at different levels, both as a scientist or a philosopher or a historian or so, one

29:41.600 --> 29:43.960
of the different ways to look into this.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.720
Something we cannot help do is move, and I think trying to explore it and understand

29:47.720 --> 29:48.920
is very important.

29:48.920 --> 29:54.240
To me, I'm very interested in exploring possibilities, because like Ortega said, who was a Spanish

29:54.240 --> 29:59.000
philosopher, he used to say, we come to life full of possibilities, but life itself proves

29:59.000 --> 30:00.560
them very quickly.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.200
So the more you explore, the more that's possible, the more directly you go to the rich and enjoy

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
life, to some extent.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.480
And I think part of that involves, and I'm not going to close with this, is being able

30:09.480 --> 30:12.200
to be creative and spontaneous.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.200
Okay?

30:13.200 --> 30:17.760
It supports what I find interesting is they give you clear constraints.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.160
They have rules you have to serve.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.120
So in basketball, you cannot kick the ball into the hoop.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.160
Of course, very difficult, not that you want to do it that way, but, or in soccer, you

30:26.160 --> 30:28.560
cannot use your hands, right?

30:28.560 --> 30:34.000
So they give you constraints within which to be very creative, if you will.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.280
Through these constraints, we learned to use our imagination to solve practical, artificial

30:39.280 --> 30:40.280
problems.

30:40.280 --> 30:45.000
We can also learn about movement in those constraints as to how we are creative and how

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
to actually be spontaneous.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.640
What is the spontaneous movement or creative?

30:47.640 --> 30:49.440
Are they the same or different?

30:49.440 --> 30:53.160
So these are some of the questions that I can ask myself about the movement.

30:53.160 --> 30:56.320
I think maybe that's a bramble for myself.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.320
Thanks.

30:57.320 --> 31:05.000
I'd like to follow up on one thing, but let me ask Bert if he has any questions or comments.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.280
If you're going to talk about movement, it seems to me there are three other things you

31:10.280 --> 31:12.800
have to bring in automatically.

31:12.800 --> 31:20.360
I mean, if you're talking about human movement and not the movement of a robot, for example,

31:20.360 --> 31:24.120
you have to bring in consciousness.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.960
When I'm unconscious, I don't do anything very interesting.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.160
I don't think I'm exceptional in that regard.

31:32.160 --> 31:39.040
You have to be conscious and your awareness, what you know, comes into play and so forth.

31:39.040 --> 31:43.480
Or acquired skills or quiet knowledge.

31:43.480 --> 31:48.760
But your deep consciousness, you also need feeling.

31:48.760 --> 31:53.720
If a human doesn't feel, it's not going to move.

31:53.720 --> 31:59.680
If an form of animate life doesn't feel, it's not going to move.

31:59.680 --> 32:09.600
Well, that gives you some kind of motive among other things for the movement.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.560
And then thirdly, you have to have spontaneity.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.200
I mean, you find that in your own movement.

32:16.200 --> 32:20.040
That's the only sense in which I'm saying you have to have that.

32:20.040 --> 32:26.280
That is, if you look at human experience, you will find that every time you move, you're

32:26.280 --> 32:33.720
conscious, you have some motivation and you're spontaneous.

32:33.720 --> 32:42.880
And spontaneity is a little bit puzzling as a phenomenon because you know what it is

32:42.880 --> 32:48.400
because you're there, you exist, you exist.

32:48.400 --> 33:00.320
But when you're doing science to cover that, I find it very puzzling how to do it.

33:00.320 --> 33:09.280
And it's an essential ingredient.

33:09.280 --> 33:17.120
When you have a feeling of some kind, suppose you feel cold, well, you find that you react

33:17.120 --> 33:24.680
automatically, you do something, you start closing off to keep warm presumably.

33:24.680 --> 33:32.160
Now that's automatic and that can very well be explained through science.

33:32.160 --> 33:36.200
But then you get a further element that comes in.

33:36.200 --> 33:47.560
I can, realizing that I'm cold, I can act appropriately, I mean huddle more or do whatever

33:47.560 --> 33:49.480
I feel is appropriate here.

33:49.480 --> 33:59.320
But there I'm acting spontaneously if you're like voluntarily.

33:59.320 --> 34:08.440
Being that, can be a scientific account, it's a bit difficult.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.160
The same thing is true with any emotion.

34:11.160 --> 34:17.800
Emotion always starts involuntarily.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.960
Something rather moves you.

34:19.960 --> 34:25.320
You don't command your own feelings, not directly.

34:25.320 --> 34:31.080
You can do various things to get a feeling going and whatnot, but in general you don't

34:31.080 --> 34:34.200
start the feeling.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.360
You get on a train that's already moving.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.400
Something is going on already.

34:39.400 --> 34:44.640
And what you generally do, because it's the easiest thing to do, is you go along with

34:44.640 --> 34:48.280
it and then you try to direct it here or there and so forth.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.840
You can also not go along with it at all.

34:50.840 --> 34:56.280
But it takes a certain amount of training to do that.

34:56.280 --> 35:06.080
If you're feeling angry at somebody, well, just to get involved and start pushing your

35:06.080 --> 35:16.000
anger, helping it out and so forth, well, it's not that easy at times.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.880
But the spontaneity or the voluntary effort that you add to your feelings is an essential

35:24.880 --> 35:28.240
part of emotion.

35:28.240 --> 35:38.600
And just as an essential part of any kind of action you undertake, movement you do.

35:38.600 --> 35:46.000
The baby you were mentioning was a sheer heat.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
It kicks its foot.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.400
It notices things moving up here.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.280
It kicks the thing moves.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.000
It doesn't kick.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.160
It doesn't move.

35:59.160 --> 36:00.960
It kicks twice.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.800
The thing moves twice.

36:03.800 --> 36:11.760
It makes a correlation between what it does spontaneously and what that thing is doing.

36:11.760 --> 36:18.160
And if it doesn't do it, it doesn't do it.

36:18.160 --> 36:25.160
The two go together.

36:25.160 --> 36:30.760
Well, how do things go together?

36:30.760 --> 36:34.920
Yes.

36:34.920 --> 36:43.440
The way you said it, are you saying feeling comes first, movement comes later or it can

36:43.440 --> 36:44.760
be either way?

36:44.760 --> 36:46.560
And the same about consciousness.

36:46.560 --> 36:54.360
Is it that that kind of recognized, the kind of consciousness you are talking about which

36:54.360 --> 37:02.160
is recognizing you said the me rather than just being conscious.

37:02.160 --> 37:08.600
In your description of the baby with the kicking, you said the baby says this is me.

37:08.600 --> 37:14.040
So this is a recognition that goes beyond regular consciousness.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.280
And so which comes first?

37:16.280 --> 37:21.720
Are you saying the kicking then makes the baby recognize his consciousness, his conscious

37:21.720 --> 37:24.760
of himself or the other way around?

37:24.760 --> 37:28.720
And that also about the emotion.

37:28.720 --> 37:41.080
You know, it's always, it's somehow interesting the way we always like to see which comes first,

37:41.080 --> 37:42.440
the card or the horse.

37:42.440 --> 37:47.280
You see, in this case, that was at least the point I was trying to make that this is a

37:47.280 --> 37:49.440
coupled system.

37:49.440 --> 37:55.880
So and Bert is amplifying that I think very nicely that this, the baby realizes that this

37:55.880 --> 37:56.880
is me.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.680
I mean, we don't know what the baby is experiencing.

37:59.680 --> 38:05.720
This is an inference, but nevertheless the fact that the baby then voluntarily kicks its

38:05.720 --> 38:12.240
leg from first of all spontaneously kicking the leg to then voluntarily because actually

38:12.240 --> 38:19.080
the baby then increases its kicking and producing the nice effect in the world, you see.

38:19.080 --> 38:27.920
So I'm not convinced that the either or which comes first is the way to see things.

38:27.920 --> 38:36.040
I would like to make a comment here or two about what Jesus said.

38:36.040 --> 38:40.960
It's actually, we can use this sort of basic example.

38:40.960 --> 38:49.040
You see, we're really asking the question, what are the, as it were, what is the significant

38:49.040 --> 38:51.280
aspect of movement?

38:51.280 --> 39:01.360
And this person sitting beside me has said the significant aspect of movement are meaningful

39:01.360 --> 39:05.560
animated synergies.

39:05.560 --> 39:11.640
And the synergy is a checkered concept, but I think it's very, very important in the

39:11.640 --> 39:18.160
following sense that a synergy actually is a working together.

39:18.160 --> 39:25.840
And in fact, this coupling of the baby and the mobile is a synergy spanning the environment

39:25.840 --> 39:27.880
and the organism.

39:27.880 --> 39:34.080
There are other kinds of synergies that people in evolutionary biology have talked about where

39:34.080 --> 39:41.880
they would have two oarsmen, one each with an oar, and they want to cross the river.

39:41.880 --> 39:48.720
Well, unless they cooperate with an effect here, so the synergy always has an effect.

39:48.720 --> 39:55.080
It's not just a working together, but it's working together with a functional effect.

39:55.080 --> 40:01.040
If one defects there, I mean, we've got game theory and all these things, repeated games

40:01.040 --> 40:04.080
and so on, but the defection is a one-off.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.000
It matters, right?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But if one defects, they'll go in a circle.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.960
Okay, everybody, get that.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.280
So they have to cooperate for an effect.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.680
That is a synergy with a real effect.

40:15.680 --> 40:20.560
Now there are other synergies that we discovered, for example, when you speak just to pull out

40:20.560 --> 40:28.440
the properties here, imagine you have to say the word baz as in the first syllable of a

40:28.440 --> 40:32.040
bad word, baz.

40:32.040 --> 40:38.440
And suddenly some experimental arrangement, normally when you say the word baz, just try

40:38.440 --> 40:44.680
it yourself, you're not really aware of it, but your jaw raises with your tongue, because

40:44.680 --> 40:50.320
the tongue has to go to the roof of the mouth to produce a frickative sign, zaz.

40:50.320 --> 40:59.240
Now imagine somebody who never experienced this before suddenly gets a tug to the jaw.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.640
Then how does the system compensate?

41:03.640 --> 41:13.280
Well, the fact is that 30 milliseconds later, the tongue is increasing its activity because

41:13.280 --> 41:18.440
you measure the genial glasses, muscles of the tongue, which raise the tongue.

41:18.440 --> 41:25.920
The tongue is already moving to get to the roof of the mouth in 30 thousands of a second.

41:25.920 --> 41:33.640
Now to get the synergy idea here, the jaw and the tongue are not mechanically linked.

41:33.640 --> 41:38.400
They are not mechanically linked, no more mechanically linked than the two people with

41:38.400 --> 41:44.200
the oars, but they are, if you like, informationally linked, they're coupled.

41:44.200 --> 41:53.080
And in fact, the synergy here is spanning the entire collection of elements that are

41:53.080 --> 41:58.400
necessary for the achievement of the goal, the purpose.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.440
You can easily change the context.

42:00.440 --> 42:04.800
Synergies are context, beautifully, exquisitely context-dependent.

42:04.800 --> 42:10.360
So just change the context and say, bab instead of baz, well, the tongue doesn't do a darn

42:10.360 --> 42:11.360
thing then.

42:11.360 --> 42:12.760
That's the upper lip.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.920
And the upper lip is not mechanically coupled to the jaw.

42:15.920 --> 42:24.720
So these are remote compensatory effects happening in, you know, a physiologist might say reflexively,

42:24.720 --> 42:31.480
but they have the creativity and the generativity required to produce an outcome.

42:31.480 --> 42:33.900
And that is the functional synergy.

42:33.900 --> 42:40.960
That is the combination, bird, I would say, of spontaneity and agency together.

42:40.960 --> 42:46.880
You have a goal you want to produce, some little piece of environmental perturbation

42:46.880 --> 42:55.360
hits one of the members of this putative assembly, and other remote members will immediately

42:55.360 --> 42:58.920
compensate.

42:58.920 --> 43:08.160
So this, I think, turns out to be quite important because you can then ask, well, how are synergies

43:08.160 --> 43:11.560
formed and how do they change?

43:11.560 --> 43:19.640
And then you're really asking questions about how any pattern or any collective pattern

43:19.640 --> 43:24.440
of behavior changes under what conditions and so on.

43:24.440 --> 43:30.320
So spontaneity and intentionality are intimately linked in this way.

43:30.320 --> 43:38.120
If I may, I'm going to interject two things, and it's backtracking a little bit.

43:38.120 --> 43:44.760
I want to go back to Ed's question about emotion with respect to movement.

43:44.760 --> 43:50.680
And that is that it seems to me that there's an overlooked dimension of movement, of emotions

43:50.680 --> 43:53.880
and movement in our everyday lives.

43:53.880 --> 44:02.600
And that is that emotions move through the body and move us to move in particular ways.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.360
Emotions move through the body.

44:04.360 --> 44:10.600
We don't trust moves through the body in ways different from fear.

44:10.600 --> 44:15.800
Joy moves through the body in ways different from sadness.

44:15.800 --> 44:21.520
There are differences in the way emotions move through the body and the way in which

44:21.520 --> 44:26.000
they move through the body moves us to move in certain ways.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.720
And it seems to me that that relationship substantiates a dynamic congruency in form

44:33.720 --> 44:40.360
between emotions and movement, which is why it's a formal congruency, which is why we

44:40.360 --> 44:43.400
can both feign an emotion.

44:43.400 --> 44:49.400
We can pretend, oh, how nice it is to meet you when we're really thinking, oh, God.

44:49.400 --> 44:55.560
And we can also restrain an emotion instead of doing such and such instead of slapping

44:55.560 --> 44:58.680
somebody in the face, we restrain ourselves.

44:58.680 --> 45:05.840
There is a dynamic congruency between emotions and movement, which allows us to a formal dynamic

45:05.840 --> 45:12.640
congruency, which allows us, in fact, to feign or restrain ourselves.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.240
The other thing that I just want to mention is-

45:15.240 --> 45:19.080
I'd say these synergies are different in those cases if you actually look at that carefully.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.160
Yes, I'm sure that they are.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.160
Yeah.

45:22.160 --> 45:28.560
Because the synergies of meaningful movement that have to do with deeper aspects as well

45:28.560 --> 45:34.440
as the what's out there overtly.

45:34.440 --> 45:47.080
The other thing, going back to Jesus's point about excelling and also in relation to spontaneity,

45:47.080 --> 45:53.840
it seems to me that one of the problems that we have in terms of taking movement for granted

45:53.840 --> 46:03.720
is precisely in terms of falling into habitual ways of doing things and overlooking the realities

46:03.720 --> 46:06.560
of the experience itself.

46:06.560 --> 46:12.240
If when we are in tune with the realities of the experience itself, we can wash dishes

46:12.240 --> 46:16.480
like this, or we can wash them and just kind of think around.

46:16.480 --> 46:22.520
There are all kinds of ways in which the qualitative dynamics of what we are doing can come to

46:22.520 --> 46:25.840
the fore to us.

46:25.840 --> 46:33.680
When we pay attention in that way, we can indeed enlarge on the possibilities.

46:33.680 --> 46:39.200
It seems to me that people who study- there's nothing wrong with studying abnormal behavior,

46:39.200 --> 46:48.400
but it seems to me that those who excel in behavior, not behavior, excel in movement,

46:48.400 --> 46:51.960
that was a great lapse.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.360
Sorry.

46:54.360 --> 47:01.200
We also need to study on the other end, those who excel not just the abnormal, but those

47:01.200 --> 47:06.080
who are at the extreme end on the other side.

47:06.080 --> 47:14.360
What comes to me as a kind of insight in relation to this is when I was in my first life as

47:14.360 --> 47:21.120
dance, I realized that there's a great difference between moving through a form and having the

47:21.120 --> 47:23.760
form move through you.

47:23.760 --> 47:29.080
When the form moves through you, you are actually experiencing the movement.

47:29.080 --> 47:33.200
When you're moving through a form, you're doing something habitual.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.200
The spontaneity, it doesn't seem to me as there precisely because it goes unrecognized

47:38.200 --> 47:40.120
as an experience.

47:40.120 --> 47:45.560
It doesn't come forth in a real genuine way.

47:45.560 --> 47:54.360
I don't know if that makes sense to any of you, but those are two comments I would make.

47:54.360 --> 48:07.120
If we could maybe pause and ask how we understand spontaneity, how we understand the emergence

48:07.120 --> 48:14.480
of anything, it's spontaneity.

48:14.480 --> 48:22.280
It's a question of how you would actually study that because, again, it's rather difficult.

48:22.280 --> 48:31.360
One way would be, for example, that you could think of an animal, a quadrupedal creature,

48:31.360 --> 48:32.360
walking.

48:32.360 --> 48:37.800
That's actually a good trick how creatures walk and locomote.

48:37.800 --> 48:44.360
Every creature does, but the laws of locomotion are not really that well understood.

48:44.360 --> 48:50.320
But where the spontaneity comes in is that animals change gate.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.760
That is, they switch from walking to trotting.

48:53.760 --> 48:56.120
And they switch from trotting to galloping.

48:56.120 --> 49:02.480
It turns out that there's a lot of different gates that quadrupedal creatures have.

49:02.480 --> 49:11.280
And so you could start to think about, well, what analogies might you make between an animal

49:11.280 --> 49:13.840
changing gate as a spontaneous event?

49:13.840 --> 49:15.680
It's a spontaneous event.

49:15.680 --> 49:20.680
And other examples of spontaneous pattern formation and nature.

49:20.680 --> 49:27.080
Well it turns out, by that I mean that under certain conditions you can take a system with

49:27.080 --> 49:35.040
very, very many microscopic components, like you, like all of us, at a great detailed

49:35.040 --> 49:41.360
level, at a molecular level, millions and millions and billions and all of that stuff.

49:41.360 --> 49:47.480
But somehow under certain conditions they form structures and patterns.

49:47.480 --> 49:50.800
And the physics of that is very interesting.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.600
It's called the physics of non-equilibrium phase transitions.

49:53.600 --> 49:59.280
So from a methodological point of view, how you go after spontaneity in this case is you

49:59.280 --> 50:06.400
say, could there be an analogy between an animal changing gate, which means it's changing

50:06.400 --> 50:14.600
the ordering among its limbs and other phenomena in nature where you see the spontaneous emergence

50:14.600 --> 50:21.840
of pattern, like in fluids or in clogged patterns or in material in different forms of matter,

50:21.840 --> 50:23.640
magnetism and so on.

50:23.640 --> 50:34.000
And the very interesting aspect is that all the features of the gate change, the spontaneous

50:34.000 --> 50:43.600
change in coordination, all the signatures of that are seen in that kind of a system,

50:43.600 --> 50:48.920
just as the same signatures are seen in other physical systems that are open to exchanges

50:48.920 --> 50:55.240
with energy and matter with their surrounds are non-equilibrium or non-linear because this

50:55.240 --> 50:57.720
is a non-linear abrupt change.

50:57.720 --> 51:03.200
So the origins of spontaneity here come through these non-linear changes.

51:03.200 --> 51:09.120
And once you know that, then you can say, well, how do I modify that?

51:09.120 --> 51:13.800
And that means you have to bring in intentionality and learning and so on.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.800
But without knowing this, here is the key point.

51:16.800 --> 51:23.360
Without knowing how spontaneous patterns arise under certain conditions, you don't really

51:23.360 --> 51:25.000
know what to modify.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.920
I call that intrinsic dynamics.

51:26.920 --> 51:33.560
You need to know the intrinsic spontaneous dynamics so that you can know what to modify.

51:33.560 --> 51:38.480
It's kind of akin in general, if you think of it in general.

51:38.480 --> 51:44.960
You don't go in and try to modify a system without knowing a lot about its spontaneous

51:44.960 --> 51:47.360
activities, its intrinsic dynamics.

51:47.360 --> 51:55.320
If you get what I mean, you can take that to a lot of aspects of life actually in society.

51:55.320 --> 51:59.520
You start interfering because you don't know what you're doing.

51:59.520 --> 52:04.720
It's only when you understand the spontaneous patterns that you can now say, this is the

52:04.720 --> 52:08.440
space that I want to change things and modify.

52:08.440 --> 52:11.440
Modification happens in that space.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.560
You had a comment, go ahead.

52:13.560 --> 52:21.280
Well, I guess I was wondering, it seems to me that once you're playing in this way where

52:21.280 --> 52:27.200
you say, well, eventually you have to bring it into a scenario, but you have these non-linear

52:27.200 --> 52:28.200
changes.

52:28.200 --> 52:33.000
But what makes the difference at our level is that we have to reflect which changes to

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
accommodate.

52:34.000 --> 52:39.080
And it's to be there is something deliberate about it that's not accidental, to some extent.

52:39.080 --> 52:44.280
So I'm wondering, is that part of the spontaneity then our deliberation about how to work with

52:44.280 --> 52:49.760
these possibility repertoire of movements or that we have available so that we seem to

52:49.760 --> 52:50.760
pick the better ones.

52:50.760 --> 52:56.800
I don't see, for example, a paramecium which is exploring with a little cilia, trying

52:56.800 --> 52:59.840
to see what kind of movements are possible for me to get food.

52:59.840 --> 53:08.400
But I don't know to what extent it's able to conceptualize, if you were through movements,

53:08.400 --> 53:11.960
you know, well, these are the movements that work for me and not those.

53:11.960 --> 53:17.720
At what level do we bring maybe this ability to work with this or does it happen automatically?

53:17.720 --> 53:25.200
Yes, so this gets technical fact because actually in the case of the bacterium or the

53:25.200 --> 53:29.560
paramecium, your point is that they have multiple possibilities.

53:29.560 --> 53:35.640
And so in fact that's the essential aspect of spontaneity.

53:35.640 --> 53:42.120
So that you can choose as it were which one suits the current conditions.

53:42.120 --> 53:50.120
And that's again a quite general property and it's also a feature of the kinds of order

53:50.120 --> 53:55.200
transitions that occur in quadrupedal locomotion, you see.

53:55.200 --> 54:02.520
So that's a key point, having many possibilities because often in science people like to study

54:02.520 --> 54:03.520
one thing.

54:03.520 --> 54:06.200
So you study a monkey doing one thing.

54:06.200 --> 54:09.800
But the monkey has a whole range of possibilities that are never explored.

54:09.800 --> 54:14.000
And you don't know actually then what the neural underpinnings of that are.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.560
The system is highly, what we say, highly degenerate.

54:17.560 --> 54:23.080
There are many ways to accomplish the same function at every known level, molecular all

54:23.080 --> 54:25.360
the way up to social signaling.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.760
That's a key feature again.

54:27.760 --> 54:33.000
Yeah, this reminds me of something that we discussed for a very little bit, but to some

54:33.000 --> 54:34.320
degree at dinner.

54:34.320 --> 54:41.040
And that is wouldn't you say that this is at a living level connected with kinetic intelligence?

54:41.040 --> 54:48.720
In other words, with the knowledge that an animal, human or non-human brings to life

54:48.720 --> 54:55.520
itself on the basis of the bodies they are to go back to what Darwin said about mine

54:55.520 --> 54:59.040
being a function of body to draw on that.

54:59.040 --> 55:06.920
We all have a basic kinetic intelligence with respect to our icons to draw also on

55:06.920 --> 55:15.960
Husserl what we can do and how we can possibly enlarge our repertoire of icons.

55:15.960 --> 55:22.280
Yes, I think you see we are very used to thinking of this word intelligence in terms, for example,

55:22.280 --> 55:27.200
of computation and kind of symbolic intelligence.

55:27.200 --> 55:33.120
Going back to Darwin, of course, Darwin's worms proved to be enlightening and terribly

55:33.120 --> 55:35.960
intelligence and ants too.

55:35.960 --> 55:43.440
Ants as we know, termites, for example, build beautiful structures under certain conditions.

55:43.440 --> 55:48.920
Put in some fear among gradients, put in a little positive feedback or to catalysis,

55:48.920 --> 55:52.720
and they start to create structures and pillars and arches.

55:52.720 --> 55:56.240
So the ant, you can say the ant is an architect.

55:56.240 --> 56:01.040
Well, it doesn't make any sense, you ask, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions

56:01.040 --> 56:08.040
for this kind of architecture to emerge and it looks intelligent and we say it's intelligent.

56:08.040 --> 56:16.160
But in fact, as you say, it's a natural intelligence in contrast perhaps to an artificial intelligence,

56:16.160 --> 56:17.960
the way we think about intelligence.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.600
And it can lie dormant in many…

56:20.600 --> 56:22.600
Underappreciated.

56:22.600 --> 56:29.840
Underappreciated in humans, I think, because in part because many times when people think

56:29.840 --> 56:38.440
of movement and they think in terms of exercising and if you go through these exercises and

56:38.440 --> 56:43.280
you're going to be fit, et cetera, but that's really a matter of going through the motions

56:43.280 --> 56:49.720
rather than being attuned and listening to the actual experience of movement and listening

56:49.720 --> 56:58.680
to what's there dynamically, qualitatively in the movement that you're involved in,

56:58.680 --> 57:02.080
that is moving through you.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.880
Yes, it's highly creative and generative.

57:04.880 --> 57:08.880
I mean, there are beautiful examples and sports of that as well.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.880
I think there was just a…

57:11.880 --> 57:18.360
I don't know if anybody knows soccer, but there was a great example of this where

57:18.360 --> 57:25.840
in the… before the last World Cup, a very famous soccer player called Thierryon Rie was

57:25.840 --> 57:30.520
playing for France and they happened to be playing against Ireland, so I had invested

57:30.520 --> 57:32.560
interest in this.

57:32.560 --> 57:46.440
But the ball came to him at somewhere between his knees and his shoulders and he couldn't

57:46.440 --> 57:52.000
control the ball with his knee and he couldn't get his head down to it, so he just used his

57:52.000 --> 57:54.320
hand and it was called the hand of God.

57:54.320 --> 58:03.360
You see, no, the referee didn't see it, but it was… it was almost reflexive.

58:03.360 --> 58:06.360
It's exactly like this very generative.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.920
It never done it before.

58:07.920 --> 58:11.920
It's against the rules, but it accomplished the goal.

58:11.920 --> 58:12.920
You see?

58:12.920 --> 58:23.280
What we're dealing with here is… and it was so reflexive, but then it's not reflexive

58:23.280 --> 58:27.880
in the case of some stimulus response kind of thing.

58:27.880 --> 58:29.280
It's never been done before.

58:29.280 --> 58:30.280
I wasn't just in that example.

58:30.280 --> 58:35.160
The thing about it too is that there has to be a way in which… I mean, he used the

58:35.160 --> 58:39.560
hand because he knew his goal was to manipulate the ball to go to a particular place.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.360
He was a modern choice in a way.

58:41.360 --> 58:46.320
But he still… and they sort of speak pretty flexibly perhaps, but he knows the goal is

58:46.320 --> 58:48.520
to move the ball to a particular place.

58:48.520 --> 58:53.360
So he has trained himself to act with a particular object in a particular way.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.400
So he's certain rules in mind.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.440
And he comes… like you say, he's supposed to use his hand.

58:57.440 --> 58:59.840
That's what comes out spontaneously.

58:59.840 --> 59:02.400
While he's trained, he's still trying to play soccer.

59:02.400 --> 59:07.520
Even when he knows that the hand's not allowed to be used, it was the only thing that he

59:07.520 --> 59:09.200
could given the goal because he…

59:09.200 --> 59:10.200
Because he…

59:10.200 --> 59:16.000
And there the goal is primary too, that means to how to achieve it.

59:16.000 --> 59:21.320
But it shows you, I think, beautifully the context and specificity, the generativity,

59:21.320 --> 59:24.920
the creative aspect of skilled behavior.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.920
And that was the question I guess I had going back to…

59:27.920 --> 59:33.680
I was just going to say that I do want to leave time to have questions and comments

59:33.680 --> 59:35.600
from all of you out there.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.000
So we'll make this the last comment.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
That's fine.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Very quick.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
That's fine.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.240
I guess I was just wondering, going back to Sondad Berg's way to go to spontaneity.

59:45.240 --> 59:52.560
And it's the role of maybe not simply bottom-up, let's try to explain the generations'

59:52.560 --> 59:55.360
spontaneity from neurons and so on.

59:55.360 --> 59:59.760
But maybe from the top-down in terms of how maybe different cultures might also help us

59:59.760 --> 01:00:07.000
to use this formal way of dealing with emotions through these formalized movements, right?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.280
And it seems like at some level we do bring a way to be deliberate.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:16.160
That is qualified in a very strong way by a cultural way.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.520
It could be a practice like soccer, what's not allowed, it could be a way to behave in

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.040
a personal distance or how to express emotions.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:28.280
I mean, to what level does those affect perhaps spontaneity or emotions or does it trickle

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.280
down as well?

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280
I don't know, I'm just wondering.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280
Do you want to…

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.080
No, I'll let you put your hands.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.720
That you get a lot…

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.400
You get a lot going on.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.920
You get a kind of automatic response.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:47.080
You get things you're used to doing, you could call them habits, I suppose.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.440
But there was their voluntary in the sense that you could stop them if you wanted.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.120
And even there, their degrees are being able to stop.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:09.240
And then there's a kind of voluntary adding on without it being very reflective.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.640
You can also reflect on the whole situation, side you want to do, you want to go ahead

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.000
with this and so forth.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.680
It's horribly complicated.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.760
I mean, the degrees you get of these various factors coming in here.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:32.240
I like this word amass.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:39.640
I think Freeman Dyson wrote a little bit about, you know, when we're talking about life,

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.120
life is DNA, you see.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.760
Well, it's not just DNA, it's metabolism as well.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:53.160
You have to have renewal processes, not just, I say, the two-ars, reproduction and renewal.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:02:01.320
You need both of those, you need both metabolism and as it wears some kind of informational basis.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.400
It's actually the same with coordination.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.600
People like coordination, they like to see the ordered coordination.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.080
And it looks like synchrony and so on.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.960
And there's an awful lot of work going on.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.880
For example, last week I was at the Society for Neuroscience.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.640
And there were many symposia on synchronization in the brain and oscillations in the brain

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.320
that are cognitively relevant, and behaviorally relevant, and even emotionally relevant actually,

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.360
that seem to have some correlation to the states of creatures.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:39.240
But actually it turns out that synchronicity and oscillation is just one the ordered part.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.280
And when you look more closely, it's a much more subtle tendency to synchronize and also

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:52.040
a tendency for the parts to behave autonomously, to do their own thing.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.680
So you have this kind of duality of a tendency to cooperate and a tendency for the parts to

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.480
do their own thing, almost compete.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.880
So you have this subtle cooperation, competition, integration, segregation.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.560
This is a key characteristic of dynamics and coordination.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.120
So that's the beast, that's the mess that we have to recognize.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.800
That DNA metabolism, how that's worked out, is really not still understood, even though

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.400
we've got the genome and all that stuff.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:34.400
But now we come to coordination in the brain that is underlying everything that's going

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.000
on here in a way.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000
And that turns out again to be messier than the way we as scientists tend to think about

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
it.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.360
But mess in this sense that it's not as simple as you'd like.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Exactly.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.680
It's not too simple, but it's not too complicated.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.880
It's sort of in this nice place in between.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.720
And that's where we have to look at things closely, I think.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.920
But I think dynamics are challenging precisely because they're messier to understand and

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:13.000
investigate than something solid and in place that has spatial clarity and exists here.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.440
And you can really look at it and dynamics is fluctuating and changing.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.440
Yes.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.000
So, I mean, the dynamics literally is spatial temporal.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.840
It's in space and in time.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:25.840
And in force.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.840
And as a flow.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.760
Well, there are underlying forces perhaps, yes.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.600
But in terms of at least of the pattern dynamics, it's more...

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.480
Like this.

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:42.440
It's more spatial temporal.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.440
Yeah.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.880
So, any questions or comments?

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.880
Yes.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:05:03.880
I'd like to throw a couple of things out and then you can deal with them.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:11.120
You speak of importance almost the necessity of movement for life.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.880
At one point saying life and movement are one, I think I heard specifically what's

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.080
said.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:23.640
What about a quadrupolegic or someone in an iron lung?

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.040
That's the first thing.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:32.880
As to emotional response, whether or not you're responsible for it, something inside

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:42.120
you unconsciously reacts to something you hear and you respond consciously.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:50.080
It reminds me a little bit of Sam Harris' explanation of free will.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.320
If in fact, there is free will.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:06:01.600
Your example of the baby and synergy doesn't have to include consciousness.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.840
The synergy existed even as the baby was not conscious before the baby became conscious

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:15.320
of the connection between his foot and the moving mobile.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.560
And the last thing is deliberate against spontaneous.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Deliberate...

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.160
I don't have a dictionary, but deliberate, I think, is conscious.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:30.760
Spontaneous is not unconscious.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:41.840
So rehorses changing their gates, I believe, correct me if I'm mistaken, that horses,

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:51.080
gates, stored as deliberate because they're learned and they become spontaneous.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.480
So I leave you with that.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:07:00.120
Let me suggest that you take or that we all take one because I would like to have other

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:15.280
questions besides which one would you like to focus on?

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:19.840
The questions are all a little bit connected, I think, in a way.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:26.360
But I think this important question you raised, but the synergy is there before it's manifest.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360
Is it really?

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360
How do you know that?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.720
I don't know that.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:39.680
But it occurs to me that there's something I like about that idea in the sense that we

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.040
study, for example, the synergies between people in interpersonal coordination.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:52.160
We study actually interbrain coordination as it turns out.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.720
And I think there's a very interesting question there about the relation between self and

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:04.840
other in the case of the baby between the baby and the organism and the environment.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:07.800
Is this energy there beforehand?

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.280
Does it pre-exist?

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:14.640
The possibility, I think, coming to Jesus's point exists, but it doesn't exist until

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.120
it's manifest, in my opinion.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:28.560
So in the case of the self and the other, I think this may be taken as often different

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:34.800
directions, but I think, for example, the field of neuroscience has stressed the individual

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:41.840
brain, you know, Je pons d'hon je jous sous, I think, therefore I am.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.040
But another way would be to say I am because you are.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:50.560
So there's a self-other, but the self-other doesn't pre-exist.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.280
It only exists in the relation of the two.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.960
And I think that's the same case of the baby.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:03.000
The synergy doesn't really exist until the conditions are set up, that it can be manifest.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:12.240
That would be, does that sound odd?

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:21.320
I think in some cases, you see, again, again, again, again, again, you, what?

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.360
I thought I was on a scientific level.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.520
I'm an average person.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.520
But that's a synergy.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.760
It exists in some kind of experience.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:39.160
A synergy is a functional grouping of elements that are temporarily constrained to act as a

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.520
single unit.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520
That's more with feeling.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:49.600
A synergy is an assembly of elements temporarily constrained to function as a single unit.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.880
The question of how it arises, I mean, we could talk about that.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:01.320
But that would be the definition in all the cases that we've been discussing.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:08.520
Now, whether that's conscious or unconscious, again, is the brain synchronized?

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.520
Is it desynchrony?

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.320
We love to have this either or logic.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:20.080
And I think where we're going to actually is more of a both and logic than an either

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:25.160
or the synergy could be both conscious and unconscious quite easily.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.720
Yeah, that's a good complementarity point.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.880
That's actually the kind of thing.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.880
Bring up.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.880
It doesn't have to be either or.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.920
Maybe it's complementary or cubios of by degrees, maybe.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.320
So there are different levels of achievement, synergy.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:42.840
Things have to be full on synergy or completely lacking that or full on conscious or unconscious.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.360
It may also be swapping up around.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.080
For example, I feel that let's speak about being in the zone, something like that, flow

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.840
or mushy in martial arts, right?

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.920
And they say, well, that's when you're not thinking about it.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.200
But I think that's really what's really happening.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.200
You really pay attention.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200
What's going on?

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200
There are both conscious and unconscious.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.960
There are some things that you kind of put in the background, if you will.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.440
But there are some other things you are hyper alert.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.160
So maybe there are degrees and ways of being synergic or conscious of something.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.680
And you use them depending on what the goal is and the needs of the moment.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.000
There's maybe a possibility to open up so it's not simply to have one or not and what

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
are the conditions.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.680
And it could be a scientific level.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.320
It could be an experiential level.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.480
And the one that maybe matters to you when you're trying to solve a problem that you

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.480
have in your face.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:31.880
It could be very practical, so that I won't want to sleep on the ice, maybe.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.520
And the more attention I paid to, maybe the more tricky it's all around.

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:40.480
So I think it could be a combination, maybe, or this is a suggestion.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.480
Another question, Ed?

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:53.520
I'd like to hear a little more thought about agency, which came up very early on.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.040
But we didn't really return to it.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.600
I think we've got elements of agency here, spontaneity, consciousness.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.880
One thing was left out.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:08.880
It seems like agency would require a sense that movement produces an effect in the environment

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:17.320
that I, although not yet an ego in any formal or strict sense, can make a difference by

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.520
my movement to the configuration of a given environment.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:28.000
That seems different from modes of movement that really may make no difference.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.440
Idle movement, we could call them, just moving, so to speak, producing no effect and not actually,

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.720
therefore, tempting us to ascribe the movement to an agent.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.040
I don't mean a full-blown agent.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.320
I don't mean a rational agent.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.040
I don't even mean a conscious agent.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:53.000
But I mean some kind of being who by moving actually insinuates itself into the world in

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.120
such a way that the world comes out a little bit different, if only the mobile moving slightly.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:09.080
So somehow in this series of terms that you've all been developing richly and I think paying

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:14.080
a due attention, respecting their deep ambiguity, that's one thing I really enjoy.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:18.280
No one's coming across definitions that we need to adhere to.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.240
You're actually exploring, I think, the penumbra of all these terms.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.640
But agency is, I think, still suspended in the air.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:32.080
And I wonder if we could return to it briefly and now say where is agency?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.800
Who is the agent and how is agency related to motion, to movement?

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:48.360
Could you give an example of what you mean by a less definitive agency when you said that

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.840
there's no impact on the world?

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:55.520
Well I don't want to have a Cartesian agency or I don't want to have a mind.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.920
I mean if I go like that.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.280
Yeah if I just go like that, you know, and I'm really doing it, I would say like flapping

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:09.040
my wings to no effect as we say in English, right?

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.960
Then I'm not sure that's agency.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.960
It's movement.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.720
Is that what you mean?

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.360
Well that's sort of what I'm getting at.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.840
Yeah how do we deal with that?

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:25.760
Is that a lower level, you see, do we reach a level of non-agentive movement here?

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.640
Maybe we call that involuntary.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:33.120
Although I actually suspect that the class, that that class of non-agent driven movement

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.920
is sometimes voluntary and sometimes heads toward the barely voluntary.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.040
But it's not really a matter of agency.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.360
So I wondered if you folks could comment on that puzzle.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:55.320
The way to say it all different levels.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:03.080
Unless you want to define agent to rule out some of the levels, if I'm doing it, if I'm

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:11.600
shaking my foot like that and if I'm aware of the thing just vaguely aware, it's there

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.320
in the background, I'm still the agent.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.400
I'm not the agent in the way in which I scratch my head, for example.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:26.080
There I have an itch and I know what I'm doing and I direct my fingers accordingly.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:33.160
I don't know a little bit over here, but so forth.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.120
That's an essential part of this thing going on.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.040
I'm not unconscious and this is not a twitch.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.600
This is something I'm doing.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.840
But my participation is minimal.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.640
So you have agents if you like it at a lot of different levels.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.280
I don't know what to do with that.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.840
It just seems to me that's the way the world is.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.640
There's a comment from, yes.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:11.280
I have the advantage of having a stroke, by the way, in my movement center.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.840
So my right side is different from my left.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:21.240
I'm also the president of La Bon Institute of Movement Studies.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.680
So irony of all ironies.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.080
Now also a radio show.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:31.080
I'm very interested in the movements of the sound of things.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:36.320
So I've had a very interesting journey from no control of my trunk or my head to finally

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.120
being able to move.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120
Amazing.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:45.360
And in the process, I've had a lot of interaction, say, with honey, my dear friend, who both

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.520
drives and does her thing.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.360
And she also walks me.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
What is the gate?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.600
I was famous, Pardot, poor, poor.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.920
The fact that I could look at the gate and say there is no gate.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.160
Everyone moves differently.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:09.080
So La Bon was probably the first person to look at movement and say there is a language

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.080
here.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.520
There are symbols to be used.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.680
There is continuity.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.680
There are sphere.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:19.840
There are movements that are not linear and very circular in nature.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:28.080
And as you said, Maxine, the qualitative aspects interest me very, very much, both recuperating

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:34.160
from my stroke, which I'm going to talk about in my new later in April, but still fascinating

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.600
to me was that there is no gate in my language.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:45.560
There is no linear, non-agent involved in movement.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:52.400
There is only movement and its qualitative differences in all aspects of movement.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:59.000
So when you have a sperm who cannot move like other spurs, it moves differently.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.760
It meets an egg that moves differently.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.120
And a zygote occurs that suddenly moves differently from all other zygotes.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.120
It's cute.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:19.520
So what you phrase is instantaneously beyond that, believe me, there are even impetus who

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:25.480
say, well, we actually know consciously there is an agent before we are, quote, born and

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.720
conceived that we listened to what was said.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.480
There are people that have many different opinions.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.480
And yes, we are in a mess in terms of movement.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.560
But where are you interested?

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.880
What is your particular take?

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.680
It's wonderful to hear everyone's different takes and my different take because of what

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.840
I have experienced both socially and individually, et cetera.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.920
I'm very, very interested in all of what you say.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:01.800
And I'm most interested in hearing the qualitative differences, as I said, in movement.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.520
And I will once again say, Erm got by Chin F was my mentor, but La Bonn really gave me

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:14.240
the opportunity, crudely caveman level that La Bonn was at, the opportunity to look at

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:19.240
movement as something other than English words.

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:24.240
Very important.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.680
And English word like gait, et cetera.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.880
And it's very helpful.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.040
I just to make a side comment.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:37.800
I've been told many times by many people who do La Bonn analysis that the phenomenology

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:43.160
of movement that I gave in the phenomenology of dance coincides very, in very complementary

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.880
ways with La Bonn analysis.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:53.880
Thank you.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.360
Have a question back there, yes?

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.400
Yeah, I just make a comment just before you start.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.880
I like the idea of qualitative differences, of course.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:13.560
I had early experiences with La Bonn notation as well.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:21.520
The, actually, I think this, I mean, one needs to be careful about using words.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.720
When I used the word gait, I meant a pattern of coordination between the legs.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:33.120
If I was looking at a person who had a stroke, I would be looking at the pattern of connectivity

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120
in their brain.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.360
I've done that as well.

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:44.720
So the qualitative effects come when the patterns change, right?

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:50.720
Not just smoothly and linearly, as you elegantly say, but qualitatively.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:57.200
And in fact, the example of an animal changing gait, if you pardon, you know, changing the

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:08.200
ordering among its components, is a qualitative change in the same sense as a physical system,

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:14.040
like water changes from ice to liquid.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.880
It's a qualitative change.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.440
There's nothing wrong with the word qualitative.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:25.320
And it turns out it has many quantitative consequences, important quantitative consequences

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.000
for these kinds of changes.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:37.520
So that's really, you know, let's talk about qualitative effects.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:43.240
The key thing from a scientific point of view would be the differences on what dimensions.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.760
Let's see.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.440
Yeah.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:59.680
But that's precisely, again, here's another dichotomy, qualitative versus quantitative.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.240
Please don't see those as a dichotomy.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.040
See them as actually complementary and mutually related.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:13.840
They are indeed, actually, it's quite beautiful.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.680
There are quantitative consequences of qualitative change that can be picked up and used as signatures

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:23.720
for predicting the upcoming change and so on.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:31.280
And it is our duty, I was going to say, to really try to fathom the way in which they

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.400
are related.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:38.680
To find the complement, this is a term of Scott's, to find the complementarity between

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:43.120
the two, rather than to keep perseverating on these dual paths.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.320
If I can just very briefly, one very quick thing, and we got to do it, right?

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.280
You are just going to connect to issues you raised.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:54.880
You raised a one point of paraplegic or people who are not able to move in an able way if

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:55.880
you will, right?

01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.040
And somebody who has maybe a stroke, right, who finds not able to move the way you would

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.480
like to or like most people, right?

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:05.800
And I think, in a way, to explore the qualitative aspect of movement or quantitative as well,

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.080
is when we look at, for example, we like to think of disabled people.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.840
And I think to some extent, they move in different ways quite differently.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840
They experience it differently.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.960
But yet, I think there are patterns of excellence as well among them.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:21.040
I have in mind, for example, somebody called Kevin Nichols, who is a skier who doesn't

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.560
have any lower body, no legs, nothing.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.680
But he's got an advantage in the skier's lobes because his liberal gravity is lower,

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.440
he can do things, nobody can do so, nobody can follow him.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.440
Right?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.640
So in a way, I think this is a way we might discount.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.160
Well, you look at him and people in the street, he walks in a skateboard where he just goes

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.080
like this really fast and people do double takes, right?

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.560
He actually takes pictures of people looking at him because they are surprised.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.160
So he's making the most of it.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.880
But going back to the two of you, I think there are ways to look at deficient movement,

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.880
if you will.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880
That's how we like to qualify it, right?

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.880
And we don't really give a negative label.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:00.360
But I think there are ways to think of it in different categories, which is an alternative

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.520
way to move, that has his own qualities.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.760
And actually, sometimes you can explain it through advantage.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.760
Okay?

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.560
So I think there are ways or rooms or spaces to open up in terms of exploration that I

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:14.880
think would enrich how we look at movement in meaningful ways.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.400
It's very interesting.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.200
It's very, very interesting.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:24.280
A concept that hasn't come up here has to do with stability.

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:29.680
And so again, we want to know the stability of what and so on.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.960
But the very interesting thing about qualitative change is that qualitative changes are associated

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.760
with what engineers don't like, which is instabilities.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.760
Instabilities create new possibilities.

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:42.280
They create new patterns.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.600
And that's a key dynamic.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.560
That's a key part of the dynamics.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560
Yes, thank you.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.800
That was very elegant and interesting.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:55.200
Discussion, and this is rather much more mundane.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.440
But I'm curious to ask, going back to the baby, about infant reflexes, which have an

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:06.200
agency that is deeply buried in the organism for survival, but is certainly not conscious

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.200
because they're reflexes.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.600
And in fact, when they become conscious, we have control over them and basically extinguish

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.600
them.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:20.800
So I'm wondering if you can talk about infant reflexes, which are movements, which have

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:27.200
an, as I said, a deep intentionality that is not conscious for the survival of the creature.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:30.200
And when they become conscious, they actually become extinguished.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Maybe you want to address that.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.760
More reflex, talking reflex.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:44.040
Some reflexes, I guess we retain flight flight, but the basic infant reflexes, when they become

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:54.040
mischievous, they become

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.680
conscious, and when they become conscious, we stop them.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.920
That's when they become integrated.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.920
So I'm wondering if you guys can talk about that.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:08.720
Do you have any examples of the moral reflex?

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:18.720
I can tell it doesn't make them extinct, it changes its solicitor, if you like.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:26.880
It's a way of responding, and a baby responds, if you take away support, it responds like

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.360
that.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.960
But then I respond like that, if somebody makes a big, a loud noise behind me, you know, I

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:34.960
go like that.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:42.560
Well, the integration of the reflexes is when they become conscious and we can control them

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.560
consciously.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.000
They're reflexes because we have no control over them when we're infants, because they

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.680
help us survive.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:55.760
But then once they become integrated, we do have the conscious control over them.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.200
And we essentially then can stop them from being reflexes.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.440
So the idea of agent there is slightly different, and I was wondering if you could talk about

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.400
it, because it's not conscious.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.160
The agent of the body to survive is huge when you're in the state of the baby.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:20.200
But it's not a conscious, conscious agent because it's the reflex.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:26.040
I would simply say that there's a, it's a bit anecdotal, but there's a beautiful study

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:33.880
by Japanese investigator Kofu Kuda where he shows all these sports examples where the

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:40.160
primitive reflex, the crossed extensor reflexes, all these reflexes are in highly skilled sports

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:44.680
like a baseball player going up for a fly ball.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:51.200
So it looks as if these quotes reflexes, these basic patterns, these primitive patterns are

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.480
actually exploited for in highly skilled behavior.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.320
The question of consciousness and so on, I can't really speak to, but nevertheless,

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:08.920
I think there's a point with respect to what you say that these basic patterns are a foundation

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:14.600
for all volitional movement and skilled behavior.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.640
And that's been ignored, I agree.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:23.120
As a postscript, small postscript, I would just say that neurologically, the first systems

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:31.560
to develop are the, are kinesthesia, which is a totally overlooked sense modality for,

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:38.280
for centuries and tactility, tactility and kinesthesia.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.840
And it seems to me since those are the very first neurological systems to develop that

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:52.440
there has to be some kind of initial consciousness developing with respect to them because fetuses

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:58.320
both have a lot of different movements that they, that they generate by themselves and

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.960
there must be some, if their neurological system is developing normally, they have a

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.800
sense of their own movement in touch.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:16.760
So consciousness is, has its, has its origin in tactile kinesthetic, in what I call the

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.560
tactile kinesthetic body.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.600
I just quick follow up to that, tonight with the issue of agency, very quickly, the example

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.960
you gave of a striker who is with the hand.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.720
That was the reflex for him.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.560
He knows he's not supposed to be with the hand, but he wants to bail it to score.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.560
The hand goes there, right?

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.160
Or was he knows it's not going to count?

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.200
I mean, he gets away with it, it's like him.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.800
But one thing is just of who is responsible, well, to some extent you could say he's to

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.880
be blamed, he goes by the referee, he doesn't count because you were the agent.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.560
At the same time, we say, well, the arm, he could say, yes, did it, yes, went, I didn't

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:47.720
meant to do it, right?

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:52.320
So there is maybe in the same system, the same agent, there could be maybe a sub-level

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:55.760
or a subconscious run conscious, and I think they tend to flip back and forth or compliment

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.600
sometimes on what's required.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.320
So I think there is a connection there.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:04.440
I have a slightly different response to Ed's question, and that is that I would call a

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:11.120
cooperativity that is, you know, obviously it involves coordination and cooperation among

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:21.720
the muscles and the kinesthetic support and so on, but a cooperativity with an effect,

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:28.760
like the evolutionary stable strategy of the two men each with an oar, and which, you

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:34.320
know, the defection scenario, that's cooperation with an effect, and that's where I think the

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.160
agency aspect is part of a functional synergy.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.680
It's not a functional synergy if you just have a cooperativity.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:46.280
It's only a functional synergy if you produce a consequence that is going to have evolutionary

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:47.280
outcomes.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.280
Right.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.280
Yeah.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.800
First of all, thank you.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.800
I'm completely fascinated and really enjoying all of you.

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:03.760
I'm wondering when you talk about consciousness and the degrees of consciousness, I'm thinking

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.320
about agency, excuse me, awareness.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:13.080
And awareness as the relationship of organism and environment, and then consciousness as

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.160
person-world.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:22.600
I wonder if you can say something about that, the developing of consciousness from, am

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.600
I clear?

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:31.040
Well, I would say to begin with, and I hope that the others bolster me in this, what I

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:38.040
said, to begin with, this seems to me that the tactile kinesthetic body is basic to the

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.120
beings we are.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:48.400
In other words, kinesthesia and tactility are basic senses, and we recognize commonly

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:54.960
five senses and disregard our own sense of movement, which is kinesthesia.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:00.400
A long time ago, Aristotle looked upon movement as a sense of komunis.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:06.120
In other words, it was a sense that is common to all the senses, and he elaborated on this

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:13.120
in very fine ways, but he didn't ever speak of our sense of movement, which has to do

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.960
with precisely with the qualitative dynamics.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:22.440
We know if we're going like this, or if we're going like this, or if we're going in it,

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:27.440
we have a sense of the dynamics, the qualitative dynamics of our own movement.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:35.200
And when Gibson went on to talk about affordances and about a sense of komunis in terms of vision

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:43.800
and movement, he completely obliterated, to my mind, any real adequate, just minimally

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.760
adequate sense of kinesthesia.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:53.760
It was all about getting, navigating in the environment, but not really delving into the

01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:00.960
basic kinesthetic awareness we have of our own bodies in movement.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:07.240
So anything that anyone wants to add to that tear-aid?

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.000
I guess I have a quick follow-up question.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.480
What you mean by the world, what do you have in mind?

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:14.640
You have in mind the environment, or asking anything with the world?

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.640
Yeah, the environment.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.040
Okay, I guess what I was thinking is just kind of work.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:24.720
What is biological and what is interpersonal?

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:28.720
And do you think it is in that way?

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.240
Organism and environment sounds biological.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240
And organism organism isn't?

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.240
What would be the risk of biology?

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.240
What would be the risk of biology?

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.240
And then there's something else.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.240
What?

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:47.480
We've been talking about conscious and unconscious and levels of consciousness and reflexes.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.440
But I wanted to share a personal experience I had when I was 13.

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.280
I had an accident.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:01.480
I was playing football and I was paralyzed in my right leg for three years.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.480
And I was in a back brace.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:04.480
And I did...

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:05.480
What?

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:10.280
I was in a back brace for three years as my spine and tailbone had been pulled apart

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:14.960
and a lot of ligaments were torn out and this leg didn't work.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.640
So I remember when the doctor tapped me and there was no reflex response.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.320
We knew we had a problem.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.640
But I recovered and years later, about 20 years later, I was in a hypnosis class and

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:34.480
we did some age regression and we went back into my trinies and into my teens.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:39.280
And I talked about experiences from each of those periods.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:45.320
And then when I hit 15, all of a sudden, my leg was paralyzed again.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:49.640
It went totally numb and I couldn't move it.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:55.800
Even though I was in my 30s and the accident that happened in my teens, I re-experienced

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.280
that in a very compelling way.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.040
And then they moved me and I was able to talk about it.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.960
And part of my mind was able to track it.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.000
My response to this new relationship I was having to this previous injury.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.440
But then they moved me into my, when I was 12, before the accident happened and my leg

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.080
could move again.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:24.200
So I'm just throwing this out there because it was a fascinating experience for me to

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.760
be able to re-live this experience.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.800
Before the accident, my reflexes were working, then the accident happened and there was this

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.400
disconnect and the reflexes weren't there.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.560
Then I was healed because I was young enough.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.680
It was corrected by the back brace.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.880
So the reflexes were there again.

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:52.840
But then as an adult, I could revisit, imaginatively, in a trance state, not having that reflex

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.840
response again.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:00.240
And I'm wondering how fluid and malleable and dynamic the brain mind world is.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.920
And another question I have, this is just off the top of my head, how can my mind be

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.880
separate from anyone's body, anyone else's body?

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.880
I think this is, how could my mind be separate from your body?

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.640
I'm curious about that because it seems to me, we talk about brain a lot as something

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.960
separate from other brains, brain mind, body, world.

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.440
So I hope there's a question there.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.240
I'm just throwing this out there.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.680
So thank you very much for allowing me to share this experience.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.440
Let me walk backwards from when that deal was in how we connect with the world, maybe,

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:41.640
on our minds or our bodies.

01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:46.840
I think maybe trying to raise people's mind and body, separate our brain is part of the

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.840
problem.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.160
I think to some extent, we're the each other's language through our bodies, right?

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:58.240
And we respond to each other's behavior, movements, actions in particular ways.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.000
So I think it doesn't extend where you neither come on in future we share a way of moving

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.960
the world and a kind of a spiritual space if you're a human space or with other creatures

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:08.960
that move us well.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:09.960
And I think it doesn't extend.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.880
We connect with that in a very unconscious way, in a very primeval way of view, until

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.360
we start exploring.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.680
And I think part of exploring this, one question we came up with over dinner about, we have

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.120
to bring up, is different methodologies, disciplines to study movement.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:28.600
And I think, for example, the episode you relate, I can think from a scientific explanation,

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.720
we can have philosophical ones and phenomenology, but I can think also, for example, like analysis

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.360
playing a role or even literature to explore different ways of how that's felt.

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:41.880
And I think, you know, when we try to go through those experiences, sometimes most of us are

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:47.160
lacking in what character articulate exactly what does it mean to me or what's the quality

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160
of it.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.840
And it's developing those tools, those linguistic ability to speak about it and understand it

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:54.280
after the fact if you will.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.600
On the one side, see there is movement and it's richness.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:01.800
At the same time, I want to understand it, not simply as I move, although I enjoy doing

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.920
that, but also articulate it in different ways.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.720
And I think different methodologies and patterns are needed to, especially with complex things

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.280
like your experience.

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:11.280
Yes, chill.

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:30.960
Very minimal notion of what dance is, but I've been involved in music since I was about

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.560
nine playing the cello.

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:41.760
And I started taking lessons again recently with a 30-something expert and I never liked

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:49.240
to play scales, but now I'm in control of the situation and he teaches what I ask him

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:52.240
about.

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:58.360
And so he said, okay, let's do it.

01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:03.680
I mean, he thought I did it, but I avoided it my whole life.

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.960
So he said, all right, start on D major, so the first finger on the cello.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:18.800
And then before you play the next note, hear it and go up the scale.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:25.200
And no open strings that is, play only notes that require pressure from a digit because

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.960
open strings don't train the left hand at all, there's no left hand.

01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:34.000
So I did it, I was surprised how in tune, it was in tune.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.560
And I didn't practice D major scale.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:44.200
And he says, when the top basketball player shoots for the three pointer, he visualizes

01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:49.040
the ball going through the net.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:56.120
And similar to the tennis player or the golf or the sink, but visualizes the ball rolling

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.400
into the hole.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:03.880
What you're doing, he says, is you're suspending your mental interference.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.480
And your body knows very well, your body's done it a thousand a million times.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:10.080
Let your body do it.

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.320
So I assume there's some overlap here.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:20.320
Very interesting comment, very, yeah, go ahead.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:34.600
Yeah, well, there's a lot of wisdom in your remarks about how you come back to something

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.840
that you haven't done in the past.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:43.000
And I think, you know, when we all leave this place, I hope you don't think we're talking

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.320
only about reflexes and stuff.

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:51.600
I mean, we're really talking about generative, creative movement.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.800
And I think that's really important.

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.680
You see what you're talking about in the case of producing an effect in the world in terms

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:05.960
of sound, actually, infants, when they develop to speak, they are doing the same.

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.680
You're producing sounds.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.960
And that is lawfully produced by the way your articulators move.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.800
The way you sense your articulators, where your tongue is, and so on.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.480
So there's an intimate connection.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:24.880
And you would, you see, you never really forget how to speak unless you've had some severe

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:26.640
insult and so on.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:31.480
So I think it's like that, that these become stabilized.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:39.720
And how they destabilize then can be part of, you know, producing new sounds as if you would

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.720
want to learn a new language, for instance.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.880
There's quite a lot of work again on that, that you're actually building on what you

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.560
have and adjusting the dynamics of what you have and the acoustic consequence that those

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.560
dynamics produce.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.200
And that's the key aspect, I think.

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:08.120
I would add to that that I think that there is a lot to be said for the imaginative consciousness.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:12.720
I can describe that in terms of the imaginative consciousness of movement.

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.440
But what you're talking about, it seems to me, is on the imaginative consciousness of

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:27.280
sound where what used to be called mental practice actually enhances your performance.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.800
Because the body really does take over and you can, this is an example from movement,

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.000
I can remember it from movement classes.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.200
I would imagine myself going through some kind of movement and I knew that this was wrong

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.400
imaginatively, you know I had to do it this way.

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:52.240
I could actually correct myself imaginatively and improve whatever I was doing.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:59.560
But I think what you're saying is that hearing the sound, letting yourself hear the sound

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:08.960
is really going on your bodily felt sense of the sound, just like the bodily felt sense

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:16.280
of the movement and how it, I don't know whether to use the term dynamics there, but it has

01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.240
a certain kind of quality, the sound has a certain kind of quality and your body knows

01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:27.600
that sound already and how to make it come to the fore, how to create it.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:31.400
I was speaking of visualizing in Seligulum's leading because we tend to think we simply

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.960
matching with our mind side, but when I try to visualize different moves in my sports,

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:38.000
I actually feel it through my body.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.120
Yeah, so visualizing in a way throws us off a little bit and trying to think that I can

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:43.600
image and that's what suffices.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:47.720
So it could be oral, it could be tactile and aesthetic, you know, when I'm trying to think

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:52.520
in the pool how to do certain moves and I visualize it, I do feel this thing in my arms

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.800
or the spirit of rivalry, the attention.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:58.680
So I think there is a richness of interconnection of our senses that we have to pay attention

01:43:58.680 --> 01:43:59.680
to.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:07.760
It's actually very interesting that if you do have a stroke, for instance, and the person

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:12.360
can only move the left hand, say it's a right hemisphere stroke, something like that, and

01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:18.800
you say imagine moving your hands together the way we normally do, and if you really

01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:25.680
work at that, actually you can show that there's a degree of recovery of function and there's

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.040
published research on that.

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:31.480
And there's also a lot of published research that when you imagine to move, many of the

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:37.440
same neural structures are activated and coordinated.

01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.920
So this is not magic.

01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:40.920
Oh.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.240
This is clearly articulated.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:51.160
My question is actually about what you had mentioned about emotions moving through the

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.320
body.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:58.480
So the movement of a feeling, no, perhaps emotion and feeling are not the same there.

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:09.280
I'm wondering if that's true, then what is the feeling of the movement of a mixed feeling,

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:15.600
like ambivalence or some other sort of maybe that's an emotion?

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.000
I was thinking a lot about those sorts of situations because I can envision what you

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.480
talk about and I think I've experienced that as well.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.720
I know what it feels like for joy to move through my body or one of the ways, and I

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:31.920
know what it feels like for sadness to move through my body, but I'm not quite sure how

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:39.680
it feels for bitter sweetness or ambivalence or anything like that.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:41.720
I don't know if that makes sense.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:50.720
Well, you have to maybe engage in some phenomenological methodology and really not on a lazy Sunday

01:45:50.720 --> 01:46:02.600
afternoon, but really this goes into phenomenological analysis, but at least begin by introspecting

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.120
as to what your experience actually is.

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:11.080
I mean, when you feel ambivalent about something, what are the tensions that run through your

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:19.040
body, what are the spatial inclinations that you feel to do or not to do?

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:29.400
What is the kind of maybe incipient movements and pauses that you feel inclined toward?

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.440
Like there are some kind of temporal aspects to it too.

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:44.360
So if you feel ambivalent, there's a certain kind of ambivalence in terms of changing in

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:51.760
terms of the, that was more or less mentioned in terms of tension, but also in terms of

01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:59.200
the way in which you feel impaled toward moving in a certain way spatially or feel more hesitant

01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.880
or in a slower kind of way.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:09.640
So in other words, just begin at least by introspecting and seeing.

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:16.760
And actually in a union sense actually too, you went in, I'm not a union analyst at all,

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:23.240
but the whole idea of exploring something through artistic manifestations, you could

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:27.800
even begin by just finding out, just starting moving.

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.280
I'm feeling ambivalent.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.320
Do I feel like?

01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:37.680
Just to give you something concrete, I'm somebody who is very indecisive.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.320
So Bruce Hehrweiser, Bruce Hehrweiser, I don't know, and I keep going back and forth.

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.920
I want to buy, I have money for it in one book and there are two books I really want.

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.800
And I'm in the computer screen, I can go back and forth and it's just my body and I feel

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:54.760
this inside of me, physically, this is comfort that pulls me in different ways, that's why

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.760
we're speaking that way.

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:00.720
So pay attention to those feelings, the next time you have to choose maybe a shirt to wear

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.720
something like that.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:02.720
Or something else, right?

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:05.880
You chose to go on for tonight.

01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.280
So try to think, what was happening, how do I feel right now in introspect?

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:12.200
And there are different methodologies that they take you further, you mentioned phenomenology,

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.960
they're more complicated, but by paying attention to that or first trying to see, well, what

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:18.280
is it unique about this experience?

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.120
That's also common to somebody else who speaks of the same experience as a beyond decisive.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:22.920
This is what I'm feeling, do you feel this way?

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.240
What do you have in common?

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.200
It's tried to extrapolate from there as you explore this.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.360
Because I think there's this kind of either our state, which sometimes is great when they

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.520
coincide with synergy, sometimes it pulls you apart.

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.760
There's two goals, which one do I want, right?

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.280
It's like, boy, dance donkey, there is hay on both sides and he does restoration.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.920
We have to know which one to eat.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.960
Anyway, I'll eat with that thought.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:54.200
There is something I think very nice about being in this, in between place that we use

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.520
to see it as negative in a way.

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.880
But I think there's also something very enlightened about being in the in between place so that

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:08.320
you can see dispositions, multiple dispositions at the same time.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.960
And those are synergies in themselves.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.960
Those are synergies.

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.960
Those are synergies.

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.520
I was just going to say.

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:21.400
I mean, Maxine, one of the first times that we interacted was going back to these gates

01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:26.200
and actually I was at Yale at the time we could only study finger movements.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:32.440
And I discovered a kind of transition between anti-phase and then phase switching one night,

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.320
thinking about how can my fingers do the walking, you see?

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.080
And analogy again.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.800
And then turning that into a real experiment.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:50.000
But Maxine wrote once that that kind of gate transition, that kind of phase, it turned out

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.880
that that was a phase transition, a qualitative change.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.320
And you analogized it with the idea itself.

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:02.000
Ideation is a phase transition.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.240
So you have new things come up.

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:09.360
And that can be actually taken advantage.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:14.480
You've got co-existing states and then you can create a new thing.

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:16.080
So it can be positive.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:23.080
Thank you all very much.

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:28.720
Thank you.

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:43.020
You know,
