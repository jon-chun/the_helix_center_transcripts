WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Which also didn't help.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
I didn't realise any of these things.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
The wood, right.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Oh, okay.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
You're gonna keep us in line.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Now, what's your...

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Sorry, I'm covering this because it's all...

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
What's your...

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm gonna say...

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
No problem.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
We've heard of the very single response that's said in the moment.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
So do you go under my office?

00:28.000 --> 00:28.000
Very

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I'm getting more

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
and I haven't quite really came yet to go back and forth.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
So I'm kind of...

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm not formally involved in the online.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
That's quite a track back and forth between New End.

00:44.000 --> 00:58.000
And so you live in?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'm Ed Nurse-Secian, the Director of the Centre.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you for being here this afternoon.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
Before I present the participants in the RAM table,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
I'd like to say a couple of words about the upcoming programs.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
Our next program is going to be in April.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I think it's April 27th.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
It's on the Anthropocene about climate change.

02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
After that, we have a round table in May on shame.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
And then in June, early June, I think it's the 7th of June,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
we have a round table on status.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And we are now working on the round tables for the fall.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.000
We have narrowed down to about five or six objects,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
and they'll be on our website shortly.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I would present the participants alphabetically

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
and they can raise their hand, so you know who they are.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
And I'm going to be very brief in their bios,

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
as you all have, I think, the printouts.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Kenneth Deal is Professor of Physics and Chemistry

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
at Stony Brook University and Director of the Laufer Centre

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
for Physical Biology.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
He helps solve the protein folding problem

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
and is interested in the principles of proteins, cell evolution,

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
and the early molecular origins of life.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
Pre-annataraean, pre-annataraean, I should say, more formally.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
He's Professor of Astronomy and Physics at Yale University.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
His research is focused on exotica in the Universe Dark Matter,

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Dark Energy and Black Holes.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
She's noted for her key contributions to two of the most challenging problems

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
in cosmology, mapping the distribution of dark matter

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and tracing the growth history of black holes.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Some of you have maybe gotten hold of what we printed out

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
about a prediction she made that has finally been proven correct.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
She made the prediction 20 years ago when she was a graduate student

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
at Cambridge University.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
She predicted that cosmic winds driven by black hole could potentially

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
carry gas and other star-making materials thousands of years away

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
from their host galaxy.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
And apparently now that has been proven correct.

04:40.000 --> 04:53.000
There was some controversy around it, but it has been proven correct.

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
Dennis Overby, sitting there, is the cosmic of Flair's correspondent

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
for the New York Times.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
His reporting can range from the mating habits of black holes

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
and zero-gravity fashion shows to science in the movies,

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
the status of Pluto and the fate of the Universe.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
He's the author of two books, Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
the Story of the Scientific Quest for the Secret of the Universe,

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Award for Nonfiction,

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
and Einstein in Love a Scientific Romance.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Caleb Scharff,

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
he's a director of Astrobiology at Columbia University.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.000
His research career spans cosmology, exoplanetary science,

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
and Astrobiology.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
He currently leads efforts at Columbia University in New York

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
to understand the nature of exoplanets and living environments in the Universe.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
He's also a global science coordinator of the Earth Life Sciences Institute's

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Origins Network at the Tokyo Institute for Technology

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
and the co-founder of Y House Inc.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
That's Y House Inc.

06:16.000 --> 06:28.000
The rent table today was initiated by

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
a communications editor and I had together,

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
and he has helped me in the planning of this rent table.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
He's professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
and an affiliate scientist at the University of Tokyo,

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Tokyo's Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
He has carried out extensive astronomical observations

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
at numerous U.S. and international observatories.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Working in both theoretical and observational astrophysics,

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
he has published more than 250 research papers

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
with concentration on the broad range of topics.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
So with that, we can start.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
It's what we're talking about.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Should I start?

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
I thought I'd start by talking about

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
the theme of this afternoon is life in the Universe.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.000
I want to mention two aspects that particularly fascinate me.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
First is a recent development,

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
which is the expansion of the code of life as it were,

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
the sort of development of the synthesis of new eight additional four letters

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
in the genetic code synthetically done.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
Just reported very recently, just about a month ago,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and I think Kent can probably elaborate a little bit more on

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
what the implications are, but the implications are just astounding

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
because these additional four constituents,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
in our DNA we have GCA and T,

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
and these expansion of those four to eight,

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
just combinatorially sort of increases the number of ways

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
in which you could possibly create life

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
and broaden the definition of what life really is.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
So I found that very, very new development, very exciting to read.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So I don't actually work on astrobiology myself,

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
but I regard myself as someone who takes a lot of intellectual risks

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
and is sort of bold.

08:58.000 --> 09:07.000
So I thought a lot about the ways in which our conceptions of what life is,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
and therefore its probability of occurring as we know it,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
similar to us, I think we've limited our possibilities.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And I think we should open up our imaginations

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
to really speculate about sort of wild other forms of life.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
And I think in the past, historically people have been bolder

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
than we have been,

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
and I sort of invite us to think more broadly about what could be life.

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
And the second point I sort of wanted to make was about a new way

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
to think about what really life is,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
and thinking about life and intelligent life.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
So these have been debates in the field across disciplines.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Maybe think about life not just as the possibility for self-replication

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
and so on, but also think about it more broadly

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
so that we can bring in the concept of intelligent life

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
as the ability to produce information

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
and the period for which that information could last.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
So we could think about how advanced a civilization is, for example,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
because these are going to come up when we talk about how we assess

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
whether we can have intelligent life elsewhere.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
And I think there's a way, you know, if you look at the amount of information

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
that's...

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Whoops.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It's just you in the past.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I can hear the past!

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, we'll see you in the past.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
So I think if we, you know, I'd like to think about,

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
so if you look at DNA and how much information there is, right,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
and we look at all the information in the books

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
and the knowledge that we've created, we actually quantify that,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
I think this capacity to generate

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
information that is multifold, so in our case

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
it's about, you know, 500,000 to a million times, more than the material,

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
the information that constitutes us. That could be a new way of thinking about

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
intelligence.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I'll just stop that.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I'm going to take a look at my book.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'm going to say about it.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I actually wanted to jump in.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
So you brought it up and I think it's really interesting and I'm curious to get

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
people's reactions. This new piece of work, I think it was Steve Benner and his group,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
who constructed essentially DNA

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
with eight letters, if you will, eight base pairs

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
rather than in the alphabet rather than four.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
You know, I think it's clearly a

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
wonderful technical piece of work, but I have some questions about it

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
and I'm wondering if anyone else has some thoughts on this.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
So it seems to me it's a proof of possibility, but it's not a proof of existence.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
And part of the reason I think it's not proof of existence

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
by any stretch of imagination is it's one thing to manufacture

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
a set of molecules that do something

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
seemingly more than the naturally evolved set of molecules,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
the DNA, but that doesn't tell you that

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
an organism could have evolved somewhere that utilizes

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
eight base pairs because of the burden that comes with that.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I assume I'm looking at you because you may have a

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
response to this. You know, to make use

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
of eight letters in your code

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
means you have to have a set of machinery,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
a molecular machinery that isn't overly

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
burdened by the energetic demands of suddenly having to

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
do what is that, how do you feel about that? I agree. I think where

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
these new bases are going to be of value as drug discovery

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
is they're going to give us better handles on being able to go after DNA

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
and go after the proteins that they make. I don't think it's going to tell us very much

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
about what life could have done for the following reason

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
that what living systems now use is 20 amino acids

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and so there's this 64 option code

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
at the moment genetic code and as you say there's costs

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
too. On the one hand there's combinatorics and that's an advantage because it gives you a new space

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
of what options could I have and yet biology

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
settled on essentially 20, a few others, but essentially

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
20 amino acids and as you say there are costs, there are fitness costs to everything

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
and one of the things that you see, especially in bacteria, over time

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
is they really strip down their genomes and they strip down

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
their machinery to be just as efficient as they possibly can

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
and so if a 40 letter, if 40 amino acids were a good idea

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I think we would see it and we don't and I think the reason

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
for that is because diversity, chemical diversity, is the thing

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
that's so powerful in proteins that you don't have in nucleic acids

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
chemical diversity right now with the 20 amino acids

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
we have plus charge, minus charge, hydrophobic interactions, salt

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
bridges, hydrogen bonding, we cover the whole spectrum of

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
the kinds of things you want to do as a chemist. It covers all the

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
kinds of little pieces of molecule that you want to

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
catalyst chemical. With this contingent on the environment and what

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
is available, so we're talking about earth like conditions right so

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I was just arguing for the possibility of imagination

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
with these right now I'm not necessarily

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
a realistic rubric for how you would make life but isn't everything

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
contingent, the ways in which things have evolved are contingent on

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
the base conditions that were available on earth.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
So you could imagine, you can argue yes or no, I mean there's a lot

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
of things that you can do but there's this classic comment

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
that nothing in biology can be understood except in the light of evolution

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
and that's sort of the point of view of I need to know the history of

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
something in order to know how it works. On the other hand, it's much more like

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
a sort of thermodynamics problem. Once you know the environment, you can

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
specify what the thing is, what the biological thing is, think about an eyeball

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I don't need to know where it came from but it's really really optimized

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
to do the job that it does. It sees very well, you can see over nine orders of magnitude

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
of light intensity between night and day and so forth, really really

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
optimized and they don't have to know a lot about the history to know about this.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
One point coming back to your point though also about polymers is

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
that not only the DNA but also in proteins now, there's new diversity

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
and a colleague in California

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
has developed these molecules called peptoids

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
it's a different kind of molecule than a peptide, different kind of molecule than a protein

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
and so it has different kinds of monomer units but they're kind of similar

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
in certain ways and it turns out they do a lot of the same

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
kinds of things that real proteins do so in principle,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
life could have gone that way too, it could have gone a lot of ways

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
and why it ended up where it did, I don't know.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
If I could say I think that your first point about the

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
new letters in the column sort of highlights one of

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
the trade-offs or horns of a dilemma that

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
our basic genetic code already presents this with

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
one of the most amazing things about biology is the

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
incredible diversity of life forms we have

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
on our, well we say from giants, the koi is to

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
single-celled organisms

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
of a huge variety of sorts, the complicated organism, mammals

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
and things like us, you know, you name it, it's hard to even think about

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
the huge diversity of things yet they all have the same

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
genetic code in operation, well why is that possible?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
It's like, it's the same reason you can write a huge variety of books or novels

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
using the letters of the alphabet, you've bought into this

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
combinatoric world where a finite number of

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
things let you do a huge variety of things, so you can

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
write a novel that makes you a giant sequoia tree or you can write a novel that

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
makes you a fungus and you can do it all with the same

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
alphabets and you're adding a few letters to the alphabet as it were,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
but the other side of that, you know, and when we first

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
discovered, when it was first discovered that these monomers

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
make up the polymers, the letters of the alphabet can be synthesized

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
in natural environments fairly readily and probably

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
occur, we know it, in fact, occur in many places in nature,

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
made everyone feel very optimistic about the topic

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
today, life in the universe, there would be life elsewhere, where we could easily

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
imagine they have the same alphabet in many places in the universe,

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
but then the other horn of that dilemma is it becomes like

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
monkeys typing Shakespearean sonnets, you have, you know, there's so many ways of putting these letters to

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
gather, the chance that blind

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
processes, before you get evolution started,

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
which selects certain things, that blind

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
processes will write you a experience on it or a

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
novel or something, starts getting smaller and smaller, and

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
personally, if, you know, it was somehow revealed to us

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
that there was no non-terrestrial life anywhere in the observable universe,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
if it was just dead, dead, dead out there everywhere, and then

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I had to make a guess at why, my guess would be that this is

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
the only place where the monkeys managed to put together a sonnet, and everywhere else

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
they wrote nonsense, and life never got started,

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
I'm not saying that the case, I'm just saying that

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
would be my best guess as a possibility, adding some letters to the alphabet

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
doesn't help that problem, in fact it makes it worse, that's

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
extra keys the monkeys could hit on the keyboard,

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
and, you know, change a word into some... Well, this nonsense and what a Shakespeare

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
is defined by us and our culture, you could have a culture

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
that defines what we call nonsense, is valuable.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
Well, it could be that there, in fact I think it's more likely, in fact, that if there's

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
something else out there, it's quite different from us. Exactly. But

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
it still has to be something that works, you know,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
that reproduces itself, or that at least persists, even if it doesn't reproduce.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
So I think that's these new codes sort of

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
add to that, that, uh,

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
trade-off that we face. I like the idea of

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
nonsense being valued, or sort of, I mean, but then of course, you know, how do you

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
define nonsense? Is it just randomness? It's seen as...

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
This is drifting into the question about intelligence and other things, but

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I really like that. I really like that. How do you...

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
How do we generate systems as

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
a people's of what is considered valuable?

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
So it goes into other... But I sort of close out with the eyeballs.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
I mean, do you think that, do you not reckon that our eyeballs,

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
like a set of eyeballs, let's forget about ours, could have evolved

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
very differently in a methane-rich atmosphere?

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
And if our atmosphere did not have the diffractive properties that it did,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
that provided the basis for

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
our eyeballs to have the range, and they optimized for that, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
So could you contemplate that you could have

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
eyeballs that are optimized for methane-rich?

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
Absolutely. What I would say is, the argument I meant to make before

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
is that I don't need to know the history, but I certainly need to know the environment.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
And that's really what Darwin's all about. It's a matching to an environment.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
And so if you... Environment is totally different. Let's say it's black and dark

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
like at the bottom of the ocean, then eyeballs wouldn't make any sense at all. I would spend a lot

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
of energy on stuff that wouldn't be relevant. But if you...

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
The history... So this issue of eyeballs versus not eyeballs has

21:39.000 --> 21:43.000
also come up a lot in sort of evolution and intelligent design

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
debates of, it's a complex system, and how could you get a

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
complex system unless there were some hand in the making of it all and so forth?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
But if you look at the history of the

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
sort of early organisms like snails and mollusks and so on,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
what you see is a pretty nice story, whether it's true or not, we never know.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
But it's a nice story, and that is that in the earliest mollusks,

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
what you see is a flat row of cells where some of them

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
are a little bit more light sensitive. And that gives you some

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
value. Then if you go further down the evolutionary

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
tree, what you see is it's curved a little bit. That row of cells is now not flat anymore,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
it's curved, and in that way it turns out you can collect light.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
Then you get a pinhole, you keep going further down the tree, you get a pinhole, then you get a

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
lens, then you get a complicated eye. So you can sort of see what's going on here.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
It's detecting light, and it's trying to get finer and finer resolution in that

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
way. But I totally agree with you. I think

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
biologists often speak of genotype to phenotype,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
which means our DNA tells everything, but it's missing

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
one major thing, and that is what's the environment that we're optimized for.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
Just to not to, I mean, because it's such a specific example, but

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
I think this is true that the camera eye that we share with

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
Saffler Pods, it's actually evolved in marine environments.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
So it's kind of like your methane environment, it already evolved

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
in a different environment, and now actually with the adaptation

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
of that, because we're walking around on the cinephus.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Right.

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
At one point coming back to your point, Ed, about the combinatorics.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
There's been a lot of interest in these combinatorics

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
arguments. Some having to do with my direct

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
area, which is protein-fed, and they also have many degrees of freedom,

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
how does the protein find the right structure in a reasonable time?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
It does so. When proteins fold up in microseconds in your body,

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
it's clearly the protein has no sense to do all this stuff.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
But the question you raise a sequence based, very interesting one, I think,

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
because the arguments are, if I have 20 different amino acids

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
that are making an HV on an necklace of a protein

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
molecule, what is the likelihood that I would

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
be able to get exactly the right string of beads that would code for one of your

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
favorite proteins, let's say, lysosine. Typical protein is 100

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
or 1000 amino acids long, and if I have 20 possible

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
options in each position, I have 20 to the 100

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
is the size of the space that I would have to explore in order

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
to find that one protein. And so the issue

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
is, gee, that's essentially impossible. Probabilities 0, 1 over

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
20 to the 100 is 10 to the minus 130. That would never

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
happen. And over the years what we've found though

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
is that what matters is mechanism. And so it's very much

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
in the monkey on a typewriter analogy. It's very much

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
the monkey's hitting each key independently as random, but if the monkey was

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
hitting keys in some poorly the way, it turns out you could do very

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
very much better very quickly. And in the protein case, looking at protein

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
sequences, how do I get lysosine? The critical question

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
between those who think probability is 0 and people who say

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
no, it could happen. The critical issue is

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
how do we ask the probability question? What is the probability

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
of getting the sequence of lysosine? That's one question? Or

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
what is the probability of getting any sequence that folds to the structure

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
of lysosine? They seem very similar, but they're 100 orders

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
of magnitude different in the answer that you get. And so

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
mechanism-wise, what's been found is that yes

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
we have a 20-letter code today. We have 20 amino acids that could go here or here

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
or here. But what's relevant for figuring out

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
how the protein folds and then how it functions is just a binary

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
code. It's some amino acids, half the amino acids are oily

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
and they don't like water so they belong together and the other half are not so

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
oily. So you have blue and red beads instead of 20 different types of

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
beads. So if I have 2 to the 100 and 20 to the 100,

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
already I've just disappeared 100 orders of magnitude

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
of the problem right there. And there's now some experience that indicate

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
that something like that is roughly right. I mean it seems to me

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
again on our question of life at the universe that there's

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
sort of two basic possibilities and

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
places in between them. But at the extreme it's that the monkeys

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
are completely random. And at the other extreme there's some

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
deterministic sequence of chemical reactions

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
that puts together just the molecules that

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
we need to get life started, which sort of sounds

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
scary in a way because it means life scary and

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
from a sort of scientist point of view and that it somehow would imply that the

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
existence of life was built into the basic laws of chemistry

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
and physics. If that were the case though

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
then we would very likely I think have tons of life out there in the universe

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
because it looks like there we have tons of environments.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
I mean 20, 25 years ago we couldn't have, but we didn't know

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
anything much about exoplanets. It could have done there was no life because there was

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
no one suitable environment but we're pretty sure there are plenty of suitable

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
environments. So if it's a deterministic process you know we're off to

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
a Star Wars universe so to speak. Where every planet has

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
something interesting going on from biology point to many planets.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Of course it could also be somewhere in between where there's

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
many you know it's just like the monkeys don't have to type exactly

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
that song that there are many song that's that could have been written and maybe there's enough of them

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
that it's fairly common. But you know between those

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
two extremes you get an empty universe or a full universe

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
and I think based on what we know now and I'm no biologist

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm sure you know better but it's at least conceivable that it's sort of

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
anywhere in between life could be quite common

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
you know slightly common quite rare. It's

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
very important in science to keep track of what you don't know and I think

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
despite the fact that I think popular belief is that there's probably quite a bit of life

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
in the universe and there's certainly a lot of popular

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
interest in that Dennis may be able to say more about that than the rest of us

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
but you know it's we really don't know the answer

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
I would say at this point. Right there's a lot of room between the impossible and the inevitable

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
and I think if you're setting that simply better than that.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
And I think in in chemistry and biology for example

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
a lot of the issue is how long does it take

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
so things that can be pretty close to the impossible

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
and can still happen if you have enough little agents

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
and this is one of the great things about biology is you have cells everywhere and bacteria everywhere

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
organisms everywhere and so in Darwinian

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
processes it also matters just how many attempts you're making and if you just

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
got a huge population and you've got a long enough time

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
you can sooner or later get there and I mean like

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
I don't think it was supposed to inevitable because it certainly took a

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
long time to develop it here on earth as far as anybody can tell

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
I guess you all mean no better than I do but it seems like it was about four billion years ago.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
It depends on what your clock is with much shorter and much longer.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
If you start with Earth being about four billion years old

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
we have like five three point five billion

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
single cells and then another billion later we had multi cells

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
and so on. He takes that half a billion years is not

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
quick I think so it's clearly not something that just happens

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
like instantly I think. Especially since there's a selection effect

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
we had to be on one of the planets where it happened otherwise we wouldn't be here

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
right.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
I think we've said that half a billion years doesn't sound like such a short

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
time. Think about cosmology.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Well one question I have is what would it take

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
anybody here to convince anybody here that they had

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
found life someplace else. I mean how hostage

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
are we to the our conceptions of it

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
that we have? I mean how would you know what signal from

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
another actual planet would actually convince you they were generally there.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
I mean this is something that a lot of discussion has taken place

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
in recent years and it's interesting just you're looking at

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
how different scientific disciplines approach this. So for example

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
astronomers who are looking at exoplanets and hoping in the near

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
future to be able to get slightly more sophisticated data about planets

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
that may or may not resemble the Earth tend to talk about bio signatures

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
but often just yeah so

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
bio signatures covers a number of things so one potential bio signature is

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
what life might do to the chemistry of a planet in particular

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
the atmosphere.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
And so the idea is with future telescopes we may be able to

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
probe using light filtered through the atmospheres of those planets we may

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
be able to see whether there are things like oxygen or water, CO2,

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
or the conceivable even methane and so on all of which we

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
think may have an association with biosphere based largely on what's happening

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
here on Earth. So that's a very simplistic

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
approach though and already even before we've done it

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
we're sort of running into problems with it. So for example

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
in the last couple of years a planetary scientist

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
and astronomers who are interested in this question have begun to recognize

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
that you could actually have in a number of circumstances a rocky planet

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
that has an oxygenated atmosphere but no life. The oxygen

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
comes from combination of chemistry that happens in

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
the atmosphere itself the breakdown of molecules like water or CO2

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
by ultraviolet photons and depending on the kind of surface chemistry

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
you have that may or may not get mocked up by the surface of the planet

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
so you can actually produce a planet with an oxygen rich atmosphere

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
with no biosphere whatsoever. So then of course you say well

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
you've got to look for the other signature molecules and build up a story

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
and so that's a, you know, I think that's a very

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
sound terrible because I'm an astronomer it's a naive way of doing things

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
I think part of what you're asking is a much deeper question

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
which is perhaps more relevant to looking for life on Mars for example

32:53.000 --> 32:56.840
and that's been a topic of discussion. You know the ideal thing would be something

32:56.840 --> 33:00.840
to crawl past your microscope and wave at you and

33:00.840 --> 33:04.840
look familiar. Oh, Shakespeare. That would be

33:04.840 --> 33:08.840
quite a thing if it was dragging a

33:08.840 --> 33:12.840
typewriter and I'm going to give it a...

33:12.840 --> 33:16.840
and then yeah so then there's all this discussion, you know, it comes back to

33:16.840 --> 33:20.840
actually something you raise which is what is life and

33:20.840 --> 33:24.840
maybe you disagree with this but my impression after talking to lots of people over the last

33:24.840 --> 33:28.840
few years about this is within science there's a hundred different

33:28.840 --> 33:32.840
definitions that people point to as their sort of favorite

33:32.840 --> 33:36.840
way of encapsulating the idea of this thing we call living system

33:36.840 --> 33:40.840
some people point to reproduction or you know imperfect

33:40.840 --> 33:44.840
reproduction right in order to have Darwinian selection or

33:44.840 --> 33:48.840
metabolism or entropy as some gauge of what's going

33:48.840 --> 33:52.840
on and it's... I mean actually I'd be interested

33:52.840 --> 33:56.840
to hear people's thoughts on why it's difficult to

33:56.840 --> 34:00.840
come up with that answer you know because it speaks

34:00.840 --> 34:04.840
directly to recognizing life. Yeah. We think that we're alive

34:04.840 --> 34:08.840
I mean I think I know that. I could be wrong.

34:12.840 --> 34:16.840
Well people sometimes say you know the huge fundamental human question

34:16.840 --> 34:20.840
that astrobiology abresses is are we alone

34:20.840 --> 34:24.840
but I think the number two question almost is important

34:24.840 --> 34:28.840
is how different or alike if we're not alone

34:28.840 --> 34:32.840
how you know are we unusual or not

34:32.840 --> 34:36.840
and I think that question

34:36.840 --> 34:40.840
the first question I would say is even easier because we could search

34:40.840 --> 34:44.840
but until we find something the second question is really impossible it's as though you wanted to

34:44.840 --> 34:48.840
study I don't know dogs and you've only ever seen one dog

34:48.840 --> 34:52.840
and so then you don't know

34:52.840 --> 34:56.840
what properties this dog has

34:56.840 --> 35:00.840
or specific to that individual dog or to that breed of dogs

35:00.840 --> 35:04.840
or to dogs in general and you know you're just lost

35:04.840 --> 35:08.840
Yeah it's hard to extract dogmas

35:08.840 --> 35:12.840
especially without a fundamental

35:12.840 --> 35:16.840
first principles understanding you know like biology is like

35:16.840 --> 35:20.840
that's a dog and modern biology is like that's a dog's genome

35:20.840 --> 35:24.840
but we're not you know at the level of being able to answer

35:24.840 --> 35:28.840
questions of like defining life at a fundamental level

35:28.840 --> 35:38.320
it's a little like my colleagues Chris Trig

35:38.320 --> 35:41.320
natural philosophers as they were called in those days are alchemist

35:41.320 --> 35:45.320
argued about what water is what makes something water

35:45.320 --> 35:49.320
is it that you can drink it is it that does all things is that it can

35:49.320 --> 35:55.320
freeze and boil and to steam and there were even Leonardo argued about what makes something

35:55.320 --> 35:59.320
water or not water and there were arguments that

35:59.320 --> 36:05.320
then you had to make sulfuric acid some thought that was a pure reform of water than seawater

36:05.320 --> 36:09.320
because it dissolves things much better than seawater seawater is almost saturated already

36:09.320 --> 36:13.320
with dissolved minerals so it's hard to dissolve things and

36:13.320 --> 36:17.320
you know when the atomic theory of matter came along we have H2O the

36:17.320 --> 36:21.320
discussion was over and new water was

36:21.320 --> 36:25.320
so if we could ever have a discussion of I mean an understanding of life

36:25.320 --> 36:29.320
at that sort of first principles level then we would be in a lot

36:29.320 --> 36:33.320
better position to talk about how to look for it and what

36:33.320 --> 36:37.320
would demonstrate it's there but I very much agree with Caleb that

36:37.320 --> 36:41.320
discussions of detecting life on exoplanet these days

36:41.320 --> 36:45.320
are well whistling in the dark hopeful let's say

36:45.320 --> 36:49.320
but you know it's it looks like it will be really

36:49.320 --> 36:53.320
hard I think it's very would be very difficult to do it with spectroscopy

36:53.320 --> 36:57.320
I think chemical definitions and even basic biochemical

36:57.320 --> 37:01.320
definitions are very tricky one of the classic

37:01.320 --> 37:05.320
sort of disproves of simple arguments about what is life is

37:05.320 --> 37:09.320
metabolizes uses oxygen reproduces and it turns out a candle flame

37:09.320 --> 37:13.320
does that and then we're going to run into problems now with

37:13.320 --> 37:17.320
artificial intelligence what's real and what's alive and what's not alive

37:17.320 --> 37:21.320
I think you know if you think about people there's something

37:21.320 --> 37:25.320
in cells for that matter there's something about purposeful behaviors but I don't

37:25.320 --> 37:29.320
know any spectroscopic way you're ever going to see something like that

37:29.320 --> 37:33.320
well people have talked about looking for pollution industrial pollution

37:33.320 --> 37:37.320
quite quite seriously compounds that we cannot think

37:37.320 --> 37:41.320
of any non-biologic that sorry we cannot think of any

37:41.320 --> 37:45.320
non-biological way to produce it however intelligence

37:45.320 --> 37:49.320
unfortunately even that turns out nature is really good at making things

37:49.320 --> 37:53.320
that are unexpected so I recently heard a discussion so

37:53.320 --> 37:57.320
chlorofluorocarbons have been held up as one example of

37:57.320 --> 38:01.320
a technologically produced compound that has a definite

38:01.320 --> 38:05.320
impact on a planetary environment by removing ozone in the atmosphere

38:05.320 --> 38:09.320
but I recently heard work done people actually studying Earth's

38:09.320 --> 38:13.320
deep past there's this giant volcanic

38:13.320 --> 38:17.320
lava system called the deck and traps and realizing

38:17.320 --> 38:21.320
that there's a geophysical geochemical root by which

38:21.320 --> 38:25.320
could have produced chlorofluorocarbons all by itself you know 200 million years ago

38:25.320 --> 38:29.320
without well without yeah without the intervention of intelligent

38:29.320 --> 38:33.320
life so maybe pollutants aren't even a particularly

38:33.320 --> 38:37.320
mature of any kind of life planets are quite good at polluting themselves

38:37.320 --> 38:41.320
so I feel that we're not ever going to converge on one I think it's

38:41.320 --> 38:45.320
all going to be as simple as H2O I think it's

38:45.320 --> 38:49.320
well probably there'll probably be many different definitions of life

38:49.320 --> 38:53.320
and maybe what we'll be looking for is some kind of Venn diagram

38:53.320 --> 38:57.320
to kind of make the decision of okay is this

38:57.320 --> 39:01.320
actually life but kind of as I started out in the beginning

39:01.320 --> 39:05.320
you're sort of your thread of trying to define

39:05.320 --> 39:09.320
intelligent life in terms of

39:09.320 --> 39:13.320
information production and the

39:13.320 --> 39:17.320
persistence of...

39:17.320 --> 39:21.320
yeah and it also I mean it does relate to this question of looking for life

39:21.320 --> 39:25.320
in the universe I mean rather ironically right if you found a planet that was

39:25.320 --> 39:29.320
beaming out radio structured radio signatures on a TV show

39:29.320 --> 39:33.320
you definitely know there's life there right we wouldn't we wouldn't be in the show

39:33.320 --> 39:37.320
it would depend on the show and the channel

39:37.320 --> 39:41.320
so I mean then for that reason just to mention

39:41.320 --> 39:45.320
within my field there has been a growing interest in

39:45.320 --> 39:49.320
resuscitation of this field of SETI of search extraterrestrial

39:49.320 --> 39:53.320
intelligence although now we call it techno signatures because that's less of a trigger word for

39:53.320 --> 39:58.840
the you know people's memories of what were thought to be failures in the past but actually

39:58.840 --> 40:02.840
part of the issue with the search extraterrestrial intelligence is

40:02.840 --> 40:08.840
we've looked so little we really have looked so little but you know that's the remarkable thing is if you got that

40:08.840 --> 40:12.840
you would definitely unambiguously I think be able to say

40:12.840 --> 40:18.840
that there was recognizable life on a planet and that fits into this question of yes you know the nature of

40:18.840 --> 40:22.840
intelligent life and the information that we carry

40:22.840 --> 40:26.840
around externally to it I mean humans are pretty peculiar

40:26.840 --> 40:30.840
in that respect you know we carry around and propagate into

40:30.840 --> 40:36.840
the future throughout human history back to the first you know the first exchange of a story around a campfire

40:36.840 --> 40:44.840
Torquevard, where the cave art, Dawkins would call it you know memes, the generation of memes and those

40:44.840 --> 40:48.840
their propagation but I think it's even more diverse than that

40:48.840 --> 40:52.840
that is an interesting quality that we have

40:52.840 --> 40:58.840
and of course it also but it's conferred great evolutionary advantages to us

40:58.840 --> 41:04.840
you can write a book about you know don't eat this plant because it will kill you

41:04.840 --> 41:08.840
and a hundred years later someone will read that book and it will save their life

41:08.840 --> 41:12.840
so there's a certain advantage to be able to store this information

41:12.840 --> 41:16.840
but it comes at a cost there's an energetic burden to it

41:16.840 --> 41:24.840
so what is the current status of the SETI like funding and programs

41:24.840 --> 41:28.840
I mean I know that in the 1980s it was federally funded

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
it died in the 1990s

41:30.840 --> 41:32.840
what is the status?

41:32.840 --> 41:34.840
Dennis do you want to say something?

41:34.840 --> 41:40.840
I don't think there's ever since I think 1992 when

41:40.840 --> 41:44.840
they pulled the plug on SETI but there's been any federal funding

41:44.840 --> 41:46.840
for actual radio searches

41:46.840 --> 41:48.840
but there was private funding?

41:48.840 --> 41:52.840
there's private funding, there's this SETI Institute which was

41:52.840 --> 41:56.840
do all the SETI scientists said okay we're going to raise our own money

41:56.840 --> 42:00.840
and they're quite successful and they you know Paul Allen built this

42:00.840 --> 42:04.840
big array of radio tales for them in Northern California

42:04.840 --> 42:08.840
and now they have Yuri Milner who's like spending

42:08.840 --> 42:14.840
$2 leasing telescopes and wants to send an iPhone to Alpha Centauri

42:14.840 --> 42:18.840
which is an amazing idea but

42:18.840 --> 42:20.840
8 is involved in that.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.840
Yeah, big idea lies in the morning of the Breakthrough Initiative

42:22.840 --> 42:26.840
such as the iPhone to the Stars Project I should say

42:26.840 --> 42:30.840
the Breakthrough Foundation which is Yuri Milner's Foundation funding of SETI

42:30.840 --> 42:36.840
is a separate initiative of both the connection to some of the people in life

42:36.840 --> 42:40.840
and is spending $100 million over 10 years

42:40.840 --> 42:44.840
which I think is the current rate of spending on SETI

42:44.840 --> 42:48.840
and it's basically a classical radio SETI looking for

42:48.840 --> 42:52.840
signals from radio signals that I'll

42:52.840 --> 42:56.840
buy Q2 to extraterrestrial civilization is probably the highest rate of

42:56.840 --> 43:00.840
spending on SETI that we have ever had in history

43:00.840 --> 43:04.840
and is in the design of that experiment is to

43:04.840 --> 43:07.840
what Kayla mentioned that we hadn't looked very much.

43:07.840 --> 43:10.840
The goal of that is called Breakthrough Listen

43:10.840 --> 43:14.840
everything is called Breakthrough Something in that world.

43:14.840 --> 43:20.840
So Breakthrough Listen's goal is to expand the volume of face-space frequencies

43:20.840 --> 43:24.840
and sensitivities and so on by about a factor of a thousand over what's been done before

43:24.840 --> 43:30.840
so however little we have looked so far the goal is to look a thousand times more

43:30.840 --> 43:34.840
by the time this is done it started a few years ago so

43:34.840 --> 43:38.840
I don't remember exactly when we probably have another six or seven years before

43:38.840 --> 43:40.840
the project.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.840
And a lot of people were...

43:42.840 --> 43:44.840
But that's still a tiny fraction of the galaxy even when they've...

43:44.840 --> 43:45.840
Right.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.840
You can look on that housing amplification.

43:48.840 --> 43:52.840
Yeah that's certainly true. It is very hard to prove something isn't there.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.840
Almost no matter how much you've looked you could

43:56.840 --> 44:04.840
always look much more because you can look for arbitrarily small

44:04.840 --> 44:06.840
signals you can look at different wavelengths.

44:06.840 --> 44:10.840
I don't think I'll be talking too much out of school to say that you really ask me for advice

44:10.840 --> 44:15.840
on how to spend money on a steady search

44:15.840 --> 44:19.840
and I should imagine that he took none of my advice

44:19.840 --> 44:22.840
which is probably why he has so much advice.

44:22.840 --> 44:28.840
But there's a lot of possible ways of looking that are not just searching for radio signals.

44:28.840 --> 44:32.840
Right it's still very anthropocentric right I want to come back to that so

44:32.840 --> 44:36.840
I remember mentioning to Keilemun Mime last time that there's a book

44:36.840 --> 44:40.840
written in 1864 by Camille Flamiro.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.840
It's called Lumen and it's imaginative.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.840
It's about a planet where you have sentient plants

44:46.840 --> 44:50.840
that digest and eat and breathe and speak to each other

44:50.840 --> 44:53.840
in a tongue that we wouldn't understand.

44:53.840 --> 44:58.840
So I mean all these ideas were looking for radio signals

44:58.840 --> 45:02.840
very tied to very anthropomorphic view of life.

45:02.840 --> 45:06.840
So how do we expand?

45:06.840 --> 45:10.840
Well I think, yeah no so you're absolutely right and it's also extremely skewed

45:10.840 --> 45:14.840
in terms of you think about the history of life on earth.

45:14.840 --> 45:19.840
For most of the history of life on earth there would be no techno signatures whatsoever.

45:19.840 --> 45:25.840
It would all be chemistry or colours or other variations on the planet.

45:25.840 --> 45:30.840
So in that sense it's already almost stacking the odds against it.

45:30.840 --> 45:37.840
If our planet is in some way representative of how evolution plays out

45:37.840 --> 45:39.840
we obviously don't know that.

45:39.840 --> 45:44.840
The fact that technological beings have only existed for maybe the last 100,000 years

45:44.840 --> 45:48.840
we have really no idea whether that's the norm

45:48.840 --> 45:51.840
or whether that's some extreme.

45:51.840 --> 45:56.840
So I think you're absolutely right and this is one of the

45:56.840 --> 45:59.840
in that whole field.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.840
It's very very challenging as well.

46:02.840 --> 46:10.840
People always I think fall into the trap of the well a species would do this wouldn't it?

46:10.840 --> 46:16.840
Which is completely skewed towards our own and it's usually skewed to

46:16.840 --> 46:21.840
you know Western European ways of thinking about the world anyway.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.840
And that is problematic and I'm not sure we...

46:24.840 --> 46:27.840
Well it's limiting, it's severely limiting.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.840
Incredibly limiting.

46:29.840 --> 46:35.840
But the problem with not doing that, you know it's like the old things looking for your keys

46:35.840 --> 46:36.840
under the light post.

46:36.840 --> 46:40.840
If you don't look for something that's like us, you don't know, you know,

46:40.840 --> 46:43.840
Yogi Berra said if you don't know where you're going you may not get there.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.840
You may not find it.

46:46.840 --> 46:52.840
And I think we've seen a recent example of that in discussions of the interstellar small body

46:52.840 --> 46:58.840
that passed through the solar system back in late 2017.

46:58.840 --> 47:03.840
Um, the name was given.

47:03.840 --> 47:10.840
It has a number of puzzling properties and the idea has been put forward that it was some piece of alien

47:10.840 --> 47:18.840
artifact, you know, some sort of spacecraft or space debris of some interstellar

47:18.840 --> 47:20.840
traveling culture.

47:20.840 --> 47:24.840
And I mean it couldn't be but the problem with the hypothesis like that,

47:24.840 --> 47:28.840
the problem of just looking for a civilization that's not like us,

47:28.840 --> 47:33.840
is that it has too much explanatory and not excessive explanatory and insufficient

47:33.840 --> 47:34.840
predictive power.

47:34.840 --> 47:37.840
You can explain anything and predict nothing.

47:37.840 --> 47:42.840
Because we know nothing about their capabilities or motives and, you know,

47:42.840 --> 47:46.840
no matter what happens you could always say, well that's because the aliens wanted to do this

47:46.840 --> 47:49.840
or wanted to fool us or do something.

47:49.840 --> 47:57.840
And, you know, it could be but it's very hard to engage that hypothesis in a scientific way.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.840
It doesn't mean it isn't true but it's just hard to do anything with it.

48:00.840 --> 48:06.840
I mean I think the one positive thing about, for example, the Umu Amua work and particularly

48:06.840 --> 48:11.840
some of these interpretations or analyses that suggest,

48:11.840 --> 48:15.840
maybe it was a, you know, a solar sail or a light sail or something like that.

48:15.840 --> 48:21.840
The one positive element of all of that discussion I think is that, you know,

48:21.840 --> 48:27.840
sort of in Bayesian terms, instead of setting the prior to zero possibility that something

48:27.840 --> 48:33.840
unusual might have a relationship to intelligence or others be, to give it a little leeway.

48:33.840 --> 48:39.840
You know, it's not zero. It's not one. It's some tiny, tiny number.

48:39.840 --> 48:44.840
And that to me is very interesting because we haven't really done that before, right?

48:44.840 --> 48:49.840
We've tended to say, well, that's such, we just don't think that's going to be a good

48:49.840 --> 48:54.840
possibility, which it comes means, again, if you never look, if you never allow it to be one

48:54.840 --> 48:57.840
of the possibilities you'll never see it if it actually shows up.

48:57.840 --> 49:01.840
So that's the one positive I think came out of that.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.840
I'm very sinned and fledding.

49:03.840 --> 49:08.840
I mean, one for all for speculation and, you know, playing with one's imagination

49:08.840 --> 49:11.840
and expanding the possibilities, right?

49:11.840 --> 49:18.840
So one other thing that's always kind of puzzled me is, you know,

49:18.840 --> 49:23.840
Stephen G. Gould has famously said that, you know, if we rewind the tape of evolution on Earth,

49:23.840 --> 49:26.840
you might not end up with us, right?

49:26.840 --> 49:35.840
So this, the role of randomness in evolution, is there anything more?

49:35.840 --> 49:40.840
We can milk, I'm just saying, well, those random sort of circumstances.

49:40.840 --> 49:48.840
Is there, are there people doing experiments like if one, something along the sequence

49:48.840 --> 49:52.840
that we now understand quite well was different, what could we end up with?

49:52.840 --> 49:56.840
Are there simulations curious of...

49:56.840 --> 50:03.840
So I think one thing that is becoming clear now, especially in cell experiments,

50:03.840 --> 50:08.840
where you can replay the tape, you can keep running it, take the same set of cells,

50:08.840 --> 50:10.840
you can do all this in the laboratory.

50:10.840 --> 50:14.840
It's not like watching zebras over, you know, thousands of years and so on.

50:14.840 --> 50:19.840
And that's a very big focus these days of evolutionary studies as well,

50:19.840 --> 50:22.840
because you can work so quickly and see so much.

50:22.840 --> 50:25.840
And the answer there seems to be, replaying the tape,

50:25.840 --> 50:31.840
gives you whatever answer you should get based on the environment you end up in.

50:31.840 --> 50:37.840
So as opposed to saying, I can tell you exactly the root this took, usually you can't do that,

50:37.840 --> 50:42.840
but you can say, if you're ending up in an environment that has the following,

50:42.840 --> 50:48.840
then it's going to succeed in the same ways it does now, more or less,

50:48.840 --> 50:49.840
with some variation.

50:49.840 --> 50:57.840
And so largely it seems to be, if you replay the tape, until to the same endpoint,

50:57.840 --> 50:59.840
then you're going to get the same result.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.840
But it's like knowing...

51:01.840 --> 51:06.840
So coming back to my methane atmosphere, so if you run your simulation and say,

51:06.840 --> 51:12.840
well, you're stuck in a habitat that is going to be methane rich,

51:12.840 --> 51:13.840
then what happens?

51:13.840 --> 51:16.840
We can play that game now, right, with the cells.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.840
Here's what I want to do if I live in methane.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.840
But if you said, so here's the sort of root issue.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.840
Suppose I said, I'm going to live in methane for a little while,

51:26.840 --> 51:31.840
and then I'm going to live in an oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere like we do.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.840
And then you said, okay, I'm going to play the tape differently though.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.840
I'm going to swap it, and I'm going to do just the opposite.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.840
First, I'm going to live in this one, then this one,

51:38.840 --> 51:42.840
but then I'm going to come back to this one so that my endpoint is exactly the same,

51:42.840 --> 51:45.840
but now I went through a totally different root.

51:45.840 --> 51:49.840
Then the answer at the moment seems to be it only matters what the endpoint is,

51:49.840 --> 51:51.840
not how you got there.

51:51.840 --> 51:56.840
And often evolution does seem to take all the roots it can.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.840
One thing that the modelers, you mentioned modeling,

51:59.840 --> 52:05.840
one of the things that modelers have often found is if you work in very high-dimensional spaces,

52:05.840 --> 52:08.840
and these are all high-dimensional spaces, because there's spaces of,

52:08.840 --> 52:13.840
I could make this mutation at this time, then this mutation, at that time,

52:13.840 --> 52:16.840
I have a whole lot of different mutations, a lot of different times.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.840
I could take all kinds of different roots.

52:18.840 --> 52:20.840
It's like traveling from San Francisco to New York.

52:20.840 --> 52:24.840
I got all kinds of ways I go through Dallas, or I go through Chicago,

52:24.840 --> 52:26.840
I go this way, or I go whatever.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.840
I got all these different roots.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.840
And the thing is, I can't tell.

52:30.840 --> 52:31.840
I can't tell anything.

52:31.840 --> 52:35.840
When I see the car in New York City, I don't have any idea where it came from.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.840
So I think that the rule of thumb seems to be

52:40.840 --> 52:48.840
in these high-dimensional spaces, it turns out pretty much always easy to get from some point

52:48.840 --> 52:51.840
to some other point, but you can't tell what that root was.

52:51.840 --> 52:59.840
Presumably, as well, thinking in sort of practical, tangible terms,

52:59.840 --> 53:04.840
when we say, oh, the environment is methane environment or toxin rich,

53:04.840 --> 53:08.840
there are many other aspects to any given natural environment

53:08.840 --> 53:13.840
that may have a subtle or not subtle influence on what's been going on.

53:13.840 --> 53:20.840
In a laboratory condition, maybe you do have that case of,

53:20.840 --> 53:27.840
you always end up kind of looking the same, but in a more realistic environment,

53:27.840 --> 53:33.840
there will be differences at some level because of the complexity of the environment itself,

53:33.840 --> 53:34.840
I would imagine.

53:34.840 --> 53:35.840
Absolutely, and this is really interesting,

53:35.840 --> 53:38.840
because this has been a huge puzzle.

53:38.840 --> 53:43.840
One of the grand puzzles really of Darwinian evolution is

53:43.840 --> 53:47.840
the idea of normal evolution is winner takes all.

53:47.840 --> 53:53.840
If I have an environment and this beast can take better advantage of living in that environment

53:53.840 --> 53:57.840
than this one can, this beast wins and that beast loses and you never see this beast again

53:57.840 --> 54:00.840
and you only see this beast, winner take all.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.840
But if that's true, how do you explain all the diversity of life?

54:04.840 --> 54:06.840
That we see today.

54:06.840 --> 54:10.840
This is very difficult to explain, and so this comes down, I think,

54:10.840 --> 54:14.840
the answer sort of is shaping up to be something along the lines of exactly what you just said,

54:14.840 --> 54:21.840
and that is sure, if I am a cell, I care about sugar, I want my glucose or something,

54:21.840 --> 54:25.840
I need my food, but I also care about other stuff in the environment,

54:25.840 --> 54:30.840
and all of those things can be coming in at all kinds of different levels,

54:30.840 --> 54:36.840
and so ninjas are sort of everywhere, and you could think about this in a sort of a corporate world too.

54:36.840 --> 54:41.840
You know, it's amazing how many different kinds of Kleenexes there are toothpaste or something like that.

54:41.840 --> 54:46.840
You know, somehow there's a niche for everybody, they seem to be able to survive.

54:46.840 --> 54:54.840
I've thought about that, and it always seemed to me that this idea of survival of the fittest isn't quite right,

54:54.840 --> 54:57.840
it's more like survival of the fit enough.

54:57.840 --> 55:02.840
I mean, it's good for all of us.

55:02.840 --> 55:09.840
So it's evolution is sort of a tautology, it says what persists.

55:09.840 --> 55:22.840
So any species or creature, well, not a single creature, but any sequence of ancestry that does well enough not to be extinguished is still here.

55:22.840 --> 55:29.840
I mean, it's again sort of circular, tautological, and certainly niches help with that,

55:29.840 --> 55:33.840
but even in the absence of niches, even in exactly the same environment,

55:33.840 --> 55:38.840
you can have quite a bit of diversity of things flourishing, you know, to the rainforest,

55:38.840 --> 55:45.840
and there's not one kind of tree or one kind of beetle, there's an insane number.

55:45.840 --> 55:49.840
But let me inject slightly to your point about survival of the survivors.

55:49.840 --> 55:58.840
This has certainly been an objection to evolution of, well, how would I define fitness in the first place if it's anything different than just surviving?

55:58.840 --> 56:02.840
You know, is there anything there besides just being a tautology?

56:02.840 --> 56:04.840
You know, you survive if you survive.

56:04.840 --> 56:14.840
But the classic case that argues that there really is something more to it than that was in early 1800s England,

56:14.840 --> 56:22.840
because there was a moth called the peppered moth, and in the old days in England, the trees were fairly white with speckles,

56:22.840 --> 56:28.840
and the moths ended up, they were fairly white with speckles, and so the birds didn't see them, they'd land on the trees, and the birds didn't see them.

56:28.840 --> 56:36.840
But then from the early 1800s, so the middle 1800s, the industrial revolution happened in England, and there was soot everywhere,

56:36.840 --> 56:42.840
and the trees turned black from soot, and what happened was the moths that evolved were black,

56:42.840 --> 56:49.840
so the peppered moths were still around, the black moths were there, but the peppered moths were the ones that all got picked off by the birds then.

56:49.840 --> 56:55.840
So the argument about survival to fit is what it comes down to in a case like this is survival.

56:55.840 --> 57:02.840
I think the wording is not great, because it really does sort of point you in that direction, point all of us in that direction.

57:02.840 --> 57:10.840
But survival is a property of the whole population, and I want my lineage to survive.

57:10.840 --> 57:18.840
But fitness is a property of the individual, and so here's a case where the population ultimately survives,

57:18.840 --> 57:24.840
you know, various moths are going to get picked off and not picked off, black ones and peppered ones and so on by the birds.

57:24.840 --> 57:31.840
But on average, the individuals that survive more are going to be the black ones, and so you can say,

57:31.840 --> 57:36.840
well, blackness is what fitness is all about in this case, I have a mechanism that's the individual thing,

57:36.840 --> 57:40.840
and then the individual thing propagates to the population.

57:40.840 --> 57:46.840
So I think probably if Darwin recognized that this was going to be a problem, he could have,

57:46.840 --> 57:50.840
or somebody could have figured out a different way of saying it that doesn't make it sound too tautological.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.840
Otherwise it's too convergent.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.840
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

57:54.840 --> 57:56.840
I'm not contingent enough, right? Yeah.

57:56.840 --> 58:02.840
Yeah, and it doesn't give you a sense of sort of what models, you know, what's the mechanism underlying any of these things.

58:02.840 --> 58:09.840
So that's, I mean, coming back to, I guess we're supposed to be talking about life in the universe, that suggests then, right?

58:09.840 --> 58:20.840
But one thing we could say about life elsewhere is there will not be a planet of all where only life is a single type of organism with identical structure,

58:20.840 --> 58:26.840
because that is not how any of this works, and that's going to be a universal truth.

58:26.840 --> 58:27.840
Yes.

58:27.840 --> 58:32.840
But there should be diversity anywhere. Yes. It would be comforting exactly what kind of diversity.

58:32.840 --> 58:37.840
Yes, and it makes us worry a lot as we lose diversity these days.

58:37.840 --> 58:45.840
Another related to that is the point about diversity in early origins, and there's a sense that, in the old days,

58:45.840 --> 58:52.840
there was sort of the sense that, well, somehow or another, some cells arose and they got competitive with some other cells,

58:52.840 --> 59:02.840
and the cell lineages were already competing with each other because that's sort of the fundamental feature of biology is the Darwinian thing about competing and so forth.

59:02.840 --> 59:10.840
But there's this view now, this guy Nigel Gold, of Illinois, and this view, very interesting, and I think it's very sensible,

59:10.840 --> 59:21.840
and that is that the way life emerged was not, you know, your family competing against my family and so on, among all the animals and species and so on.

59:21.840 --> 59:36.840
It was this big soup of proteins and nucleic acids, and it was sort of like one organism, and the separation out into individual lineages didn't happen too much later.

59:36.840 --> 59:44.840
And it's interesting because you see this reflected in bacteria, there's a thing called horizontal gene transfer, and bacteria,

59:44.840 --> 59:53.840
so Darwin's tree of evolution says, you know, I came from my parents and my parents came from their parents and all this stuff, and so it's like a tree all the way down.

59:53.840 --> 01:00:02.840
But the thing that bacteria do is they violate this tree in a big time way because they just cross over here, they just pass their genes over to anybody who wants them,

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.840
and the genes get passed around, that's called horizontal gene transfer.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:19.840
That stuff happens all the time, it happens in us too, we got cells, most of ten times more cells are bacteria in us than are us cells, and they're not good.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840
It's in a microbiome.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.840
Yeah, so it's a microbiome.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.840
And those cells are doing this kind of swapping all the time.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.840
It was modern technology pushing medicine towards that direction.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.840
Very much, yeah.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:36.840
Direct transfer again, yeah.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:44.840
There's a lot of activity going on right now in the microbiology world to try to figure out the microbiome, and how much does your gut have to do with your health?

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:50.840
And, gee, could I reconfigure your gut if you're not healthy and things of that type?

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:59.840
The difficulty with it is it's way harder than studying a single kind of cell because you're studying an entire ecosystem, and everybody in there is sort of

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.840
they've got their neighborhoods and their communities, and it's like New York City when it's in your gut.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:05.840
You know, it's complicated.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:18.840
There's also been a lot of debate about the microbiome and humans or any organism that has a microbiome, and, you know, Darwinian selection in terms of this idea of the hollow-biant.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:29.840
So, you know, the microbes in you, what their interests are, what they want or need may be different at some level than what you need.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.840
And so when you look at a human being, what...

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.840
This is a big philosophical question.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.840
I mean, so when a micro-biome is not you, I mean, I would think it would be you.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.840
No, no, this is purely from a sort of Darwinian fitness point of view, right?

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:57.840
When you look at a human, when I look at Dennis, I evaluate your evolutionary fitness in terms of your cells and what you're doing, or your microbiome, or the combination of that.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:12.840
And I know some people have been saying that the selectable quantity is actually the interaction of all these things in some sort of abstract sense, which is very, very fascinating to me.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:20.840
Because that's sort of moving away to a different sort of definition of complex life that's not...

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:22.840
Selectability can be really complicated.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:30.840
And one of the things that's of great interest right now is that we make these things...

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.840
They're mathematical things, and they're called fitness landscapes, and they look like hills.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:45.840
And what they're supposed to represent is that organisms that are more fit are higher up the hill, and organisms that are less fit are lower down the hill.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.840
And so these are just sort of simple mathematical cartoony kind of representations of that idea.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:58.840
So the idea is, okay, let's see if I weaken figure out what kind of organism is more fit than what other organisms are.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.840
Here's the problem with that, and this is what's kind of new and really interesting.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.840
That's not the whole story.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.840
There's another thing that people are calling the Red Queen hypothesis.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.840
What that amounts to is, also you have predator prey relations.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:23.840
It's not just about me fitting my environment, just an individual, and that individual's personal fitness or the lineage for that environment.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.840
It's the environment.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.840
It's the environment interacting with everybody.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:36.840
And so the predator prey thing is, let's say I'm the prey, and you're the predator, and we're both sitting at some level on this fitness landscape.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.840
You're equally fit, and I'm equally fit, or whatever.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:51.840
And now you start chasing me, but you're chasing me around certain changes that can be made biochemically in me that have nothing to do with changing my fitness, improving it or making it worse.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:04:03.840
Or you either. It's just you're chasing me, and so you get better at capturing me, and then my genome evolves, and I get better at avoiding you, and then you get better at catching me again, and I get better at avoiding you.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.840
And it turns out we're running around this hillside, never making it any further up.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.840
But we have to do this, because this is part of evolution, too.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.840
And it makes everything even more complicated than it was.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:25.840
We've talked a lot about evolution, and I want to suggest some of it via a value just to be imaginative.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:36.840
So let's try to imagine a life form or a life on the planet, where evolution isn't really a major factor, it doesn't work very well.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:45.840
And let me motivate this by saying, I think people are kind of a little hand-wavy and vague about what evolution requires, because they are well.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.840
And we just have to have self-replication going, and then we'll get selection, and we'll have evolution.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:56.840
But really there's a lot of factors. You have to have a flexible way of storing information.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:03.840
It has to express that information, it has to be expressed some way, otherwise there's no selection on it.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.840
It has to make accurate copies, but not too accurate, otherwise there won't be any mutations or changes.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:17.840
But it has to be accurate enough that you're not forgetting information faster than you're generating it.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.840
And the errors that you make have to be non-deterministic, otherwise you'll always go in the same direction.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:32.840
So they have to, in some sense, be stochastic or random, so you can explore this whole landscape of different fitnesses.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.840
And there was one other. Oh, yeah, and you have to have all this text energy.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.840
You have to have a stable metabolism to drive it.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:50.840
So all of this fooling around with the information content has to go on without destroying your ability to make copies,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.840
either through metabolism or destroying the copy mechanism.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:02.840
So there's quite a set of fairly complicated requirements for evolution to occur the way it does on Earth.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:13.840
And obviously, we do have those mechanisms here, and it's played as our discussion has illustrated a dominant role in determining what life is like on the Earth.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:25.840
But there might be systems made even out of the same beads on the basic biochemistry, which don't satisfy all of those things.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:32.840
And so you can have life and some of the things, some of those factors, but it just doesn't evolve very well.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.840
I can think of that might lead to just the confidence.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.840
So those kinds of simulations would be just fantastic.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.840
So there you might find a planet which only has one type of life or something.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.840
Well, what it made me think of, and it's sort of jumping forward a bit, it's almost a very science fictiony idea.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.840
It was an outrageous idea, so I'll say that.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:56.840
And it's not a reason, but it's still in principle something that would happen, sort of naturally.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.840
Imagine a species, a sophisticated species, a sort of technological species,

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.840
decides it does not want to evolve anymore.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840
Right?

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.840
Just says no, because I mean, this is always comes up when we talk about interstellar travel and moving around the galaxy.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:19.840
The truth is, by the time you end up on the other side of the galaxy, you're going to be a different biological entity because of evolution.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.840
But suppose some species decides it doesn't want to do that.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.840
So what it does is it says, okay, there's no more biological reproduction.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:31.840
We're going to build a machine and it's just going to pop out clones on demand.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.840
Then you'll have a lifetime and you'll die and then you'll be buried, but you're not reproducing biologically.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:43.840
And now so the question is, assuming the environment is stable, I mean, that could conceivably exist.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:44.840
Right?

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.840
And it's a sort of rational decision.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:50.840
Right? I kind of like us to all stay the same way.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:55.840
I don't want to end up with tentacles or whatever a billion years time.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.840
So that could, I know that sounds like it's an artificial thing, but it's not, right?

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.840
It's an evolution to the point where you make that decision.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.840
Sounds going to be boring.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840
I'm sorry?

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840
It sounds kind of boring.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.840
Yeah, I mean, sure.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.840
Maybe it's an unimaginable species.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.840
You don't want to get it checked from their line.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.840
It's sex with reproduction, so you could still, you know.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.840
So there's a, you know, it would require an arrogant and narcissist species.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.840
I wonder where we could find one.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
Yeah.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.840
How far we have to look to find one.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.840
So there are examples of exactly what you're talking about.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.840
Andrew Murray at Harvard has done a really interesting experiment.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:41.840
And it turns out if his cells live in a very fixed environment and they never change,

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.840
they just start jettying all kinds of stuff that has to do with evolution.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.840
So there's this notion of the evolution of evolvability.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.840
And so the sense is that certain organisms, if you're in a very fluctuating environment,

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.840
you have a lot of machinery to be able to sort of handle all of those fluctuations.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.840
But if you're in an environment that's very fixed, then you can throw a lot of that stuff away

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840
and you don't need to evolve.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.840
But then, of course, the problem is you're really brittle.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.840
If all of a sudden, someday, global warming or something comes along and just changes slightly,

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.840
what your environment looks like?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.840
Bang, you're kind of all, your whole population's dead.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:31.840
I also want us to think a little bit about, it's quite possible that a species might actually not have the curiosity

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.840
to go seek out other species, right?

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.840
That's another part of the answer of a more perfect view that we carry around.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:47.840
There could be sort of a more content species that has somehow learned to live better with his environment than we have.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:53.840
Well, there are humans that people now, humans, who said don't go looking for aliens.

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:56.840
They're going to come and eat us or some kind of slave us.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.840
That's a view that people vow hold.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:08.840
Or that's one view, but there are also people who think we shouldn't be spending all this money on space travel

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.840
or space rides or colonizing Mars or whatever else.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:22.840
And that maybe we should save our planet, we should eradicate diseases here, and learn to live better in a better harmony.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.840
Or we're hardly spending any money on those things.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.840
It doesn't even make a mark in the federal budget really.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.840
We're not spending money on either of those things.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:41.840
It feels like it's people object to the attention being given to these things.

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.840
I mean, as you say, they matter to actual money.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.840
It's not so much the money, it's about the sentiment.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.840
Yeah, they're very interesting.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:55.840
So I'm just to be devil's advocate, because I basically agree with you, but in the big picture, the earth will not stay.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:58.840
In a condition that is good for us.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.840
And that could happen on timescale.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.840
A hundred thousand years, it could happen on timescale.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840
A million years, whatever.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.840
Irrespective of how green we become and careful we become.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:18.840
So there is this bigger level question of, you know, and this is one of the excuses someone like,

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:26.840
our Musk uses for going to Mars, well, you know, it's a backup plan.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.840
It's a really long-term picture.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.840
The earth like any planet.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:33.840
It's good for us now.

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.840
In fact, it's been in a period that has enabled humans to emerge.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.840
And it hasn't always been like that at all.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.840
And it won't be like that again, the future, no matter what we do.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.840
So I just wonder, I mean, the difficulty with that, it's really long-term planning.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.840
It's interesting from an evolution.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:55.840
From an evolutionary point of view because there is fundamental mismatch in the kinds of timescales

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.840
on which we have evolved and the timescales.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Perhaps it's the contrast between evolutionary timescales and our lifespan.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:11.840
Maybe that's what it is, that is making us such short-termy folks.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:16.840
Well, I mean, once you start thinking down those sorts of avenues,

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:24.840
and maybe this is relevant to one of your future roundtables about the Anthropocene planet.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:35.840
Because we've paid or disliked or tried to avoid death and, you know, at an individual lifetime level,

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:42.840
we sort of conceive that wise behavior for our species, for public policy,

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.840
would be to resist changes in the environment.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:52.840
You know, there's even this idea called, what's it called, Gaia,

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.840
that the biosphere in general tries to stabilize the environment.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.840
I don't actually see any evidence at all for that in my opinion.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.840
But would that even be a good thing?

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.840
And, you know, there's this view that, you know, what do they call them?

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.840
Would most of the species die out? I've lost the phrase.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:13.840
Mass extinction?

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.840
Mass extinction, right.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
There's the idea that mass extinctions are, you know, that there might be one coming

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:25.840
from either human causes or other causes, and we'd better do something about it.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.840
But we wouldn't be here where they're not mass extinctions in the past,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.840
and indeed, you know, the whole history of life, which we're so fond of,

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.840
not only because it led to us, but because it led to them.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.840
The difference is that the difference compared to previous mass extinctions

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:50.840
and are being here is the accelerating lever arm that human activity has provided, right?

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.840
And so this might be a mass extinction from which we may not recover at all.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.840
Right, and we may not. Something probably will help.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:03.840
And it does seem to be going fast, but I'm not sure it's faster than, you know,

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.840
the asteroid that crashed down.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840
Who says that humans have to survive anyway?

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.840
Exactly.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.840
Anyway, I mean, we're going to have our turn and we're going to be gone.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:18.840
I mean, a far more wonderful species could go along in the space less by us

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:25.840
that has these traits of, you know, deep thought and tranquility and we have to get out of the way.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.840
I mean, we just don't know.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.840
Or maybe not, or just our iPhones floating through the gallantry.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.840
There's an experiment in cells that proves your point and it has to do with time constants.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:43.840
You know, what's my lifetime span versus when am I likely to see my next mass extinction

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.840
or big devastating event or something?

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:52.840
You can do this in cells and it turns out what you do is you put drugs in and cells don't like drugs.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840
These are ones that knock the cells out.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.840
So you put drugs in and you do it sort of periodically.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:04.840
And if you do it sort of on a time scale where the cell says, okay, now time is fine.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.840
Okay, now I'm getting hit by drug and back and forth and so forth.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.840
Then the cell develops these resistance mechanisms.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.840
On the other hand, if the time constant is pretty slow over the population time,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.840
they just jettison that stuff.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.840
They don't need it anymore.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.840
And I suspect maybe we're a product of that too.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.840
The difference, of course, it's argued to answer my own question is

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.840
we have four sides about the future that presumably cells don't have.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:31.840
Yeah, imprintable.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:38.840
So if we cause a mass extinction, it may be feeble compared to the one that was caused by the great ox,

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.840
you know, when the photosynthesis changed the atmosphere to an oxygen one,

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:52.840
but presumably the organisms that gave off all that oxygen didn't have any way of evaluating what its impact would be

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.840
in the future.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.840
I don't know, responsibility or...

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.840
That's a great question for me.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.840
So where is this foresight?

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.840
Because we're all made of cells.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.840
The great question for me.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.840
The cell in my body knows the future.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.840
And you have somehow, I think I know the future.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840
Where is that?

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.840
This collective intelligence somehow, right?

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:26.840
Does it just mean, or do I know in your relationship that everybody wrote on this table?

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:32.840
Well, actually I do know a lot of it in relation to the people around this table, because they're my sources.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.840
But...

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840
Is that me?

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.840
No, no.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Maybe it was the aliens.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Heaves dropping.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.840
Come and say that.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:54.840
Pretty asked a question earlier, or made a comment earlier about maybe these other life forms nonsense to us as important to them.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.840
So quick.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:57.840
So that would raise the challenge.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.840
How would we ever find such life forms if they were interested in what we would call nonsense?

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.840
Would they be discoverable even to us?

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:20.840
Yeah, I mean that relates to also, there's a thing in the discussion of SETI and the efficiency of transmitting information between stars and also keeping it secure.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:28.840
And so, I think actually this bizarrely enough came up in some conversation somebody had with Edward Snowden.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.840
I was going to say, or a calendar, for example, I can imagine.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:39.840
So this idea that perfectly encrypted high efficiency data is indistinguishable from noise.

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:44.840
So the aliens talking to each other across the cosmos, we might not...

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.840
Even pick it up.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.840
Is there any sort of structured information? It's just more cosmic hiss.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.840
I know that's not quite what you were talking about, but it triggered that thought in my head.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:56.840
Okay.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.840
I'll open it up for questions from the audience.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
I don't think you were on.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840
Okay.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.840
And yeah, we're open for questions from the audience.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:32.840
Please ask questions and note on guns.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:49.840
Okay, this is not a question, but a few observations directed primarily to Dr. Dhill.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.840
And then anyone else if you allow the time, which is unlikely.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.840
So, one...

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.840
No, that I reject.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840
One minute.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.840
That's a good question.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:07.840
All right, so in terms of the two factors that I've really noticed are, of course, that of anthropomorphism and that of imagination.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:15.840
So I'm going to give examples of why this is more important than it may not be apparent to some.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:24.840
A few years ago, a couple of scientists took a mathematical model of Darwinism in order to try to answer the question,

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.840
what is the benefit that death gives?

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:33.840
And long story short, it was discovered that for a particular group, not a whole species, but for a group,

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.840
the food resources that are available on a generation by generation basis,

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.840
extends or diminishes life expectancy.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:48.840
So that is the value is not for the current generation, but for the next.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.840
So that's one thing.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.840
In terms of SETI and radio communications, we're a very young species.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.840
Radio waves are the beginning.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:10.840
Again, relatively recently, counterfactual entanglement allows entanglement between particles that never have to interact.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:18.840
And it's also secure without using a non-quantum key, which means that if there are anything like us,

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.840
except hopefully they've been around longer, a billion years, a hundred thousand years,

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:31.840
they may be using counterfactual communications, which in fact has been already demonstrated in the laboratory.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:37.840
And if they're a little bit like us and didn't destroy their own planet and they're there,

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:45.840
it may well be the case that they are making assumptions that we also are using quantum communications of that nature,

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.840
which is why we're not hearing a damn thing.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.840
We're not there yet. It's still in the lens.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.840
So I'll just finish with why I'm motivated by it as Einstein.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:03.840
Imagination is important in knowledge because knowledge is limited, but imagination encompasses the entire universe.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.840
And that also engages not just space, but time.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:17.840
In other words, the use of imagination to look at potential futures is not only wonderful, but necessary.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:23.840
Maybe I would just say the beginning that it was shut up.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.840
I already said it wasn't a question.

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.840
So I just wanted our response from yourself.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.840
I think I wanted to say something.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:39.840
Just very, very briefly, I would say that many of the more thoughtful people in the SETI community have long

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.840
admitted that our best chance of hearing from classical radio SETI would be if our punitive,

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:54.840
expectarrestrial civilization was sending signals intended to be easy for us to pick up and understand.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:00.840
One thing is wanting to make contact. That's why I married that point earlier.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.840
Rather than us eavesdropping on something they intended for each other or whatever.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:11.840
And I can comment on your first point, which has to do with longevity and energy investment.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:18.840
If you look across species, you see exactly that, that some species live quite a long time and others live

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.840
in much shorter time. A lot of this has to do with when do you have babies?

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:29.840
And so if your physiology is such that you have babies early and your life span, you will die early.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.840
So you're just needed long enough to have babies and then after that you're not anymore.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.840
And so for example, we can compare us to species like one that's called the naked mole rat,

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.840
which turns out to just live a very long time, for example.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:50.840
And what you discover is that evolution could have, if we look at them, these other species.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.840
Evolution could have designed us differently. We could have lived a lot longer.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.840
But we didn't because this is how long it takes for us to have kids.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840
Thank you.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.840
Before I ask my question, I'll just comment on the SETI project.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.840
I have a background in electrical engineering.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:21.840
Electromagnetic waves are a very inefficient form of communication. They do not penetrate solid objects

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:29.840
or electromagnetic objects like stars. So more likely means that communication would be either what the gentleman mentioned,

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:40.840
quantum communications, entanglement, or neutrino communications, which, you know, we have no technology that I'm aware of

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.840
to use neutrino communications.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:56.840
But my point, you know, the entire supposition that there is extraterrestrial life of any form,

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:02.840
let alone technological life like us, is based on probabilities.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:12.840
And the probability of our having evolved on this planet with perfect conditions for us to have evolved

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:22.840
is still practically zero. And it took us one third of the life of the universe for us to evolve, to be technological beings.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:31.840
If you change one single factor in our evolutionary course, if, you know, if the asteroid had not hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago,

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.840
the dinosaurs would certainly, mammals would not be ruling the planet. Reptiles probably would be.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:45.840
And I don't think they would be broadcasting sitcoms to cosmic evil.

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:52.840
They would be broadcasting the equivalent of dinosaurs' sitcoms, dinosaur communications.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:25:00.840
But again, another technological civilization if it existed probably wouldn't know where to look, which is what

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:05.840
we discussed before. But let me see if I remember my question.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:12.840
My question is, since it took us one third of the life of the known universe for us to evolve,

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:27.840
an extremely unlikely evolution, does anybody believe that in the short 14 billion years that our visible universe has existed,

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.840
that there would be a replication of that evolution or anything comparable to it?

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.840
Well, there's an interesting story.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.840
Probability is probably just too low.

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:38.840
But we have no idea.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:46.840
Can I just say you're making an awful lot of assumptions, including that we have any idea what the probability is that we're here.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.840
I mean, Ed might want to comment on that. Ed has written beautiful papers about this.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840
The level of ignorance is extreme.

01:25:54.840 --> 01:26:00.840
We know somewhat the probability of our own evolution, because we know what the steps were.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840
I wouldn't.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.840
And they were trillions and trillions and trillions of improbable steps.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.840
But this is a change of single one.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:16.840
Yeah, I see your point, but it's all about interpreting things after the fact.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:27.840
I would say our probability of a replication of evolution to a technological civilization within the short 14 billion years.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:38.840
I would disagree, because I think that given that unless you think we started on Mars, the probability that we evolved on Earth is one.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:39.840
We're here.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:40.840
Right?

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.840
That's one data.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.840
Yeah, that's there's no evidence that anybody else is here.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:47.840
So I can tell you an interesting story.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:27:00.840
This is back in 1972-73, Francis Crick, the famous guy who discovered the double helix, worked with a guy named Leslie Orgel, and they put out this idea called directed panspermia.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.840
The idea of panspermia had existed a long time before.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:14.840
Panspermia means that life has existed in the universe before, and somehow it ended up here, but panspermia, the old idea itself, was just, hey, it's everywhere, and it landed here.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.840
And that's why we have only one genetic code, because there was this one bottleneck, and it sort of was the thing that landed on Earth and so on.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:29.840
Anyway, what Crick and Orgel did was they gave these talks, I heard one as a graduate student, and then they wrote this as a paper called directed panspermia.

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:41.840
And directed panspermia, the idea is, no, it's not that there's just life everywhere in the universe, it's that somebody out there is sending something straight to Earth for some purpose, and they're trying to get us going.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:50.840
And those of us who were in the audience couldn't tell if these guys were, I mean, they were super first-rate scientists, both of them.

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:51.840
Whether this was-

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:59.840
Whether this was a scientific hypothesis, or whether this was a British sense of humor.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:07.840
And at the end of the day, so it turns out this became quite a well-known idea, this directed panspermia thing.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:13.840
In the meantime, I think now the whole scientific community has kind of dismissed it, including Crick.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.840
Before Crick died, he then became sort of an RNA world guy.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.840
Well, just a footnote to your comment, a footnote to history was not correctly discovered DNA.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.840
In honor of International Women's Month, it was a Rosalind Frank.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.840
Turn it up.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.840
Turn it up.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.840
One, go ahead.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:37.840
Good afternoon, ma'am.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:39.840
Extraordinary debate.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.840
My name's Anthony Fimbo, by the way.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:49.840
I run a company called Eagle Genomics, and we're building technology to explore the microbiome, not just the human microbiome, but the microbiome of the earth.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.840
And I've got so many ideas, I want to try and string together in a very simplistic way.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.840
I'm not a scientist, I'm not a astrophysicist, I'm not a biologist.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:05.840
But I am a cybernetesis, and I just want to talk about the Gaia thesis, first of all, in a quasi-scientific way.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.840
Starting by just making a bit of a contrast.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:12.840
So we have most of the debate today focused on the happy accident.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.840
Francis Crick's happy accident, never to be repeated, versus some conversation about determinism.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:28.840
I don't know if anyone is familiar with Eric Smith's work, the idea that the earth is a giant battery, and that the

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:37.840
the citric cycle as the basis for this chemical breakdown means that life is in inevitability on this planet.

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:40.840
It's one idea, the second idea is to talk about the microbiome.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:47.840
And that's really an anthropomorphic, anthropocentric view of the holobiant, because the soil is a microbiome fundamentally.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:53.840
Plants interact with the soil, we interact with plants, etc, etc, etc.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.840
So, I wanted to close.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:08.840
So I just wanted to try and expand on the ideas of determinism, Gaia, and on the idea of the holobiant, to ask the question about whether that might get us a bit closer to understanding what life actually is.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:14.840
One word answer, sure.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.840
I think it's a good question.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.840
So we have this tendency to think about things in isolation.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:33.840
We put it in a test tube and study it, we'll understand it, but of course nothing actually lives in a test tube in the real world.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:44.840
I think I see this coming up also slightly different, but in field of AI research, people talk about, oh, how do we make a general AI that is like us?

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:54.840
But you're doing it in a test tube, and I don't think that's ever going to work. It has to somehow be out in the complexity of the universe in order to develop more skills.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:31:00.840
So I think, yeah, I don't really have a good answer. I'm making a comment to your question.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:10.840
Yeah, absolutely. But I'm not sure how we're going to fully incorporate the enormous complexity of the entire biological system of the Earth.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:23.840
Maybe one comment. There's a lot of complex systems that share a lot of features, and I think we could learn from looking at each complex system and the other.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:38.840
One example of this is that Sergey Masloff some years ago was at LBL, sorry, we're having looked at software usage.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:52.840
How many software packages call other software packages? And what it was a story about is that some stuff is really useful, writing a little code that adds to and to, and everybody uses that, and then there's other codes that are more complicated and so on.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:32:02.840
Looked at the complexity of software codes. And he then, he also looked at the complexity of biochemistry, and he discovered the distribution functions of these things are identical.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:15.840
And as if what we learned from the software, looking at the software, was that there's sort of swapability and there's usability and stuff that's really good and useful, you just use it as much as you can.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:31.840
And there's a broader field too of what some people call explore and exploit computational modeling, where the idea is you have complexity and you're trying to search a landscape, maybe some complicated mathematical function, and you're trying to look for the,

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:36.840
say the mountain peak or something, and how do you find it in the most efficient possible way?

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:45.840
Well, what you do is you do, you have sort of two modes. One is when you think you're headed up a mountain, you just go for it, and that's the exploit part.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:57.840
And when you don't quite know where you are, you're going up a little and you're going down a little, what you do is you just keep doing random things, it sort of splits into an entropy like thing and an energy like thing, but it's how Monte Carlo people

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:04.840
and how people who do super computing protein folding in our kind of world, for example, all kinds of things,

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:15.840
function in some what similar ways, they find answers in these sort of with the swapping off randomness and optimization.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:26.840
And I think another example of this is industrial innovation. If you ask, so one of the examples that comes up often in origins, questions,

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:32.840
it comes up in origins, is chicken and egg problem, what came first, the chicken or the egg?

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:45.840
Well, that's a badly posed problem because chickens and eggs come up together, and so it's not, you don't get one or the other, and then boom, the egg pops open and now comes to chicken for the first time.

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:53.840
And if you, there's, and so this has to do with sort of the sequence of events that things can happen.

01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:01.840
If you look at industrial innovations, very similar to this, and also the origin of evolution of the eye, for example, what's the evolution of the iPhone?

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:13.840
Well, you can say, well, okay, let's see, is half an iPhone, this is the argument about an eye, half an eye would be useless, therefore, there's no fitness value, therefore, it couldn't have evolved and it had to have come from some other thing.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:22.840
What about half an iPhone? Well, half an iPhone, there was half an iPhone, but it's not sewing it in half, that obviously would be a useless thing.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:35.840
Half an iPhone was, what happened if we, when we started back in the 1940s, we invented computers, we invented transistors, we invented GPS, we invented Internet, those were all the threads.

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:51.840
So half an iPhone was sort of between 1947 and now, what would it have been? It was probably, half an iPhone was probably an Apple II, and it was large-scale integrated circuits, and it was some clumsy version of an Internet, and it wasn't anything that looked like an iPhone, and it was not gold-directed.

01:34:51.840 --> 01:35:02.840
It was not gold-directed in any way, and so I think that all of these complex systems, there are commonalities that we should be exploiting somehow or another.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.840
I don't know how to do it, and I think your points won't very well taken though.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:19.840
Yeah, I mean, I think the only sort of brief comment I have is that you're absolutely right, that probably what we need to consider are networks that facilitate life, so connections between conditions.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:25.840
So it's a much more complex problem than saying whether you need oxygen or water.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:39.840
I sort of would go back and thinking about the issues you raised and the issues of previous question raised, is we're a little bit back to trying to study dogs with just one example of a dog to look at.

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:50.840
I think Eric Spitz works on these cycles, a brilliant description of what happened on Earth. Are they relevant for what's happening on other planets?

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.840
We just don't know, I would say.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:03.840
And again, we have to keep track of what we know, and we don't know, and that question number two is how different or similar are we if there is other life out there?

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:09.840
Is I think something that we fundamentally don't know. What are the ways we might find out?

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:21.840
One, which I think Ken has been talking about, is we may understand biology and what's happened on Earth, and a deeper and deeper and more systems levels so we can see the patterns that might be the same.

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:32.840
And of course the other is to search for life elsewhere, and if we find it, we'll learn some of my undergraduate mentor Philip Morrison, who was one of the pioneers of SETI actually,

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:43.840
what said finding a single example of life anywhere. I think he said finding life on Mars would change life from a miracle to a statistic.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:57.840
So we have to probably try both of those. I mean, we are trying, and I think should continue to try to advance in both of those ways towards answering those sort of questions.

01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:10.840
What's contingent, what's convergent, but we shouldn't pretend, and it's fun to talk about this, but we just don't know until one of those programs of research succeeds are hopefully both of them.

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:15.840
Thank you very much.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:35.840
I don't know if you discussed this before I got here, but my question is about the extremophiles and the types of life you find in sulfuric lakes and in thermal vents and something like the tardigrade where, you know, what's going on with these creatures and do they share DNA with us?

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:52.840
Yeah, good question. Yes, they do. They share DNA with us. It's interesting. There are studies now where you can take a given organism that's a mesophile that grows at our temperature, let's say, and the same organism that's the thermophile equivalent.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:38:08.840
So it does the same things, and it has DNA that's pretty similar, except it just happens to live at the higher temperatures. And you can ask what are the differences, and now there's something like 50 different thermophiles for which a lot of proteins are known and understood clearly and so forth.

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:23.840
It's an interesting process. You can rationalize to some extent how the proteins changed and how they became better at folding up and doing their enzyme activities at the other temperatures.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:46.840
But they otherwise, their organisms just like us, the DNA, you know, across species, the DNA is very similar. The difference between everybody in this room is about 0.1% in your DNA. The difference between all of us and chimpanzees is about 1% and between us and the great apes is something like 4%.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:51.840
And it's the same thing with thermophiles and mesophiles. The differences are really small and subtle.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.840
So we can't really talk about the absolute requirement for life, though, in terms of...

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.840
No, exactly. It depends on the environment.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:12.840
And also, just to add, I mean, those extremophiles, we call them extremophiles. Many of them do not do well in our environment, our preferred environmental conditions. So to them, we are the extremophiles.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:23.840
Okay. Thank you very much.

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.840
Thank you.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.840
Thank you.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:52.840
Thank you.
