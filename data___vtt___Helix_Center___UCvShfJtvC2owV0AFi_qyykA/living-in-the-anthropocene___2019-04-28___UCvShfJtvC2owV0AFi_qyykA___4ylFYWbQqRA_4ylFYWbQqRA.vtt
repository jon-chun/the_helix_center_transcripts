00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Okay, I'm Ed Narsasian, I'm Director of the Helix Center.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.680
Today's program is on living in the Anthropocene that was suggested to us by

00:13.680 --> 00:20.280
Nirmi Shake, who is sitting there and I think she had conversations about it with

00:20.280 --> 00:24.000
Don Moss and Akil Bylgrami.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.100
Before I tell you something about the participants, we have two more programs

00:32.100 --> 00:40.860
before the summer. On May 18 we have a program on SHAME and on June 8 we have a

00:40.860 --> 00:51.360
program on status. I'm going to be super brief on the bios, the more extensive ones

00:51.360 --> 01:03.280
are available on our website. Akil Bylgrami is the Sidney Morgan Besser

01:03.280 --> 01:10.000
Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University. Amit of Gosh is the author of

01:10.000 --> 01:15.080
the Great arrangement, climate change and the unthinkable and of course many

01:15.080 --> 01:21.960
others. Dale Jamison is Professor of Environmental Studies and Philosophy at

01:21.960 --> 01:28.960
New York University. W. John Kress is distinguished scientist and

01:28.960 --> 01:35.400
character of botany at Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Donald

01:35.400 --> 01:39.600
Moss is a psychoanalyst, program chair of the American Psychoanalytic

01:39.600 --> 01:46.280
Association and founding member of the Green Gang. Nirmi Shake, co-host and

01:46.280 --> 01:54.840
news producer of Democracy Now. She will take over as you know we don't do

01:54.840 --> 02:00.120
moderating on these programs but she will get things going. Thank you.

02:00.120 --> 02:05.720
Thanks very much Ed. So just so everyone knows what the format is, there's roughly

02:05.720 --> 02:11.440
no format. We'll just begin talking and it'll be a kind of free conversation and

02:11.440 --> 02:16.080
after we've spoken for a bit then we'll open it up to the audience for questions.

02:16.080 --> 02:20.360
So I'd like to begin by asking John Kress who's an environmental scientist

02:20.360 --> 02:26.640
to just lay out the scene. What is the anthropocene? When did it begin and you

02:26.640 --> 02:37.880
know what are the most salient features of this period?

02:37.880 --> 02:44.400
I recently published a book called Living in the Anthropocene. It's

02:44.400 --> 02:50.880
appropriate to start with the scientific basis of where we're at in the year 2019

02:50.880 --> 02:54.560
in terms of environmental change and this is not just climate change as

02:54.560 --> 02:58.320
though we think of this as primarily a climate change and a global warming

02:58.320 --> 03:02.640
issue. There's a lot of alter-authority planet that are going on right now that

03:02.640 --> 03:08.600
make this broader than just pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. About 10,000

03:08.600 --> 03:14.000
first I should say the earth 4.6 billion years old has been fluctuating in terms

03:14.000 --> 03:19.600
of the climate, the temperature, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as well

03:19.600 --> 03:24.520
as the as well as life on the planet. We started out with single-celled

03:24.520 --> 03:29.560
organisms and now we're primarily dominated in terms of physical presence

03:29.560 --> 03:38.360
and weight by multicellular animals, mammals, birds, plants. So there's this

03:38.360 --> 03:43.200
dynamic aspect of the earth has been going on for a long time. But about 10,000

03:43.200 --> 03:48.880
years ago, maybe 12,000, the end of the last major period of ice ages on the

03:48.880 --> 03:54.280
planet, homo sapiens, humans were around at that point. And about 10,000, 12,000

03:54.280 --> 03:59.320
years ago, suddenly the climate began to stabilize and we don't exactly know

03:59.320 --> 04:03.640
what caused that stabilization but the the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere

04:03.640 --> 04:08.200
stabilized, the temperature stabilized and that was the period when actually

04:08.200 --> 04:14.480
humans began to develop our own civilization, our own cultures, agriculture

04:14.480 --> 04:21.120
began domestication of animals, began. So it was this long period of stasis that

04:21.120 --> 04:25.800
I attribute and maybe some of my colleagues attribute to how one species

04:25.800 --> 04:30.640
on the planet, namely homo sapiens, humans, began or became the dominant

04:30.640 --> 04:37.400
species controlling many of the aspects of how the planet functioned. That stability

04:37.400 --> 04:42.080
of that climate, particularly the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the

04:42.080 --> 04:48.880
temperature has now come to an end. All climate scientists agree that this

04:48.880 --> 04:54.680
period of stability is now moving into a period of great fluctuation. CO2 is

04:54.680 --> 04:58.520
increased in the atmosphere because primarily of the burning of fossil

04:58.520 --> 05:02.520
fuels. That has led to an increase in temperature because of the greenhouse

05:02.520 --> 05:10.360
effects, many of you I'm sure are aware, the rampant use and abuse of resources

05:10.360 --> 05:14.080
around the planet, whether it's wood resources, whether it's fossil fuels,

05:14.080 --> 05:21.280
whether it's fresh water, all of those abuses of natural resources has also

05:21.280 --> 05:25.640
radically begin to change in the last few years. And as Nermene said, we're not

05:25.640 --> 05:31.320
quite agreed upon when we reached a point where change was such that we

05:31.320 --> 05:37.160
could maybe call this a new epic on of the planet, which used to be called the

05:37.160 --> 05:43.000
Holocene. But most scientists agree now that it was about the mid-1950s where we

05:43.000 --> 05:47.480
reached what was called the Great Acceleration when all of these aspects of

05:47.480 --> 05:52.520
the environment reached a point where they all skyrocketed. So over that period

05:52.520 --> 05:57.360
of time since the mid-50s, we've now reached a period in the age of the

05:57.360 --> 06:02.760
planet where many of the aspects of stability are radically changing. And I

06:02.760 --> 06:07.160
think that's what we want to address today. What does that period of change,

06:07.160 --> 06:12.600
how is that going to affect, first of all, us as a species, but also how the rest

06:12.600 --> 06:17.160
of the planet functions, whether it's biodiversity, whether it's cycling of

06:17.160 --> 06:21.560
water, cycling of nitrogen, whatever, all those things are changing. And I think

06:21.560 --> 06:26.880
probably a lot of you are here because you're as concerned as we are about

06:26.880 --> 06:31.680
this period of rapid change. So I hope that's kind of what you wanted me to

06:31.680 --> 06:36.320
address in terms of setting the stage of where we're at.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.280
Amitabh, what about you've written this?

06:42.920 --> 06:48.280
Very powerfully about the environment, about forests, about human beings in

06:48.280 --> 06:54.200
relation to the earth. Today, if you pick up, you know, go into a bookshop with

06:54.200 --> 07:01.360
South Asian literature. It's really all urban stuff. It's all, a lot of it is

07:01.360 --> 07:06.560
political in the sense of being about politics or it's about identity. But

07:06.560 --> 07:11.880
this other thing, this great reality that is outside us hardly seems to

07:11.880 --> 07:17.280
impinge, you know, on people's sensibilities. And that is, I think to me,

07:17.280 --> 07:22.560
it's the big question. I mean, you know, after all, Hurricane Sandy happened here

07:22.560 --> 07:28.320
in New York. It has a larger concentration of writers than almost any other place.

07:28.320 --> 07:34.600
But the curious thing is, can you think of the great Hurricane Sandy novel? There

07:34.600 --> 07:41.000
are novels about New York, you know, drowning in the future. Many, several, but

07:41.000 --> 07:44.720
there's not a single book about New York's actual drowning.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.320
But also, as you say in the book, so I'm after this, I'm not going to ask any more

07:49.320 --> 07:54.000
questions because I'm not supposed to. But in the book, you also point out that

07:54.000 --> 07:58.200
when literature explicitly deals with these issues, it's almost always

07:58.200 --> 08:03.920
relegated to the realm of science fiction. Yes, absolutely. You know, you look at

08:03.920 --> 08:10.320
all the big reviews and so on. I mean, it's quite rare to see, you know, novels

08:10.320 --> 08:15.600
that deal with these issues ever being regarded as literary fiction. So, you

08:15.600 --> 08:21.560
know, we subscribe to a notion of boja seriousness, which by definition excludes

08:21.560 --> 08:26.400
these unlikely things, except that they're not so unlikely anymore. But I must say

08:26.400 --> 08:32.120
that in 2018, there was one book which I feel made a huge difference. And that's

08:32.120 --> 08:37.160
Richard Powers' book, Overstory, which was actually on the shortlist for the

08:37.160 --> 08:42.840
Man Booker Prize. And I think in, I mean, you know, it's, I can't go into all of it

08:42.840 --> 08:50.320
right now, but I think this book is a very significant event in literary history,

08:50.320 --> 08:59.640
really. I mean, all of you, really. It's a very interesting thing that even

08:59.640 --> 09:09.360
progressive and left-leaning writers, thinkers, pretty much till 20 years ago,

09:09.360 --> 09:16.080
at most, never really thought very much about nature, but never thought about

09:16.080 --> 09:22.920
future generations. Novelist Bonnie Natsom called Love in the Anthropocene. And

09:22.920 --> 09:28.240
we run various public radio shows and so on. And I come from the world of

09:28.240 --> 09:31.480
philosophy and environmental science, not the world of literature, although writing

09:31.480 --> 09:39.120
fiction was fun. And I remember this phrase, idea fiction being used in a

09:39.120 --> 09:43.720
derogatory way. Not, I mean, it wasn't that this is

09:43.720 --> 09:49.520
didactic. No, it was just the very idea that the fiction somehow carried an idea

09:49.520 --> 09:55.360
already seemed to be a strike against it. I think that's, I mean, so there's

09:55.360 --> 10:00.160
something there, I think, in the world of literature. I mean, the other thing is

10:00.160 --> 10:07.360
it's extremely difficult, I think, to write about the Anthropocene, especially

10:07.360 --> 10:13.360
when we understand it in the way that the explanation was given. I mean, we're

10:13.360 --> 10:16.840
really talking about the disruption of all these cycles, not just the carbon

10:16.840 --> 10:24.120
cycle. And all this is happening at the same time that technology is

10:24.120 --> 10:31.680
increasing radically, the globalization is speeding up incredibly. And when we

10:31.680 --> 10:35.640
tend to focus on one thing, I mean, I want to tell you about a climate change

10:35.640 --> 10:39.760
world. I want to tell you about a technologically advanced world. We tend to

10:39.760 --> 10:43.320
focus on that thing and then tell the story as sort of as if everything else

10:43.320 --> 10:48.240
gets held constant in this thing changes. But that's not the future. That's not

10:48.240 --> 10:53.280
next week. That's not next month. It's a matter of...

10:53.280 --> 10:59.360
And what was it about? It was about the destruction of the sacred cedar forest

10:59.360 --> 11:05.560
by Gilgamesh and Incadou. So the earliest literature we've ever had was a

11:05.560 --> 11:10.400
about power, but was also about the relationship between man, our humans, and

11:10.400 --> 11:15.320
nature, and about the destruction of nature. So that history of literature

11:15.320 --> 11:20.480
goes way back and what's happened in the last 30 years is one perspective, but

11:20.480 --> 11:25.400
what's happened in the last 5,000 years is different. But it's also that, you know,

11:25.400 --> 11:32.880
much like writing about war is not about all wars or the conditions that give

11:32.880 --> 11:38.360
rise globally to wars, but rather a particular war as a backdrop. So similarly

11:38.360 --> 11:41.960
with the Anthropocene, I would imagine that any kind of literary writing would

11:41.960 --> 11:48.680
take one what's come to be known as an extreme weather event or and situate the

11:48.680 --> 11:53.800
story within that context, at least that's the way that I understand it. But

11:53.800 --> 12:00.240
Don, you gave a very interesting paper in Iceland, which I had the pleasure to

12:00.240 --> 12:08.120
hear on slow violence and the slow violence of climate change or climate

12:08.120 --> 12:11.760
catastrophe as you made the argument in fact that it should not be just called

12:11.760 --> 12:17.520
change because that's two benign a word. So why don't you say a little about that?

12:17.520 --> 12:26.880
Before saying anything about that, I wanted to say something about what

12:26.880 --> 12:35.120
psychoanalysts have been working on for not quite entirely. Well, yes, for 120 years or so.

12:35.120 --> 12:41.720
And I think that one of the things one would conclude from looking at psychoanalytic

12:41.720 --> 12:49.560
literature is that there's a deep lack of interest in the future. That is the

12:49.560 --> 12:54.880
entire the entire discipline is organized. Freud had the famous phrase that

12:54.880 --> 13:02.240
neurotic people suffer from reminiscences and in saying so, the notion would be

13:02.240 --> 13:08.600
that people like us who are interested in neurotic people would be focusing on

13:08.600 --> 13:18.960
the pathogenic consequences of reminiscences and essentially be thinking

13:18.960 --> 13:26.800
of people. The labor of becoming a person would essentially be the labor of

13:26.800 --> 13:36.200
liberating the work completed. And I think that it seems to me, I just want to say

13:36.200 --> 13:42.120
one other thing about that, sort of about that. I was John and I were coming up here

13:42.120 --> 13:49.800
together and I was maybe many of us, we watched these discovery channel things

13:49.800 --> 13:57.000
and we watched threatened mammals and see how they do and what they're doing. And I

13:57.000 --> 14:04.240
was watching one recently and I saw all these threatened mammals and what they

14:04.240 --> 14:12.880
do is do their best to adapt to the threat. So if there isn't sufficient ice,

14:12.880 --> 14:18.440
they try to make do with the ice that they find. If there isn't sufficient ice

14:18.440 --> 14:25.680
in spot A, they try to move to spot B. If it's too cold here or too warm here,

14:25.680 --> 14:34.240
they move up the mountain. But the task is an immediate one. Now you don't have a

14:34.240 --> 14:39.840
sense that any of these animals and I think it would include a huge percentage

14:39.840 --> 14:47.880
of humans that our task always feels either immediate to escape the immediate

14:47.880 --> 14:56.480
threat or to escape the regressive pull of the past. And so few of us and maybe

14:56.480 --> 15:06.520
none of our, whatever we call them, primates and earlier in the chart, have

15:06.520 --> 15:10.800
any notion of the future at all. The one thing I would add about progressive

15:10.800 --> 15:18.480
literature, it seems to me marks is an exception that at least the marks that I

15:18.480 --> 15:27.520
loved was always written with the future in mind. That is the whole notion was

15:27.520 --> 15:33.840
future-oriented. That the entire notion of what the human task would be.

15:33.840 --> 15:39.560
Hegel interpreted the world our task needs to change it. So it's, so there

15:39.560 --> 15:46.560
you have this contribution that was future-oriented and in that sense,

15:46.560 --> 15:58.280
just that. Okay. Jack, can I ask you, I mean I've spoke about the lack of

15:58.280 --> 16:04.480
consciousness and literary writing about these issues and done trying to

16:04.480 --> 16:15.400
diagnose psychoanalysis. But isn't it also true that geology, until it became

16:15.400 --> 16:23.320
geosciences, was also very focused on the lithosphere. I mean they were

16:23.320 --> 16:29.800
focused on a sanitary. Focused on what? The lithosphere, the solid rock or

16:29.800 --> 16:36.240
the rock below the surface or sedimentary phenomena. But it wasn't focused on the

16:36.240 --> 16:41.640
hydrosphere or the atmosphere or the biosphere. And all that's now become

16:41.640 --> 16:47.240
part of an understanding of what these sciences should be doing. But I

16:47.240 --> 16:53.240
assume it's because of this very narrow focus that they didn't look at the data

16:53.240 --> 16:57.240
correctly or something. Well, I think that's what they had to look at. They had

16:57.240 --> 17:03.600
fossils and they had the hard part of the planet to actually study. But now that

17:03.600 --> 17:09.480
we're also interesting in how the atmosphere and how the hydrosphere and

17:09.480 --> 17:13.680
the biosphere is changing. I think scientists, not just geologists, but

17:13.680 --> 17:18.360
environmental scientists such as myself, are trying to go back and look and use

17:18.360 --> 17:23.120
data that we can find to look at these other parts of the sphere. So ice cores

17:23.120 --> 17:27.440
and such where we can actually interpret what went on in the atmosphere

17:27.440 --> 17:34.400
5,000, 10,000, 50,000 years ago. So it's very interesting you bring up, I mean I

17:34.400 --> 17:39.360
think of paleontologists when you talk about geologists. And all my

17:39.360 --> 17:43.200
paleontologists at the Smithsonian, my paleontologist colleagues, who are always

17:43.200 --> 17:49.520
looking back, Don, as you say, they all, when I bring up the Anthropocene, they

17:49.520 --> 17:56.320
all say, don't worry. John, relax. Don't worry, the Earth is 4.6 billion years

17:56.320 --> 18:01.040
old. Life has been around for 3.2 billion. If you're worried about the future of

18:01.040 --> 18:06.120
life, don't. Because life will go on where one species, things will radically

18:06.120 --> 18:10.680
change. If you're worried about your grandchildren, you should do, you should

18:10.680 --> 18:15.080
be really worried. Or you're worried about your great-grandchildren. So I think that

18:15.080 --> 18:19.880
you logic- Sorry, I don't understand. That means you should worry about the

18:19.880 --> 18:23.360
species or you shouldn't or you should worry about the long term. You should only

18:23.360 --> 18:28.960
worry about it immediately. Right. I see. But it's our the future generations of

18:28.960 --> 18:32.800
humans that are going to suffer the most. It's not in life on the planet. Even

18:32.800 --> 18:38.040
though we are now responsible for a thousand times greater rate of extinction

18:38.040 --> 18:46.820
than happened 200 years ago. But I'm curious about it. When before the last

18:46.820 --> 18:55.200
time scale being so huge, do you just see the short-term trends as noise and

18:55.200 --> 18:59.400
dismiss them? What was the- No, it wasn't dismissed at all. I think it was made more

18:59.400 --> 19:03.760
relevant by what's happening on the planet today. So suddenly that was

19:03.760 --> 19:08.480
academic understanding of changes in atmosphere and hydrosphere. Now with the

19:08.480 --> 19:12.600
changes that are happening in the world today, that data collected in the past.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.040
That's what I mean. So earlier, did they dismiss what would we now see a

19:17.040 --> 19:21.400
short-term trends in- Oh, no, they didn't know about it. They just didn't-

19:21.400 --> 19:27.640
They weren't that good. I mean, so there's two different issues. I want to go back and

19:27.640 --> 19:30.880
pick up on something in adaptation. But on this issue, I mean, there's really

19:30.880 --> 19:35.840
interesting issues in epistemology and the history of science here. So I mean,

19:35.840 --> 19:42.160
so if you take someone like Araneus, for example, in 1903, I mean, essentially

19:42.160 --> 19:47.520
those calculations that he made on long, cold, boring, Swedish nights in the

19:47.520 --> 19:52.360
back of an envelope have basically turned out more or less to be right, although

19:52.360 --> 19:56.200
we have a very different understanding of the mechanisms that actually make

19:56.200 --> 20:01.960
that change possible. I mean, I think there's two things in response to your

20:01.960 --> 20:06.000
question that Kila should be noted. And maybe in some ways they're kind of boring.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.880
I don't know, but one thing had to do with the development of supercomputers.

20:09.880 --> 20:15.800
Do I talk- The development of supercomputers, which allow you to do all kinds of things

20:15.800 --> 20:20.920
in terms of simulating futures that could simply not been done before. I mean, I

20:20.920 --> 20:25.720
was around the National Center for Atmospheric Research, for example, the

20:25.720 --> 20:29.720
first time that people were able to link ocean models with atmosphere models,

20:29.720 --> 20:36.280
for example. That sounds like an obvious thing to do, but it's something you

20:36.280 --> 20:41.160
actually could not do until the early 1980s when you had the computing power

20:41.160 --> 20:44.480
to do it. At the same time, I think you're also wanted to kind of

20:44.480 --> 20:50.840
associate logical fact, which is the kind of science that we grew up on was a

20:50.840 --> 20:56.560
kind of science that without stating this explicitly sort of assumed that

20:56.560 --> 21:04.080
nature seeks equilibria. And that divergence from equilibrium states are

21:04.080 --> 21:08.760
some way driven by something sort of weird and exogenous to the system.

21:08.760 --> 21:14.520
The kind of early biology, for example, that sort of talks about climax

21:14.520 --> 21:20.400
ecosystems and so on is of that mode. We're now in an era where we tend to see

21:20.400 --> 21:26.760
disequilibrium and chaos, if you will, as more than natural state of things. Now,

21:26.760 --> 21:33.080
that isn't a purely scientific discovery. That has something to do with the

21:33.080 --> 21:39.080
changes in political and social climate and the kind of cultural settings in

21:39.080 --> 21:44.720
terms of how we look at the data. So it's epistemological, but yeah, driven by

21:44.720 --> 21:49.840
these things. And I was just wondering to what extent, just looking at the

21:49.840 --> 21:55.000
timescale in very large terms, just makes us dismiss these things as always.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.400
But it's interesting, the equilibrium, that's a sort of theoretical

22:00.400 --> 22:06.200
pre-commitment which would drive onto it too. Yeah. If I can just say one thing

22:06.200 --> 22:11.160
in response to your comment about kind of how science has changed over the last

22:11.160 --> 22:15.520
30 years, when I was a graduate student studying tropical ecology, my job was to

22:15.520 --> 22:21.360
go out and find a pristine habitat in nature and study the biology, study the

22:21.360 --> 22:25.960
interactions between the organisms and try to find out how nature works. That is

22:25.960 --> 22:30.040
no longer the paradigm anymore. The paradigm is to go out and find out how

22:30.040 --> 22:34.600
humans are affecting those systems. It's totally changed. You can't find a

22:34.600 --> 22:38.280
single graduate student in environmental sciences that is going out to look at a

22:38.280 --> 22:49.280
pristine system because they do not exist anymore. I wonder whether there are

22:49.280 --> 22:55.840
any, like if you think about the Anthropocene as a kind of, I mean it's a

22:55.840 --> 23:07.320
silly word to use, but let's say pathology. A catastrophic change

23:07.320 --> 23:19.840
in what had been a stable form of life, let's say. And then there's this pathogenic

23:19.840 --> 23:31.000
series of events that we're talking about. So are there any in medicine, in any

23:31.000 --> 23:42.200
zone, in all the humanities, or is there any zone in which contemporary

23:42.200 --> 23:49.360
pathologies are being addressed in a serious way with the future in mind? Or

23:49.360 --> 23:59.200
is all serious address of pathologies organized around eliminating the pathology

23:59.200 --> 24:08.720
at which point the aim would be accomplished? Are there pathologies

24:08.720 --> 24:21.040
being addressed with a serious focus on generations to come? I think what

24:21.040 --> 24:29.760
the nomenclature of Anthropocene is intended to capture better be much more

24:29.760 --> 24:39.760
open-ended and not thought of in these terms. Anyway, something to get other

24:39.760 --> 24:45.560
people to. What do you mean by open-ended? It isn't as if there is

24:45.560 --> 24:54.320
some telos, which you know some messianic end. It's something uncertainty.

24:54.320 --> 25:03.120
Yeah, uncertainty and therefore keeping a very wide range of options

25:03.120 --> 25:12.240
open as to what might be done about it or both by way of constraint. And

25:12.240 --> 25:22.640
actually a preparedness to be reactionary to say let's just go back. The future

25:22.640 --> 25:31.920
might be a better outcomes in the future if we are against modernity or

25:31.920 --> 25:38.560
against even that should be a possible option. So that's what I mean by

25:38.560 --> 25:48.400
wilding, the notion of wilding would be something more conservative and not

25:48.400 --> 25:56.160
radical in the sense of thinking we can change anything that I will, etc.

25:56.160 --> 26:02.440
But isn't going back, isn't that changed? No, it is changed but it's not the kind

26:02.440 --> 26:08.160
of thing that Hegel Marx and other figures brought in the future in the

26:08.160 --> 26:13.320
way that you had noticed. I mean we tend to have these two orientations towards

26:13.320 --> 26:19.400
the future. One is utopianism, which is largely disastrous in terms of human

26:19.400 --> 26:25.360
history in my opinion. And the other is muddling through. And the amazing thing,

26:25.360 --> 26:30.160
which is what we actually do most of the time, and the amazing thing about

26:30.160 --> 26:38.120
muddling through is not that it actually works. It's that it seems to work and it

26:38.120 --> 26:44.600
seems to work in part because of this incredible power of adaptation that

26:44.600 --> 26:50.880
humans have, both to adapt to changing circumstances, but also to adapt their

26:50.880 --> 26:57.440
preferences and desires about things. And so when people talk about the

26:57.440 --> 27:01.080
Anthropocene and how terrible at the 21st century is going to be and so on and

27:01.080 --> 27:03.960
so forth, it's a very delicate thing to talk about because there's lots of things

27:03.960 --> 27:11.000
I want people to do in response to this. But look back at the 20th century.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.360
Unbelievable disaster. Millions and millions and millions of people killed.

27:16.360 --> 27:26.240
Fast parts of the planet destroyed and despoiled. A decade after Rome was in

27:26.240 --> 27:32.920
rubble and people were eating cats, it was La Dolce Vita. I mean with very

27:32.920 --> 27:38.440
little sense of how close people were to those events. And I think one mistake that

27:38.440 --> 27:43.160
we make about thinking about the future is when we imagine the world in 2020,

27:43.160 --> 27:49.360
when things are really getting going, 2030 or 2040, we imagine ourselves into

27:49.360 --> 27:53.920
that future with the baselines from where we come and the preferences we have and

27:53.920 --> 27:59.400
the desires we have. But the people are going to be born into that world,

27:59.400 --> 28:06.240
are not going to mourn the same things that we would mourn, where we to be

28:06.240 --> 28:12.400
born into that world. And that makes it even more difficult I think to think

28:12.400 --> 28:17.960
about the future from where we are now on these long time scales.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.440
Well, Camita actually, one of the things in your book which was very striking is

28:22.440 --> 28:28.760
you cite the example of Gandhi, of course, who was one of the early figures, a

28:28.760 --> 28:35.680
prominent figures to understand that modernity in its present form, and one

28:35.680 --> 28:40.680
can only say that it's accelerated since then, to recognize that the form of life

28:40.680 --> 28:46.840
that that was giving rise to would simply not be possible.

28:46.840 --> 28:51.160
It was taking us to disaster, the jobtists knew it, the lotites knew it.

28:51.160 --> 28:56.520
You know, around the world wherever this thing went, people tried to resist. I mean,

28:56.520 --> 29:01.880
just today I was reading about how in the 19th century the Bonaparte state was

29:01.880 --> 29:07.200
trying to impose certain forestry regulations on Italy and how strongly

29:07.200 --> 29:11.400
the Alpine peasants resisted because actually they held land in common.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.760
You know, there was no tragedy of the commons, they held land in common and

29:14.760 --> 29:20.000
they regulated it. You know, so I think we forget sometimes how new this this

29:20.000 --> 29:25.240
regime of property is. We also forget that, you know, before the 18th century,

29:25.240 --> 29:30.440
really people everywhere around the world understood, you know, that there are

29:30.440 --> 29:33.640
certain limits, you have to act in certain ways, you have to act with the

29:33.640 --> 29:39.640
future as they did in Japan during the 17th century. So, none of those things is

29:39.640 --> 29:46.360
really... But a view to the future in this sense of shrinking resources and the

29:46.360 --> 29:54.000
possibly injurious effects of consumption, acquisition, this was the, I mean, of the

29:54.000 --> 29:58.760
examples that you're citing, it was just a more community oriented. It was that,

29:58.760 --> 30:02.720
but it was also that people recognized. So, I'm certainly with the key. I think at

30:02.720 --> 30:08.600
this point, you know, I think we have to understand really, is that this

30:08.600 --> 30:13.800
disaster has been brought upon us by essentially the 19th and 20th century,

30:13.800 --> 30:18.600
what we call education, what we call rationality. And I would say that in this

30:18.600 --> 30:22.600
psychoanalysis plays a very large part. You know, I say this is someone who, you

30:22.600 --> 30:26.640
know, loved to read Freud, but you can see in retrospect that in a way it's a

30:26.640 --> 30:30.760
part of a whole constellation of things that is brought us, you know, to this

30:30.760 --> 30:37.120
disaster. And really the task ahead of us is to try and unlearn. Just today, I was

30:37.120 --> 30:46.560
reading such an interesting book. It's on art and the Anthropocene, you know. So,

30:46.560 --> 30:53.440
in the Little Ice Age, as it was advancing, you know, the last great sort of atmospheric

30:53.440 --> 30:59.640
fluctuation was in the 17th century. So, in India, for example, the Emperor Akbar,

30:59.640 --> 31:04.600
very early on, he responds to this in an artistic sense, you know, the droughts and

31:04.600 --> 31:09.520
the terrible atmospheric disturbances, the commission, you know, a lot of art

31:09.520 --> 31:15.680
around this, but also the commission, you know, all sorts of waterworks, all kinds.

31:15.680 --> 31:21.680
So, it entered their minds in a way that this doesn't enter our mind now. And why is

31:21.680 --> 31:27.160
that? It's because we've been educated.

31:27.160 --> 31:36.520
Like analysis. So, those four words put in a cluster. I think what you're getting

31:36.520 --> 31:47.080
at is the kind of emergence of what could be called, what do we say, a kind of fetishized

31:47.080 --> 31:56.640
individual. And that the educated individual is a fetishized individual, is a fetishized

31:56.640 --> 32:07.520
individual and a fetishizing individual, that is, who turns his or her individuality into

32:07.520 --> 32:18.200
a magical talisman which represents success and returns other individuals into talisman

32:18.200 --> 32:28.120
also. So, I think you hold psychoanalysts, at least in part, responsible for that. Well,

32:28.120 --> 32:38.800
I mean, you said, I'm not just inferring that. You just said it. And I agree with you. It's

32:38.800 --> 32:47.240
hard to say responsible because I think it's actually hard to locate responsibility anywhere

32:47.240 --> 32:55.000
when you think about a historical trend, modernity. Well, can one name the responsible agents

32:55.000 --> 33:02.560
for modernity? It wouldn't be easy to do. And nor would it be easy to hold one responsible

33:02.560 --> 33:10.200
for wanting to become a modern person. It's hard to locate responsibility in there. True.

33:10.200 --> 33:24.720
It's hard to attribute it to that form of agency. But one could make helpful diagnostic

33:24.720 --> 33:31.600
attempts by noticing. So, if you take some of the concepts that they'll and Amitav that

33:31.600 --> 33:42.600
surfaced in things they said. So, if you take the tragedy of the commons, the tragedy is

33:42.600 --> 33:56.480
supposed to arise because commoners are supposed to ask, since in which this notion of rationality,

33:56.480 --> 34:02.280
whether it's for a common or natural or agricultural common. So, these things are, I don't know

34:02.280 --> 34:07.800
what agents, but they're out-lucks. They're what emerged in pretty much since the mid-17th

34:07.800 --> 34:12.960
century. I'd like to just say something there. I think we have to remember that this guy

34:12.960 --> 34:19.240
Gareth Hardin, who came up with a paper on the tragedy of the commons, he was a white

34:19.240 --> 34:25.240
supremacist. He was a eugenicist, a fascist really. And his idea of the commons comes

34:25.240 --> 34:29.880
from exactly what you're saying, which is this idea that people who think of themselves

34:29.880 --> 34:36.040
as maximizing individuals, if allowed upon the commons, will destroy the commons.

34:36.040 --> 34:42.360
There is in North America and Europe right now. Yeah, that's the thing. It's North America.

34:42.360 --> 34:49.840
I mean, it's essentially that kind of, you know, this corner-coopier idea that you have

34:49.840 --> 34:56.120
once English settlers come to America, that the land will always provide, you know, and

34:56.120 --> 35:02.720
each one for himself. And it also, I mean, that also raises the question of agency, right,

35:02.720 --> 35:10.040
when we speak of these, like, can you fault someone for wanting to be a modern individual?

35:10.040 --> 35:18.600
The question could also be asked, does one leave people with a choice to be anything

35:18.600 --> 35:27.480
but a modern individual? It's not as though, I mean, now you see it in all of these movements,

35:27.480 --> 35:36.160
indigenous peoples in Latin America, peasants in large parts of South Asia. They are being

35:36.160 --> 35:44.360
forced by various systems. I mean, capitalism, obviously, one of the most egregious, to

35:44.360 --> 35:52.080
adopt, adapt, and adopt ways of life because simply the way of life that they've had is

35:52.080 --> 35:57.280
no longer tenable. And it's no longer tenable because of these larger system structures

35:57.280 --> 36:03.920
that are propelling them outside a form where, for them, there is no other outside.

36:03.920 --> 36:14.240
I think that's absolutely right. I mean, but you know, I don't think there's any response

36:14.240 --> 36:22.320
that one can make once one acknowledges what you're quite rightly pointing out, except

36:22.320 --> 36:29.680
to say that even very well we are shaped by the structures that you describe. We go in

36:29.680 --> 36:38.160
and out of being cooperative and non-corporate. You know, in some frames of thinking, it

36:38.160 --> 36:43.560
will dream of us to ask, what if I cooperated and others didn't and not going to cooperate.

36:43.560 --> 36:50.840
There are many, many contexts, quotidian contexts, you know, where one is completely, the question

36:50.840 --> 36:58.360
never occurs to one, to ask that deeply alienated question, you know, which you're saying is

36:58.360 --> 37:04.760
shaped by structures of modern society. And yet in many public contexts, that's precisely

37:04.760 --> 37:11.240
how we think, you know, in this way of modern rationality and so on. So really, I think

37:11.240 --> 37:19.400
it's a very important task of politics to try and see how we can scale up the context

37:19.400 --> 37:25.720
in which we are not, you know, not driven by those ideals of rationality, scale them

37:25.720 --> 37:30.840
up so that we, they yield the conceptual resource for us to criticize the other frame in which

37:30.840 --> 37:35.120
we think, you know, I mean, that's, that should be a very central goal of politics.

37:35.120 --> 37:46.680
So, I keep having things I want to ask, because then we keep moving on and I forget what I

37:46.680 --> 37:53.920
was doing. They were just throughout a couple of things. One is, climate change is a problem

37:53.920 --> 38:01.760
that exists today. And it wasn't a subject that people talked about 50 years ago. They

38:01.760 --> 38:06.000
didn't talk about, like you said, when I was at university, we didn't worry about climate

38:06.000 --> 38:12.160
change. So that since it has now become a problem, we can look back and say, well, we

38:12.160 --> 38:20.680
did all these things wrong. There we are today. Now we didn't do it completely right, but

38:20.680 --> 38:25.480
we didn't know how to do it completely right. So that's why we are here and we should try

38:25.480 --> 38:32.880
to fix it. The other thing that was, that occurred to me is that in a way, you know,

38:32.880 --> 38:40.600
Freud came up and criticism of Freud came up. But the fact is, when religion dominated

38:40.600 --> 38:47.560
everything, then you assumed that God would take care of everything. There wasn't this

38:47.560 --> 38:54.000
idea that we are so powerful that we are going to fix things that God isn't going to take

38:54.000 --> 39:01.920
care of. We just have to be good, go to confession, and eventually things will work out. So it's

39:01.920 --> 39:09.080
more of a concern, become more of a concern now where there's a diminution of religion.

39:09.080 --> 39:20.000
There's less effect of God on everybody's thinking. And so it's become a major concern.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.600
It's a devastating effect on people's lives. Those are just random thoughts that I was

39:25.600 --> 39:36.760
thinking as you were talking. So just two things. One is without really disagreeing with the

39:36.760 --> 39:41.640
historical story, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that, for example, climate change

39:41.640 --> 39:49.640
was mentioned by President Johnson in a message to Congress in 1965. There has really been

39:49.640 --> 39:56.160
something like a concerted attempt to obscure the continuous history of the knowledge of

39:56.160 --> 40:01.160
this. There are two books are reviewed in the New York Times for the weekend where they

40:01.160 --> 40:13.000
say that it was already in Congress in the 70s. It absolutely was. So that's a whole

40:13.000 --> 40:19.800
other issue. What's tended to happen is that about every 10 years people wake up and look

40:19.800 --> 40:25.000
around and say, what's this climate change stuff? Nobody ever told me about this and then

40:25.000 --> 40:30.800
become synonymous again, until the next up surge. I want to go back to this agency issue

40:30.800 --> 40:39.600
because I really think that this is key. It's not just indigenous peoples who view themselves

40:39.600 --> 40:45.720
as being involved in coercive systems. It's also people who live in the suburbs who want

40:45.720 --> 40:53.520
to take their kids to school and would like not to burn gasoline but don't feel that there's

40:53.520 --> 41:01.920
any other way of doing this. One of the things that I think is really central to the meaning

41:01.920 --> 41:08.160
of the Anthropocene is that the coercive structures that humanity used to feel imposed

41:08.160 --> 41:14.960
on itself by nature are now imposed on us by our social political and economic systems.

41:14.960 --> 41:23.080
If anything, this vise of coercion feels to people, I think, across nations and societies,

41:23.080 --> 41:31.840
as rigid, perhaps even more rigid and inescapable as the vise of nature once felt to people.

41:31.840 --> 41:46.960
So would you say that the word coercion, it's interesting, but the word coercion, in order

41:46.960 --> 41:53.840
to feel coerced, you have to be imagining non-coercion. You have to have an image, a

41:53.840 --> 42:01.280
realistic image of something that feels real to you. Oh, it could be otherwise. We would

42:01.280 --> 42:10.680
need that in order to feel coerced today. But if the source of coercion is nature, are

42:10.680 --> 42:22.120
people imagining an alternative nature such that, see, I'm just trying to distinguish

42:22.120 --> 42:31.360
between coercion and necessity. So a nature might induce necessity, at least as I would

42:31.360 --> 42:40.800
think, whereas capital induces coercion. I suppose it depends on how you experience

42:40.800 --> 42:45.400
this from nature. So if you experience this through a god, for example, and particularly

42:45.400 --> 42:51.040
a wrathful and arbitrary god, maybe that stands somewhere between the necessity of nature

42:51.040 --> 42:57.080
and the coercion, something that looks like capital, I don't know. And I'm not so invested

42:57.080 --> 43:04.080
in the comparison anyway. What I think is really important is, again, this kind of weird

43:04.080 --> 43:10.440
paradox, where it's humanity who's remaking the planet. It's not nature in the non-human

43:10.440 --> 43:17.200
sense. It's not aliens from somewhere else. It's us that are doing it. But yet there

43:17.200 --> 43:23.600
is this sense of power. I think of it as not necessarily coercion, but constraints and

43:23.600 --> 43:31.800
restraints. Earlier, nature wasn't a constraint because when Europeans landed in North America,

43:31.800 --> 43:38.240
it was an endless garden, even though there were a lot of other people here already taking

43:38.240 --> 43:45.720
care of that garden. So nature seemed to not constrain us. We've reached a point where

43:45.720 --> 43:51.120
we realize that resources are finite now for our population use. And we could argue when

43:51.120 --> 43:56.760
those finite resources will run out or when they won't run out. But we realize that the

43:56.760 --> 44:00.280
planet is a certain size. And we also realize that there's more of us on the planet using

44:00.280 --> 44:06.080
those resources. And so I think we're beginning to feel that constraint being ourselves rather

44:06.080 --> 44:18.040
than nature before. The fault line was earlier when we actually began to equate nature with

44:18.040 --> 44:29.640
natural resources. It's true what you say that resources will run out, but that's still

44:29.640 --> 44:37.540
a very anthropocentric way of seeing the problem. It does seem to me that we at some point

44:37.540 --> 44:43.840
transformed the concept of nature into the concept of natural resources. And that transformation

44:43.840 --> 44:52.800
was a fault line in landing us in the mid-end that we are in.

44:52.800 --> 45:00.640
For sure. It turns nature into quantity. You know, as it's, you see, this goes back

45:00.640 --> 45:11.920
to what Ed was asking, which is if you desacralize nature at some point, nature first got equated

45:11.920 --> 45:19.240
with, without remainder, exhaustively equated with the idea of what the natural sciences

45:19.240 --> 45:29.000
study. It's a nature containing no properties that the natural sciences don't study or can't

45:29.000 --> 45:35.640
study. Now, I think that's a superstition of modernity.

45:35.640 --> 45:47.040
Yes. It's, you know, many people who I know and admire who have great concern for climate

45:47.040 --> 45:53.560
change, like my friend Peter Singer, your friend too. That's how he would see nature

45:53.560 --> 46:01.120
as that which the natural sciences study and try and recover such environmental anxieties

46:01.120 --> 46:08.640
that he has and develop them within that assumption. But I think the assumption is wrong.

46:08.640 --> 46:18.240
As a natural scientist, I believe that nature exists outside what natural scientists can

46:18.240 --> 46:26.360
study. There will be nature on the planet long after natural scientists are gone. And

46:26.360 --> 46:33.440
that's true. That's a slightly different point. And I think that's perfectly correct. But

46:33.440 --> 46:42.080
what I'm suggesting is that some kind of baby was thrown away with the mouth water, which

46:42.080 --> 46:50.040
is that value properties got equated as well from nature. And I'm saying, there's, you

46:50.040 --> 46:56.720
can be an atheist and insist that nature contains value properties which should constrain our

46:56.720 --> 47:07.280
behavior towards nature. And I'm saying that a lot of scientists not doing science, but

47:07.280 --> 47:14.080
doing philosophy in their own time have equated nature with what the natural sciences study.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.560
So when Dawkins says things like that, he's not talking as a scientist. He's talking

47:18.560 --> 47:23.360
about as a public intellectual philosopher. And as Wittgenstein said, you know, only

47:23.360 --> 47:26.840
a year for philosophy could say something as absurd as that.

47:26.840 --> 47:32.520
No, I have one thing to talk about what you're saying, having to do with something I think

47:32.520 --> 47:39.680
is quite potentially useful about psychoanalysts in this regard. And it's a Melanie Klein notion

47:39.680 --> 47:50.200
of different set of resources. And let's say that the infant is in that sense a natural

47:50.200 --> 48:00.160
scientist in relation to its mother so conceived. And then comes this fateful moment, so says

48:00.160 --> 48:06.160
Klein, in which the nature of the position is changed. And the nature of the change is

48:06.160 --> 48:16.440
toward a depressive position with the implication of a kind of melancholy acceptance of the

48:16.440 --> 48:27.760
mother's limitation of the limitation in her resource capacity. But at the same time,

48:27.760 --> 48:40.760
a huge expansion of her status as something other than resource. So losing her as a source

48:40.760 --> 48:55.920
of unlimited resource, that's the cost. The gain is a vision of her as an entity that

48:55.920 --> 49:05.000
needs protection, no less than I do. And in that sense, there's something, how can I

49:05.000 --> 49:14.560
say, there's something theorized in psychoanalysis that I think is kind of congruent with what

49:14.560 --> 49:21.000
you're saying. You see what I mean? But it's obviously not the aspects of psychoanalysis

49:21.000 --> 49:27.200
that I'm talking about. No, no, no. Can I ask the two of you to talk a little bit about

49:27.200 --> 49:35.760
that if you start about the... I mean, some rude remarks about psychoanalysis.

49:35.760 --> 49:41.120
No, I mean, I was just following... I mean, as you said... We were both saying this.

49:41.120 --> 49:48.280
Yeah, I mean, it's individualizes. There comes to be reliance upon individual histories,

49:48.280 --> 49:55.840
upon the past. But you know, I think the important thing that we can't forget here was two things.

49:55.840 --> 50:04.080
I must say, for me now, I find Jung's thinking much more interesting in relation to the Anthropocene.

50:04.080 --> 50:11.120
The other thing is that I think we can't forget here that really, you know, one of the major

50:11.120 --> 50:15.040
scientists writing the IPCC said the other day, you know, that climate change is not

50:15.040 --> 50:21.960
a natural phenomenon. It's actually the ongoing effect of inequality. And especially those

50:21.960 --> 50:27.640
of us who are from India or China or Indonesia or wherever, you know, this is the thing.

50:27.640 --> 50:34.360
I mean, the solving or the addressing of climate change is no longer in Western hands. It's

50:34.360 --> 50:40.720
really going to be decided in Asia because Asia has the weight of numbers. And the reason

50:40.720 --> 50:48.600
why nobody can go to an Asian population and say, cut back your emissions is because they

50:48.600 --> 50:54.920
say, well, we just want what they have. You know, it's just that. I mean, that's really

50:54.920 --> 50:57.480
the fundamental dynamic that drives it.

50:57.480 --> 51:02.160
But I think that, isn't it a way out of this exceptional science?

51:02.160 --> 51:07.320
Well, I'd just like to follow up on your point. We haven't really talked about economic systems

51:07.320 --> 51:12.800
yet and the impact of economic systems on climate change. And some of you may know, there's

51:12.800 --> 51:19.000
ecological economics now, which is beginning to rise as an alternative to capitalistic

51:19.000 --> 51:24.600
economics and neoliberalism and such things. It seems to me, my reading of the literature,

51:24.600 --> 51:30.720
which is that economics is not immune to natural laws, is not immune to science, is

51:30.720 --> 51:36.560
not immune to social interactions, but really depends on that in a way. And we have to change

51:36.560 --> 51:42.840
our system and recycle analysis does have to.

51:42.840 --> 51:49.440
But what I've heard about future of an illusion and civilization and this just contains where

51:49.440 --> 51:55.000
he addressed that. But he addressed that in a very scientific way. Yes, exactly. He just

51:55.000 --> 51:58.160
thought of these as counter drives to the drives of the age.

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
Yes.

51:59.160 --> 52:13.880
So we should open up the first question. Thank you all. It was a very interesting talk.

52:13.880 --> 52:19.920
My question will be for all of you, anybody who'd like to answer it. I'm going to make

52:19.920 --> 52:27.000
a couple quick generalizations so I can formulate it into a question. So the idea of the tragedy

52:27.000 --> 52:34.720
of the commons was that if everybody was selfish and acted individually, it would be a tragedy.

52:34.720 --> 52:39.760
And on the other side of the argument, Ellen, and Ostrom got a Nobel Prize by saying, people

52:39.760 --> 52:46.560
don't do that in ordinary life. They act as communities and they see holistically and

52:46.560 --> 52:50.600
they work it out. Who's the owner of Australia?

52:50.600 --> 52:57.640
Okay. So there's these two alternative possibilities. Now, again, to oversimplify, if I can ask

52:57.640 --> 53:08.440
the question, when civilizations are characterized, it's simplified by saying all civilizations

53:08.440 --> 53:17.160
have put the community before the individual. Western civilization is the first civilization

53:17.160 --> 53:24.160
where the individual was put on a pedestal before the community and despair.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.160
They don't interest.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.160
You don't sound close.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.160
I just want to add.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.560
When I really depressed, you wouldn't be here, right?

53:31.560 --> 53:38.320
I want to add as a sort of maybe a Carla or your question that I haven't heard today

53:38.320 --> 53:47.040
here among the panelists any sort of solutions that don't seem to touch on some form of coercion

53:47.040 --> 53:54.040
of some type that either through guilt, through a sense of guilt or through regulation, there's

53:54.040 --> 53:55.040
two different things.

53:55.040 --> 54:04.000
Maybe it's absolutely mis, or it's just not sufficient.

54:04.000 --> 54:09.600
So this isn't an answer to your question. I'll leave other people to confess how they've

54:09.600 --> 54:16.120
managed their inner lives. But there's two things that always really strike me about

54:16.120 --> 54:20.480
this question, which I get a lot.

54:20.480 --> 54:29.280
The first is, I'm doomed. We're all going to die as individuals. I mean, whatever people

54:29.280 --> 54:34.160
figure out or don't figure out about life in the 23rd century, and I think there's

54:34.160 --> 54:39.880
something for cycle analysts here about why it is we're so concerned about collective

54:39.880 --> 54:48.400
doom and somehow so much in denial on an everyday basis about the probability of one

54:48.400 --> 54:51.000
about my individual doom.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
So that's just the...

54:52.000 --> 54:54.920
I think you said it's being about a van to the room.

54:54.920 --> 55:03.880
Well, I mean, that's just one question. The other thing is that when it comes to these

55:03.880 --> 55:09.840
civilizations that we've built and what threatens the most, as someone who's worked on climate

55:09.840 --> 55:15.000
change for decades, I can tell you, at least with complete confidence in my part, that

55:15.000 --> 55:22.320
it's nuclear weapons. That it's nuclear weapons that will really put an end to anything like

55:22.320 --> 55:25.760
the civilizations that we all know in treasure.

55:25.760 --> 55:31.280
Climate change may do that. It certainly will cause enormous amounts of death and suffering.

55:31.280 --> 55:36.200
If humanity survives in a recognizable form, it's not going to be very recognizable to

55:36.200 --> 55:42.960
us, but nuclear weapons. This is certain destruction and the probability of this happening is

55:42.960 --> 55:46.120
very great on relatively short time horizons.

55:46.120 --> 55:52.280
So I just find it kind of puzzling, the kind of freak out, the level of people's freak

55:52.280 --> 55:58.560
out about climate change compared to our complacency about nuclear weapons and our denial about

55:58.560 --> 56:01.960
this death that awaits me in the not too distant future.

56:01.960 --> 56:07.200
If I could kind of respond to that, I think those are just two examples of the possibilities.

56:07.200 --> 56:11.600
You brought up geoengineering. That's in response to climate change, but that's another attempt

56:11.600 --> 56:18.640
by homo sapiens to control things. I think we will see many more of those if we continue

56:18.640 --> 56:25.160
on. As a naturalist, you know, I don't really care about humans to tell you the truth. I

56:25.160 --> 56:30.000
care about the 10 million species on the planet that are being disproportionately affected

56:30.000 --> 56:34.640
by what one species does. There's no other species on the planet that makes other species

56:34.640 --> 56:38.240
go extinct. There's one and they're all sitting in this room.

56:38.240 --> 56:41.000
Not all of them.

56:41.000 --> 56:52.560
Can I ask your question? Somebody sent me an article recently on the disappearing insect

56:52.560 --> 57:04.560
species. Apart from pollution, the other major cause is apparently agriculture.

57:04.560 --> 57:13.680
Now, can I just ask, you know, on the one hand in the last seven decades, this increasing

57:13.680 --> 57:19.160
organization and fear and fear people are actually living off agriculture, making their

57:19.160 --> 57:27.560
living off agriculture, even in a country like India, which was 80%, is now 49% agriculture.

57:27.560 --> 57:36.960
And it's just where everything is headed. So I'm sort of not getting it. Is it some

57:36.960 --> 57:47.280
notion of agriculture? What? Are the inputs so much more productive that it's not?

57:47.280 --> 57:54.880
That's two things. There is not less agriculture now. There is more efficient agriculture.

57:54.880 --> 57:59.600
Through mechanization, such as the dam tractor, which has really changed things, so fewer

57:59.600 --> 58:02.400
people were needed to do the same productivity.

58:02.400 --> 58:07.600
Yes, and the second is the green revolution, which required a lot more fossil fuels and

58:07.600 --> 58:12.600
a lot more pesticides. And it says pesticides that are in monocultures.

58:12.600 --> 58:16.840
Well, monocultures, which is a result of that, which require more. So there's more of us.

58:16.840 --> 58:21.840
So there has to be actually more agriculture to be feeding us.

58:21.840 --> 58:27.360
People are being dispossessed to their land. You know, they're sort of being pushed into

58:27.360 --> 58:34.840
destitution. And yet agriculture is being intensified in these ways through these more

58:34.840 --> 58:40.400
efficient inputs to give rise to. I mean, it just seems like...

58:40.400 --> 58:44.880
It's obscene. But John, you obviously know, but it's also they say, I mean, meat, the

58:44.880 --> 58:48.960
consumption of meat all over the world, the agricultural land is now being used more and

58:48.960 --> 58:55.040
more for the part of the Amazon that now is devoted to growing soybeans is for feeding

58:55.040 --> 58:56.880
the cattle, not for feeding.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.880
I think we have another question.

58:58.880 --> 59:02.320
I mean, can I just take one comment about meat consumption? Because this is hugely important

59:02.320 --> 59:07.160
because we talk about developing world and they want to be like us and all this. But

59:07.160 --> 59:13.960
the real time bomb is increasing meat consumption in poor countries. And interestingly, India

59:13.960 --> 59:19.560
has some values to dampen that down. And the Chinese government is actually has a policy

59:19.560 --> 59:25.200
in place to try to reduce meat consumption rather than have it grow. And I think these

59:25.200 --> 59:28.800
are things that are not well-unappreciated in the West.

59:28.800 --> 59:32.200
Can I just say something in response? Who's the gentleman? You asked the question, right?

59:32.200 --> 59:36.920
Sorry, we don't mean to disregard it. I understand that the point, the question you have about

59:36.920 --> 59:42.200
teaching and, you know, the questions that you get from some of your... I work at Democracy

59:42.200 --> 59:46.520
Now. It's an independent television news show here in New York. And after our broadcast,

59:46.520 --> 59:51.480
often we have groups of students who come to watch the live broadcast and then we go

59:51.480 --> 59:57.200
and we speak to them. And of course, as young people, they all want to know. And obviously,

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.200
democracy now, people have said, you know, you should rename it, depress me now. The

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.520
news is just relentlessly awful. So, you know, after you watch an hour of democracy

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.040
now, obviously you just think, okay, which cliff can I go throw myself off of? But, you

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:19.360
know, I think that... There are a couple of things. I mean, one I think that... I mean,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:25.280
I don't know how much of a solace it is, is the space is not between hope and despair,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.040
right? I mean, the option is not between hope and despair. I mean, I think being, you know,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.920
the way that... Forgive me for saying this, but in the US in particular, there's a massive

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.240
emphasis on optimism and, you know, feeling good and I'm great and terrific and this kind

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:47.680
of thing. I mean, this is just a... It's an... at a very shallow level which has very little

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:57.200
meaning or duration. So, that's not... I mean, I don't think that's the alternative to despair.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.720
I think, you know, also in light of what, you know, people here have been talking about

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:10.960
is the question of solidarity, right? Solidarity in the sense of feeling mutually both implicated,

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:18.080
bound and responsible. Now, whether that induces more despair or more hope, I don't know, but

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:28.800
it subverts or... I don't know, somehow looks at the problem of individual despair through

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.080
a different lens.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.200
Thank you. I love that. Could I respond to that too? Sorry. At the Smithsonian, we've been

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.240
struggling with this for a long time because we don't, as a public museum or a series of museums,

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.680
hate the idea of telling the public that we're pessimistic. I mean, it's just not a way the best

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:52.640
way to engage. So, we have started something called Earth Optimism Day where it's more the

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.480
solidarity, exactly what you're saying. It's to present cases where we have succeeded in changing

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:05.600
things. But at the same time, point out all the issues that one has to realistically understand

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.400
to achieve those optimistic successes. So, there's a way to do it. I have a hard time doing that

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.040
because I'm a little on the pessimistic side. But I think we are getting towards that a little bit.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.160
I think the time is reported that a substantial majority of Americans in a survey said they were

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:33.680
prepared to pay 15% more for energy bills and have the money spent on clean energy programs.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:40.640
So, that's a sign of what we do. I mean, some times, I'll talk to you. I just have to say that

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.080
these surveys go back decades. And the problem is people are always willing to pay more if the

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.520
money goes for some shiny new thing. The real reason to make people pay more for energy is so

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.120
little function is a pregovian tax and get them to consume less. That is what's unacceptable.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.760
This is what they always say. I could pay more, but not so much more that they have to use less

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.200
of it. Oh, no, not that. But that's the whole point of the tax, London. We'll see this with

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:14.560
congestion pricing. This is another place. I would just add that neither hope nor despair is a strategy.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:23.360
You know, leadership and action is what we need. But to my question, you know, this is not the

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:29.760
first time in our history that we've faced a crisis like this, you know, perhaps not this grand.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:38.240
But ultimately, it boils down to a political crisis. And more often than not in history,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:44.640
the scapegoating has been used rather than trying to find a solution to the crisis.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:51.840
And, you know, the 20th century is replete with that. And now we find, you know, that climate

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:58.560
changes Chinese hoax. He hasn't said that in a long time, but he probably will if he needs to.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:07.040
But does anyone have, I mean, now that we've discussed the problem, does anybody have any

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.000
suggestions for political action that we could take as individuals or collectively?

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:26.480
Ben Shapiro, the right-wing idea, wrote here recently that the way to solve the crime of crisis

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:34.800
is to bomb India and China's coal-fired power plants. And, you know, it's a curious thing. I

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:40.800
think if we were in a different world, that would be the political response.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.320
The first thing is, I mean, I think there's so much about the way we misconceived this issue.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:55.120
And one is climate change is not a problem. Climate change is out of the box that essentially all

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.120
of these Anthropocene forces, which are fundamentally about destabilizations of natural systems,

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.560
are simply going to condition and affect life on the planet for the next few centuries,

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.800
unless we do something even crazier like geoengineering, for example, right?

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:20.240
So those destabilizations of natural systems throw up and produce a wide range of real problems,

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:26.400
like sea level rise, for example, droughts, extreme events that people are going to have to respond to.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:35.360
But there's not a solution to climate change now. There was at a time, there could have been an

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:42.560
energy transition at a time before we got committed to 1.8 degrees centigrade, and probably are going

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:46.880
to go to three or four or five before this thing turns around. So the way we have to think about

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:52.960
this issue is no longer in the problem solution space. When it comes to the obvious things,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.560
sure, we have to get the idiots out of office, you know? But it's not, you know, but look,

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.360
we're living in it. Who was it? Madison or somebody once said a long time ago that the

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.880
win of the framers, that the fundamental weakness of the American political system is that the

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.480
people cannot be impeached. And that's essentially what we're dealing with.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:25.360
I guess. That can't be right. It's so typical of us intellectuals when something happens to

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:31.840
blame the people rather than in the institutions. And you know, Jameson, Fred Jameson said,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.560
it's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.080
And I don't know if there's any solution. Whatever solution there is to climate change problem,

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.960
it probably involves such constraints in capitalism that it brings about a terminus of capitalism.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:00.000
And then Jameson's thought is, we just don't have the conceptual wherewithal

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.680
in our political zeitgeist to even so much as. Absolutely. But we do have to take,

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:14.800
look, this was a throwaway line about impeaching the populace. But we do have to take seriously

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.800
that there is no system of governance that has ever been created by humanity.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.680
You can't believe in democracy and despise the electorate. You can't do it.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.280
I'm not on board with that.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.480
Well, if I were to complete my sentence, what I would have said, there is no system of governance

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:42.000
that's been created, that there's including democracy, whatever that is exactly, and wherever one might

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.080
find it being practiced, which is certainly nowhere where I live, for example. But wherever that may be,

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.480
there's no reason to believe that any of these systems of governance that this species has developed

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.640
are adequate to the challenges that we face. Now, I don't say that in celebration or to dance on

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:05.680
the grave of liberalism or anything like that, it's just to talk about the seriousness of the

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:11.360
issues that we face and our lack of experience as a species in dealing with things of the scale.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.760
Singapore, the Netherlands are very responding very, very quickly and with general sort of social

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.080
consensus. And that's interesting because there are two such different political systems.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.400
And some very small scale. One last question? So I don't quite know where to start, but first I

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.880
wanted to say something about, we're all involved in political economies, and I just wanted to point

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.480
out that I'm the fifth guy coming to ask questions in a panel that's mostly guys, and I'm sort of

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:46.240
curious about that reality. So if a woman would like to speak now, I'm willing to step down.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:54.720
First. Okay. I'll have two more questions.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.240
I was saying to strange twitching in my breasts when somebody mentioned that women were the

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.600
feeders, and I want a clarification on that point from you guys.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.280
Well, that was you. Yes.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.280
Yes.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.280
But it was about me.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:19.280
Nice. That's...

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.800
I didn't say that.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:34.560
No, it was in response to what Akhil was saying about nature, and the notion that nature could

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:44.560
be reduced to a notion of resource. And what I was saying is that in Melanie Klein's theory of

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:54.560
infant development, that we start off in relation to mothers whom we experience as resources,

01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:04.960
and whom we experience as resources without limit. And this momentous...

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:16.080
momentously, this mode of experience undergoes a transformation at which point this once limitless

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:27.200
resource becomes limited and is recognized as something more and other than a resource.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:42.800
And that transformation of it into her seems to me, and seems now to me, to be congruent with

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:51.680
what Akhil was saying about a transformation that went in the other direction, from her to it,

01:10:52.400 --> 01:11:00.960
from nature as something like a living being, something like her, beyond the reach of the study

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:09.520
of her resources, and that vision of nature, or not vision, but I don't know what to say,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:19.600
a sense of nature might have been lost when changed into that which natural science can study,

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.280
and that which we can, from which we can extract. That's how that came up.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:35.360
Yeah, thanks for the clarification. And in fact, nature is often referred to as a woman because of

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:42.320
the unpredictability of it, hurricanes, which are now hurricanes or whatever. We're now having

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:50.080
masculine names for that. And I think it is time. I'm so proud. I'm watching my sister here

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:59.280
feeling a sense of comfort and I do encourage more women to be here and participating,

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.440
schlep over, go on the subway, deal with it, and just be here. I'm talking to the people in outer

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:11.840
space who are watching us. Thank you. You know, I do have to say, one interesting thing about what

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:18.640
you're saying is that, you know, having sort of imbibably off the climate change discourse,

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:26.160
it is very striking that it's an overwhelmingly Eurocentric, Western, and male discourse. Even

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.080
though there are, you know, Naomi Klein, Naomi Rasky's, there are these great figures, but

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.600
it is strange how that discourse is. I mean, considering, as you say, that, you know, it's

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:44.080
Asians who are going to be hit and Africans and so on, how few Asian and African voices participate

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.720
in this discourse? Well, that I have to say that's not completely fair. I mean, I mean, I mean,

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.080
to some extent, that's true. It's less true than it used to be. But for example, the IPCC

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:03.280
works very, very hard at inclusiveness. And I think that should at least be acknowledged.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:10.080
But to some people, you know exactly why Muranus and the Latin Americans walked out of Copenhagen?

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:23.200
Well, I think it was over-determined, honestly. So I have another kind of statement and question.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.720
So I don't know if other people in the room feel this as well, but I felt that there was a certain

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:37.600
lack of forward-looking kind of part of the element in this discussion. And I'd love to invite you

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:43.040
for whatever the time we have left to do that a little bit with the preface that I think,

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.800
Emith, have you talking about part of the current problem dating back to the 17th century? I want

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.920
to suggest that it might go back 10,000 years, but definitely it goes back to the patricento and

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.720
like the invention of perspective and those kind of precursors to science, to the invention of

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.840
science, which objectified nature allows it allows us to manipulate it. So there's a deep

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.880
involvement with science and industrialization together as a kind of immediate cause of climate

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:20.080
change in which individualism is also tied. And to kind of counterbalance that I think we're at a

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:27.440
moment where there's also a possible opportunity in this tragedy, and that is there's a moment of

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.960
realization that we are part of a larger collective. And I think it's apparent in the

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.120
disciplinary space where people are more and more trying to work across disciplines and in the

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:43.200
cultural space and in the fact that we are trying to, we are acknowledging that we are many cultures

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:51.360
and that we're polyphonic and that the solutions will be polyphonic. Of course there's political

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.600
forces that go against that. But so just to give you a little context, I'm an artist. I work with

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.040
scientists around this project called the Ocean Memory Project where we look at memory not as a

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.200
rear looking process but as a forward looking process and that's integral to nature or to the

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:17.440
ocean. And that's I'm sort of curious about you as intelligence in the room and our larger group

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:27.760
thinking about our ability to look forward not necessarily with hope or with a positive outlook

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:36.000
but just to see what is what is existent in the moment to take advantage of. I feel like

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:45.280
climate change is forcing us to face some of our own demons in ways that we wouldn't need to if

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:51.920
it weren't there and that's an amazing opportunity. So I'm just curious like if you were to now

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:56.640
okay you've had your rear looking analysis if for two minutes you were to look forward

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:04.240
in a hopeful or not a hopeful way in terms of what does this up but this moment what are the

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:12.240
opportunities in the present to be better, to be worse, to be I don't know but like if you were to

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:22.720
go forward from now. Don you wanted to say? Well does climate change force us to do something

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:30.400
that was the premise of the question and I'm interested in this word force and I think it

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.160
intersects with what you were saying earlier about regulation

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:45.840
that is under what conditions are humans for our humans forced to do something how does that

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:54.320
happen what what is the force that forces us and it seems to me it's it's extremely elusive

01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:04.960
um most of us are not forced at all that seems to me the problem whatever we mean by individualism

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:13.840
we we includes the individual's capacity to evade forces

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:24.080
and and not only that to celebrate that evasion as power. I am powerful to the extent

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:30.400
that I am free from the influence of forces so tremendously deep question actually I mean it's

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:37.920
so deep that it's well he raises almost it's it's in fact but but you know one of the the things to

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:49.920
think about in in responding to it no doubt very much on the surface is that sometime after

01:17:49.920 --> 01:18:01.120
Australia we we really began to think that human beings can be made better by making them over

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:09.360
into citizens laws and costitions that didn't go so well no a last a last and a last but didn't

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:17.040
go off and we might have to say it didn't work yeah and that's really you know one symptom of

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:23.600
how how that question is it I mean you can't understand the enlightenment and all its codes and

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:31.120
constitutions without seeing that aspiration as underlying it that you can make human beings better

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:36.400
what's bad in us can be made better by making our so going to citizens it just hasn't worked

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:47.200
yeah but by citizens I mean forcing us through laws and constitutions to be different which is

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:55.200
really what you're what you're seeking so that's once one level it which just didn't work

01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:11.360
do we have it do we have a Singapore in the Netherlands do we have it it's painful to be in on this

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:20.800
conversation and to hear that question and not be able to jump forward I have to say that I really

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.040
disagree with the premise of that question in the sense that I think this whole business of whole

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.000
president made pointed out earlier is something that arises out of this whole sort of bourgeois

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.960
society which creates the problem in the first place I mean if you think of other societies

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:43.120
if you think of pre-modern societies human beings were always intensely aware of their precariousness

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.440
you know that didn't make them hopeless but it made them very aware that they were always in danger

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:56.480
that is what we want people to wake up to yes you're in danger this is what it is life is not

01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:03.680
the smiling liberal paradise that you are from it it's actually very interesting

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:10.400
on the dot because sometime amongst philosophers we stopped talking about what it would be to cope

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:19.200
and you know we started saying what would it take for us to flourish yes no flourish human

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:24.000
I don't want to flourish I just want to go for long walks and listen to music and read

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.160
complaining the notion of what compels us we rise to forces it's not what compelled it but what

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:40.320
impels us well okay I wait I wait to complain those two notions and someone said earlier regarding

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.600
because I see this as a moral challenge and moral imperative and when you talk about morality

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:54.080
you are you are alluding to subjectivity the more problem is not something it evolved to a

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:59.760
collective action but ultimately it's a subjective experience so the person is not what compels

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:05.520
us which it is a practical question the question I think that that precedes that is what impels

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:14.320
you not us what impels you start there and then examine the the organic evolution of that question

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:19.840
if that makes sense I would have to conflate the notion with what compels you to what it tells you

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.880
that's all all right one response that we're gonna have well I'm afraid that what I have to say is

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:32.160
very simple literal and flat-flitted in relation to what I just requested to be so and it just really

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.480
to make a couple points one is there's some obvious things that are going to be different

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:42.160
most parts I mean let's just take the United States most parts of the United States that where the

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:48.320
landmass was created by filling in which includes parts of New York are not going to exist by the

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:56.800
end of the century there are ways of eating and ways of life it's much harder to be quite

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.080
specific about that that we know that by the end of the century are no longer going going to exist

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.560
and as we go out further it's going to you know it's going to become a little more less certain

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:13.440
which those things are but some we can identify now now this is the interesting psychological point

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:22.080
to me that much that we do under constraint or however we want to characterize this we don't think

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:31.120
of as doing under constraint I joyfully get on the internet every day even though if I were not on

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.560
the internet I would be unable to do my job there's a sense in which I've sort of compelled to be on

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:43.840
the internet people who got telephones in my parents generation saw this in some way as a

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:50.480
positive choice I suppose but from another point of view they were socially coerced actually to

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:58.640
have a telephone in order to take part in a life that made livelihood possible people to many people

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.360
who smoked of the last in the last generation didn't feel that they might have felt that taking up

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:09.040
cigarettes was a positive choice but the power of social conformity was incredibly strong and now

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.080
the same thing is true on the other side so one of the kind of weirdnesses here in terms of lining

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:22.800
up the subjectivity with the objectivity is that we often don't see the social facts that condition

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:34.800
and constrain and even coerce us as being independent of our preferences and choices

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.280
well just one final thing to build on that I think that the solutions are social we know how to do

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:48.160
it scientifically we know how what needs to be done in many ways in terms of changing things

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:54.400
and physical but now we're grasping and that's what part of this discussion is is how do we find

01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:20.240
the social way to make this happen personally I think that's going to be a really hard task
