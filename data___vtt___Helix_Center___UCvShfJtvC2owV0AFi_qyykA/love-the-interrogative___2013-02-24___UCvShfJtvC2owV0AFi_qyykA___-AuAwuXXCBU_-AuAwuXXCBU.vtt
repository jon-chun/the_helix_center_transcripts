WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.900
Today's round table would be moderated by Dr. Fred Sander.

00:04.900 --> 00:09.680
Fred Sander is an old friend, a member of this institute,

00:09.680 --> 00:13.440
and who has been involved a great deal in teaching,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.340
on teaching both here and at various universities,

00:17.340 --> 00:21.640
Cornell and not Sinai, also Sinai.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.240
Yeah.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.520
He is a psychoanalyst, but also specializes in family therapy

00:29.520 --> 00:32.320
and some of his books are up front there,

00:32.320 --> 00:36.520
and apparently one of his books can be accessed for free

00:36.520 --> 00:37.920
on the web.

00:40.320 --> 00:45.040
So that's it, Fred.

00:45.040 --> 00:46.120
Thank you.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.000
Check to see if this is working.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.440
It's not working.

00:52.440 --> 00:56.600
I'll try to speak louder until it works.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.000
I'm really delighted to have an opportunity

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
to participate in the Helix program.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.320
I have on a number of occasions said to Ed,

01:09.320 --> 01:12.160
we're having these interesting meetings.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.840
And how come we never have a psychoanalyst as part

01:15.840 --> 01:17.480
of a round table?

01:17.480 --> 01:20.960
So I think this is his way of either getting back at me

01:20.960 --> 01:22.840
or taking me seriously.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.640
The psychoanalyst in this building

01:26.640 --> 01:29.840
might have something to say about the subjects that we cover

01:29.840 --> 01:31.760
here, including the subject of love.

01:31.760 --> 01:32.480
We'd find out.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.920
So I did want to make a few opening remarks.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.720
What is it, especially exciting today,

01:42.720 --> 01:50.920
is the wide number of disciplines that are represented here.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.560
The side psychoanalysis, we have a poet.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.360
And we have a curator of the European collection

01:58.360 --> 02:00.320
of the Metropolitan Museum.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.480
I'll let them each introduce themselves

02:02.480 --> 02:05.400
when after I say these opening remarks.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.080
And we have a neuroscientist, which

02:08.080 --> 02:11.640
is the latest angle on love.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.080
I don't think 10 years ago there

02:13.080 --> 02:15.920
would have been a neuroscientist yet on the,

02:15.920 --> 02:19.160
I may have the time wrong.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.720
Your research is, I think, about five years ago

02:21.720 --> 02:24.920
that it's published.

02:24.920 --> 02:25.600
Well, whatever.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.160
It's a new field.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.960
A new field of love in the mind.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.920
The question that we might raise in this discussion

02:31.920 --> 02:35.920
is, is love in the harder is it in the brain,

02:35.920 --> 02:39.680
or some other organ that we don't know.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.880
So and when I first learned that I

02:42.880 --> 02:45.680
would be doing this moderating, it just

02:45.680 --> 02:48.160
happened that that day in the New York Times,

02:48.160 --> 02:53.360
there was an obituary about a man named Mr. Pugash.

02:53.360 --> 02:56.560
And I must say, I do remember the name from when he first

02:56.560 --> 03:00.960
was a notarized.

03:00.960 --> 03:07.160
So so blatantly in the news when he threw some head,

03:07.160 --> 03:11.200
some lie thrown into the eyes of his beloved.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.560
And he went to jail for that maybe 10 years or so.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.000
He gets out of jail.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.840
And the next thing we know is he marries the woman whom he

03:20.840 --> 03:22.480
virtually blinded.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.040
And so I thought, my goodness, love

03:24.040 --> 03:26.680
goes in all kinds of ways.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.400
I trust it's not the form of love we're

03:28.400 --> 03:30.000
going to spend too much time on today.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.520
But it's true that love takes many, many forms and shapes.

03:35.520 --> 03:41.480
And there's probably no limit to how far love can go.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.800
And we'll see some of that one in our discussion.

03:45.800 --> 03:51.240
I went to the internet and I checked the subject of love.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.800
And there were a number of categories of love.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.560
One was called quotes on love.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.960
And there were 16,000 quotes on love.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.640
I didn't go through them all.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.520
But I thought two weeks later when

04:04.520 --> 04:07.160
we were going to have this meeting,

04:07.160 --> 04:08.320
I looked it up again.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.720
And there were 16,500.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.480
So just in the two weeks that I was checking,

04:15.480 --> 04:19.520
the number of wherever these quotes are coming from,

04:19.520 --> 04:23.440
they just keep arriving and adding to the information

04:23.440 --> 04:24.000
explosion.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.520
Now, I was concerned in this discussion today

04:30.520 --> 04:34.680
that the topic is so something everybody

04:34.680 --> 04:36.680
has some strong feelings about.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.640
And the field is already the 16,000 quotes

04:39.640 --> 04:45.080
tells you already how far and wide the subject goes.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.200
And I was hoping that in this discussion,

04:47.200 --> 04:49.560
we would have some degree of focusing

04:49.560 --> 04:52.360
on the subject of love so that we're not completely

04:52.360 --> 04:53.640
all over the place.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.520
Even though the discussion and conversation we have

04:56.520 --> 04:59.280
will take us not far afield, but hopefully

04:59.280 --> 05:04.680
there'll be overlap among the five of us.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.400
And there'll be time for discussion at the end.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.920
There's a possibility we might have one or two questions

05:12.920 --> 05:19.560
before the end so that you have a chance to be heard.

05:19.560 --> 05:24.440
So I'll just start with Steve Klein to introduce yourself

05:24.440 --> 05:30.680
and tell us a little bit about the heart and poetry.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.600
Oh, why?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.120
My Michael.

05:33.120 --> 05:33.880
I still love you.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.560
And I don't know if love is the heart of poetry.

05:40.560 --> 05:49.520
I think that I think it's the way that one might access love.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.960
But I think that poetry goes on.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.920
I mean, the wonderful thing about if you

05:52.920 --> 05:54.640
take on poetry as a vocation is that you

05:54.640 --> 06:00.480
get to address a lot of different kinds of things.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.080
But I think that it's certainly not out of fear

06:04.080 --> 06:07.040
that one writes poetry, which I think

06:07.040 --> 06:11.000
is I'm haunted by this sort of definition I heard many,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.280
many years ago by Emmett Fox, which

06:13.280 --> 06:16.160
talks about if you're not feeling love, you're feeling fear.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.680
And that basically we in one way or another

06:18.680 --> 06:21.280
we're feeling one of those emotions all the time.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.280
So I always think of poetry as the way

06:23.280 --> 06:27.600
to keep the aperture open toward the love direction and not.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.760
It's a place to let everything happen and not a place to.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.680
It's not a place for self-censorship.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.160
And I think any place that is not about self-censorship

06:37.160 --> 06:38.080
is about love.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.080
I don't really want any to say a word or two about yourself.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
Oh, I'm Michael Klein.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.400
I'm a poet and a writer.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.200
I teach writing in the graduate program at Goddard College

06:49.200 --> 06:50.440
in Vermont.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.200
I've written three books of poems.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.000
I wrote a book of essays called The End

06:54.000 --> 06:57.640
of Being Known, which is about sex and friendship.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.680
And I wrote a memoir called Track Conditions, which

06:59.680 --> 07:01.320
is about my experience.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.200
Grooming a Kentucky Derby Horse in 1984, who died.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.360
And I'm explain for his death.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.000
So I write about it a lot of things.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.200
And I have a certain book of poems that just came out

07:13.200 --> 07:14.800
in January called The Talking Day.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.880
I'm Andrea Beyer.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.600
I'm the curator of Italian Renaissance paintings

07:23.600 --> 07:25.680
at the Metropolitan Museum.

07:25.680 --> 07:32.480
And I'm here because I was the curator of this exhibition,

07:32.480 --> 07:35.800
art and love in Renaissance Italy.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.720
And actually, I did think of an anecdote

07:38.720 --> 07:41.000
that I wanted to begin this discussion with,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.760
because the point of this exhibition

07:44.760 --> 07:48.400
was to bring together as wide a variety of objects

07:48.400 --> 07:51.120
and paintings that had been made during the Renaissance

07:51.120 --> 07:54.960
that celebrated those great ritual moments in people's

07:54.960 --> 07:59.560
lives, betrothal marriage, the beginning of a family.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.880
And in fact, we wanted to call the exhibition something

08:02.880 --> 08:06.920
about marriage, marriage in the family, et cetera.

08:06.920 --> 08:11.680
And the powers that be at the Met made us do a survey.

08:11.680 --> 08:16.240
And they found out that the word marriage was such a turn-off

08:16.240 --> 08:21.520
that they would not allow us to proceed with that in our title.

08:21.520 --> 08:26.440
And so they encouraged us instead to use the word love.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.520
And my colleagues, some of whom were much more academic

08:30.520 --> 08:33.200
than I am, were appalled by this because there

08:33.200 --> 08:39.680
was so little love in Renaissance marriage arrangements

08:39.680 --> 08:42.520
that they felt that we were, in some ways,

08:42.520 --> 08:45.800
distorting the conversation.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.120
However, I ended up seriously disagreeing

08:49.120 --> 08:52.640
with that point of view, and I was very happy that love was

08:52.640 --> 08:53.200
in the title.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.600
And if I have another two minutes,

08:54.600 --> 08:58.240
I'll just tell you a great Renaissance anecdote.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.120
You can probably all bring to mind

09:00.120 --> 09:04.640
the beautiful Titian Venus of Ourobino in the Uffizi.

09:04.640 --> 09:08.480
That painting was done for the Duquito Baldo della

09:08.480 --> 09:11.160
Rovare in 1538.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.120
And he wrote a very famous letter to Titian

09:13.120 --> 09:18.400
in which he says, don't sell that nude lady to anyone else.

09:18.400 --> 09:21.800
And that's the way he describes it.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.160
But to me, the thing that was so touching

09:25.160 --> 09:27.200
and interesting about that story,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
Guido Baldo della Rovare at that moment

09:29.200 --> 09:32.920
is married in a dynastic marriage with someone

09:32.920 --> 09:35.160
he had had no interest in, and in fact,

09:35.160 --> 09:38.320
who was prepubescent when they got married.

09:38.320 --> 09:43.720
But he had been in love, deeply in love, the year before.

09:43.720 --> 09:45.880
He was forced to marry that lady.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.640
And I just wanted to read to you his letter to his father

09:49.640 --> 09:51.720
briefly, briefly.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.840
For two years now, I've spoken at length,

09:53.840 --> 09:55.920
begging you that in giving me a wife,

09:55.920 --> 09:58.840
it would seem that in this act, the principal matter

09:58.840 --> 10:02.400
is to satisfy me, given that I carried and still

10:02.400 --> 10:05.000
carried such a love for the Lady Clédice.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.120
This is Clédice Oceini, due to her qualities and her manners.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.720
To let me have her would give me such extreme happiness

10:12.720 --> 10:16.520
and not to have her would cause me such infinite sadness.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.440
So I beg you with all my heart, if you have any regard

10:19.440 --> 10:24.200
for my sanity and health, satisfy and concede me this favor,

10:24.200 --> 10:26.960
knowing that in her is my all.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.880
Well, her father said no.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.400
Her mother said no.

10:30.400 --> 10:33.320
She was married the next year to an 11-year-old,

10:33.320 --> 10:35.840
and then bought the Venus of Urbino

10:35.840 --> 10:38.000
to put in his nuptial chamber.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.280
So love is a complicated story in the Renaissance, too.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.360
Under Andrea, it was modest in not telling us

10:46.360 --> 10:50.880
that the show she curated can be found on the web

10:50.880 --> 10:53.800
for giving a lecture on just looking up

10:53.800 --> 10:57.200
to the title of Love and Art in Renaissance Italy.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.040
And you'll be had a chance to hear her entire lecture

11:00.040 --> 11:03.000
on the show, which is now five, perhaps five years old.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Listen.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.400
And so I'm going to give you a quick place to start, actually.

11:11.400 --> 11:13.000
But I'm Lucy Brown.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm an neuroscientist.

11:15.000 --> 11:21.600
I've worked for about 40 years at Einstein College of Medicine.

11:21.600 --> 11:28.400
My most recent work has been human-like knowledge

11:28.400 --> 11:33.800
of early stage, intense knowledge.

11:33.800 --> 11:38.920
So we have to understand that the scientists have really

11:38.920 --> 11:43.000
had to focus in on a particular kind of love.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.840
There's the passionate love.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.200
There's the passionate love.

11:48.200 --> 11:52.400
There's love that can develop after a bunch of parties.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.880
There's the parental love, which

11:55.880 --> 11:59.800
shows to look at early stage, intense romantic love.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.600
So who would like to see any effects in the brain with this new

12:03.600 --> 12:06.800
methodology we've had on children or not?

12:06.800 --> 12:07.800
Lucy, any?

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
But we knew that romance, that early stage

12:16.000 --> 12:20.600
romantic love, that kind of romance that Andrea just read

12:20.600 --> 12:25.400
about can affect people's lives tremendously effectively

12:25.400 --> 12:27.000
and tremendously.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.800
After all, Edward, the seven stepped down

12:30.800 --> 12:35.920
from the throne of England in order to marry, well, a Simpson.

12:35.920 --> 12:41.720
So romance can affect our lives tremendously.

12:41.720 --> 12:46.920
And it's a big force, even though some people,

12:46.920 --> 12:50.000
it can be a big disruptive force, especially

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
in the Renaissance, and especially in Asian societies,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.480
they don't trust it because it can be so disruptive.

12:58.480 --> 13:05.040
But bottom line is, on your scientists' study,

13:05.040 --> 13:08.000
first romance, that intense failure,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.920
because part of the reason I did that first,

13:10.920 --> 13:14.120
because I was pretty sure I could measure something

13:14.120 --> 13:17.480
in the brain that is not the methodology.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.320
Also, because I knew, affected life was so frustrating.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.120
You would think about it.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.280
It changes us.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.560
Marriage, it's the way we pass on our genes.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.720
So much of our life actually revolves around falling in love.

13:36.720 --> 13:40.280
And I also have the eye of the anthropologist

13:40.280 --> 13:43.320
who one of my collaborators is Helen Fisher,

13:43.320 --> 13:45.080
an anthropologist.

13:45.080 --> 13:51.920
And the idea that romance is a developed form

13:51.920 --> 13:57.880
of a mammalian behavior to pursue preferred mates.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.080
But romance isn't just a human thing.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.000
Anyway, so I'll stop there.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.040
I don't think you need it.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.160
I think that one wasn't funny.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.600
Testing, testing.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.760
Thank you for having me.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.040
My name is Dan Slater.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.440
I am a writer and a reporter.

14:17.440 --> 14:22.600
And I am a writer.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.560
I'm a writer.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.440
Yeah?

14:26.440 --> 14:28.600
So it's sort of a funny story about why I'm here.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.440
I was a lawyer before I became a writer,

14:32.440 --> 14:34.760
and I was the legal affairs reporter at the Wall Street

14:34.760 --> 14:38.440
Journal up until about four years ago when I was laid off.

14:38.440 --> 14:42.880
And the layoff happened to coincide

14:42.880 --> 14:45.200
with the end of a relationship.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.120
So it was a lot to handle at one time,

14:47.120 --> 14:48.480
and I was seen a therapist.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.240
And she said to me, well, some of my patients

14:52.240 --> 14:53.560
fed luck with online dating.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.120
So me should give that a shot.

14:56.120 --> 14:59.440
And after several sessions, I finally, I took her advice,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.880
and I got on to match.com.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.280
And I started doing online dating,

15:03.280 --> 15:06.920
and that began to become a focus of the sessions.

15:06.920 --> 15:11.200
And she was asking me, well, what are the sites?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.720
I'm almost like she was using the sessions

15:12.720 --> 15:16.720
to get information out of me to pass on to her.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.960
And to her patients, because she'd

15:18.960 --> 15:20.280
get asked about online dating.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.760
And she said to me, she said, well, maybe one day

15:23.760 --> 15:25.600
you will write a book about this.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.720
And as I was saying downstairs, I said,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.640
there was no way I would write a book about this.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.400
But after a few more things happened,

15:35.400 --> 15:37.400
one of which was finding out that my mom and dad

15:37.400 --> 15:41.160
met through a computer dating service in 1965,

15:41.160 --> 15:46.280
I started to get serious as a researcher and a journalist

15:46.280 --> 15:49.160
looking into the online dating business

15:49.160 --> 15:52.760
and how it was affecting modern relationships.

15:52.760 --> 15:57.720
So the product was out as a book that I published last month.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.840
It's called Love and the Time of Algorithms.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.480
It was excerpted in the Atlantic magazine this last month.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.680
And so I've been out speaking about the book.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.480
So I come at this, I guess, from a slightly different angle.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.520
There's a lot of psychology in the book.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.880
There's a lot of business reporting.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.320
There's a lot of narrative.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.240
But really, it's a book about how this technology has come

16:21.240 --> 16:26.640
to mediate the way that we meet and discover mates now.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.000
And so that's the reason I'm here.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.160
Can I answer that?

16:33.160 --> 16:33.720
I met my boyfriend.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.120
We've run it permission.

16:35.120 --> 16:35.920
Thank you.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.800
No, it's an interesting story because I'm not

16:37.800 --> 16:39.200
my boyfriend online.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.880
And we've been together for 10 years.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.560
And what's interesting is that when I first

16:42.560 --> 16:46.200
asked the site, what was the website?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.440
It was part of law of a light or lava.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.840
It was a bubble for men.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.880
I mean, for gay men, it was for a man line.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.520
I gave them.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.040
And there was a sex part, and there was a relationship part.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.080
And I put my profile on all of them

16:57.080 --> 16:59.560
because I didn't really know what.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.240
I didn't know that you could actually have a relationship,

17:03.240 --> 17:05.320
but didn't necessarily have to do with all those things.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.960
I had been out of a relationship for 15 years.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.240
And the only reason I went online was because I was convinced

17:10.240 --> 17:12.840
by an ex-student that I had been offered for a year

17:12.840 --> 17:13.760
and she said, try to get you.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.200
He said, play dirt.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.160
And I did it the next day.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.000
I met this guy.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.040
So what happened was that we were going back and forth

17:20.040 --> 17:20.880
for about three months.

17:20.880 --> 17:23.800
And I sat down with Marie Howe, who I'm actually here

17:23.800 --> 17:25.080
replacing today.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.840
And she said, you have to leave him immediately.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.560
I said, why?

17:28.560 --> 17:34.400
She said, you're making somebody up.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.440
Even though they are, for all intents and purposes,

17:37.440 --> 17:40.960
proving their existence by these amazing emails,

17:40.960 --> 17:44.160
I mean, I really fell in love with both writers.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.840
And that was really what was interesting is sure enough.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.240
As soon as we met, it actually, I

17:51.240 --> 17:54.840
had to force it to work in this very strange way.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.440
I had to give it a chance because I

17:57.440 --> 18:00.960
knew that I was up against my imagination.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.440
And when it was physically presented to me,

18:03.440 --> 18:05.920
it was like, nothing like I thought he would look.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.120
He actually didn't even exchange pictures.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.120
Because of that, because I didn't think it mattered.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.320
That it's of matters.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.960
That it matters a lot.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.120
So I just say, it's such a way to still be there

18:18.120 --> 18:19.240
after 10 years.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.600
I have to say, it's a different kind of work.

18:21.600 --> 18:26.120
And in this day and age, I think that we've become,

18:26.120 --> 18:27.680
it's interesting, I think we've become

18:27.680 --> 18:30.000
people who are willing to do the kind of work

18:30.000 --> 18:32.680
that we would never, my parents would never have done.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.000
I mean, when you told me, when you said your parents met,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.480
and that's like, who does that?

18:36.480 --> 18:37.760
Like 20 years ago.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.000
I mean, it was a very different way of courting.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.640
And what's also fascinating is, how do we,

18:42.640 --> 18:44.440
and this might be a question to, I mean,

18:44.440 --> 18:54.200
how do we acclimate to using different phenomenology

18:54.200 --> 19:00.600
around instinct, which meaning somebody online is not,

19:00.600 --> 19:04.240
it's very different than having an instinct for somebody

19:04.240 --> 19:07.760
that you've met at a party, for instance.

19:07.760 --> 19:13.160
So I think one of the ways that online dating makes a difference

19:13.160 --> 19:17.440
is that you are sort of meeting an avatar in a person

19:17.440 --> 19:18.920
before you meet a person themselves.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.440
And one of the many results of that

19:21.440 --> 19:24.280
is that you invent an idea in your head of what he or she

19:24.280 --> 19:25.720
is like.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.040
And then, of course, at some point,

19:27.040 --> 19:28.200
you have to actually go meet them,

19:28.200 --> 19:32.800
and you have to sort of align those two things.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.400
And for some people, that can be a lot of disappointment.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.840
Because if the fantasy becomes very intense,

19:38.840 --> 19:42.040
then you ultimately have to reconcile the person with the fantasy,

19:42.040 --> 19:44.600
and that can be a disappointing process.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.520
But I think that's part of a learning curve thing.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.200
I think the people who do online dating for a while,

19:49.200 --> 19:52.840
they learn hopefully to get past that.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.440
I was saying to Lucy before we started

19:54.440 --> 19:58.520
that I think one of the great things that online dating is

19:58.520 --> 20:02.760
doing is that it is presenting people with some opportunities

20:02.760 --> 20:04.440
to fail.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.800
At least they're getting out there and meeting people

20:06.800 --> 20:10.280
and having relationships and having failed relationships

20:10.280 --> 20:13.040
and hopefully learning from them and hopefully making

20:13.040 --> 20:17.160
a better selection down the road as a result.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.160
So I don't know if I've answered anything that you.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.760
Nobody's interested in what they do.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.560
But then again, what is the authentic self that

20:23.560 --> 20:25.200
meets the avatar?

20:25.200 --> 20:25.680
Who is this?

20:25.680 --> 20:26.800
Well, forget the avatar.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.480
The avatar is just a way of meeting.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.000
OK.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.480
The avatar, I mean, unless for you,

20:33.480 --> 20:37.360
romance, love, and companionship means sitting in a room

20:37.360 --> 20:41.240
and imagining people, which I think for 99 to 100% of people,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.480
that's not the case.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.760
Ultimately, it's about meeting someone.

20:44.760 --> 20:49.160
So the way I think of it is that in a way,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.880
the technology is just a discovery tool.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.840
And I think the goal for most people

20:54.840 --> 20:58.600
should be to get offline as soon as possible.

20:58.600 --> 21:02.200
No, you're not spotting them across the room,

21:02.200 --> 21:03.960
or you're not spotting them in a class,

21:03.960 --> 21:06.000
or on the subway, or in a bar, or whatever.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.360
I think for some people that feels very strange,

21:08.360 --> 21:11.400
because we've become so used to that way of meeting.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.280
But it's really, it's just a discovery tool.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.480
And so I don't think the profile matters as much.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.120
I think the profile is one of those things of an online dating

21:21.120 --> 21:23.160
that is sort of a superficial difference.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.880
It's a fun thing to focus on because it can be funny.

21:26.880 --> 21:32.720
And it can be the source of sort of a lot of fibbing

21:32.720 --> 21:33.560
about yourself.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.520
But ultimately, you're going to put that aside,

21:35.520 --> 21:36.600
and you've got to go out.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.200
I think it's interesting that if you way, way before any

21:40.200 --> 21:42.040
of this could have taken place, one of the things

21:42.040 --> 21:46.360
that both of you are describing as sort of the idealization,

21:46.360 --> 21:48.160
that you idealize yourself, and you

21:48.160 --> 21:50.760
idealize the person with whom you're communicating

21:50.760 --> 21:53.640
on with online dating until you can no longer do that,

21:53.640 --> 21:56.280
because you're confronted with the actual person

21:56.280 --> 21:57.880
and have to relate to them.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.960
But this actually, at a completely different scale,

22:00.960 --> 22:05.040
is of course the basis of much of Renaissance ideas

22:05.040 --> 22:09.280
about love and embedded in poetry and so on,

22:09.280 --> 22:14.440
that in fact it's best not to meet that ideal love.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.360
And many of the poets never did meet that ideal love.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.520
They saw them in church and invented an entire thing

22:20.520 --> 22:24.240
about who they were and how great they

22:24.240 --> 22:28.240
and how they epitomized all of these ideals.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.600
But when they met them, it would be a completely different thing.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.120
And in fact, when they met them, they usually were very happy

22:36.120 --> 22:39.440
that those great ideals were married to someone completely

22:39.440 --> 22:41.040
different, and they didn't have to deal with them

22:41.040 --> 22:42.640
on a day-to-day basis.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.920
But it is, in a way, it's the same kind of thing

22:45.920 --> 22:48.520
that you overlay on somebody.

22:48.520 --> 22:54.200
It seems to me what you said that you studied romantic love.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.840
But from what I hear, first there seems to be the issue

22:58.840 --> 23:03.320
of interest, whether it's on the internet or in person

23:03.320 --> 23:05.600
or whatever there has to be interest.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.560
Then there is a term you didn't use,

23:07.560 --> 23:10.800
and I wonder why you chose not to use it,

23:10.800 --> 23:12.720
which is infatuation.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.040
And then you came to romantic love,

23:16.040 --> 23:20.720
which different people have different definitions of.

23:20.720 --> 23:23.840
So I thought maybe.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.360
So for my definition I like comes from Lane Hatfield

23:27.360 --> 23:30.640
for romantic love, and it's the intense desire

23:30.640 --> 23:34.840
for emotional union with another person.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.880
Unity, did you say?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.480
Emotional union.

23:37.480 --> 23:38.480
Union.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.440
With another person.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.480
That intense desire for emotional union.

23:42.480 --> 23:46.560
That is how romance can begin.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.520
And certainly what I'm talking about,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.240
you could use the word infatuation.

23:51.240 --> 23:53.040
It can start out that way.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.560
Where one of the things that we asked people

23:56.560 --> 23:59.320
who we were interviewing to become subjects

23:59.320 --> 24:01.920
in the experiment, the most important question,

24:01.920 --> 24:06.800
was what percentage of the day do you think about this person?

24:06.800 --> 24:09.120
Now most of the people who were part of this study

24:09.120 --> 24:11.360
said, you're kidding?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.880
I can't stop thinking about them.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.920
I can't sleep.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.280
They're totally obsessed with the other person.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.760
That doesn't last all that long, usually.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.440
I mean, you can't not sleep.

24:27.440 --> 24:32.160
People who are in love in the early stages often lose weight.

24:32.160 --> 24:37.960
That's one of the symptoms too for being in love.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.720
You have to moderate a little bit,

24:40.720 --> 24:44.920
and a little bit of attachment sets in,

24:44.920 --> 24:48.360
because you have to go to work and do other things

24:48.360 --> 24:52.160
and build a home, actually.

24:52.160 --> 25:01.600
So this intensity, you can call infatuation, I guess.

25:01.600 --> 25:06.360
But what's interesting to me, one of the interesting things

25:06.360 --> 25:12.440
we found, I'll just tell you, is that for people in that stage,

25:12.440 --> 25:15.560
when they looked at a picture of their beloved,

25:15.560 --> 25:19.400
their sweetheart, their romantic partner,

25:19.400 --> 25:22.480
I thought maybe it would activate parts of the brain

25:22.480 --> 25:25.320
that have to do mainly with cognition,

25:25.320 --> 25:28.400
recognizing something attractive about the other person.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.600
So remember, they've already fallen in love with the person.

25:31.600 --> 25:36.360
What was fantastic was the area of the brain that was active

25:36.360 --> 25:40.160
was deep in a reflex level part of the brain.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.800
It's called the brainstem.

25:41.800 --> 25:46.440
It's a reward system that neuroscientists had identified.

25:46.440 --> 25:49.680
But at a very primitive level of the brain,

25:49.680 --> 25:52.920
totally, dare I say, the unconscious level,

25:52.920 --> 25:56.040
but I'll say non-verbal level, maybe.

25:56.040 --> 26:01.520
Anyway, a part of the brain that is not just human at all,

26:01.520 --> 26:04.360
part of the brain we share with other mammals.

26:04.360 --> 26:11.840
And it's this primitive system.

26:11.840 --> 26:18.080
Our sense that water tastes good when we're thirsty.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.240
It's like thirst.

26:20.240 --> 26:23.000
And if you remember being in love,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.600
as a matter of fact, poetry, I think,

26:25.600 --> 26:29.400
uses the word thirsty when I hunger after my beloved.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.880
I'm thirsty for you.

26:31.880 --> 26:37.400
That is a poetry and literature often describes very well

26:37.400 --> 26:43.120
what kind of findings that we saw in the brain as we look back.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.720
But there was so what we say is that it activated part

26:47.720 --> 26:51.320
of the reward system that mediates basic drives

26:51.320 --> 26:53.560
like hunger and thirst.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.560
But right next to that area, actually,

26:56.560 --> 27:01.400
is another area that we found was activated

27:01.400 --> 27:05.560
just by the attractiveness of the face.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.840
So you can maybe sit down at a coffee shop

27:09.840 --> 27:11.480
with someone, see them the first time,

27:11.480 --> 27:14.320
and you have a reaction to them.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.480
And you know the face is attractive.

27:18.480 --> 27:23.560
In a general sense, there's a beauty that we all see in art.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.000
You know, there's a.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.240
And psychologists call this the difference

27:29.240 --> 27:34.760
wanting and liking so you can want someone.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.280
And that can be, goodness knows,

27:37.280 --> 27:40.120
that the face has to be somewhat attractive to you,

27:40.120 --> 27:41.520
but there are other things.

27:41.520 --> 27:45.360
And maybe it does have to do with your experiences

27:45.360 --> 27:47.000
with a primary caregiver.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.320
And there's something about that person that reminds you of them.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.640
But you focus on that person.

27:51.640 --> 27:58.080
You want that person versus liking them to start with.

27:58.080 --> 28:02.160
And liking can turn into wanting, actually.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.600
But that the brain studies identified very nicely

28:06.600 --> 28:10.040
these two different systems is interesting to me.

28:10.040 --> 28:16.800
I'd be very interested to know how much of that liking side

28:16.800 --> 28:20.240
is inherent to one person or is really

28:20.240 --> 28:25.960
conditioned by cultural norms.

28:25.960 --> 28:30.640
So that, again, to come back to the kind of descriptions

28:30.640 --> 28:35.560
of beauty in the Renaissance, the same kind of beauty

28:35.560 --> 28:37.880
is described over and over again.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.120
So you can imagine that, first of all, people

28:40.120 --> 28:44.520
tried to look like that by plucking their hair

28:44.520 --> 28:47.520
and dying at blonde and plucking their eyebrows and so on.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.720
Women tried to resemble that.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.280
But men seemed, in poetry at least,

28:54.280 --> 28:56.760
to respond mostly to that.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.560
Are they responding to something that's

28:59.560 --> 29:00.600
inherent to themselves?

29:00.600 --> 29:03.480
Or have they somehow been trained over time

29:03.480 --> 29:08.800
to like a certain kind of face, a certain kind of body?

29:08.800 --> 29:12.920
What responses are you going to like ourselves?

29:12.920 --> 29:16.920
And so we like to, I mean, we are at the Psycho analytic

29:16.920 --> 29:18.240
Institute here soon.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.680
Can you talk a little bit about the arts?

29:19.680 --> 29:21.520
Is that a cue for me to say something?

29:21.520 --> 29:24.840
One of the things I found when I

29:24.840 --> 29:29.800
interviewed over 100 online daters for this.

29:29.800 --> 29:35.520
And one of the things that I would hear over and over again

29:35.520 --> 29:39.520
would be the tales of sort of, as we were saying earlier,

29:39.520 --> 29:44.160
the ideal and sort of inventing the ideal early on.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.240
And then having to kind of reconcile the reality

29:46.240 --> 29:48.600
with the ideal that certainly, at the beginning of love,

29:48.600 --> 29:50.760
when you're feeling a tense romantic love,

29:50.760 --> 29:53.840
one at least in my own experiences and the experiences

29:53.840 --> 29:55.440
that a lot of people I interviewed for the book

29:55.440 --> 29:57.960
was that you'd meet someone who you liked.

29:57.960 --> 30:03.000
And part of that intensity was sort of inventing an ideal,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.480
oh my god, this person's amazing.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.520
This is the, they do this and that.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.600
And she's funny and all this.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.560
And then over time, of course, that starts to dissipate.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.880
And then you say, well, you know what?

30:14.880 --> 30:18.280
She actually, she leaves a lot of dishes in the sink.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.160
And gosh, and I really wish that she would take her shoes off

30:22.160 --> 30:23.800
in the house when she comes in.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.160
You know, whatever your thing is, whatever your little,

30:26.160 --> 30:32.000
and so the ideal starts to, the ideal no longer exists.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.280
The ideal is kind of shattered.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.200
And I think that with online dating,

30:36.200 --> 30:38.200
one of the things online dating allows you to do

30:38.200 --> 30:41.040
is become addicted to that ideal over and over again

30:41.040 --> 30:43.280
because just because you can meet more people.

30:43.280 --> 30:45.200
It's got to, you know, I want to feel that again.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.640
I want to feel that infatuation.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.000
So I met a lot of people who would kind of, you know,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.160
the serial online data that the person who always

30:51.160 --> 30:54.080
was looking for that kind of next early fix.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.160
You know, I don't, first of all, I don't think there is an ideal.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.400
I think that's the problem to begin with.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.960
And I fall in love with people that I'm not supposed to fall

31:00.960 --> 31:04.280
in love with, but by, in terms of what I think I like

31:04.280 --> 31:07.160
or I desire and much of it has to do with desire.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.880
I also think that if it's real love,

31:09.880 --> 31:12.720
there has to be a spiritual element to it.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.840
In other words, one of the best, but believe it or not,

31:14.840 --> 31:17.960
the best definition I've ever heard for this is by Scott Peck,

31:17.960 --> 31:19.840
who's not my favorite writer.

31:19.840 --> 31:24.320
But he said this great thing that love was being engaged

31:24.320 --> 31:26.760
in the spiritual progress of somebody else

31:26.760 --> 31:30.320
without insisting that they satisfy you.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.520
And I think, and that definition, it seems to me,

31:33.520 --> 31:37.480
could be carried over in a wide array of many different things

31:37.480 --> 31:38.320
that happen in a way.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.840
It could be physical or emotional or, I mean,

31:40.840 --> 31:44.800
I think that covers a lot of ground, even sexually.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.440
I think it could cover ground.

31:46.440 --> 31:50.440
But sat the idea of getting something back in a relation,

31:50.440 --> 31:54.000
in a love relationship, I think is where it gets screwy.

31:54.000 --> 31:54.880
I really do.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.880
I mean, and particularly when you have love

31:57.880 --> 32:00.560
for something that is not a person.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.520
I mean, I love many, many things in the world

32:02.520 --> 32:03.360
that have nothing.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.040
And the other thing I was thinking of was I got a letter

32:05.040 --> 32:07.000
from a wonderful writer named William Maxwell.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.080
You were talking about animals.

32:08.080 --> 32:13.160
I mean, there's nothing greater on this planet than that love.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.120
I mean, we all agree right there.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.440
I mean, that this should be an animal planet.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.000
And we should be the guardians of the animals.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.120
I really believe that.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.200
And there's this wonderful letter from William Maxwell

32:23.200 --> 32:26.320
who said that he'd read my book.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.120
And he said, we were going back and forth about horses.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.920
And he had this horse story that he wanted to tell me.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.520
And he said, when I was 17, I fell in love

32:33.520 --> 32:35.600
with a mayor named Diana.

32:35.600 --> 32:40.120
And because this is a true love story, never saw a hurricane.

32:40.120 --> 32:46.720
Well, I just wanted to, I noticed that I've been relatively

32:46.720 --> 32:48.480
quiet as a moderator.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.120
And there are a number of reasons for that.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.120
One is that I was aware that if I didn't say anything,

32:53.120 --> 32:56.640
a little bit like an analyst in the quiet phase,

32:56.640 --> 33:00.200
the conversation seemed to be moving in the direction

33:00.200 --> 33:04.680
of sort of, I think, deeper issues and themes

33:04.680 --> 33:06.360
that involve the human being.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.680
And I thought, well, I could let this go on

33:08.680 --> 33:12.880
and before long we'll have the id will be on the table.

33:12.880 --> 33:18.040
But I do want to, first of all, say that Lucy, when you said,

33:18.040 --> 33:20.840
you know, you apologize for using the word unconscious,

33:20.840 --> 33:24.800
you don't have to apologize for bringing the unconscious

33:24.800 --> 33:27.480
into our conversation.

33:27.480 --> 33:32.320
The aspect of falling in love and being in love

33:32.320 --> 33:37.120
and relating in general has, to my way of seeing it,

33:37.120 --> 33:42.280
always involves images that people have of the other.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.720
And they either want to find that image out there somewhere,

33:45.720 --> 33:50.040
or if they don't find it, they will try to create that image,

33:50.040 --> 33:52.280
some image they have within themselves

33:52.280 --> 33:54.920
of what they would feel most comfortable with.

33:54.920 --> 33:59.360
And then they will try to induce the image of the other

33:59.360 --> 34:02.280
in images that they have of that person.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.240
Of course, it gets further complicated

34:04.240 --> 34:08.120
by the other person that similarly has images.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.440
And that's where my profession comes in,

34:10.440 --> 34:13.160
because when I, there's a couple of therapists,

34:13.160 --> 34:15.680
almost always the problem, presenting problem,

34:15.680 --> 34:18.200
is the image that people have of one another

34:18.200 --> 34:21.840
doesn't fit the person who they're with.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.600
And that seems to me the human condition.

34:24.600 --> 34:29.840
There's nobody who's going to be a symbiotic twin,

34:29.840 --> 34:31.960
or be exactly the way you want them to be,

34:31.960 --> 34:33.760
or to be the same as you.

34:33.760 --> 34:36.320
And so I did want to bring that up as a...

34:36.320 --> 34:38.920
So, first, how do you avoid that trap?

34:38.920 --> 34:40.880
Which trap?

34:40.880 --> 34:41.720
Well, I mean...

34:41.720 --> 34:43.080
Looking for your twin.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.640
Well, there are a number of ways to do that.

34:46.640 --> 34:50.120
In the therapeutic world, there are two ways

34:50.120 --> 34:54.840
that that can happen in the traditional psychoanalytic framework.

34:54.840 --> 34:59.240
A patient comes in and begins to transfer feelings

34:59.240 --> 35:03.920
onto the analysts that are totally sort of in their head.

35:03.920 --> 35:07.600
And the analyst then tries to interpret what image

35:07.600 --> 35:11.040
are they trying to create in the analyst

35:11.040 --> 35:12.880
is it some version of a sibling,

35:12.880 --> 35:15.200
or a parent, a father, or a mother.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.960
And by gaining some insight into that,

35:17.960 --> 35:21.720
they can say, well, this is something I have to keep my eye on,

35:21.720 --> 35:23.760
that I don't fall into that trap

35:23.760 --> 35:27.440
that you sort of suggest that we all fall into.

35:27.440 --> 35:31.200
Now, when I see a couple, in some ways,

35:31.200 --> 35:34.280
it's somewhat easier to me because each party

35:34.280 --> 35:36.920
is projecting onto the other person

35:36.920 --> 35:40.680
some irrational parts of themselves.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.920
And one can do two for the press of one, so to speak.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.120
The transparencies are going on both ways.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.360
And so you can then begin to examine that

35:51.360 --> 35:54.200
and help them also get greater insight

35:54.200 --> 36:00.000
into who they are, what they're about, and who they want to be.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.120
Before, when you were telling me about your analyst

36:02.120 --> 36:05.320
said to you, there's a book in there.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.160
I thought to myself, my analyst never told me

36:07.160 --> 36:09.120
there was a book in the middle of me.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.520
I didn't have an analyst who told me

36:11.520 --> 36:13.640
that I wrote a book anyway.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.280
But I wasn't told that I had a book that might come out.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.960
Now, that's a different intervention

36:20.960 --> 36:23.040
that your analyst got.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.640
I was like, I'm a career coach.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.640
Huh?

36:25.640 --> 36:26.640
Yeah, I would.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.880
So, but this goes on in the analytic and in the therapeutic

36:29.880 --> 36:32.800
room as well, that is there are transparencies

36:32.800 --> 36:35.560
and counter-transparencies between the patient

36:35.560 --> 36:37.560
and their therapist.

36:37.560 --> 36:42.440
And hopefully, the therapist is not overly filling the room

36:42.440 --> 36:45.000
with his or her transparencies.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.600
But anyway, I was just struck by how almost everything we say

36:49.600 --> 36:54.160
ultimately brings up our own way of being in the world.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.680
Not Stephen, but Michael.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.320
Michael.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.080
Well, Stephen is my son.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.840
I knew somebody.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.880
I knew somebody.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.560
Lots of transparencies.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.400
Well, you asked me.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.400
I told you.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.560
I'm not asked.

37:12.560 --> 37:16.320
So Michael, you had a lot of affect

37:16.320 --> 37:18.360
when you were talking.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.440
That comes from who you are and what you think

37:21.440 --> 37:25.520
is a normal or regular way of being in the world.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.440
It's not the same as the other people in the room.

37:28.440 --> 37:30.960
It's who you are.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.840
So that's what I think a second analysis

37:34.840 --> 37:35.920
has to offer people.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.280
That is to examine themselves at the same time

37:39.280 --> 37:43.000
that they are examining the world and who they're with

37:43.000 --> 37:44.080
and what they're doing.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.040
And it's all in the way around the team.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.320
I think it's on that ground when people are most themselves

37:48.320 --> 37:49.920
that you fall in love.

37:49.920 --> 37:52.240
But what I'm having a problem with

37:52.240 --> 37:55.080
is that everybody's talking about something else.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.760
I'm not so sure.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.520
You're all talking about love.

37:59.520 --> 38:03.160
To begin with, I'm not understanding from your definitions

38:03.160 --> 38:04.760
what is love.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.760
He's talking about dating and thoughts

38:08.760 --> 38:11.760
you have about the person before you have met them.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.640
You are talking about meeting the person

38:13.640 --> 38:16.920
and maybe losing all those thoughts that you had or not

38:16.920 --> 38:17.840
losing.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.640
You are talking and saying it was a good thing

38:20.640 --> 38:23.080
that some of these people, in fact, didn't meet the women

38:23.080 --> 38:25.200
because if they had met, it wouldn't have worked out

38:25.200 --> 38:26.440
and would have been back.

38:26.440 --> 38:31.360
And when you talk about it, you talk about reward centers

38:31.360 --> 38:34.560
and that is present in animals.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.360
And so I'm not so sure.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.360
And you talk about varieties of love.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.080
You mentioned a number of them.

38:41.080 --> 38:46.080
So what is it you people think love is?

38:46.080 --> 38:47.000
Is it sex?

38:47.000 --> 38:47.840
Is it love?

38:47.840 --> 38:48.760
Is it love and sex?

38:48.760 --> 38:49.880
Is no sex at all?

38:49.880 --> 38:50.720
What is it?

38:50.720 --> 38:52.520
It's the opposite of everyone.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.040
I'm not being so close.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.480
Like I really, I didn't say what it was.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.760
I think a number of things.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.720
It's the opposite of fear.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.760
And it's not demanding that somebody

39:00.760 --> 39:03.400
is satisfied if you are in the relationship.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
I think those two things.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.200
It has been the opposite because there are a lot of people

39:07.200 --> 39:11.640
who are full of anxiety but also think they are in love or love.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.040
But there's a lot of anxiety.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.520
I'm sorry.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.000
They're in something else.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.520
You have a sense of certainty.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.520
I have to jump in.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.240
Jump.

39:23.240 --> 39:27.520
Because I want to comment on what you said.

39:27.520 --> 39:30.600
And you can imagine how from the brain studies,

39:30.600 --> 39:34.160
how true some of the things you said may be.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.360
And in the next round table, you're

39:36.360 --> 39:37.640
going to be talking about fear.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.480
And you'll have Joe Ludu here.

39:39.480 --> 39:42.960
He was the one who really discovered the amygdala.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.000
Please, a big role in fear.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.120
Now, there's another thing that happens in the brain

39:47.120 --> 39:52.120
when people look at their beloved, at their romantic partner.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.280
There's one area of the brain where activity

39:57.280 --> 40:00.480
goes down tremendously in everybody.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.560
And it's in the amygdala.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.040
What?

40:03.040 --> 40:05.120
It's in the amygdala, which we know

40:05.120 --> 40:09.520
plays a big role in mediating our feelings of fear.

40:09.520 --> 40:14.560
Now, anxiety too, but anxiety is different.

40:14.560 --> 40:15.920
And you can certainly be.

40:15.920 --> 40:20.120
You can have all these emotions around love of anxiety.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.880
And you can be sad.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.080
You can be euphoric.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.040
You can have lots of emotions around love.

40:26.040 --> 40:31.800
My idea is that love is best described as a drive,

40:31.800 --> 40:34.800
a drive toward another person.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.120
And when that comes, let me tell you some interesting data

40:38.120 --> 40:41.160
we just got.

40:41.160 --> 40:45.200
We did a study of people, they happened to be in China.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.560
They were in love.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.440
We scanned them four years ago.

40:49.440 --> 40:53.440
So they were deeply in love.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.600
And we called them four years later to say,

40:56.600 --> 41:01.120
are you still with that person?

41:01.120 --> 41:04.680
And we weren't sure that anything would predict.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.520
We were looking for predictions.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.440
Would there be a difference between those

41:09.440 --> 41:15.840
who were still together compared to those who had broken up?

41:15.840 --> 41:19.000
One of them, there turned out to be a difference.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.200
I was stunned.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.720
It was real.

41:21.720 --> 41:25.160
But it's so consistent with some psychology,

41:25.160 --> 41:27.600
because one of the things was parts of the brain that

41:27.600 --> 41:30.640
are associated with negative judgment

41:30.640 --> 41:32.800
showed a decrease in activity.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.040
It's one thing that's interesting.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.640
But the other thing that addresses what you said

41:37.640 --> 41:43.040
is that there was a decrease in activity

41:43.040 --> 41:44.600
of parts of the brain, and I'd have

41:44.600 --> 41:47.160
to summarize a lot of stuff, that have

41:47.160 --> 41:50.560
to do with our sense of self.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.560
And what it looked like people were doing

41:53.560 --> 41:57.520
was actually, first of all, not judging

41:57.520 --> 42:01.920
the other person negatively, but secondly, also in some way

42:01.920 --> 42:04.240
suppressing their sense of self.

42:04.240 --> 42:12.120
And it does indeed, the psychologists know a lot about this.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.920
They call it incorporation of other in the self.

42:14.920 --> 42:18.360
A lot of people who study romance and relationships,

42:18.360 --> 42:20.720
and there's even a scale for incorporation

42:20.720 --> 42:23.440
of other in the self.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.040
And that ability to incorporate someone,

42:27.040 --> 42:29.560
you're incorporating someone in your sense of self.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.960
Some people think that romance is actually

42:32.960 --> 42:37.360
a very fast expansion of the self.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.640
Self-expansion.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.800
That's a great thing.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.120
My colleague, Art Aaron, who's a psychologist who studied

42:43.120 --> 42:47.440
love all of his career, his email address

42:47.440 --> 42:49.960
is at self-expansion.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.520
Not going to get it.

42:52.520 --> 42:57.040
But so it's a rapid expansion of the self,

42:57.040 --> 43:04.120
but also perhaps the ability to indeed put your needs kind

43:04.120 --> 43:07.280
of last, even, the other person first.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.480
And by the way, I just have to say one other thing,

43:10.480 --> 43:12.080
because you mentioned animals.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.800
And I grew up on a farm with horses, actually,

43:14.800 --> 43:18.200
and love dogs and animals.

43:21.640 --> 43:26.040
One of the things that I actually did for myself

43:26.040 --> 43:29.800
was to scan myself to looking at my beloved dog.

43:29.800 --> 43:30.300
OK.

43:35.400 --> 43:43.160
But it was different from looking at my newlywed husband.

43:43.160 --> 43:49.480
This ventral-tagmental area that is in the brainstem,

43:49.480 --> 43:54.520
that is this area of the brain we share with other animals,

43:54.520 --> 43:57.280
was not activated, although I was surprised.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.120
So does that say about what that part of the?

44:00.120 --> 44:02.600
So it's not the same drive.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.840
And it's not the same complexity,

44:04.840 --> 44:10.400
because the dog accepts anything.

44:10.400 --> 44:18.880
Perhaps also I know that my self and my survival

44:18.880 --> 44:20.320
is not dependent on her.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.560
Whereas for my husband, I now, after doing these studies

44:25.560 --> 44:30.520
for 10 years or more, I have come to see romantic love

44:30.520 --> 44:34.440
and attachment as part of our survival systems.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.520
We take them for granted.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.240
Also, I've studied the motor system in neurology.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.920
We take standing up against gravity for granted.

44:42.920 --> 44:46.640
We take love and attachment for granted.

44:46.640 --> 44:51.600
But they are actually essential for our survival.

44:51.600 --> 44:52.880
It's my way of looking at it now.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.360
That's a big illusion.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.960
It's a big illusion to take it for granted

44:57.960 --> 45:02.600
that the love is there and it's unconditional.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.160
In your own research, I think you also

45:05.160 --> 45:06.920
look at people who fall out of love.

45:06.920 --> 45:07.440
Yes.

45:07.440 --> 45:11.960
And what's the other side, the falling love that

45:11.960 --> 45:13.000
is falling out of love?

45:13.000 --> 45:13.480
The cruel tale of love.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.640
What why do you fall out of love?

45:15.640 --> 45:22.080
Well, the other night I watched the Metropolitan's version

45:22.080 --> 45:25.200
of Othello, some of you may have watched it.

45:25.200 --> 45:30.280
And you're watching a man who's so unbelievably in love

45:30.280 --> 45:31.680
with Desdemona.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.960
And shortly within just a short period of time,

45:35.960 --> 45:38.600
Iago has him questioning that love.

45:38.600 --> 45:41.560
And before you know it, he hates his wife

45:41.560 --> 45:44.800
and is about any proceeds to murder her.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.760
So I think we can't have this discussion

45:47.760 --> 45:53.120
without looking at the dialectic of love and love and hate.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.040
It will fear you.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.440
I'd like to jump in there too.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.320
First of all, I don't want to be held accountable

45:59.320 --> 46:01.800
for what my Renaissance people thought about each other.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.680
That's not my own personal feelings

46:03.680 --> 46:04.720
and that love.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.880
I prefer to meet the people that I idealize.

46:07.880 --> 46:11.440
But it's very important, actually,

46:11.440 --> 46:17.320
in the whole Renaissance system, the cruelty of love,

46:17.320 --> 46:19.160
the opposite side of it.

46:19.160 --> 46:26.240
And so, in fact, if they had been confronted with your evidence,

46:26.240 --> 46:28.760
I think that for most people in the Renaissance,

46:28.760 --> 46:33.520
they would say that proves that our system is the best.

46:33.520 --> 46:37.560
Because what we are looking for, what we're looking for to build,

46:37.560 --> 46:43.520
is a system of life that guarantees the survival

46:43.520 --> 46:45.280
of the people in it.

46:45.280 --> 46:48.880
And that gives them that kind of trust in faith

46:48.880 --> 46:54.080
in the next day that they did not find an extreme romantic love.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.720
What they found was an attachment.

46:56.720 --> 47:06.760
That attachment led to a solid base for love, for ongoing love,

47:06.760 --> 47:08.680
and for family.

47:08.680 --> 47:12.560
And what they feared the most was the cruelty of love,

47:12.560 --> 47:17.120
the betrayal, the loss, which, of course, for women

47:17.120 --> 47:19.200
was catastrophe.

47:19.200 --> 47:22.880
That if you could not put your faith in the actual family

47:22.880 --> 47:25.960
building side of love.

47:25.960 --> 47:31.840
So when they would have looked at the picture of their loved one,

47:31.840 --> 47:33.720
they would have wanted that to be someone

47:33.720 --> 47:36.120
who was going to be there the next year, the next year,

47:36.120 --> 47:39.080
and then that would have been something that would have led

47:39.080 --> 47:44.320
them to a satisfaction in life and to an avoidance of fear.

47:44.320 --> 47:48.320
We put a lot of faith in romantic love

47:48.320 --> 47:52.720
and the hope that it will continue, or so it seems to me.

47:52.720 --> 47:55.120
I'd like to bring up another play, actually.

47:55.120 --> 47:59.560
Sylvia the Goat is a play that Edward Albie wrote,

47:59.560 --> 48:04.400
and in which a man falls in love with a goat.

48:04.400 --> 48:08.800
And during the course of the play, someone asked him,

48:08.800 --> 48:11.200
well, why did you fall in love with a goat?

48:11.200 --> 48:12.000
How could that be?

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
He said, it was a look in the goat's eyes.

48:15.000 --> 48:18.800
Somehow there was some kind of eye contact that was made.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.000
At least that's what Albie gives,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.400
is the modus of falling in love.

48:23.400 --> 48:26.400
There's something about the eye contact, which, of course,

48:26.400 --> 48:28.400
as an analyst, I'm listening to this and thinking,

48:28.400 --> 48:38.400
what I haven't said yet in this symposium is that falling in love,

48:38.400 --> 48:41.400
as Freud said, is refinding a love object.

48:41.400 --> 48:49.400
That is, one infantile experiences dictate largely

48:49.400 --> 48:51.400
what happens later in people's lives.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.400
They may not want to believe that,

48:53.400 --> 48:57.400
but the infantile sexuality has its way.

48:57.400 --> 49:01.400
The finding itself in the adult world,

49:01.400 --> 49:08.400
whether it's on the internet or whether it's letter writing

49:08.400 --> 49:12.400
between people, actually, we're talking about how our parents met.

49:12.400 --> 49:19.400
My parents met via my mother's brother putting an ad in the paper

49:19.400 --> 49:22.400
in 1910 or something like that.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400
That was an early form of online data.

49:24.400 --> 49:27.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:27.400 --> 49:32.400
Of course, here's where sociology and anthropology come in.

49:32.400 --> 49:37.400
We alluded to our cultures play a role in all of these questions as well.

49:37.400 --> 49:40.400
We're going to have an anthropologist here this afternoon,

49:40.400 --> 49:42.400
as well, there are a number of other disciplines.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.400
We don't have the whole field to ourselves.

49:45.400 --> 49:50.400
Anthropologists have a lot to say about what happens at any particular period of time,

49:50.400 --> 49:56.400
like in the Renaissance, arranged marriages, outnumbered marriages by choice.

49:56.400 --> 50:01.400
So there's no one kind of theory that's going to explain everything.

50:01.400 --> 50:11.400
There's going to be a series of different factors that make for what happens at any particular time in our own history.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.400
Can I say something about Albee for just a minute?

50:14.400 --> 50:15.400
Albee.

50:15.400 --> 50:19.400
He writes the most unlovable creatures on the American stage.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.400
I mean, it was interesting that you brought up that particular play,

50:22.400 --> 50:25.400
which I actually think is his best play, but look at his work.

50:25.400 --> 50:28.400
He knows nothing about romantic love.

50:28.400 --> 50:32.400
Really? It's what he's about. That's what his plays are about.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.400
It's about the cruelty of love.

50:34.400 --> 50:37.400
Well, he's not, maybe he would say that's not what he's writing about.

50:37.400 --> 50:41.400
He would say many things. I did an interview with Edward Albee.

50:41.400 --> 50:46.400
And I felt like I was interviewing an imposter, to be honest with you.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.400
I never felt like I was getting the truth.

50:48.400 --> 50:52.400
I tell you, to give you an example of how I think there was some truth in that play.

50:52.400 --> 50:59.400
As the play moves on, you learn that George, when he was a teenager,

50:59.400 --> 51:04.400
was in an auto accident in which he ran over his parents and killed them.

51:04.400 --> 51:06.400
You talk about Virginia Woolf.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.400
You talk about him as a friend of Virginia Woolf.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.400
Yeah, he was a friend of Virginia Woolf.

51:09.400 --> 51:14.400
And then Martha, we learned that Martha, when she was a young girl, her mother died.

51:14.400 --> 51:18.400
Father remarried, and her stepmother also died.

51:18.400 --> 51:26.400
So here you have two people who had loss of their one parent or two parents in their early years.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.400
So what do they end up doing?

51:28.400 --> 51:31.400
They end up hooking up with each other for a lot of other reasons,

51:31.400 --> 51:34.400
and they don't have a child, except for the one that they make believe.

51:34.400 --> 51:37.400
So here they are, because it's dangerous to have a child.

51:37.400 --> 51:39.400
A child will kill you sooner or later.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.400
So, I mean, I don't think that there's no truth in that play.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.400
They love each other.

51:44.400 --> 51:50.400
I think, you know, I knew when we were going to meet that there was going to be no agreement

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
about what love means, what...

51:52.400 --> 51:54.400
Love means every time to say you're sorry.

51:54.400 --> 51:58.400
I think it's one of the most misused words in English language.

51:58.400 --> 52:02.400
And I was hoping that one of the things that would come out of this symposium

52:02.400 --> 52:05.400
is that we give this word up.

52:05.400 --> 52:10.400
It's not a word that means very much, except to what we want it to mean

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
and how we imagine it.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.400
But what about love of the world?

52:13.400 --> 52:16.400
I disagree. I'll just have to go on the record.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.400
Yeah, you disagree with what?

52:18.400 --> 52:20.400
Yeah, because that's what you're saying.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.400
No, I think romance and love is something very specific.

52:24.400 --> 52:27.400
I think we can be very specific about it.

52:27.400 --> 52:32.400
I think we can describe its behavioral symptoms very clearly.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.400
A certain kind of love.

52:34.400 --> 52:39.400
And well, romance, a attachment, companion at love,

52:39.400 --> 52:42.400
and I think there can be definitions for all of the internal love.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.400
Yeah, but then we have parental love and we have platonic love.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.400
We can be very specific about the definitions.

52:48.400 --> 52:53.400
We can be specific about the definitions, and I think...

52:53.400 --> 52:55.400
And we see it in behavior.

52:55.400 --> 53:00.400
We can describe it behaviorally, I think, to each other quite easily.

53:00.400 --> 53:04.400
And anything that you see in behavior or any difference,

53:04.400 --> 53:07.400
there may be many types of love.

53:07.400 --> 53:10.400
But if you can describe it behaviorally,

53:10.400 --> 53:13.400
you know there's going to be a different brain system there,

53:13.400 --> 53:15.400
also mediating it.

53:15.400 --> 53:20.400
And I think one of the things that actually neuroscience can help

53:20.400 --> 53:23.400
to do is to help us with these definitions.

53:23.400 --> 53:27.400
And to realize we can come up with definitions for these things.

53:27.400 --> 53:31.400
Well, I think we can make correlations between the caudate nucleus

53:31.400 --> 53:34.400
lighting up and some kind of grooming behavior

53:34.400 --> 53:37.400
between either two animals or two humans.

53:37.400 --> 53:41.400
You can correlate them, but you can't say anything about what's causing

53:41.400 --> 53:46.400
which and whether you decide to call it love is a matter of definition.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.400
Not whether you're causing it, but it depends upon where it is now.

53:49.400 --> 53:54.400
For example, if I had found that everybody's pre-frontal,

53:54.400 --> 53:59.400
medial prefrontal cortex was active in this study,

53:59.400 --> 54:03.400
I would have a very different story to tell you, or maybe no story.

54:03.400 --> 54:07.400
The fact that it was in this primitive part of the brain

54:07.400 --> 54:10.400
gives me more to tell you about it

54:10.400 --> 54:15.400
and why it may be so hard to control when you fall in love.

54:15.400 --> 54:20.400
And by the way, so romance can indeed bring pain,

54:20.400 --> 54:23.400
and it does, and there's nothing like heartbreak,

54:23.400 --> 54:27.400
and even whole cultures are afraid of love.

54:27.400 --> 54:30.400
But the fact is for many people,

54:30.400 --> 54:34.400
when they are in a relationship and they were in love

54:34.400 --> 54:37.400
and they stay together and sometimes even in arranged marriages,

54:37.400 --> 54:41.400
you do fall in love after you get married.

54:41.400 --> 54:47.400
That romance period often plays a critical role in keeping the couple together.

54:47.400 --> 54:52.400
They can remember it when things aren't so good.

54:52.400 --> 54:58.400
I think that romance does play a role in attachment later, too.

54:58.400 --> 55:01.400
And so I do think...

55:01.400 --> 55:03.400
What if there's never any attachment?

55:03.400 --> 55:06.400
Then you go on to somebody else?

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
No, no, no.

55:08.400 --> 55:15.400
Does the result, or sort of, you know, the goal of love?

55:15.400 --> 55:17.400
You can fall out of love.

55:17.400 --> 55:20.400
Have anything to do with the definition?

55:20.400 --> 55:23.400
So like, if I'm in it for...

55:23.400 --> 55:25.400
We can hear you.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
Hello?

55:26.400 --> 55:29.400
Do you read what you said?

55:29.400 --> 55:37.400
Yeah, I was just asking Lucy if the result of the relationship

55:37.400 --> 55:40.400
has any effect on what sort of love existed.

55:40.400 --> 55:46.400
So if it winds up being a week-long relationship or a 50-year marriage,

55:46.400 --> 55:54.400
does that fact then affect what actually happened from a neurological perspective?

55:54.400 --> 55:57.400
Between the people?

55:57.400 --> 56:04.400
Or is the love, at least from your perspective, analyzed as a separate thing?

56:04.400 --> 56:07.400
I'm not sure I understand your question.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.400
So what is the reason to be in love?

56:09.400 --> 56:11.400
Is there a reason for it?

56:11.400 --> 56:14.400
Yes, it's part of the human reproductive strategy.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.400
You have sex?

56:15.400 --> 56:16.400
Now wait a minute.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.400
I take issue with that.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.400
I'm not reproducing nothing.

56:21.400 --> 56:24.400
No, but you have a partner who is making you safer.

56:24.400 --> 56:27.400
It's even known...

56:27.400 --> 56:35.400
There have been a lot of studies that suggest that people live longer when they're in partnerships

56:35.400 --> 56:38.400
and you're safer when you're walking down New York City Street.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.400
It's survival.

56:40.400 --> 56:44.400
You're safer when you're walking down the street when you're with someone else.

56:44.400 --> 56:50.400
So it's not just part of the reproductive strategy and part of the safety strategy.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.400
But an important...

56:52.400 --> 56:55.400
It makes romance very unromantic.

56:55.400 --> 56:58.400
It's not a new reproduction.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.400
Even you're strong in love.

57:00.400 --> 57:01.400
It doesn't.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.400
When you fall in love, you very often...

57:03.400 --> 57:06.400
And I'm not talking about our society right now, remember?

57:06.400 --> 57:11.400
I'm talking about the evolution, or even human evolution,

57:11.400 --> 57:14.400
before there were such constraints,

57:14.400 --> 57:19.400
that romance was there.

57:19.400 --> 57:22.400
And then there were some things often...

57:22.400 --> 57:27.400
One way of looking at it, which I say, here's a working hypothesis.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.400
Okay, okay.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.400
That you've got sex, which just...

57:31.400 --> 57:34.400
You have to have the capability, you know?

57:34.400 --> 57:37.400
And sex brings pleasure too, besides being reproductive.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.400
But we do need to reproduce to survive as a species.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.400
Okay, we just do.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
But it's a different issue.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.400
But...

57:45.400 --> 57:48.400
No, no, no, it's not necessarily because you've got sex.

57:48.400 --> 57:53.400
But then you've got romance that keeps you focused.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.400
That's what I'm saying, I just said that.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.400
But they do it because it's part of a larger societal...

57:58.400 --> 57:59.400
People from many reads.

57:59.400 --> 58:05.400
Yeah, they do it for lots of reads, aside from some innate feeling that they won't be a person.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.400
Okay, I say you have your individual...

58:07.400 --> 58:09.400
Time out, time out.

58:09.400 --> 58:12.400
I knew this was going to happen.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
No, I just...

58:13.400 --> 58:15.400
I think we should keep it in open.

58:15.400 --> 58:18.400
I think we should be... I'm not being head over with sexist either.

58:18.400 --> 58:20.400
I don't mean to sound head over sexist.

58:20.400 --> 58:23.400
But I'm just saying, whatever, we're head over from people.

58:23.400 --> 58:28.400
Excuse me, there are a lot of assumptions that are being made here by all of us.

58:28.400 --> 58:35.400
One is that falling in love is good for our species and it helps with reproduction and survival.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.400
That's no longer true.

58:36.400 --> 58:44.400
It's no longer true that we as a species are going to do well by increasing our population at all.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.400
And more to do more to the world.

58:46.400 --> 58:52.400
And then as far as you're talking about reproduction, you know, when you're a teacher...

58:52.400 --> 58:54.400
Is Edward Albee says, it can ruin you.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
I mean, it's the opposite.

58:55.400 --> 59:01.400
When you're teaching students, you're doing a form of reproduction there as well.

59:01.400 --> 59:09.400
I mean, if you take it in a narrow reproduction of infants, that's not the only kind of reproduction that there is.

59:09.400 --> 59:11.400
Is reproduction of students?

59:11.400 --> 59:14.400
There's reproduction of students.

59:14.400 --> 59:15.400
Just went off.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.400
I think they all went off.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.400
You might want...

59:18.400 --> 59:19.400
Or techies went off.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.400
Just when it was getting good.

59:21.400 --> 59:23.400
I totally guess.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
You're absolutely right.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.400
I like that definition.

59:25.400 --> 59:29.400
You shouldn't say you put yourself down by saying, I don't reproduce.

59:29.400 --> 59:31.400
But that's just not true.

59:31.400 --> 59:32.400
Okay.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.400
I mean, we all reproduce in different ways.

59:34.400 --> 59:35.400
Right.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.400
And hopefully we reproduce in a positive way.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.400
Yeah.

59:38.400 --> 59:42.400
No, no, no, fine.

59:42.400 --> 59:43.400
Nurturing.

59:43.400 --> 59:47.400
But you know where I was going when I before too.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.400
I'm just saying, I think it's a loaded word.

59:49.400 --> 59:52.400
And if we make it more open, that's great.

59:52.400 --> 59:56.400
If we all know what the definition is, that we're all using fine.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
That wasn't the initial.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.400
Well, let us say that...

59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.400
Let us say that...

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:07.400
Specifically just for reproductive purposes, there is no need for love.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:12.400
You can have sex and have kids without having love for the person with whom you had sex.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.400
So love in that way, that's why I look...

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.400
We're shut down.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
So is that my...

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.400
Is that my...

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Nothing's working.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
We're all going to have to speak louder.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
Just imagine.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400
Oh, no, here it goes.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Here it goes.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400
It's back on.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.400
Are we back?

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400
Yes, we're back.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400
It's like a Super Bowl.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400
You know, it's just a soul.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
The lights are off.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.400
That's why I think that...

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400
There you go.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:49.400
That's why I think that it becomes a kind of just turning around and around because we don't start with proper definitions of the term.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:01:02.400
And there are so many varieties of it, and it's not even clear what we mean when we talk about love, that it has the kind of correlation that you talk about.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:11.400
For example, you gave that when somebody is in love sees the face of the beloved, the amygdala coitons them.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.400
If he sees the face of a familiar person where there is no danger, the amygdala would quieten them.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.400
Oh, no, the experiment was comparing those two.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400
But it does quieten it then.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:31.400
So we need to be more, I think, precise in terms of defining it, especially from the neuroscience point of view.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.400
Because neuroscience is what's going to enlighten us about some of the biological aspects of this.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.400
But of course, we don't only have to deal with neuroscience.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.400
It's an event that happens in life, and we need to see what is it about?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.400
But maybe it's the adjectives that help us.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400
I mean, we are a little bit fixed, right?

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.400
We have been a little fixed so far in this romantic love.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:03.400
And actually, I'd be very interested to know whether anyone in your field is doing the same kind of work on parents looking at children.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:10.400
And that's also survival, that's also building attachment and so on.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:20.400
And what would differentiate neurologically, what would differentiate that from a romantic impulse?

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:30.400
Quite specifically, it's interesting that oxytocin, for example, which is also called milk let down factor.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.400
It's very important at childbirth.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:47.400
Oxytocin appears to play a big role in the brain to mediate these attachment feelings and behaviors that we engage in as parents.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.400
And also later in the relationship with a partner, I'll call it.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:01.400
Yes, people are investigating this, and it's different from romance.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:13.400
It's using different brain systems and mainly different neurotransmitters or chemicals or hormones to have different things involved.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:25.400
So, and to go along with that when you were speaking about the group in China and going back four years later and seeing how they had progressed, let's say.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:32.400
So then by then, that extreme romantic love was probably pretty much played out for most of them.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.400
So then either they had split off from each other or they had built some other kind of attachment.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400
So, what did that look like?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.400
I'm not so much talking about the splitting off.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:51.400
Those people probably were ready for new romantic love, but the people who were attached but not so energized anymore.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:59.400
So that too, the attachment seems to be, it's a little more complicated in the brain.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400
It's higher up in the brain.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.400
It's not so much the reflex level.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:10.400
But it's still part of the reward system, by the way.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:17.400
But it's part of the reward system that's getting much more information from cognitive areas, these frontal areas of the brain.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:24.400
The attachment system is much more dependent upon probably your experiences with that person.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:32.400
You're not just memories about perhaps primary caregivers, but memories about with that person, what you've done,

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:40.400
your evaluation of them, you're constantly, it turns out, we're constantly making evaluations about the situations

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:48.400
we're in, and the people who we're looking at, and what we might get from it actually.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:05:02.400
But this whole idea that attachment is quite different, more cognitively based, certainly more complex.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:09.400
So does this satisfy you if you put different adjectives in front of the word love, then you have...

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.400
It depends at what level of discourse you are talking about.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:23.400
If you are talking about poetry and you want to use love to communicate something that appeals to you,

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.400
feels that you're expressing something and communicating that appeals to the other,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.400
then it doesn't matter exactly what the definition of love is.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:40.400
When you move gradually towards psychoanalysis for that matter and towards neuroscience,

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:47.400
where you're talking about the workings of the mind and the brain, then the ways you distinguish them

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.400
and you define them become very, very important.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:57.400
For example, his maternal love, the same as romantic love.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:04.400
So it becomes increasingly more important depending on where you are.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.400
So that's all I'm trying to say, that we need to be...

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400
No, I don't need to say no matter what.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.400
No matter which way we look at it, it's multi-factorial.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:24.400
So anyone can study a level and get clarity with it, but you can only measure one level at a time.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:29.400
And then there are other levels that you can't study at the same time that you're studying one level.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:36.400
I would bring in here from a scientific point of view that we live in a world of scientific uncertainty.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.400
We cannot know the truth about everything through science.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.400
And I doubt that when Obama's plan for 10 years of mapping the brain,

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:52.400
that we're going to know very much more than we know Shakespeare or some poet can tell us about love.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:07:00.400
So let me tell you, I have a colleague named Simmer Zeki who was one of the other very first people to study

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.400
romantic love and the brain systems of romantic love.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:13.400
And as he says, it's poetry and literature from the past that really help neuroscience inform neuroscience

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:19.400
about love and kind of... and how to interpret what we see.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:30.400
Remember, a neuroscientist really thinks that all of our behavior is based in a brain system, right?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.400
And that it's all of behavior is physiological, some level, all right?

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:46.400
So literature is just a... and poetry is really... is just a reflection of what's going on in our brains.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.400
But I had to, because poetry has been mentioned like 20 times in the last 10 minutes, I just have to ask.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:57.400
If that's true, what everybody's saying about poetry, why do so few people read it?

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:03.400
It's an interesting question. It makes up that people write it generally.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.400
That's only a very recent development.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.400
By the way, I think a red poet, a tree at home in the Renaissance.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:17.400
And all the way through to Virginia Woolf's family where they all read poetry sitting around at home at night.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.400
I think it... and I happen to be married to someone who's Russian.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.400
And they read poetry to each other when he was growing up, so well into the 1970s.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400
And it's definitely an American.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.400
But what would you say about all the popular songs that all the kids are listening to?

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:36.400
I think they're all about the fact that if you don't have a partner, you're nothing.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400
No, but...

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:43.400
I think... is it... I mean, the Supremes say, you know, whenever you're near me, I hear a symphony.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.400
Is that poetry to you?

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.400
No, it's a song lyric. That's not a bad song lyric.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.400
It's a pretty good song lyric.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.400
But is it anywhere close to poetry? I think more people are...

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.400
Why is a song not a poem? Because it's a song.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400
But a poem is a song as well.

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.400
I could sing your poem and have a guitar or whatever.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.400
It could always be a song.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.400
I could sing this. No, everyone would leave, but I mean, I could sing this.

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.400
And it's, you know, I don't know if there is that, but you know, it's rhyming, it's fine.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.400
Very short phrases, pippies.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.400
Yeah, but I think song lyrics get... I think songs are like sorry, not a poem.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.400
Yeah, I think it's more of a hurry than even a poem is.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.400
And they generally, I mean, forgive me for saying this, but most of the popular songs are right.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.400
It's so important to really roll lyrics if no one longer with us.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.400
There are a lot of great lyricists in the world. And let's face it.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:46.400
Right, it is different, but there may be some... I'm just trying to think... I'm not sure we're not...

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:54.400
There aren't as many people maybe reading poetry now, but I think there's some poetry in people's lives in music lyrics, for example.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.400
Absolutely. I'm not saying that. I mean, God forbid.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.400
But wives are empty. But I also think it's an American phenomenon.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:09.400
And if you go to other countries in the world, you will find that poetry is very valuable.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:15.400
People will stand online in front of a bookstore in Russia when a new book of poems comes out.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.400
They need it as they need bread, but not in this country.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:23.400
And the reason not in this country is because people don't want to deal with their feelings most of the time.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.400
People don't want to deal with it.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400
And poetry is about...

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.400
They don't want to face what they're feeling.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.400
That's why... Look at this. That's technology.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.400
Well, it also just stands down to people who don't get it.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400
They actually go to Fred.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.400
Yeah, I think they don't get it.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.400
You don't understand poetry.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.400
Since there's been a period of time.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400
You stand in the middle reading.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.400
All you have to do is read it. And you understand it.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400
Well, you don't understand astrophysics.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400
It's going to be a plea. A plea here.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.400
It's going to be a plea here.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.400
It's going to be a plea here.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.400
You know?

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.400
Like go to Dr. Ruth. It's going to be a plea to go to Fred.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.400
Well, first of all, I want to say about the audience that you've been...

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.400
I'd like to say about the audience.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.400
That the audience has been extraordinarily patient and...

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:08.400
And hopefully absorbed in the noise that's been going on here at the rat table.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.400
But we do like to hear from the audience.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.400
And so I thought maybe we'd have a few questions for 15 minutes or so.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.400
And then maybe we could have a chance to respond.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.400
You have to go to the mic when you have questions.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.400
Hi.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.400
I was very...

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.400
I've taken Dr. Brown with your description of love.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.400
And to me, it sounds like a very addictive thing.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.400
Yeah?

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:43.400
And so I was wondering if you could talk about that and whether any research is being done

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.400
between romantic love and addiction.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:50.400
Because it sounds like it hits the same brain areas that addictive substances hit.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.400
So, indeed, thank you for bringing that up.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400
She's a plant.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.400
She's a plant.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.400
She's a plant.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:01.400
Because when we first started doing these studies,

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
that was one of the things I was interested in,

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.400
because I thought there were commonalities.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.400
And I predicted brain areas would be involved.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.400
We knew we were involved in addiction.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.400
So, of course, because of the clinical relevance,

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.400
the drug addiction studies were done first.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:24.400
But it wasn't quite the same, but it was very similar.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:30.400
So, there's ventral tegmental area that I've told you about that's so critical to romance

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:38.400
and is really the drive and reward system is also active when cocaine abusers are given cocaine

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400
and they feel high.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.400
Now, when you're heartbroken, think about it.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.400
Even when you're heartbroken, you can be even more obsessed about the person,

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.400
and even more in a way addicted to the person,

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:55.400
and you must be near them and you're constantly seeking them.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:02.400
And that's, it was under the condition of heartbreak that we saw that the drug addiction systems

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400
really become involved.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.400
So, what actually I was asked to go and speak at the National Institute for Drug Abuse,

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.400
one of the things we really came up with is we were a kind of round table like this,

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.400
was that the systems for romance may be the natural,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:27.400
it's the natural system that the drugs hop onto, you know, and activate really strongly.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:34.400
But the reason we're, we get addicted to drugs at all is because we have these natural systems for addiction.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.400
That's the system that's being used when you abuse drugs.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.400
We need that system there, we need to be addicted to some things,

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.400
we need to be addicted to other people for protection.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.400
We need these attachments there.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.400
So is Casanova syndrome a true addiction?

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.400
Ah, so, and so you mean by Casanova?

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400
Yeah.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.400
Pardon?

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:13.400
Yes, you know, Don Juan Casanova syndrome is a true addiction.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:19.400
Then the Casanova syndrome where you have where the person goes from one person to another to another to another.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.400
Always falling in love, always falling in love.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.400
Spitzer, and then immediately moving on.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:32.400
Yeah, well, in a way, yes, it's a little like cocaine, they're constantly getting the dopamine rush.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:37.400
But that's different in a way, I think, from that other question that she has.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.400
You can be addicted to love, so you want to constantly go back and get, you know, fall in love again.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:50.400
But what I'm saying is that the, that system for most of us is there for a very good reason.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:59.400
And the natural system is, we are naturally addicted to each other, which is nice.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:06.400
So we keep seeking, we keep, we keep going on these dates and keep going online to try to find someone.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.400
And eventually people do.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.400
Heartbreak is there for sure, but that addiction is...

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400
Well, there's a lot of merry-go-round too, and online data.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.400
I mean, you mean a lot of people who they found a good person, they can't seem to make it work.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:26.400
And one of the reasons I think it's, is it's become easier to not make it work.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.400
Right, and you know what... Because of this new expanded pool and all the technology we have to meet...

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:37.400
And I think it's more and more important for people to understand who, that it's so much who you are.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:43.400
If you are the kind of person who can suppress a negative judgment and put the other person first,

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.400
you're much more likely to make a relationship work.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:52.400
We're going to have to try to keep these questions shorter and the answers shorter.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400
Yes.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.400
Hello, one player's drive further.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400
Do you love the...

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
A class drive further?

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.400
I'm a psychoanalyst and a family and couple therapist.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:07.400
So I'm just wondering if other people in the room, and I know Fred's worked very well and really respected

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.400
and used in my teaching for many years.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.400
And what I'm thinking of is you have more in common than is led to believe.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:22.400
One of the thoughts I have is the biological model is very Freudian,

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:31.400
and you do bring in the unconscious libido love, and then there's a fabric and a social drive.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.400
And here, and I Fred brings in developmental and it works together.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.400
Now, when you're talking about the capacity to fall in love,

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:46.400
there's one thing in the capacity to stay in love and maintain love is something else.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:53.400
And it's a very important paper also by Otto Kerber who does the range and Fred is sort of alluding to that.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.400
And it's really important.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:17:03.400
Now, when you have attachment and it is disruptive and insecure and all the stuff that we're all aware of

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:08.400
with Dan Stern and Beatrice Bebe and a lot of work that's being done,

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:14.400
what you do find is that the infant who has wired up, and this is the research,

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:22.400
and it's wired up so that the attachment is loaded, if you will, with strife or whatever,

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.400
and comes out developmentally, and affect, and cognition as you get older and repetition.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.400
And so we can really hear, if you want to pull it together in some way,

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.400
that it can be a tension between these two spheres, but you can bring it together.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.400
So you're wired up, it makes it hard later to let yourself have,

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.400
or that you could have if things had been different.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:50.400
And I think biologically we are wired or set up to connect,

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:57.400
whether it's in the social fabric kind of way, or it's in the, if you will, sexual area, a little bit,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.400
and the species going on, it all works together.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.400
And I think this is room then for an integration from what we're listening to.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400
Thank you.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Next question. Lady here is in line.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:25.400
Very short comment, and I have a very short comment in the defense of sciences.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.400
I myself, the researcher in music cognition and professional pianist,

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:38.400
there is a beautiful line by Pushkin about music that among the pleasures of life,

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:45.400
music differs only to love, and music is a melody, but love itself is a melody.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.400
They are dealing with two very different fields,

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.400
while art and music gives us knowledge in highly condensed form.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.400
Science is moved by very short, but very small steps toward knowledge,

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:07.400
and learning about the intimate things that are learning about ourselves.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.400
It's a difficult pursuit, and in order to understand the complexity,

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.400
we really have to be very intuitive.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:22.400
So I don't see any conflict in studying very complex things in sciences.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:26.400
And just because the sphere of love and sphere of music,

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.400
they both suffer from this attitude that we cannot explain everything about love,

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.400
everything about music, but it's not what we expect from sciences today.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.400
We expect learning by small steps about who we are.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.400
Thank you.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.400
Thank you.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:51.400
Could I, that was very lovely, but if I could also say something about music,

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.400
actually one of the things that we haven't really gone into,

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.400
which would be a very interesting further discussion here,

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:05.400
is how the senses really play into the initiation of love,

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:10.400
and in the Renaissance, it was strongly believed that there were two senses

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:16.400
that led most directly to the sensation of love, vision,

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:23.400
and hearing through music, that music was the accompaniment of love,

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.400
and this is why you have so many pictures in which there is a loop player

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.400
playing to Venus and so on, that those two senses were the things

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.400
that were most closely connected to the feelings of love.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.400
This lady and then this gentleman, she was waiting.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400
Sorry.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:53.400
I think this has been a wonderful discussion that could go on for hours

01:20:53.400 --> 01:21:01.400
and hours and hours, having spent 43 years as a relationship

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.400
and couples' experiments.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.400
I really, and I'm sure you know as well as I do,

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:17.400
that the brain changes with trauma, and that's what the speaker before said,

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:25.400
and that what most people have some form of trauma, which to me

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.400
makes me wonder why they didn't want marriage and that thing,

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:35.400
because there's so much trauma and fear of attachment out here,

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.400
especially in New York City.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:48.400
And you talked about love being a fear, and you answered it so beautifully

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:56.400
by saying, if you grow up in a touch with fear, your love is going to be fear.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.400
There is some standing here to say something,

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:05.400
as I'm starting with the 20-year-old's in our society,

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:13.400
that I think we need to know more how we were imprinted as children.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:18.400
When I was at the World Economic Forum and ran workshops,

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:27.400
everybody had to answer the question, what did I learn about relationships

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:37.400
by watching my parents, and that somehow is the answer to how do I attach,

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.400
which I think is the same as love.

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.400
I have a couple where he is an antique dealer,

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:52.400
and his wife says he loves this and takes much more than he loves her.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.400
So I don't know what that means.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:02.400
I think this is an important discussion, but I think we all.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:10.400
I should be able to ask which one of you, everyone in the room here.

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.400
How were you imprinted with love?

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:20.400
Do you reach for somebody that you can never have?

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.400
And then when the extra day turned around, you dropped them,

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:29.400
because the intimacy becomes too much.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:35.400
Are you somebody who likes to be invaded and abused?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.400
Are you somebody who imbues somebody?

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.400
That is the love imprint that we all have,

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.400
and we should know about and be more conscious of.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.400
Thank you.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.400
You know, I just want to say that I think one thing that's very important

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.400
is that we all have different attachment styles, really, too.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:06.400
And different personalities that are biologically based also,

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.400
even genetically, and I think especially for the younger generation

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.400
coming up and dealing with these kinds of dating situations,

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.400
I think self-knowledge becomes even more important

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.400
and knowing your attachment style, whether you're an avoidant or an anxious attachment.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.400
I mean, I think I do agree that a lot of the answer to that is exactly what you said,

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.400
which is to look backward at the experience, and maybe, you know,

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.400
the biology may have less to do with it than you think.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.400
Okay.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:44.400
Probably not surprising that in this crowd, I'm another psychoanalyst

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:50.400
and a couple's therapist more years than I care to count.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.400
I agree that we need definitions.

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.400
I hope what I'm saying is in no way against defining,

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.400
but I think that it's a problem if when we ask what is love

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:12.400
that we treat that as a noun and look for some kind of separate definition

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.400
with a frame or an edge around it, it seems to me that love is a process

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.400
and it keeps changing even between the same two people.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.400
And it's a developmental process, what's more,

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.400
and it goes through a lot of stages that may begin with infatuation

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:37.400
or some kind of erotic chemical response, may begin with an awful lot of projection.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.400
I think that's always there.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.400
And then may head into romantic emotional union,

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.400
and people might live together, try to make an everyday life together through that.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:57.400
And then there's a developmental stage that I think is as important as any other,

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.400
and I would call it disappointment, because there's a fall into disappointment

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.400
with a couple just as there is a falling into love.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:13.400
And when you get to disappointment, that's a very, very important kind of choice point,

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.400
because how people treat their disappointment is going to tell everything

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:23.400
about whether they might grow together into a more mature kind of loving

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.400
or wind up partying into self-preservation

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:31.400
and a change from abundance into scarcity

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.400
and a sort of Darwinian struggle for control of the relationship

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.400
and whose needs get met.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.400
And it goes from there.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.400
So I think, and as Walter Benjamin once said,

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:48.400
the important thing is not love at first sight, it's love at last sight.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:55.400
And that's that stage of growing old together and facing each other's mortality.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:27:02.400
So it's a long developmental process, and I think we have to be very careful not to be reductionist

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.400
and say love is a this or that.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.400
Thank you.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:07.400
Thank you.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.400
That's true.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:18.400
Hi, my name is Maxine Safeman, and I was married to a member of this society,

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:24.400
Israel Safeman, who died 27 years ago, and I'm also a psychoanalyst

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.400
at the New York Freudian that's become contemporary psychoanalytic.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:35.400
I wanted to say very much what the last person had said,

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.400
because I was lucky enough to find a soulmate,

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:46.400
and no one has talked about a soulmate or kindred spirit.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:53.400
And I found him because when I was 15 years old,

01:27:53.400 --> 01:28:01.400
because he was in total contrast to my parents' marriage,

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:09.400
my parents had a very conflicted, angry, my mother hated the marriage,

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.400
was very depressed, constantly was running away.

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:27.400
And I found someone who had strength of character, who was totally capable of being there,

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:31.400
and I knew this exactly when I was 15 years old,

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:39.400
because when I was five years old, I very clearly understood what a terrible marriage was,

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.400
but they couldn't resolve seemed to be so simple,

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:47.400
and they weren't unable to resolve the conflicts.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:53.400
So I found someone who was that soulmate,

01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:01.400
and it is really to have that kind of lasting love there.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.400
I used to get five calls a day saying, I love you, Mackie,

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.400
which is pretty lovely.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.400
You can have that kind of luck.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:20.400
I think it is luck also to find someone who has those kinds of characteristics.

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:25.400
I mean, and able to be there in a total way,

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:32.400
trustworthy, with the caring about society,

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.400
the other oriented, all those kinds of good qualities.

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.400
So in some ways it is a matter of luck.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.400
I've never found anyone else.

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.400
It's looking.

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:52.400
There are other questions.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400
There are other questions.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.400
Are there any more questions before we close?

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:02.400
It was hard after the last testimony.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.400
I'm not doing a testimony.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:07.400
I'm a psychiatrist too, of course.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.400
I have a lot of patients who have a rhodomania,

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.400
which we didn't touch upon today,

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.400
but a rhodomania is when a patient falls in love with someone,

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.400
usually have a higher social status,

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.400
and they follow them around, stalking behavior.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.400
So Dr. Brown, you should study these people because they're full of, I think,

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400
dopamine and different kinds of chemicals.

01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:30.400
Exactly. It's these systems on, you know,

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400
it's overdrive.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400
Overdrive, exactly.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.400
So they might be good for your studies, so I just thought I'd add that.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.400
This lady of children in the restaurant,

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:26.400
and she had to be

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:48.400
topic was love, the interrogation of love.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.400
Like correct? Is that the topic?

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.400
Yes.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.400
Well, I started to think about it.

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:57.400
You mentioned music. What is this thing called love?

01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.400
You mentioned all the other emotions,

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.400
whether it's kindness, whether it's horny, whether it's whatever.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:09.400
We have, I'm in the mood for love. What does that mean?

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.400
We have the libestone.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.400
You know what that does.

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.400
So we're always thinking about love.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.400
It's a force. It's an energy.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.400
It's something that's invisible.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:24.400
And you never know what's going to happen.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.400
I do believe luck.

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400
It plays a part.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:38.400
But I think we need to think about where we are today in this culture.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:41.400
Unrealistic expectations,

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:47.400
because the media is killing us with all this crotch stuff and everything else.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:55.400
I beg to do with my friend over here who thinks that only in Europe or Russia or in France,

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.400
they understand anything about love and read.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.400
In my profession, I get calls all the time saying,

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.400
don't tell me about this utopian. I don't want to hear about series.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.400
Just give me a great love story.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.400
When you get back to me with a great love story, we'll talk.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:16.400
Everybody's still looking for a great love story.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.400
We don't have a Shakespeare right now.

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400
We don't have any good love stories.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400
No, I'm not talking about sonnets.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.400
I'm talking about wonderful expressions of love.

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.400
The poets today are reflecting our society.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.400
We have a society that is not dealing with love.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.400
It's dealing with terror.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:41.400
It's dealing with sexual annihilation of women.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.400
We're dealing with trafficking.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:48.400
We're talking about the beauty and the museums of Ruben's women and gorgeous men

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.400
and the Adonis and David.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.400
We're talking about slaying, killing.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:59.400
It's very hard to take this beautiful force that's still around us and

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:03.400
grad and see each other and look at each other.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:07.400
I would like somebody to talk about the force of love.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.400
Would you be the example?

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400
You be the example.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
No, I don't.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400
We have to be the example.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:15.400
It's universal.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.400
People read about it, but we have illiterate people.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.400
What are we going to do about that?

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.400
We still have...

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:30.400
We should look back to Cupid because, though, we have made Cupid a sort of silly figure.

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:38.400
Cupid, of course, in mythology is an unbelievably powerful figure who shoots his arrows.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.400
You don't know where they're going to go.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.400
You don't know who they're going to hit.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.400
Once he hit his own mother, Venus, and she fell in love with the mortal Adonis,

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:56.400
whom she could not save, that that force, which until recently was seen,

01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:01.400
indeed, as something so overwhelming that could strike at any time,

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.400
at any person in a way that could not be controlled,

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.400
is something that we should all be thinking about, the power of it,

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.400
the way that it can turn our lives upside down,

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:17.400
the way that it can turn for good or for bad.

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.400
I mean, it is there.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:27.400
And we need to maybe help our children both get the very positive aspects of that

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.400
and also realize the importance of it.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:05.400
I think I'd

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:32.400
I'd like to do that.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.400
I think that's very, very important.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.400
All right.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.400
Well, that's I think as somebody said, we could go on for a few more hours.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:47.400
But my cup goes on.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.400
And thank you very much for your participation.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:51.400
Thank you.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.400
Thank you.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:59.400
Thank you.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:04.400
Still not like hands but it's real.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:07.400
See.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.400
That was a young buck.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:13.400
Because I've been following.

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.400
And you.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.400
You want me to try it?

01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:21.400
Yeah.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.400
I chose the office.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.400
I'm not going to do that.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.400
But then I just don't want to talk about solely.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.400
We may have to get some.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.400
It isn't just the attraction.

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:58.400
Yeah.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:16.400
I'm not going to do that.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:37.400
I'm not going to do that.

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:58.400
I'm not going to do that.

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:25.400
I'm not going to do that.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:34.400
I'm not going to do that.
