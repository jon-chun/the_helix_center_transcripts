00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:15.920 --> 00:24.160
Welcome to the fall 2019 inauguration of the Hillock Center.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.520
I'm glad everyone could be here on such a beautiful day.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.520
My name is Jerry Herowitz.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.400
I'm the associate director at the Hillock Center.

00:32.400 --> 00:38.280
And today we have a roundtable on the topic of lying.

00:38.280 --> 00:44.520
Before I commence, I want to mention that on October 5th, our second roundtable is on

00:44.520 --> 00:48.520
the mechanization of mathematics.

00:48.520 --> 00:53.640
So let me go on and introduce our esteemed panelists today.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.800
First of all, unfortunately, Patricia Churchland, who was scheduled to be on our panel, fell

00:58.800 --> 01:01.480
ill and was unable to make it today.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.920
But we do have a fill-in, Martin Garbus.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.200
If you would raise your hand so we know who you are, is here.

01:08.200 --> 01:14.920
He's an attorney and has taught it several prestigious law schools in the U.S.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.880
Dr. Anna Ballis, if you'd raise your hand, is associate professor of clinical psychiatry

01:19.880 --> 01:25.600
at Waukornell Medical College and training and supervising analyst at the New York Psychoanalytic

01:25.600 --> 01:27.400
Institute.

01:27.400 --> 01:34.000
She's been in private adult and child psychiatric practice in Manhattan over 35 years and is

01:34.000 --> 01:38.400
a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association.

01:38.400 --> 01:45.800
Neil Garrett is a Henry Welcome Research Fellow in cognitive neuroscience at Oxford University.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.520
His research centers around aversive behavior and learning.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.640
As part of this, he has led a new line of inquiry, examining the role of emotional adaptation

01:54.640 --> 01:56.920
in decision-making.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.640
And I think he's going to tell us more about that today.

02:00.640 --> 02:07.600
Emma Edelman-Lavine is an assistant professor of behavioral science and the Charles Merrill

02:07.600 --> 02:12.560
Faculty Scholar at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.880
She was recently recognized as a rising star of the Association of Psychological Science

02:16.880 --> 02:19.240
in 2019.

02:19.240 --> 02:26.360
Emma studies the psychology of altruism, trust, and ethical dilemmas.

02:26.360 --> 02:33.920
Dr. Francis X. Shen is the executive director of the Harvard Mass General Hospital Center

02:33.920 --> 02:39.520
for Law, Brain, and Behavior and Instruction Psychology at Harvard Medical School, senior

02:39.520 --> 02:44.640
fellow in law and applied neuroscience at the Harvard Law School, Petrie Flom Center, and

02:44.640 --> 02:51.400
an associate professor of law, McKnight Presidential Fellow and faculty member in a graduate program

02:51.400 --> 02:57.760
on neuroscience at the University of Minnesota.

02:57.760 --> 03:03.120
Jonathan Stray is a computational journalist at Columbia University where he teaches the

03:03.120 --> 03:09.040
dual master's degree in computer science and journalism and leads the development of

03:09.040 --> 03:13.000
workbench, an integrated tool for data journalism.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.200
He's contributed to the New York Times, the Atlantic Wired, foreign policy, and pro-public

03:20.200 --> 03:21.840
hub.

03:21.840 --> 03:29.800
And sitting on the panels well to help moderate is our executive director Ed Narsesian.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.920
So thanks very much.

03:33.920 --> 03:43.320
Okay, well I was thinking just to get the ball rolling about and not to have this start

03:43.320 --> 03:46.640
out necessarily on a political line.

03:46.640 --> 03:53.080
Although I'm sure that's on several of the minds of our audience today.

03:53.080 --> 04:00.520
That part of our founding mythology includes, of course, the truth-telling traits of George

04:00.520 --> 04:07.240
Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and both known for their honesty, of course.

04:07.240 --> 04:13.640
And that also brought me, brought back to my attention, a wonderfully humorous television

04:13.640 --> 04:19.840
commercial, some years ago where Honest Abe was sitting in his bedroom and married Todd

04:19.840 --> 04:22.280
Lincoln portrayed in a commercial.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.880
I don't know what she really looked like as being a little portly was getting dressed

04:26.880 --> 04:28.800
in a dress.

04:28.800 --> 04:33.920
And she turns to Abe and she says, do I look fat?

04:33.920 --> 04:36.440
And Abe turns looks at the camera like OA-Vay.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.920
What am I going to say?

04:39.920 --> 04:45.520
So of course, lying is something even for George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, everyone has

04:45.520 --> 04:47.480
engaged in at some point.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.720
So I guess the question is why is lying a problem or when does lying become a problem?

04:52.720 --> 04:56.160
So I'd like anyone to sort of jump in.

04:56.160 --> 05:04.720
I can think about your example a little bit, not going to quite answer your question.

05:04.720 --> 05:09.640
And instead, think about when lying isn't a problem, but maybe that creates the blurred

05:09.640 --> 05:13.120
line of kind of when it's not a problem and when it is.

05:13.120 --> 05:18.800
So if you ask most people, like, what should a person say when someone who can't change

05:18.800 --> 05:21.600
us how they look in the dress, they'll say, you should lie.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.200
The right thing to do is to lie.

05:23.200 --> 05:28.520
And if you ask people, would you want it to be lied to if you couldn't change if there

05:28.520 --> 05:30.120
was no time to institute feedback?

05:30.120 --> 05:32.080
They'd say, yes, I want to be lied to.

05:32.080 --> 05:37.040
And so we actually have all these implicit rules that we think a lot of lies are ethical.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.640
A lot of lies can build trust.

05:38.640 --> 05:43.920
A lot of lies we seek ourselves at the end of the life when we're vulnerable, when we

05:43.920 --> 05:45.680
can't institute change.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.720
And so there is this whole category of lies that most people agree are good.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.200
And then I think maybe other people can talk to this more, right?

05:53.200 --> 05:56.880
That blurs the line of then, well, when, right, when, how do we figure out when it's

05:56.880 --> 05:58.880
no longer good?

05:58.880 --> 06:04.520
I'll take a shot at this.

06:04.520 --> 06:11.640
So a framework that I sometimes use is to think of communication as persuasion, right?

06:11.640 --> 06:15.160
And so we have this idea in an democracy with a free press.

06:15.160 --> 06:18.280
We should be able to persuade each other that we're right.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.480
But we also have these ideas about what types of persuasion are legitimate.

06:22.480 --> 06:29.920
So if you look at advertising, if you look at politics, all of these different fields

06:29.920 --> 06:33.560
have sort of developed norms and sometimes laws.

06:33.560 --> 06:38.360
So for example, you can't pretend to be someone else, right?

06:38.360 --> 06:46.320
If you publish the same message and pretend to be a political candidate falsely, if that

06:46.320 --> 06:49.960
candidate had said it, it might have been perfectly fine.

06:49.960 --> 06:55.400
It's generally found upon to try to use psychological manipulation of various sorts, right?

06:55.400 --> 07:00.280
So if you know something about the psychology of the person you're trying to persuade, that

07:00.280 --> 07:05.160
they're perhaps not aware of, then that's considered illegitimate.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.520
And so there are all these categories beyond simply speaking an untruth.

07:10.520 --> 07:18.640
And many of them are fairly well developed and consistent across a lot of fields.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.640
Yeah.

07:19.640 --> 07:27.840
I just want to link to something that Emmett said there, which I'm Jonathan as well, to

07:27.840 --> 07:28.840
extend.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.680
You know, lying, there's just so many different types of them.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.520
And how we categorize them, I think to some extent gets to this question of, you know,

07:35.520 --> 07:40.360
who are the beneficiaries of the lie and who are the ones that are harmed?

07:40.360 --> 07:42.040
So like, Emmett's totally right.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.840
Like when kids start to lie, we often, some extent, think that's a good thing in certain

07:45.840 --> 07:46.840
circumstances.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.280
Like if they're given the present, that's terrible.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.640
We want them to say, wow, thank you.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.400
What a fantastic present that was, you know.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.760
So that's the context where we think lying is a good thing.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.960
But then there are other lies which are actually legal.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.760
Like if I go in somewhere and pretend I'm a police officer, if I lie under oath, that's

08:00.760 --> 08:05.760
a very clear signal of society that that is not okay because they have a law against

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
them.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.240
I think the reason for that is because, you know, people are harmed by that.

08:08.240 --> 08:13.040
You can potentially frame an innocent man and it has all these consequences.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.200
Whereas in the present example, it's actually benefiting most people from the lie.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.960
So, you know, in theory, you could take each lie on a sort of case by case, a sort of utilitarian

08:21.960 --> 08:26.520
perspective and say, you know, who is getting harmed, who is benefiting from this lie, and

08:26.520 --> 08:30.080
use that as a sort of measure of whether it's a good or a bad thing.

08:30.080 --> 08:38.840
I'm a lawyer and I deal with the creation of lies, honest people tell honest stories

08:38.840 --> 08:45.960
that I made up to achieve a certain social justice end that I perceive.

08:45.960 --> 08:53.200
And if faced with the issue of whether there should be a truthful answer or an answer that

08:53.200 --> 09:01.400
pursues my concept of justice, the decision from the easy one, and if you are part of

09:01.400 --> 09:11.680
a system of law, which is a system of lying, and you seek to achieve a certain goal, you

09:11.680 --> 09:19.440
first have to accept that that structure of that system, and then you decide what to do.

09:19.440 --> 09:28.080
I just spent some time down on the border where immigrants were trying to get into the United

09:28.080 --> 09:38.520
States through the Trump regime, and they will ask questions and the whole question of truth

09:38.520 --> 09:43.640
and how they answered them became very significant.

09:43.640 --> 09:50.560
Their lack of awareness of truths, for example, if they had been raped a year ago, then the

09:50.560 --> 09:57.640
government concluded they were damaged then and should not have waited a year to come

09:57.640 --> 09:59.600
into the United States.

09:59.600 --> 10:05.440
If you looked at the damage, you could say the damage was there a week ago.

10:05.440 --> 10:11.800
So then if you're faced with a witness like that, who's going to go before a judge, you

10:11.800 --> 10:17.920
have to decide or somebody has to decide, or there has to be some input as to what that

10:17.920 --> 10:19.920
witness's answer is.

10:19.920 --> 10:25.320
The truth a year ago or the truth, the damage is there today.

10:25.320 --> 10:42.880
There are very helpful if you would speak not to reach other, but speak to the person

10:42.880 --> 10:45.840
who has farthest away from you in this room.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.180
It is very difficult to understand people that you reject.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.140
I'll do my best.

10:50.140 --> 10:54.960
Several of the answers have suggested that there are certain times that it's a problem

10:54.960 --> 10:57.600
because the law says it's a problem to lie.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.040
But if you take a step back, you have to ask yourself why has the law determined that certain

11:03.040 --> 11:08.040
instances is problematic to be deceptive or to not tell the truth?

11:08.040 --> 11:12.280
And other times we allow it whether in the name of national security or in the name of

11:12.280 --> 11:14.400
justice or in the name of something else.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.280
So that's one challenge.

11:16.280 --> 11:20.560
The original question was when is it a problem to lie, setting aside that bigger question

11:20.560 --> 11:25.280
which maybe we'll get to, it is the case that I'm coming from the law.

11:25.280 --> 11:32.200
If Honest Abe had to answer that question under oath, he can say OIV, but he has a duty to

11:32.200 --> 11:37.040
do a certain thing, whereas he may strategically decide, I don't want to tell you the truth.

11:37.040 --> 11:45.440
So once inside a courtroom or inside generally legal proceedings, there are some added complexities

11:45.440 --> 11:50.360
that we have sort of socially determined should be there for one reason or another.

11:50.360 --> 11:54.200
And we even use the word fact finder for a judge or a jury.

11:54.200 --> 11:58.480
And if for instance they have to figure out whether or not Mary Todd Lincoln was obese

11:58.480 --> 12:02.480
or not, they want to know all the information that they can.

12:02.480 --> 12:09.240
And they rely on witnesses hopefully being at least a purporting to be honest.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.400
Well it's interesting just to quickly jump back on the issue of him.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.360
Abe having to answer that question under oath, of course there's another wrinkle to it which

12:17.360 --> 12:21.080
is he's the only one who knows whether she looked fat.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.920
So even under oath he might be able to, it's just another wrinkle.

12:25.920 --> 12:30.280
I mean you're right to point out that under oath people are seen to be compelled to say

12:30.280 --> 12:35.360
the truth more, but in certain instances like this one where it's a piece of private information

12:35.360 --> 12:40.880
that is not shared with anyone, in this case whether or not she looked fat to him, he could

12:40.880 --> 12:42.960
continue to lie even under oath.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.760
So that's another wrinkle to the whole issue of lying.

12:45.760 --> 12:51.800
Or he could love her so much to him she didn't look fat.

12:51.800 --> 13:04.160
So we as analysts are concerned with the subjectivity of people's perception and also when are

13:04.160 --> 13:07.520
they lying to themselves?

13:07.520 --> 13:13.520
When are they lying to others?

13:13.520 --> 13:20.680
Also with children what do we teach them and how do they learn to be truthful?

13:20.680 --> 13:22.000
That's a whole other dimension.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.560
We're very interested in both people's motivation for being truthful or lying and also how that

13:28.560 --> 13:33.520
develops as they grow up.

13:33.520 --> 13:40.800
So for instance when you ask that question about honest state it made me think about

13:40.800 --> 13:46.680
the Hans Christian Andersen tale of the Emperor's new clothes where everybody said, oh these

13:46.680 --> 13:51.720
clothes are absolutely magnificent and it was a little child who said, but he's naked.

13:51.720 --> 13:59.200
So the little child hadn't yet learned to be an obsequious courtier and in that sense

13:59.200 --> 14:02.520
he was truthful.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.920
So that's a very interesting story about what we teach our little children and how do they

14:06.920 --> 14:11.680
grow up to be truthful or liars.

14:11.680 --> 14:21.360
And also how do they grow up to be tactful versus ruthlessly brutal in their statements

14:21.360 --> 14:26.440
and there's a lot to be thought about on that.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.640
One thing I think is confusing for children is one of the things we tell them is if you

14:30.640 --> 14:34.440
don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.080
And there's this kind of comfort I think in the law too with this distinction between

14:38.080 --> 14:39.600
omission and co-mission.

14:39.600 --> 14:44.280
We can all go around not saying anything, not saying anything to my wife, changing the

14:44.280 --> 14:46.680
subject, saying something, your eyes are beautiful.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.680
I've never seen you look happier.

14:48.680 --> 14:55.480
We can create these statements that are technically true or technically non-lies that still allow

14:55.480 --> 15:02.160
a person to be deceived and that's what makes it easier for us to justify deception and

15:02.160 --> 15:06.520
gauge in deception without feeling too guilty.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.320
But something interesting that I've found is that targets of deception are really not

15:10.320 --> 15:12.080
sensitive to these differences.

15:12.080 --> 15:18.200
So I go through great mental gymnastics to figure out how do I deceive this person without

15:18.200 --> 15:21.920
explicitly lying because somehow I know lying is bad.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.800
But even deceived, you don't really care how I did it.

15:24.800 --> 15:30.560
The victim of a deception and negotiations or the victim of even kind of false positive

15:30.560 --> 15:35.440
hope doesn't care that you didn't explicitly say an untruth they care that your intention

15:35.440 --> 15:37.080
was to deceive.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.040
The question of intention is really interesting.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.680
When I teach this, if I ask the students first thing, well, how would you define a line?

15:44.680 --> 15:47.760
We get, you know, I'm sure if we went around the room 50 different answers.

15:47.760 --> 15:51.680
And one of the big breaking points is whether or not intention is required.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.200
And this gets to your point.

15:54.200 --> 15:59.600
If one subjectively, truly, honestly believes something, but it is objectively false and

15:59.600 --> 16:03.840
there's wonderful research by a number of psychologists on this point, one from Beth

16:03.840 --> 16:09.240
Loftus group many decades ago now, she can implant, sort of quote unquote implant a memory

16:09.240 --> 16:10.880
of seeing Bugs Bunny at Disney World.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.720
And you'd never see Bugs Bunny at Disney World because, you know, at different companies

16:14.720 --> 16:18.960
and these participants in the research studies will swear up and down that they remember

16:18.960 --> 16:21.960
seeing Bugs Bunny at Disney World.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.040
Same thing if I misremember who the fifth president of the United States, am I lying?

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
I didn't intend to, right?

16:27.040 --> 16:29.280
I intended actually to give the right answer.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.920
How do we categorize that?

16:31.920 --> 16:33.920
And I'm sure we all have different answers for that.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.560
But of course it gets to your question to begin with.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.560
What is a lie?

16:37.560 --> 16:38.560
Yeah.

16:38.560 --> 16:44.400
I think that also gets into the idea of this difference between deception and self-deception,

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
right?

16:45.400 --> 16:50.800
And there is this theory that, you know, humans and animals and even, you know, viruses have

16:50.800 --> 16:52.880
evolved to self-deceive.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.600
And we think the reason for that is if I wanted to deceive someone, I give off a lot of tell

16:57.600 --> 17:03.760
tale signals, you know, my voice might contract, my eyes will, my pupils would dilate, my

17:03.760 --> 17:05.120
fingers will start sweating.

17:05.120 --> 17:10.240
So all these signals can be read if I am telling a lie with intention there.

17:10.240 --> 17:15.240
But if I actually believe that lie myself, you know, if I actually believe that I'm fantastic,

17:15.240 --> 17:19.880
you know, that I've got all these amazing superpowers, if I actually really believe

17:19.880 --> 17:23.280
that, then those tell tale signals that I give off aren't there anymore.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.160
So if that intention isn't there, then I'm better able to deceive others.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.480
So there's this theory that actually we've evolved not to have that intention there in

17:29.480 --> 17:36.080
some cases so that we can sort of better able to sell better versions of ourselves to others

17:36.080 --> 17:39.080
around us.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.600
And of course people like actors are, you know, especially good at it.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.960
I don't know how many of you remember Peter Sellers.

17:46.960 --> 17:52.320
He was a very wonderful comedic actor and he died rather young of heart attack.

17:52.320 --> 17:57.800
And when I read his obituary in Time magazine, it was time on Newsweek, it was saying how

17:57.800 --> 18:01.960
when he got into a role, couldn't get out of it.

18:01.960 --> 18:07.080
He had this kind of a little bit of a quality of as if, what we call as if personality in

18:07.080 --> 18:09.720
our language.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.360
He just couldn't get out of it.

18:11.360 --> 18:19.160
And he was superb at it.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.960
Also if you talk about young children, they're so suggestible.

18:22.960 --> 18:32.720
So this is kind of a tricky subject that also has connections with the law, which is for

18:32.720 --> 18:37.400
instance young children who are molested.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.960
And you know, since I'm a psychiatrist, a psychoanalyst, worked with kids, the whole

18:40.960 --> 18:47.720
issue of truth and falsehood in the area of trauma is something that's of a great interest

18:47.720 --> 18:48.720
to me.

18:48.720 --> 18:54.720
So we have an old analyst, Farron C, from a long time ago who wrote a paper about, it's

18:54.720 --> 19:00.640
called Confusion of Tongues Between Adults and Children.

19:00.640 --> 19:06.360
And one of the things that he describes very eloquently is the way when children are molested,

19:06.360 --> 19:12.160
that's a young child, often the perpetrator is someone like an uncle or someone in a family

19:12.160 --> 19:17.080
who knows the kid and says, oh, this will be our little secret.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.080
Don't tell anybody.

19:18.080 --> 19:23.520
So not only does the child have the trauma, but they also then have the burden of secrecy

19:23.520 --> 19:29.840
and kind of borrowing the guilt of the grown-up and having to collude with them.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.920
And so it's really terrible.

19:32.920 --> 19:38.720
And then, because we're analysts, when it comes up in the analytic situation, it gets

19:38.720 --> 19:43.960
very complicated because these feelings get revived in the treatment and then they're

19:43.960 --> 19:47.160
not sure about, well, can I trust the analysts?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.800
Are they going to do bad things to me?

19:48.800 --> 19:53.480
So the whole thing gets recreated in that situation.

19:53.480 --> 19:57.680
So anyway, that's just, it's a very complicated matter.

19:57.680 --> 20:05.240
And a lot of people get caught up with trying to figure out, well, there was a scandal, for

20:05.240 --> 20:09.840
instance, in the late 80s, I think, where all these nursery school teachers were accused

20:09.840 --> 20:11.800
of molesting little children.

20:11.800 --> 20:16.320
And to this day, we don't really know whether that was true or not because the way that

20:16.320 --> 20:22.600
children were interviewed by the cops who were not terribly knowledgeable about child

20:22.600 --> 20:30.240
development was so suggestive that the kids complied and they said, yes, yes, these things

20:30.240 --> 20:36.760
happened and we don't know.

20:36.760 --> 20:41.600
So when it comes to, just one other point about this, when it comes to truthfulness,

20:41.600 --> 20:51.240
I think that especially children at the age of five or six are very malleable about what,

20:51.240 --> 20:56.920
not because they can't perceive the difference between truth and untruth, but because there's

20:56.920 --> 21:02.240
so much at the mercy of the authorities either because of their wish for love or fear of

21:02.240 --> 21:04.520
punishment.

21:04.520 --> 21:12.040
So it's always very problematic to put a young child on the witness stand or to rely on the

21:12.040 --> 21:17.800
testimony of a young child unless you understand who it is that has kind of, if you will, brainwash

21:17.800 --> 21:18.800
them.

21:18.800 --> 21:26.280
But anyway, if you extrapolate that to more suggestive malleable personalities, then some

21:26.280 --> 21:28.240
grownups can be like that too.

21:28.240 --> 21:36.600
People talk about PTSD, Stockholm syndrome, people who as adults are very brainwashed to

21:36.600 --> 21:40.680
tell whatever they're supposed to tell.

21:40.680 --> 21:47.560
And then of course other people who are much stronger and don't give in.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.360
So there is a question of coercion when it comes to lying.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.280
Okay, that's a whole topic now.

21:53.280 --> 22:04.200
Well, if there's a, let's say there's a tendency in terms of natural selection towards suggestibility

22:04.200 --> 22:11.280
or self-deception, I would imagine it's not something, well, I believe it's not something

22:11.280 --> 22:17.320
that everyone has inherited equally, that there are people more suggestible and less

22:17.320 --> 22:22.760
and there are people who are better at suppressing or not having those feelings that often are

22:22.760 --> 22:25.560
associated with telling lies.

22:25.560 --> 22:31.520
And in the extreme, think of psychopaths as being very, you know, not responding to lies

22:31.520 --> 22:36.960
and telling lies without any sort of physiological effect.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.840
So what do you think about the idea that there may be different types of people that we could

22:40.840 --> 22:42.320
sort people in this regard?

22:42.320 --> 22:47.840
That's a great question, maybe I can mention a study that I've done that maybe speaks

22:47.840 --> 22:49.720
to this point to some extent.

22:49.720 --> 22:56.240
So I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and we run a lot of experiments in the lab where we actually

22:56.240 --> 23:02.360
can see how willing people are to be dishonest to someone else.

23:02.360 --> 23:07.600
And what we've looked at is how this changes over time and how it varies with people's

23:07.600 --> 23:11.200
emotional reaction when they choose to be dishonest.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.720
So we're able to measure their emotional reaction by using one of these machines called an

23:15.720 --> 23:20.960
FMRI scanner so that can show you in brain regions associated with emotion what your

23:20.960 --> 23:23.600
emotional reaction is when you choose to be dishonest.

23:23.600 --> 23:28.560
And what we found in our study was quite interesting, we found that first of all people

23:28.560 --> 23:33.040
started being dishonest by a small amount and when they were being dishonest by a small

23:33.040 --> 23:38.920
amount in those early days and they had a really strong emotional reaction in brain

23:38.920 --> 23:43.680
areas like the amygdala for example which we know is important for emotional processing.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.840
But as we gave people more and more opportunities to be dishonest we saw that the emotional

23:47.840 --> 23:54.680
response decreased and we saw that they're lying subsequently increased as a consequence.

23:54.680 --> 23:59.040
And that's consistent with other studies that have shown that emotion is really important

23:59.040 --> 24:02.560
for sort of governing how dishonest we're willing to be.

24:02.560 --> 24:09.840
So for example if you give students beta blockers which is a type of pill which lowers

24:09.840 --> 24:14.680
your emotional response cheating will increase on a test that you give those students because

24:14.680 --> 24:18.760
when that emotion is not there sort of restricting people's dishonesty it seems that people

24:18.760 --> 24:21.280
are more willing to be dishonest as a result.

24:21.280 --> 24:25.200
So we think emotion is really important for governing how dishonest people are willing

24:25.200 --> 24:28.560
to be and that really speaks to this point of individual differences.

24:28.560 --> 24:33.360
Some people whether it's by nature or by nurture you know just have stronger emotional

24:33.360 --> 24:37.760
responses than other people and that allows them to be more dishonest than others.

24:37.760 --> 24:42.040
But one of these sort of I suppose alarming points of our study is that this emotional

24:42.040 --> 24:48.400
response seems to decrease in everyone through a process which we know a brain process called

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
adaptation.

24:49.400 --> 24:54.800
So that's a process we know that happens with lots of sensory information for example so

24:54.800 --> 24:59.920
with smells you know if you buy a new perfume for example you might initially put a couple

24:59.920 --> 25:04.560
of drops on and you'll smell it really really strongly okay but after a few days you won't

25:04.560 --> 25:08.240
smell it as much so you need to put a bit more on right.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.800
Emotions do the same thing so when we start off being dishonest we have a really strong

25:11.800 --> 25:16.800
emotional response but through this act of repetition this emotional response will automatically

25:16.800 --> 25:21.440
adapt it will decrease and as a result we can be more dishonest as a consequence.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.600
So I suggest if you just put people in a context where you give them lots and lots of opportunities

25:25.600 --> 25:30.320
to be dishonest even if they initially have a very strong emotional reaction to that and

25:30.320 --> 25:33.960
that will sort of stop them being very dishonest in that situation.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.560
By giving them lots and lots of opportunities this process of emotional adaptation would

25:37.560 --> 25:41.960
take place and there's a good chance that they're dishonest we will increase as a consequence

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
of that.

25:42.960 --> 25:52.320
So if you feel the more you like the more you will like.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.320
Exactly yes yes.

25:53.320 --> 25:57.840
It feels to me that we are sort of inevitably circling around the idea of truth and so I

25:57.840 --> 26:03.840
wanted to maybe say a couple things about that.

26:03.840 --> 26:11.840
There's this idea of an epistemic virtue that is virtues or rules of thumb or moral commandments

26:11.840 --> 26:14.920
that deal with knowledge.

26:14.920 --> 26:19.680
So the most concise statement of this is I only want to believe those things which are

26:19.680 --> 26:24.040
true but then we have the problem of well okay how do we determine whether something

26:24.040 --> 26:30.840
is true and as the flyer for this is pointed out we mostly rely on second hand knowledge.

26:30.840 --> 26:35.280
I and my colleagues are in the business of producing this sort of second hand knowledge

26:35.280 --> 26:43.920
and it's kind of a complicated process right there are standards for reporting.

26:43.920 --> 26:48.320
There are so I do a lot of work with statistics and data.

26:48.320 --> 26:53.000
There are all sorts of issues about the validity of statistics and the sorts of analyses that

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
you do.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.760
There's the issue of reputation so you know part of why you should believe what I write

27:01.760 --> 27:07.480
is because I was right last time or maybe because you haven't heard of me being wrong

27:07.480 --> 27:13.080
which is not quite the same thing and then there's transparency.

27:13.080 --> 27:18.840
Part of how I can build trust with you hopefully is to let you in on my process.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.680
What are my reasons for believing this is true?

27:21.680 --> 27:26.040
So you know in the in the era of the internet this has actually gotten a lot easier.

27:26.040 --> 27:30.040
I can do something like link to the court filings that I'm basing my story on.

27:30.040 --> 27:36.320
I could maybe include an audio recording of an interview if the source will consent to

27:36.320 --> 27:39.760
that.

27:39.760 --> 27:46.200
But a lot of the time it sort of has to come down to reputation because it's difficult

27:46.200 --> 27:49.800
to put that whole process in a story.

27:49.800 --> 27:55.040
If you're doing a complicated statistical analysis most people aren't going to be technically

27:55.040 --> 27:59.000
equipped to go through that line by line anyway.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.240
And there are many important stories that can only be got by anonymous sourcing.

28:05.240 --> 28:10.360
So people won't tell you certain things unless you can guarantee to keep their name out of

28:10.360 --> 28:12.600
it.

28:12.600 --> 28:17.680
And I think every field has some complicated construction of truth.

28:17.680 --> 28:22.720
You know why should we believe what a lawyer argues at trial?

28:22.720 --> 28:26.480
Why should we believe what you say in your paper?

28:26.480 --> 28:33.320
The processes by which we actually produce these truths remain opaque.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.920
And this is almost a definition of truth for me.

28:37.920 --> 28:42.520
Rather than asking about in some abstract way is this true or not.

28:42.520 --> 28:49.200
I try to ask what is the process by which this community decides what is true.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.120
And so that's one way of getting at it.

28:51.120 --> 28:55.920
And you know that can go wrong in a lot of ways right?

28:55.920 --> 28:59.360
There's self-deception in every field.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.000
What about bias?

29:01.000 --> 29:04.800
I knew you were going to ask me this eventually.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.280
Yeah, yeah.

29:06.280 --> 29:11.160
One of the challenges with the whole topic of media bias is that there isn't really a

29:11.160 --> 29:14.040
ground truth.

29:14.040 --> 29:18.160
Of course articles can have factual errors.

29:18.160 --> 29:23.200
But as anyone who's gotten into this fight knows there are a number of problems with

29:23.200 --> 29:26.920
trying to distinguish back from opinion.

29:26.920 --> 29:31.440
And there are a number of problems with deciding which facts are relevant.

29:31.440 --> 29:38.960
So you know to take this really glaring example right?

29:38.960 --> 29:42.240
You might be talking with someone who says you know Trump is terribly racist.

29:42.240 --> 29:47.000
Okay well what has he done that's racist and you will get a list of things that he's

29:47.000 --> 29:48.520
done or said.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.600
And then you'll just get into an argument about whether those things are racist or not.

29:51.600 --> 29:55.880
So you're not really contesting the facts at that point.

29:55.880 --> 30:02.920
So media bias suffers from this problem of you, it's very difficult to establish a ground

30:02.920 --> 30:06.840
truth of sort of what objective journalism looks like.

30:06.840 --> 30:13.920
Having said that, what you can do is you can do analyses of political leaning.

30:13.920 --> 30:20.680
So does this story talk about a subject in a way that a left-wing person would talk about

30:20.680 --> 30:24.680
it or does it talk about it in the way that a right-wing person would.

30:24.680 --> 30:28.560
And you can do this in various ways such as for example frame analysis right?

30:28.560 --> 30:38.120
So if you have a story about poverty to generalize greatly on the left it's considered to be

30:38.120 --> 30:42.960
a societal problem or the fault of the environment in which the person grew up on the right it's

30:42.960 --> 30:47.760
more commonly considered to be you know they're lazy or they weren't educated enough or so

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
on.

30:48.760 --> 30:53.480
So you can do these types of things and when you do them you find the results are very

30:53.480 --> 30:54.600
unsurprising right?

30:54.600 --> 30:59.760
You find that the New York Times is slightly left of center and you know Fox is farther

30:59.760 --> 31:05.840
to the right and you know MSNBC is farther to the left and it's not really a shock.

31:05.840 --> 31:11.280
So I think we can all perceive these political biases already.

31:11.280 --> 31:15.800
I'm beginning to wonder if maybe we're asking the wrong questions about media bias.

31:15.800 --> 31:20.560
I mean beyond the sort of straightforward factual issues which admittedly sometimes

31:20.560 --> 31:23.920
is a problem.

31:23.920 --> 31:31.520
I wonder if we are a lot of the conversation around media bias is sort of a proxy for

31:31.520 --> 31:39.240
the hope that media figures will wage our political battles for us which depending on

31:39.240 --> 31:42.760
your theory of journalism either is or is not their job.

31:42.760 --> 31:46.080
Yeah, interesting.

31:46.080 --> 31:53.480
So maybe I can sort of ask a provocative question related to that is do you think truth is sort

31:53.480 --> 32:01.480
of under threat because you know you used to have these select media heavyweights you

32:01.480 --> 32:05.320
know that have that reputation attached to them you know these certain papers certain

32:05.320 --> 32:09.920
TV channels are provided news but now the barriers to entry of entering this world are

32:09.920 --> 32:11.880
like plummeted right with the internet.

32:11.880 --> 32:16.000
So there's just so many sources out there like the reputation things sort of dissolve

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
to some extent.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.200
Do you think that's a problem?

32:19.200 --> 32:27.240
I think we are at a very interesting moment for authority and trust and so am I interested

32:27.240 --> 32:30.360
to hear about your trust research.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.840
So I can say a couple things.

32:31.840 --> 32:35.880
So trust in journalism is at a historic low.

32:35.880 --> 32:43.600
We started decreasing before the transformation of the internet so the 1970s and no one really

32:43.600 --> 32:47.840
is quite sure why of course there's various theories.

32:47.840 --> 32:52.960
Trust in American institutions in general is at historic lows at this point so maybe

32:52.960 --> 32:56.520
just piggybacks off that.

32:56.520 --> 33:00.720
For a long time one of the classic critiques of media was that it's just a few powerful

33:00.720 --> 33:03.360
people and they're not really representative.

33:03.360 --> 33:09.680
So we wanted to tear down the gatekeepers and we did and now we're I think relearning

33:09.680 --> 33:18.120
the role of gatekeeper and what sort of value they provided.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.360
I'm optimistic actually.

33:19.360 --> 33:22.600
I think a lot of people are pessimistic about the concept of truth.

33:22.600 --> 33:28.680
I'm more optimistic than that and I think in part that's because I have a certain amount

33:28.680 --> 33:34.560
of professional visibility into the institutional processes that are springing up to try to

33:34.560 --> 33:35.560
combat this.

33:35.560 --> 33:43.240
So for example the Wall Street Journal has a 21 person team to deal with AI generated

33:43.240 --> 33:44.760
fake imagery.

33:44.760 --> 33:48.520
They don't do this every day but they have their community of experts and they have

33:48.520 --> 33:50.080
their policies and standards.

33:50.080 --> 33:56.360
So I have a very privileged position in some way and that I get to see the way that various

33:56.360 --> 34:03.160
types of media and technology institutions are gearing up to deal with these problems.

34:03.160 --> 34:10.080
And I don't know if that will be successful or what even success would look like but I

34:10.080 --> 34:12.240
can tell you that there is a response.

34:12.240 --> 34:17.120
It has become a field of endeavor.

34:17.120 --> 34:23.000
Just thinking about this idea of trust I think it's complicated because many of us think

34:23.000 --> 34:27.200
about trust and truth as intrinsically linked but for lots of people they're not.

34:27.200 --> 34:32.400
So I can trust you and want to affiliate with you because you make me feel good.

34:32.400 --> 34:37.480
You give me the content that I want to hear that supports my worldview even if I recognize

34:37.480 --> 34:38.680
it might not be truthful.

34:38.680 --> 34:45.960
So we can choose friends and engage in partner selection around beliefs about loyalty and

34:45.960 --> 34:50.880
emotion and benevolence like whether this person supports us that have nothing to do

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
with truth.

34:51.880 --> 34:56.560
I think that's relevant to how we think about media and how we think about choice of leaders

34:56.560 --> 35:03.160
too is there might be a recognition that maybe this isn't truthful but what I look for I

35:03.160 --> 35:07.760
think it's hard for many to believe in news but in a leader is not necessarily truth.

35:07.760 --> 35:13.280
It's other things that are important to living the life that I want to live and that can drive

35:13.280 --> 35:18.040
trust nearly as much sometimes more than a belief and honesty.

35:18.040 --> 35:26.640
I think an old and very interesting piece of literature that addresses these concerns

35:26.640 --> 35:33.880
that's worth revisiting is 1984 which I read sometime within the last couple of years and

35:33.880 --> 35:44.920
it's fascinating because the protagonist you know it's sort of negative utopia there

35:44.920 --> 35:50.320
they're trying to hide the truth rather than but they do it in a very systematic propaganda

35:50.320 --> 35:56.760
way and he's trying to figure out who he can trust in this place of profound mistrust and

35:56.760 --> 36:03.640
the person who he thinks maybe has a common thinking with him ends up being the person

36:03.640 --> 36:09.360
who's trying to get him to betray himself and then eventually gets brainwashed.

36:09.360 --> 36:17.000
I mean it is a pretty gory story but it's kind of a real illustration of how desperately

36:17.000 --> 36:22.640
people want to have that sense of someone they can look up to and connection and how

36:22.640 --> 36:28.720
that can then be misused and exploited.

36:28.720 --> 36:37.440
I know it was written a long time ago but I think it's pertinent perhaps not so much

36:37.440 --> 36:44.840
to our place but just to think that such things exist and I don't really know what's going

36:44.840 --> 36:53.040
on in China for instance and how much is it still the way they try to block things to

36:53.040 --> 36:59.760
have one official message and everything else gets forcefully suppressed and so forth.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.160
Don't you think people still can make a distinction between someone they might like or want to

37:05.160 --> 37:12.920
affiliate with or who's perhaps minor lies they can abide by with someone that they can

37:12.920 --> 37:18.840
recognize in distinction of that people who are really truth tellers.

37:18.840 --> 37:23.200
Like for example I can recognize when I like to think and recognize when a story is fair

37:23.200 --> 37:28.520
and unbalanced and balanced rather and I can recognize when I think it's biased and I

37:28.520 --> 37:35.040
think people make those distinctions I'm not so sure the public is concerned to make those

37:35.040 --> 37:36.760
distinctions that large.

37:36.760 --> 37:43.320
Yeah I think it depends I mean coming back to this trust versus truthfulness so that's

37:43.320 --> 37:48.040
a really key distinction that's made in a book that's come out recently by Steve Martin

37:48.040 --> 37:54.920
and Joe Marx and they talk about the US president you know like among his supporters he's not

37:54.920 --> 37:59.400
seen as someone who's very truthful but they really feel that they can trust him because

37:59.400 --> 38:03.000
he in a lot of ways he has delivered on what he said he would you know he has tried to

38:03.000 --> 38:07.960
build a wall he has lowered taxes he has made it difficult for people from Muslim countries

38:07.960 --> 38:13.400
to get in here so they in a way they don't mind his dishonesty I think if it's serving

38:13.400 --> 38:18.540
their cause I think that's true in general of dishonesty it's not how we judge it is

38:18.540 --> 38:22.520
depending on what it's sort of doing for us and I think that's probably true of media

38:22.520 --> 38:28.360
bias as well like you know there's a whole field of motivated reasoning you know in some

38:28.360 --> 38:32.440
ways we probably quite enjoy reading media that we think is biased if it's biased in

38:32.440 --> 38:39.880
a direction that suits our view of the world that we want to believe and buy into.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.880
Audience metric supports that view.

38:41.880 --> 38:47.600
Yeah I mean this is this is part of what's happened is that the lower lowering of the

38:47.600 --> 38:52.440
barriers to entry have made it possible for media to specialize and so if you just had

38:52.440 --> 38:58.200
you know if you have three cable news networks if you have to decide whether ABC goes left

38:58.200 --> 39:03.040
or right you lose half your audience but now you can be the left wing outlet or you can

39:03.040 --> 39:07.440
be the right wing outlet or you can be the like housewives of Arkansas outlet right where

39:07.440 --> 39:13.960
we're in an era of niche media which has led to a proliferation of choice in terms of political

39:13.960 --> 39:14.960
orientation.

39:14.960 --> 39:20.800
You know it's interesting from the law side so our center for law brain and behavior thinks

39:20.800 --> 39:27.240
a lot about the role of new science and technology in helping potentially to achieve more truthful

39:27.240 --> 39:28.240
and just outcomes.

39:28.240 --> 39:32.440
I think one of the success stories in law is the introduction of DNA evidence over the

39:32.440 --> 39:39.840
last 15 to 20 years and the precursor to that is to say that unlike some other fields where

39:39.840 --> 39:45.400
there is I think a sense that the goal is if it goes into print it's as best you can

39:45.400 --> 39:48.160
do the truth I suspect right.

39:48.160 --> 39:53.200
We take an adversarial model in the law and we teach our students to write a persuasive

39:53.200 --> 39:58.080
set of facts and share when you're in front of you tell facts and the other side tells

39:58.080 --> 40:02.520
facts and they're honest and yet listening to them it sounds like two completely different

40:02.520 --> 40:08.840
things happen and we actually embrace that and the idea is that we'll have it out proceed

40:08.840 --> 40:13.200
with these procedural rules in the courtroom and act the fact finder will have to sort of

40:13.200 --> 40:14.200
sift between the two.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.680
The equivalent of saying you have to sit for an hour and watch Fox News an hour and watch

40:17.680 --> 40:21.360
MSNBC and then you make your decision.

40:21.360 --> 40:24.760
One other interesting thing about law is thinking about it when you're mentioning anonymous

40:24.760 --> 40:29.120
sourcing it's the it's really opposite in law and especially in a criminal case where

40:29.120 --> 40:33.200
there's something called a front confrontation clause a right to confront your accuser and

40:33.200 --> 40:35.160
look at your accuser in the eyes.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.880
It's one of the problems when a witness dies a key witness dies you often can't go forward

40:38.880 --> 40:42.240
with the case because that person has to appear in the courtroom.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.840
It's a really interesting way to get that truth.

40:44.840 --> 40:48.480
I'll just leave you with this quote it comes from a Supreme Court case on the issue that

40:48.480 --> 40:52.360
had to do with whether or not we should introduce the polygraph in the court proceedings.

40:52.360 --> 40:56.520
The polygraph by the use is by the way is used routinely in police investigations but it's

40:56.520 --> 41:02.960
not typically admissible in the courtroom and just as Thomas said the jury is the lie detector.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.920
It's an interesting thing to think about the jury is the lie detector.

41:07.920 --> 41:14.920
Let's just say that what I do is I try jury case so I let's say try hundreds of them and

41:14.920 --> 41:21.040
one of the most interesting explorations is speaking to a jury after you've tried a case

41:21.040 --> 41:26.480
and seeing what they heard and what they've evaluated and it's a place in the country

41:26.480 --> 41:33.720
where the people are relatively responsible for their own lives within government and

41:33.720 --> 41:40.680
they can make important decisions about their lives and they are trusted with the responsibility

41:40.680 --> 41:48.280
of making decisions to prove that the lives are deaths of people who are before them.

41:48.280 --> 41:55.560
So you have this creation of a truth seeking system which is as good as anything else and

41:55.560 --> 42:07.200
the extent to which it's perverted or supported is fascinating and the ways in which you learn

42:07.200 --> 42:15.920
to support it or pervert it is fascinating.

42:15.920 --> 42:22.640
How much of the social networks, how much influence does that have?

42:22.640 --> 42:29.080
I'm often biased in asking the question this way in perverting that effort to establish

42:29.080 --> 42:30.720
the truth widely.

42:30.720 --> 42:35.880
The jury's come in with extraordinary biases.

42:35.880 --> 42:42.000
Your job as a lawyer is to find out those people whose biases are yours.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
The ones you want.

42:43.000 --> 42:50.800
Your job as a lawyer is to find out which people you can influence either by being truthful

42:50.800 --> 42:53.120
or untruthful.

42:53.120 --> 43:03.200
So the effect of the media is in there every second of every court day.

43:03.200 --> 43:14.400
I tried a case recently in Miami involving Cubans and politics in Miami.

43:14.400 --> 43:20.440
So we had to and I represented someone in New York years ago called Cathy Boudin which

43:20.440 --> 43:22.520
was a murder case here.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.280
Which was a murder case years ago.

43:25.280 --> 43:31.840
And the question of trying to rid the jury of biases.

43:31.840 --> 43:34.520
A fascinating thing, I'll just tell you one story.

43:34.520 --> 43:40.720
There was a case in Harrisburg and it happened to be so legal, the Berrigan case which was

43:40.720 --> 43:43.600
tried a long time ago.

43:43.600 --> 43:53.880
It was priests who had put blood on weapons of war and they were being prosecuted.

43:53.880 --> 44:04.640
And one of the jurors was a woman who was whose son had been jailed because she believed,

44:04.640 --> 44:11.840
as the defendants in this case, that the war was horrible and there are certain things

44:11.840 --> 44:14.360
you should do with respect to it.

44:14.360 --> 44:20.520
So she was the perfect juror for us and we did everything we could to keep her on and

44:20.520 --> 44:24.400
they did everything they could to knock her off.

44:24.400 --> 44:33.040
At the end of the case, the defendants were convicted in large part because of this woman.

44:33.040 --> 44:40.600
And we then sat down with her and she was gracious enough to allow us to have her examined by

44:40.600 --> 44:43.800
psychologist, psychiatrist.

44:43.800 --> 44:48.760
And what really happened is that she was furious at these defendants because her son

44:48.760 --> 44:51.760
was in jail.

44:51.760 --> 45:00.240
I think coming back to you as a question about social media, I think one sort of problematic

45:00.240 --> 45:07.040
aspect of it is it just is making spreading dishonesty easier in lots of different ways.

45:07.040 --> 45:12.760
So coming back to this idea of emotion, if I'm actually being dishonest to someone in

45:12.760 --> 45:15.480
person, I'm going to probably feel quite bad about that.

45:15.480 --> 45:19.400
But if I can do it through a click of a button, it's much more indirect, it's much further

45:19.400 --> 45:20.400
removed.

45:20.400 --> 45:26.000
One of the other interesting things is that often dishonest information seems to spread

45:26.000 --> 45:28.120
quicker than true information.

45:28.120 --> 45:32.680
I think part of the reason for that is often it's more sensational, it's more novel, so

45:32.680 --> 45:39.800
it propagates through things like Twitter much faster than true information.

45:39.800 --> 45:46.920
So in many instances, justice seems to trump what's true about something, let's say.

45:46.920 --> 45:52.000
Or people are motivated by thinking that they're following some path of justice and that sort

45:52.000 --> 45:58.120
of means biasing or telling a little falsehood may not be so bad after all.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.120
A little story again.

46:00.120 --> 46:07.280
In an anatomy of murder, a film some of you may remember, the man walks into the lawyer

46:07.280 --> 46:10.880
and he says, I kill so and so.

46:10.880 --> 46:17.400
And the lawyer then says to him, my wife would kill my girlfriend.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.400
So the lawyer then says to him, well, I'm not going to say that.

46:21.400 --> 46:29.240
Well, listen, if you come in and say that you picked up a gun and you were angry and

46:29.240 --> 46:36.240
you killed this woman, your wife, your girlfriend, you will be convicted and sentenced to die.

46:36.240 --> 46:43.480
If you come in and tell us that you were upset, you would totally lost any sense of

46:43.480 --> 46:50.080
sanity that morning you tried to fly to the roof and you tell us that story and if you

46:50.080 --> 46:56.880
didn't, you will be found not guilty by reason of insanity.

46:56.880 --> 47:02.360
So the lawyer then says, come in tomorrow and tell me what happened.

47:02.360 --> 47:06.560
Talking about truth in the legal system and the different ways you deal with it.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.400
But you're trying cases, right?

47:09.400 --> 47:21.760
You are in the service of a defendant and your legal duty is to help them win their case.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.760
What about the judge in this?

47:22.760 --> 47:24.760
What's their duty in their obligation?

47:24.760 --> 47:26.280
Well, it is legal duty to win the case.

47:26.280 --> 47:28.440
Is legal duty to truth?

47:28.440 --> 47:34.960
Is legal duty to be in a legal system that values truth?

47:34.960 --> 47:44.120
Is it my duty to participate in a system that underlines truth and the question is, what

47:44.120 --> 47:46.080
are the values?

47:46.080 --> 47:53.200
It's not merely, it can't merely be to get people off or can it be.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.160
So I think that's an interesting issue.

47:56.160 --> 48:00.600
My friend here mentioned Elizabeth Loftus.

48:00.600 --> 48:10.360
Elizabeth Loftus spent years trying to determine how people saw truth and what she said and

48:10.360 --> 48:13.160
it's a Bible in the law.

48:13.160 --> 48:16.480
They see it as they want or as their influence.

48:16.480 --> 48:29.000
What happens if you have a legal system which chooses fundamentally irrelevant?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.800
That's a dark thought to me.

48:31.800 --> 48:34.760
I put it on the table.

48:34.760 --> 48:39.920
But you would agree that the judge has a different responsibility than the lawyer who's representing

48:39.920 --> 48:40.920
a client?

48:40.920 --> 48:45.480
No judge doesn't have a system of bias.

48:45.480 --> 48:46.480
No judge.

48:46.480 --> 48:51.520
In other words, the concept of the United States Supreme Court years ago is that these

48:51.520 --> 48:58.120
were people who had a sense of the law and they made their judgments based on the law

48:58.120 --> 48:59.880
free from bias.

48:59.880 --> 49:06.080
A, most people no longer believe that if they believed it long ago.

49:06.080 --> 49:12.640
If you look at the law back in 1810, 1850, and you look at the Constitution which says

49:12.640 --> 49:19.760
this or that about slavery, you no one will believe that anybody is making judgments

49:19.760 --> 49:21.480
free of bias.

49:21.480 --> 49:30.160
Now I was a law professor who had written eloquently about justice and truth in the law.

49:30.160 --> 49:35.160
Very respected, he thought it out through, he thought it out in NYU.

49:35.160 --> 49:39.160
After Bush against Gore came out, he threw it all away.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
What?

49:40.160 --> 49:41.160
What?

49:41.160 --> 49:42.160
What?

49:42.160 --> 49:43.160
What?

49:43.160 --> 49:47.880
After Bush against Gore, he threw it all away.

49:47.880 --> 49:54.400
He became persuaded that truth was not the issue, that there were other things determining

49:54.400 --> 49:56.400
that decision.

49:56.400 --> 50:03.880
Well, so that means there's no way to determine whether someone's biased, very biased, a

50:03.880 --> 50:08.560
little biased or hardly biased.

50:08.560 --> 50:13.720
I mean in other words, there are degrees of bias and that there are characters who demonstrate

50:13.720 --> 50:16.880
their equanimity before the truth.

50:16.880 --> 50:21.400
By any illusion, I think that we've given up and great relates to the question you were

50:21.400 --> 50:26.240
talking about, the question you asked, is a judge is free of bias and he's committed

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
to the law?

50:27.240 --> 50:28.920
In that sense.

50:28.920 --> 50:38.000
I would like to stay on the subject but change it slightly.

50:38.000 --> 50:47.600
And the question of being free of bias and impartial and how do you assess things.

50:47.600 --> 50:55.720
I have done a lot of work with children of divorce where it's a pretty acrimonious situation

50:55.720 --> 51:04.160
and there you're trying to be witness, jury, judge, sort of.

51:04.160 --> 51:11.680
Because each of the parents gives you a very brainwashed version of their side because

51:11.680 --> 51:15.920
I'm talking about, not about peaceful divorces, I'm talking about situations where the kids

51:15.920 --> 51:19.200
are really caught in the middle of World War III.

51:19.200 --> 51:24.280
And so you as the advocate of the child, and I've never gone to court.

51:24.280 --> 51:28.520
This is not about going to court, it's about helping and protecting the best interests

51:28.520 --> 51:30.480
of the child.

51:30.480 --> 51:34.960
You get two different versions of the truth and if it's highly intelligent, high functioning

51:34.960 --> 51:40.720
people, they can be extraordinarily convincing and persuasive.

51:40.720 --> 51:48.560
You find out the worst possible things about each other and it's perplexing because when

51:48.560 --> 51:54.240
you talk to one parent, they convince you of their point of view and you're saying,

51:54.240 --> 51:55.240
oh, okay.

51:55.240 --> 51:58.200
Then you talk to the other parent, they convince you of their point of view and you're saying,

51:58.200 --> 52:00.400
well, wait a minute, now which is the truth?

52:00.400 --> 52:05.000
And then you say, ah, this is what life is like for this poor child.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.520
All the time they're being torn back and forth.

52:07.520 --> 52:15.320
How does a child like this develop a cohesive sense of integrity, of values, of knowing

52:15.320 --> 52:21.360
right from wrong, of figuring out who to trust and what to trust, if the two people in their

52:21.360 --> 52:28.480
life that they love and would like to trust are at war and telling such terrible things

52:28.480 --> 52:31.560
about each other with such conviction.

52:31.560 --> 52:36.720
And it could go down the line whether it's about visitation, about how much the kid should

52:36.720 --> 52:41.800
be studying, how strict or loose, how much time they should get on the media.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.640
You name it.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.120
It's war.

52:46.120 --> 52:54.600
And so it's a very interesting window in a way, a painful one to see what, you know,

52:54.600 --> 52:56.600
the divorce rate is like 50%.

52:56.600 --> 53:03.600
What so many children grow up with and then how do they figure out their values?

53:03.600 --> 53:07.920
Now of course it depends on how old the kid was when the war started but the war often

53:07.920 --> 53:12.360
started long before the divorce, it continues afterward, etc.

53:12.360 --> 53:17.480
So I have to tell you that even as a grown up it's very difficult but it's certainly

53:17.480 --> 53:19.720
super stressful for the kids.

53:19.720 --> 53:28.080
So this whole question about how do people develop into good judges with good values

53:28.080 --> 53:37.200
and try to figure out what authorities to trust, all of that gets formed through one's

53:37.200 --> 53:49.080
government and I think we have such a breakdown in a way of cohesive standards not only in

53:49.080 --> 53:55.680
journalism but in so many different settings starting with childhood.

53:55.680 --> 54:00.440
So this is kind of a plea for peaceful divorces.

54:00.440 --> 54:05.760
If I could just interject as well and you know you raised the question I think to some

54:05.760 --> 54:10.200
extent it gets at can you ever really discern the truth or you just have to throw your hands

54:10.200 --> 54:11.200
up.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.600
And I do want to make clear that there are a lot of efforts from the clinical side and

54:15.600 --> 54:21.280
on the legal side to gather additional information rigorously and systematically with which to

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
evaluate claims.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.160
And this is say on the clinical side if you're treating someone you actually want to know

54:26.160 --> 54:28.160
how many times did this happen.

54:28.160 --> 54:31.880
We've typically relied on self-report while the future is digital phenotyping, collecting

54:31.880 --> 54:32.880
that data.

54:32.880 --> 54:37.200
In the situation you ask you got two different stories, well you go out and you get a bunch

54:37.200 --> 54:41.680
of extra evidence in your world right you get additional sources.

54:41.680 --> 54:46.400
And in law we're trying to systematize that and specifically about judges it's not just

54:46.400 --> 54:52.200
that they're biased but they're biased based on empirical evidence in knowable and predictable

54:52.200 --> 54:53.200
ways.

54:53.200 --> 54:57.240
And if you know that systematically you can then suggest interventions that won't take

54:57.240 --> 55:01.040
care of every single case but will and the same thing in a corporate world right where

55:01.040 --> 55:05.520
you can begin to recognize what your systemic biases are and adjust.

55:05.520 --> 55:10.200
And I'd say on the hopeful side I think there's some slow progress there.

55:10.200 --> 55:14.960
It doesn't solve sort of the underlying human nature we've brought up several times but

55:14.960 --> 55:19.520
it begins based on the collective research to say okay we know at broad level here are

55:19.520 --> 55:24.280
some things that are happening at a system level can we put in some safeguards that will

55:24.280 --> 55:28.360
for instance in the judge stop and think we have a quick emotional response should we

55:28.360 --> 55:33.000
require that you don't give your opinion now but you deliberate for now as one example

55:33.000 --> 55:34.960
and there are others.

55:34.960 --> 55:43.760
It seems to me in a way in law you most of the time are deciding or not deciding but

55:43.760 --> 55:49.600
the law is supposed to be deciding is this person telling the truth about having not

55:49.600 --> 55:55.700
having stolen something or not having embezzled something or not having killed somebody.

55:55.700 --> 56:02.320
But in human relations it's different because what you are in a way doing you are constantly

56:02.320 --> 56:06.080
having to interpret and your interpretation may be wrong.

56:06.080 --> 56:12.480
So you may think in a couple who are fighting that my husband is a liar but in fact he isn't

56:12.480 --> 56:17.280
it just how you interpret his behavior and vice versa.

56:17.280 --> 56:26.600
So there's a it creates such a lack of clarity about especially in psychology and human relations

56:26.600 --> 56:32.680
what lying and truth is about.

56:32.680 --> 56:40.440
I have a question for everybody what about people who life or sport kind of confabulators

56:40.440 --> 56:47.520
like to make up stories would you like to address that subject a little bit.

56:47.520 --> 56:50.360
Can you give an example?

56:50.360 --> 56:51.920
I think of one.

56:51.920 --> 56:52.920
Okay.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.720
I'm joking really obvious to one.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.720
They're president.

56:57.720 --> 56:58.720
Yeah.

56:58.720 --> 57:00.720
But in sport though.

57:00.720 --> 57:01.720
What?

57:01.720 --> 57:04.720
No you mean what you mean what you mean?

57:04.720 --> 57:18.320
For sport for fun as a way of creating an impression or because it's pleasurable to deceive.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.360
It's pleasurable to full people.

57:20.360 --> 57:23.520
No, not to have certain mental illness as well as sometimes.

57:23.520 --> 57:24.520
Well that's what yeah.

57:24.520 --> 57:29.520
The duration of the brain where the person keeps inventing things which are people.

57:29.520 --> 57:35.800
Unfibulation correct but the person keeps inventing them to create a narrative.

57:35.800 --> 57:45.280
And I think there is this issue of people lying or borderline lying in order to create

57:45.280 --> 57:52.600
a narrative for themselves about their lives, their past, their aims, their goals etc.

57:52.600 --> 57:57.960
I think it's a very important topic because it addresses the question of motivation.

57:57.960 --> 58:02.080
I mean before we were talking about legal matters, okay someone's fighting for their

58:02.080 --> 58:03.240
life.

58:03.240 --> 58:07.880
But what about people who just routinely confabulate and make things up and exaggerate

58:07.880 --> 58:12.760
and so forth and so on.

58:12.760 --> 58:20.640
Sometimes people like that actually go to seek help because it's compulsive and they

58:20.640 --> 58:23.560
can't stop themselves and they run into trouble.

58:23.560 --> 58:29.240
But of course it's very challenging to treat people like that as a clinician because they

58:29.240 --> 58:34.720
put you in a situation where you never know if they're lying or not to you or they tell

58:34.720 --> 58:39.640
you stories about I fooled this one and I told that one that and so forth and so on.

58:39.640 --> 58:46.880
So it puts you that in a position of either you are like the moralist in which case you

58:46.880 --> 58:53.080
become the enemy or how are you going to help them figure it all out.

58:53.080 --> 58:58.600
Why they're doing it or how to stop it etc.

58:58.600 --> 59:03.480
It's an interesting kind of question so I was just curious what your experience is

59:03.480 --> 59:05.440
with any of that.

59:05.440 --> 59:09.960
I mean I've encountered such people.

59:09.960 --> 59:13.480
It took me quite a few months the first time I encountered such a person to understand

59:13.480 --> 59:16.600
that that's what they were and that such a thing existed.

59:16.600 --> 59:20.640
I like to believe I've gotten faster at it.

59:20.640 --> 59:27.160
I feel like one of those things those experiences have taught me is how little consistency is

59:27.160 --> 59:29.640
actually required to be convincing.

59:29.640 --> 59:33.040
We have this idea that one of the drawbacks of lying is then you've got to keep your

59:33.040 --> 59:38.960
story straight which is true but it's actually not that hard to just oh I thought I said

59:38.960 --> 59:39.960
something out or gaslighting.

59:39.960 --> 59:44.280
No that's not what I said at all or that's not what I meant or that's not a relevant

59:44.280 --> 59:48.560
fact because even though you saw me steal this thing what was actually happening is that

59:48.560 --> 59:56.200
I was pressured into it and when you deal with these people you see these incredible

59:56.200 --> 01:00:06.200
often very charismatic, manipulative, it's hard to do it justice but to me what the existence

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:14.080
of such people and their ability to operate says is that we actually are relatively poor

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.640
at enforcing epistemic norms.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.200
We're actually pretty bad at making people be self-consistent although we often have

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.600
a sense right we often know something is wrong and I think the process of encountering these

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.400
people multiple times is to develop that sense and to learn to trust it.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.520
Do you remember that play six degrees of separation was this guy who was insinuating himself into

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.480
all kinds of situations and got away with it for the longest time.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.320
Oh I'm fascinated by con man it's such a crazy topic.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.640
So that's an extreme case but then we have situations of people who just the limit con

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.240
money and what's that like.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.400
We don't see them too often in the consulting room but occasionally we do and that it's

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.360
really scary.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:12.960
I feel like the especially tricky case is when someone with that personality bent is

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.320
telling you about an injustice that was done to them and then you're in the challenging

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:23.240
position of trying to understand to what extent do you believe their version of the story

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:28.280
which I'm sure you must have encountered.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:33.560
It kind of goes back to the question we started with right so most people think right what

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.840
distinguishes a good or a bad lie in terms of the moral sense as if it helps or harms

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840
others.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.160
The fitting, the impression management, the fooling is not directly harming an identified

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160
person.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:53.120
It's very easy to believe this is in sport and people with a normal psychological profile

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.400
really care about harm.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.200
What we care about is harming others and so in the absence of evidence that I'm directly

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:05.080
harming someone it's quite easy to believe that I'm not actually doing anything wrong.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.800
And you guys both brought up this interesting example over like the con man I think something

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:15.280
that makes it more complicated is we do actually have this admirable narrative of people who

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.840
are really good at deception and as kids again we read stories of the widely coyote like these

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.720
characters who are able to do great things through deceiving others in clever ways, the

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.720
trickster.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.600
And so there's this other part of deception going through everyone's head that is like

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:41.200
there's good stuff here if I can't see the harm and that probably makes it really easy

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200
to keep going.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.400
Yeah I think that's just a related maybe to learning as well.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.920
We know that a path of mechanism for learning is what's the consequence.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.240
If I just go out and steal something I'm going to get punished there and then so it's pretty

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.200
clear that I shouldn't do that but with the sort of cases you're telling about where it's

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.640
sort of ongoing, little lies here, little lies there.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.280
You can't instantly see what the consequence is on that person and that consequence might

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.880
come quite far down the line as well so it's quite hard to sort of tie it to your actions

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:15.200
so maybe that lack of learning is what allows it to continue perhaps.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.160
Well even lack of learning or learning that it works.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.760
All that as well yeah also getting like positive reinforcement from it maybe as well.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.640
You know one of the interesting things developmentally is that very little kids let's say five or

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.840
four under more or less they think that their parents practically read their minds.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.680
They think that the parents know everything that's going on so if they do something they

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.840
shouldn't and they get caught they're not surprised because they kind of assume that

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.240
the mom and dad kind of knew in the first place there's this fantasy of parents being

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:57.400
so omnipotent and it's kind of a major developmental step in the sort of separation and be developing

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:04.920
one's identity to know that in fact if you say something that's not true maybe they don't

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:12.640
know and oh you kind of left your own devices on your own but you can do that.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.280
So then how do people decide after all that they should be truthful.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.800
It has something to do with what we call superior formation in other words people feel like

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:30.160
they want to be loved and they want to be just like their parents, upright citizens if

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:35.680
they come from that kind of a family so this whole story about that about who your models

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:45.880
are and that it's you're going to love yourself if you're being kind of truthful and honest

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.680
to yourself and you're going to feel ashamed and guilty and not like yourself if you lie

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:58.880
etc very basic stuff but it's something that develops gradually and then what we call you

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.920
know sort of beginning of the latency at the age where in all cultures people go to school

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.800
and so on they get very creative rules of what are the rules of that culture and then

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.800
they have a sense of belonging to the community if they obey the rules so there's a lot of

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:18.880
incentive for socialization both from the family and through the community to be a good citizen

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:27.720
but there are often situations where that development is faulty because let's say the

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.160
parents are doing something deceitful like one of the parents is having an affair and

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.920
says oh don't tell that or whatever and then the kid doesn't know what to think anymore

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:49.120
and so that this what should be a very solid sense of right and wrong gets bent and twisted

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:56.080
and the rest is history as to what what then happens with that so in our work as as analysts

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:03.080
we try to go back and understand something about the origins of some of these lesions

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:09.960
in one sense of integrity which are manifold you know I think all of us are keeping in

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:15.200
line with these comments most of us can seem to be able to appreciate pretty well I guess

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.240
because we've all lied to some degree what their incentives are to telling a falsehood

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.160
and that it may be adaptive in certain instances it may be con men for example and they do

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.280
unfortunately tend to be men more often than women not exclusively there's Elizabeth Holmes

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:36.480
but men seem to lead the pack when it comes to that anyway there's a new idea I believe

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.400
the anthropologist name is Richard Rangam this last name is Rangam who's written about

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:46.520
the self domestication of the human you know the humans human race I guess and in it he

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:54.960
said that there was a sort of a movement towards trying to get rid of the more aggressive violent

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.000
and but also lying and cheating members of the of the group of the tribe and this was a way

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:07.320
of pushing back against that type that may be selected to a degree the con men type con

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.480
man type who may have been selected so again I'm going back to my feeling about being unbiased

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.480
there are some pressures and incentives towards being unbiased and I think that's sort of

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:25.240
what Rangam was trying to bring out in his in this new book about self domestication so

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:32.720
I wonder is that in this sort of skepticism about bias don't we believe there are incentives

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:38.520
you mentioned Anna trying to live up to the ideal of your parents assuming your parents

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:44.480
are honest people aren't their incentives to being fair and honest even when it's a challenge

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:53.880
to you personally I mean certainly there are such incentives invented in the professional

01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:02.440
structure of journalism which I think actually surprises many people journalism turned out

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:10.960
to be more idealistic than I thought it would be actually but there are both internal incentives

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:16.920
in terms of norms and standards and you know I sometimes think of Columbia journalism school

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:21.440
as this cathedral of journalism right it's this big old building and there's plaques on

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:26.240
the walls and it's got the Pulitzer Prizes right it's a very it functions as a cathedral

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.520
it's like this sort of awe inspiring symbol but there's also just reputation right if you're

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.600
wrong too many times you have trashed your credibility unfortunately the flip side of

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:46.440
that is that it means also as a public information source or a public figure you are subject

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:51.360
to political attacks so I mean that's part of what is happening now is there are enormous

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.240
political attacks on the press which is you know certainly not new in a world historical

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:06.520
sense but is relatively new in this country I mean you could make the case for dishonesty

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.080
being good in some cases as well right you know in World War II Churchill would lie about

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.440
how well we were doing you know in the war and that was to you know really encourage

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.000
us to keep going and that's true with individual case of optimism as well you know it's quite

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.920
good if you get rejected from a job interview or asking someone out for a date you know to

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.320
really believe the next time you know it's going to be successful so you know sort of

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.760
delusion at different levels can be can be a good thing in certain cases I think if you

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:43.880
are a psychoanalyst like I am if you go to a party and there's a patient of yours there

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:48.760
you are not going to shake the hands and tell everybody oh here's my patient you're going

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:54.840
to keep quiet about it you may not even acknowledge the patient in order not to create any problems

01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:02.160
with issues of confidentiality so you are being deceitful you are not actively lying

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:11.440
but but you have to and there are many situations where one has in a way there is no other way

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.280
but so I realize that there's this whole moral component and there's this whole area of

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:24.840
terrible to lie but there's also a usefulness to it the question is how does one really

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:31.320
distinguish between days and is it only based on the outcome on the motivation what what

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:37.120
makes the difference and then there are all all all degrees of lying for example we all

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:44.600
enjoy being deceived by a magician we know he's deceiving we know of you yet we have

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:51.080
tremendous enjoyment from it so there are all these complexes is having to do with neuroscience

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:56.160
which I think perhaps we don't fully understand that have to do with this phenomena we call

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:05.760
lying a lot of the judgment is also culturally bound so in the US we we believe in autonomy

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.960
we believe in knowledge right obviously there's some variance in that from person to person

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.960
and different personality traits and political leanings but mostly we're a country that believes

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.520
in autonomy or the culture here so I should have knowledge for self governance and that's

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:24.360
part of the reason that honesty is so important but that's not true everywhere right so in

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:30.680
eastern Asian cultures right dignity and authority are more important than necessarily self knowledge

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:36.720
so right there there's it's not as if the whole world is living in this debate that tonight

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.960
should we be telling the truth and a lot of other cultures they're saying no we shouldn't

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:47.080
always be telling the truth right so medicines and examples I've done studies in oncology

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.120
units and in the US actually a lot of patients want more false hope than their doctors are

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.640
willing to give them but in China it's very it's very common to get false hope and that's

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.480
part of the expectation we could argue whether that's normatively good or normatively bad

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:08.400
but there's certainly lots of different beliefs you know aside from the belief that truthfulness

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.320
is what should be guiding most of our traitors is a movie about that yeah that's farewell yeah

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:19.440
yeah what's the movie farewell farewell yeah about the difference between how that's handled

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.800
the truth about a medical prognosis is handled in China versus a US US it does raise a question

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.440
about how much we want to know about ourselves there's both a medical question one specific

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.520
example is increasingly we're able through brain and blood biomarkers and genetic information

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.920
to determine one's probabilistic likelihood of developing Alzheimer's and other dementia

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:46.920
and the country and other populations roughly split 50 50 50 percent of people say I want

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:50.280
to know because I want to plan so forth the other 50 percent say given that we don't

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:56.360
have a cure right now don't tell me but there's a deeper way in which we have to ask ourselves

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.960
do we really want to know who we are and this is in part when we say you've got to go to

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.680
some constantly why because you're not seeing who you are how angry you are how narcissistic

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.560
or you know you're not seeing what you are as a parent and that's a really challenging

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.080
question do we want to know how much of the whole truth I was very difficult for myself

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.760
certainly I think for many of us but it gets started I think at this point again there's

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.720
a medical one is almost easier sometimes to compartmentalize you know go around me as

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.640
a husband as a father you know as a friend as a colleague how well did I actually do

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.400
the right it's challenging to confront that maybe more challenging than what we do in

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:43.960
law okay all right great thank you everyone I think it's time we can have a few of the

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.960
audience members ask questions if you line up back here I'm sure our panelists would

01:13:50.960 --> 01:14:12.960
be happy to respond to the question for everyone on the panel one is the time that each one

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.920
of you lied and reflecting back on that would have will tell that lie again I'll answer

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:24.160
that I was thinking about on the server there so my brother and I over two years apart we

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.760
look kind of similar so much so that when we go out and we recently celebrated our joint

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.320
40th birthday he's 39 I'm 41 and this is the year we're both 40 and a lot of people said

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.480
oh that's great we were the same close these Elvis costumes are you twins yeah we're twins

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.800
it's our birth we said that all night and after a while we're like let's see you know

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.520
let's see what can we add to the story you know from we're not from Hawaii we're from

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.800
Hawaii and all this kind of stuff what I do it again if I turn 40 again absolutely it

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:56.560
was great everyone got a kick out of it you know I don't go into your question I don't

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:03.240
think anyone was irreparably harmed yeah I don't know how we were intentional about it

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:24.200
was not true that's a good one we'll just go for one bit I create a system of lies at

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:34.040
the border I would do it again what I created a system of lies at the border representing

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:39.880
immigrants trying to come into the country and I would do it again

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:51.880
you're saying you're here in public yes I'm having trouble coming up with one I told although

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:58.560
I'm sure I have but I can recall like circumstances in which I was grateful being lied to so I

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.520
was planning my wedding the first year of graduate school when I was preparing for my

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:09.160
qualifying exam my my grandfather wanted to invite all of his friends to my wedding which

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.240
we didn't have space for like totally wasn't feasible we didn't have enough invitations

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.720
for them my mother said don't worry like you study I got this we're not going to invite

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:24.240
them I found out like the day before my wedding that she had photocopied my wedding invitations

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.320
and sent them to all of my grandfather's friends who she knew wouldn't come right she

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.600
knew that like this is going to be the easiest thing she I'm not going to be harmed I'm

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.600
going to be able to live in my bubble not stressed about my wedding and I'm great like I'm

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:48.440
very grateful that she pulled pulled it up so my quest comments slash question is more

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:55.320
about as a physician and the sort of the sense of knowing sometimes when the patient's not

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:00.880
telling the truth and the search for the truth to prove that the patient's not telling you

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:08.880
like patients with pseudo seizures or a fictitious disorder malingering and how sometimes just

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.000
the sense that as humans sometimes we feel that sense when we're not being told the truth

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.560
even when we could even have clinical evidence in like fictitious disorder that it's not

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:27.320
true and we search for some sort of inconsistency or sometimes we really can't find it so I

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.000
often think of that because we really trust that what the patient's telling us is true

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:39.040
so maybe I I'm also at part time a neuropsychiatrist so it's a joke I am a neuropsychiatrist but

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:46.640
full-time and I've treated people with pseudo seizures and fictitious illness and it is

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.920
I think the answer is very simple it's just that I think that as a physician you have

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.360
to not feel offended and angry that the person's been deceiving you often they don't know

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:01.280
they're even or why they're deceiving you and so being disarmed not feeling angry or

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.920
with the patient it seems to me to be pretty easy just to say well you're you're not having

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.800
real epilepsy you don't have real epilepsy and where this isn't a real illness and patients

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:17.360
respond incredibly well to that I find I haven't had patients who've come to me with those sorts

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.240
of problems leave because I said you know I don't believe I don't believe this is a real

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:28.160
the diagnosis you think it may be just be honest

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:35.400
to the lawyers or the legal people that is that amitol interview ever used in legal cases

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.040
truth serum as it's called is truth serum ever used not in the United States it has

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:44.800
been used in the last few years in India in some cases there have been two cases of brain

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.080
based MRI based lie detection where the in there was proffered in both the state case

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.600
in Maryland and the federal case in Tennessee it was excluded and there are some other types

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.520
of technologies that are being proffered they're not yet ready for another day there's a discussion

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.160
about it and we have this panel in 20 years if some of those technologies have come into

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.960
the courtroom is polygraph still used in us call the polygraph is used extensively in

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.960
the investigation phase but is not it's not typically allowed it's typically excluded

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.680
in the guilt phase in the courtroom phase it's also used sometimes in some probation and parole

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.400
considerations for instance with sex offenders if they're determined if they're ready to go back

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:35.120
to society it's partly common partly question first I would like to say let's be honest

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:44.160
the route is not very entertaining what about literature what about art what about creativity

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:54.040
it's all established on on lies what's the question it's a question I'm saying that it's

01:19:54.040 --> 01:20:07.800
partly question partly common and yes thank you and in American society when I came here

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:15.240
twenty five years ago I start to learn that's deception for example advertising it's probably

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:24.680
most but you know most obvious than probably in any other society to have to learn deception

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:32.480
if what we right now we see in our white house we see that guy who obviously like and it's

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:38.640
kind of very entertaining for both sides here it is not that entertaining at all and from

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:47.560
one side is like I'm outraged from other side I'm it's she said what I was thinking for a

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:57.280
long time so it's kind of we have this in the time and it's and he probably won't because

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:04.280
of his that he's good in line and Hillary is not Hillary is not good in like everybody

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:11.840
you agree so could you please say that what about all these areas like advertisement

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:23.760
literature arts in general well we should put the what they they are all in our society

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:31.560
I would make a very big distinction between art and literature and advertisement because

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:37.160
advertisement is to I mean unless you say that art and literature is to sell its own

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:44.160
product but it's considered fabrication or fiction whereas advertisement is trying to

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.840
sell something into embellish it for purpose of selling it but I think the whole question

01:21:50.840 --> 01:22:02.200
of lying and fabrications and art is a very interesting spectrum because a really good

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:11.200
impersonator or one of these people who's a practice liar is kind of an artist they

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:22.200
are they have the finesse and the ability to create illusion and so forth so there's a

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:28.600
kinship with artists and Thomas money somebody who was very very interested in this issue

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:35.280
and he's written some interesting things about it one of them is a novel called Felix cruel

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.240
the adventures of Felix cruel and it's based on the memoirs of somebody who was a very

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:46.880
famous of all things Romanian swindler and I'm saying of all things because I'm from

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:56.080
Romania and he he was fascinated by this the name of the swindler was different but in the

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.400
Thomas Monstory he wrote he worked on this novel on and off for many years till the end

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:07.680
of his life and I don't think he even finished it because this guy was able to impersonate

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:15.520
so many people and Rob hotels and so forth he was quite a swindler there's another story

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:22.320
by Thomas Mon called Tonya Kroger it's a short story in which the main character is kind of

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.440
torn between being a businessman and an artist because his father was a businessman his mother

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:32.920
was artistic and he could never quite find his footing anywhere but he's mostly an artist

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.680
and in it he's fascinated by the whole question of what does it take to be an artist compared

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:45.320
to kind of a square conventional super straight type of guy and how come he couldn't find

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.240
his place in a super straight world and maybe to be an artist you have to be a little outside

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.600
of things an outsider to be able to describe things and therefore already not adhering to

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:01.800
the rules of the community so I don't know if this is this addresses what you're asking

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:07.360
but I've thought about it in the context of this preparing for the round table so on that

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:16.080
subject of deception and versus an honest person why is it that in literature and in theater

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:23.080
the most fascinating characters are the bad guys absolutely okay anybody come in yes I

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:39.040
think the bad guys have the characteristics yes yes I won't go into the other stuff yes

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:46.040
yes you asked about whether it's a law and I said yes I think it's related to the issue

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:52.120
why why are it seems because I think the the final research in this is not clear but it

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:59.960
looks as though falsehoods as you were mentioning earlier spreads faster than truth and it's

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:07.680
more sensational so I that's a simple version of why I think these stories and also I think

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.440
there's a certain tension when someone's telling a lie and typically is part of some

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.360
work of literature or stage production you're aware there's this tension as an audience

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.560
and that creates tension in you and then you're what's going to happen next right so I think

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:31.560
that sort of generates a lot of interest in in lying yeah yeah I like that I like that

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:38.520
explanation that it creates attention because actually the essence of theater is conflict

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.600
so if it's everybody agree yeah we all agree it's not interesting the fact that you disagree

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:51.160
the fact that there's it's not so simple the complexity I think is what draws us to the

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.160
facets yeah link to that I think what we don't we often aren't actually that fascinated

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.400
with people that are purely evil what we really like is people that are sort of essentially

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.200
good but a bit flawed and that might be because that's basically like us right like we want

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.320
to be seen as these good people but we do have these sort of weaknesses you know we do lie

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.600
like most days to some some degree so maybe it resonates with us those types of characters

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:20.960
I don't know when when you had spoken about adultery and children of in conflicted families

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.200
I immediately was thinking of all these fabulous characters like Madame Bovary and just the

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:33.240
literature really is not is not made up of goody goody housewives it's the ones that you

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:40.800
know are peeking through the blinds and and your explanation of you know the why we're

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.880
more interested because it creates attention I think you really hit on something thank you

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:55.320
thank you thank you

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:03.880
so many things occur to me I really was thinking about sort of the demise of religion and these

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:15.400
kind of strong values systems and maybe the rise and acceptance of lying and you know

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:20.600
that that was one thing that occurred to me but on a on a bigger scale I'm wondering whether

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:30.440
the fact that there seemed to be no long no repercussions and no punishment for lying

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.120
on sort of a governmental scale on corporate scale whether you think of coverups or whether

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:43.880
you think of our president sort of being able to lie with kind of no nothing's been done

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.800
about it I mean he hasn't been impeached he hasn't you know there's no punishment and

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:56.000
what you see you know I think of the clergy and all those coverups and sort of the lack

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:05.480
of punishment for lying what you see as a long-term outlook for our democracy you know

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.960
where lying is just kind of accepted on a leadership level

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:18.880
I said there's a leisurely legal system that is supposed to deal with a lot of this I mean

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.840
my field is in the business of accountability right so I mean that's I would I would say

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.440
that there have been consequences maybe not the consequences there should have been or

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:38.120
the consequences you would have preferred but so I'll take a very concrete specific one

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.960
which is that Facebook collaborates with a number of fact checking organizations and

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:51.800
if a fact checking organization rates an article as substantially false they will reduce the

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:57.760
distribution of it on Facebook and apparently Facebook says you lose 80% of your reach if

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:08.040
a fact checker takes you as false so that's a very concrete economic hit for being labeled

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:15.280
as a lie they could do more though right as well I think you could have some rating of

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.760
information like potentially oh yeah like yeah let's let's do this for another 90 minutes

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:25.720
yeah I mean we I thought I was actually going to be asked to talk about all the disinformation

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:35.440
world I think we're a little late for a long explanation but I'm surprised to say that

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:42.560
all of the major social media platforms are deep in this issue and it's a it's a difficult

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:50.600
issue in part because it is an issue of who gets to decide so it's inextricably political

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:55.880
it's inextricably legal as well because if you have a global company whose standards

01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:01.240
do you use or do you show different people in different countries different things which

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:08.520
has its own implications and problems so it's not at all a simple question and then there's

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:14.360
the actual how do you decide if something is a lie and the platforms have mostly fallen

01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:25.040
back on essentially journalistic fact checking organizations which use a essentially open

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.360
ended variety of methods to try to verify things you know you'll you'll interview sources

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:35.280
you'll compare pictures you'll do technical analyses of the sources of a piece of information

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:43.800
I mean it's it's it's research in the broader sense and it and anything is fair game and

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:50.200
the idea is to try to produce these consequences right and in the sort of immediate sense as

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:54.640
in this article is false and in the broader sense as in you know we did this investigation

01:30:54.640 --> 01:31:01.360
and we concluded that you know somebody isn't bezling money or I think the sex scandals

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.880
in the Catholic Church are actually a prime example of the role of journalism and democracy

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:12.480
right there there is a movie about this yes we saw that's an excellent movie yeah thank

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.840
you I understand if you're pessimistic but I don't think it's fair to say that there

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:24.320
are no consequences well I want to thank everyone for their contribution today and and that's

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:39.800
oh you have one more question I know a guy really wanted a job so he applies does the

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:49.200
interview and he tells the interviewer I I can't work on the Sabbath the interviewer

01:31:49.200 --> 01:32:00.440
who says okay you're hired what he doesn't say and I said to him why didn't you tell the

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:06.000
interviewer that you also don't want to work on the religious holidays which will come in

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:17.080
six months and then he said well they won't give me the job okay he had already been fired

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:27.840
and sued on a different job that he had before because he sprung this on that company I can't

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:37.200
work on the Jewish holidays and he was fired from that job so he had some experience with

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:46.160
this then I said well what would happen if they hired you on this job you're now applying

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:57.080
for oh by the way on that first job he won $20,000 in court for religious intolerance so he would

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:09.960
say he said to me I would sue them and I said you know you're a excuse me a fucking liar and I

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:23.520
throw it out to you I don't know I don't know the outcome of it's your relative the answer to

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:34.160
that is yes I could I could actually I could actually embellish that but I won't I think I'm

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:42.720
sorry I'm sorry that you have a relative who's I just I just I think you told the truth thank you

01:33:42.720 --> 01:34:12.560
everybody thank you yeah it's all
