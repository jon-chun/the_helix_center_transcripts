00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
...

00:04.380 --> 00:09.220
...

00:09.300 --> 00:16.860
wise

00:17.700 --> 00:25.300
evidoring

00:25.300 --> 00:40.720
I'm Ed Nursece in Director of the Center.

00:40.720 --> 00:49.520
Before we get going on today's program that was proposed by Beverly Zabriski and Harold

00:49.520 --> 00:59.340
Atman Sparkers, I'd like to tell you what we are planning for spring of next year.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.560
So far we have planned three round tables.

01:02.560 --> 01:08.600
One will be on data versus this course, humanity is in the age of big data.

01:08.600 --> 01:16.280
The other would be on the ethics of AI, machine learning, and the last one would be on the

01:16.280 --> 01:21.800
general subject of memory looked at from various perspectives.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.000
Beverly will take over from this point and introduce the speakers.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Thank you.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Let's see.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.640
Let me do this way.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.320
Welcome, welcome.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.840
The persons in this room are one of the three audiences for this program.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.360
There is also a live stream audience and there will also be a YouTube audience going

01:47.360 --> 01:49.680
through the years.

01:49.680 --> 01:57.400
So remember that if you get up and ask a question or make a remark, you will be recorded out

01:57.400 --> 02:04.680
at infinitum and that's taken as a release that we are allowed to use your question

02:04.680 --> 02:08.560
and your presence in the YouTube video.

02:08.560 --> 02:13.880
So welcome to all three audiences to this day.

02:13.880 --> 02:21.000
I'm a Jungian analyst at Gave Me Permission to say that in this hallowed building and

02:21.000 --> 02:24.640
tells you what an ecumenical mind he has.

02:24.640 --> 02:30.320
And Jung said that if he ever came back to another life, he would study prime numbers.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.600
That's how he would spend his time.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.920
And he urged all of his followers to do so.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.840
I have not done so.

02:38.840 --> 02:46.680
So the closest I get to understanding mathematics is by being around minds like in this circle.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.960
And so I think that's a pleasure we'll all have today.

02:49.960 --> 02:56.320
So thank you all for agreeing to come and to be with us and Alma, especially to you.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.120
You stepped in the last minute because Stephanie was ill.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
So thank you.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.240
Alma did not intend to be here this morning and here she is.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.760
And she's a great lady.

03:08.760 --> 03:13.560
So Harold and I were talking about this as a possibility and he suggested the title

03:13.560 --> 03:15.720
Mathematics and Other Reality.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.280
So that's what we'll be speaking about today.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.520
And it's a spontaneous conversation.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.920
There's been no preparation.

03:23.920 --> 03:31.200
And it's meant to be scholars and intellectuals who hear each other and then get into an exchange.

03:31.200 --> 03:36.440
Harold is a senior scientist at the Collegium Helvetium at the University of Zurich and

03:36.440 --> 03:40.080
the Polytechnic in Zurich.

03:40.080 --> 03:46.720
After a PhD in physics at Munich, he worked as a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute

03:46.720 --> 03:50.040
for extraterrestrial physics.

03:50.040 --> 03:55.200
Then he served as head of the theory group at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology

03:55.200 --> 03:57.360
at Freiburg.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.040
This fields of research are the theory of complex systems, conceptual and theoretical

04:02.040 --> 04:07.520
aspects of quantum theory and mind matter relations.

04:07.520 --> 04:12.280
He's the president of the Society for Mind and Matter Research and editor in chief of the

04:12.280 --> 04:16.640
interdisciplinary journal Mind and Matter.

04:16.640 --> 04:22.080
Last summer I went to Harold's conference on the Science of Consciousness in Interlochen.

04:22.080 --> 04:27.960
He said it was one of their smallest conferences, it was 620 scientists from around the world

04:27.960 --> 04:34.040
discussing the matter of consciousness and where it emerges from and scientific perspectives

04:34.040 --> 04:35.600
on that.

04:35.600 --> 04:40.800
And Switzerland, we like to keep everything small.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.120
We're a small country, after all.

04:45.120 --> 04:50.480
And then Amma Steingaard.

04:50.480 --> 04:55.360
Herages the interplay between politics and mathematical rationality.

04:55.360 --> 05:02.440
Her second book, Accountable Democracy, Mathematical Reasoning and Representative Democracy in America,

05:02.440 --> 05:09.320
1920 to Now, examines how mathematical thought and computing technologies have impacted electoral

05:09.320 --> 05:13.640
politics in the U.S. in the 20th century.

05:13.640 --> 05:19.560
She investigates how changing computational practices from statistical modeling to geometrical

05:19.560 --> 05:27.040
analysis insinuated themselves into the most basic definitions of fair representation of

05:27.040 --> 05:28.920
the American electorate.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.360
Nothing could be more timely than what you're working on.

05:32.360 --> 05:38.220
In pure abstraction, mathematical thought and high modernism forthcoming.

05:38.220 --> 05:44.400
She investigates the influence of axiomatic reasoning on mid-century American intellectual

05:44.400 --> 05:45.800
thought.

05:45.800 --> 05:50.840
She's a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows and a pre-doctoral research fellow

05:50.840 --> 05:54.320
with the Max Planck Institute in Berlin.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
Pardon me?

05:55.320 --> 05:57.960
I was a junior fellow.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.760
I'm now in Columbia.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
All right.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.960
So, yes, that's true.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.000
You are now a professor at Columbia that was not added to this.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.400
Thank you.

06:09.400 --> 06:16.040
Michael Harris has become a mainstay intellect of the Helix group here.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.840
He's a professor of mathematics at Columbia and is on extended leave from the University

06:20.840 --> 06:24.880
Perry D. Duro where he taught for 20 years.

06:24.880 --> 06:29.680
He was professor of Brandeis, got his PhD from Harvard.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.880
He's organized and co-organized more than 20 conferences and workshops.

06:34.880 --> 06:41.880
In his field of number theory and until 2018 directed the European Research Council Project,

06:41.880 --> 06:44.960
arithmetic of automorphic motives.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.040
Fantastic.

06:47.040 --> 06:52.680
I have to find out what it means, but I know it's fantastic.

06:52.680 --> 06:59.320
He's been a visiting professor at Bethlehem University in Palestine.

06:59.320 --> 07:04.840
He's been an exchange scholar at the Stecholov Institute in Moscow.

07:04.840 --> 07:14.000
He's initiated the project of science for people in Nicaragua and London Paris number

07:14.000 --> 07:15.800
theory seminar.

07:15.800 --> 07:22.680
His book, Mathematics Without Apologies won the Prose Award in Mathematics.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.520
He is a contributions to the Langlands program.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.200
Maybe you'll tell us what that is.

07:28.200 --> 07:34.480
He won the Grand Prix Sophie's Jormendow, Blocademy in Sciences in 2006.

07:34.480 --> 07:43.160
That he asked me to condense his introduction because it was not too long, so many accomplishments.

07:43.160 --> 07:48.920
Harry Field is a silver professor and university professor at NYU.

07:48.920 --> 07:53.360
Before that he taught at Princeton, USC and CUNY Graduate Center.

07:53.360 --> 08:00.280
He's the author of Science Without Numbers, Expanded Edition, and Saving Truth from Paradox.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.440
As well as numerous articles in the philosophy of mathematics and logic.

08:05.440 --> 08:11.360
His Science Without Numbers defends the view that one can develop physics without assuming

08:11.360 --> 08:14.440
the existence of mathematical entities.

08:14.440 --> 08:22.320
He's been working in the philosophy of mathematics, less on the existence of mathematical entities,

08:22.320 --> 08:30.120
and more on the objectivity of mathematics, which you're going to prove today.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.120
Chris McDonald.

08:34.120 --> 08:38.360
McDaniel has a BA in Philosophy from Western Washington University.

08:38.360 --> 08:44.440
His PhD in Philosophy is from University of Massachusetts Amherst.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.200
He's been teaching at Syracuse University until 2019 and is now professor of Philosophy

08:50.200 --> 08:52.160
at Notre Dame.

08:52.160 --> 08:58.320
His publications include the books The Fragmentation of Being and this is metaphysics, which is

08:58.320 --> 08:59.320
forthcoming.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.560
Topics in metaphysics, ethics in the history of philosophy.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.320
Welcome, Chris.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.080
Marcus.

09:09.080 --> 09:15.040
He's one of the founders of New Realism.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.600
He studied in Heidelberg, Lisbon, New York.

09:17.600 --> 09:24.960
He has held the chair since 2009 for epistemology, modern and contemporary philosophy at the University

09:24.960 --> 09:26.120
of Bonn.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.560
And at his appointment, he became Germany's youngest philosophy professor.

09:30.560 --> 09:36.480
Now I just heard you upstairs tell the others that now there's a younger one.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.360
The mathematics, he also won a fields medalist at my university, he was hired one month

09:40.360 --> 09:44.520
after me, so I was the youngest full professor at my university for one month.

09:44.520 --> 09:51.560
And then Peter Fausberg was hired at the age of 21 and just won the fields medal last year,

09:51.560 --> 09:53.840
so apparently you go tired.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.480
Yeah, so that's the reality of mathematics.

09:57.480 --> 10:03.520
Someone comes along younger, right?

10:03.520 --> 10:08.840
He's also the director of the International Center for Philosophy in Bonn as well as the

10:08.840 --> 10:12.720
Multidisciplinary Center for Science and Thought.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.600
He's held faculty in visiting positions at many different universities, including NYU,

10:17.600 --> 10:21.360
and he's written popular books about philosophical issues.

10:21.360 --> 10:26.760
His book Why the World Does Not Exist has been translated into 14 languages.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.520
Sometimes we wish that was right, right?

10:29.520 --> 10:35.960
So I would now, after this long pause, ask Harold to open up the discussion and thank

10:35.960 --> 10:39.520
you for your patience.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.920
On this round table, you will hear a lot about the term ontology and ontology as opposed

10:45.920 --> 10:47.200
to epistemology.

10:47.200 --> 10:54.120
So I thought it might be a good idea to start with a very brief, maybe anecdotal piece,

10:54.120 --> 11:00.400
which illustrates to everybody what ontology is all about, what epistemology is all about,

11:00.400 --> 11:03.800
and then we might go from there.

11:03.800 --> 11:10.480
In my example, my anecdote of course comes from the history of my own fields from physics.

11:10.480 --> 11:19.440
It goes back to the early 1930s, it goes to Ireland to Dublin because at that time I

11:19.440 --> 11:25.520
was working at Dublin and he was often visited by his physicist colleagues, like in this

11:25.520 --> 11:31.880
case, Erwin Wehrner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac.

11:31.880 --> 11:39.320
So Heisenberg and Dirac just took a little walk after the lunch out of Dublin in the hills,

11:39.320 --> 11:49.320
I hope, and then they come over such a hill and in the valley they see a huge herd of sheep.

11:49.320 --> 11:58.680
And Heisenberg says, look Dirac, these sheep are all shorn and Dirac, he was known as a

11:58.680 --> 12:04.560
very meticulous thinker, so he had to analyze the statement before he could answer.

12:04.560 --> 12:13.280
And then he said, well Heisenberg, at least on this side.

12:13.280 --> 12:20.960
So you see, this is about being and knowing, right?

12:20.960 --> 12:28.520
So I don't think I have to explain that, but being, this is the notion of philosophy which

12:28.520 --> 12:30.200
ontology deals with.

12:30.200 --> 12:36.760
So ontology is about existence, whenever you make an existence statement and philosophy

12:36.760 --> 12:39.320
this is about ontology.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.880
Whenever you make a knowledge statement it's about epistemology.

12:43.880 --> 12:52.160
And I think many sciences in the 20th century have seen a tendency to build up an ontology

12:52.160 --> 12:58.840
which many of them call a fundamental ontology, which in physics would be about the existence

12:58.840 --> 13:05.880
of particles as kind of building blocks for the universe and everything else.

13:05.880 --> 13:13.360
Like for instance, biology, genes or even up to neuroscience is actually in some way,

13:13.360 --> 13:16.600
in one way or another reducible to these particles.

13:16.600 --> 13:21.240
Even though this program is of course not completed, but the assumption is in principle

13:21.240 --> 13:24.560
this is the way to go.

13:24.560 --> 13:30.360
And you know, when I still was a student I had a PhD advisor who could still tell me

13:30.360 --> 13:34.480
that chemistry is not yet understood physics.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.640
So the hope was really to take all of chemistry back into physics.

13:38.640 --> 13:45.960
And the research program for instance of microbiology or molecular biology is set up in the same

13:45.960 --> 13:48.320
spirit, just produced in the smaller parts.

13:48.320 --> 13:55.200
In the neuroscience there is the neuron doctrine where people think that you can understand

13:55.200 --> 14:02.600
everything in the brain once you understand how the neurons operate and cooperate.

14:02.600 --> 14:08.960
So this research program is the program in all these fields to build up the kind of fundamental

14:08.960 --> 14:12.000
ontology, we have the notion of ontology.

14:12.000 --> 14:18.600
So there's only one fundamental sort of beings and everything can be reduced to that.

14:18.600 --> 14:24.000
Now interestingly the second half of the 20th century voices here and there came up and

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
these voices became one more who sort of doubted that this is really working.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.840
So we see today a kind of development in which people at least in the natural sciences, that's

14:39.840 --> 14:46.800
what I can talk about really started out this notion of fundamental ontology.

14:46.800 --> 14:51.800
And talking about fundamental of course raises immediately a resonance with fundamentalism

14:51.800 --> 14:55.120
in much broader sense.

14:55.120 --> 15:02.800
So this round table is also at least to some extent a round table that could be, I don't

15:02.800 --> 15:10.480
know how it works, how it will develop, it could be a kind of critique or traces of a

15:10.480 --> 15:12.520
critique of fundamentalism generally.

15:12.520 --> 15:17.320
I mean in physics and in the sciences we see that anyway.

15:17.320 --> 15:30.120
And I'm really curious to hear from all of you how you think about that.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.120
You want to do a round?

15:31.120 --> 15:32.120
Sure.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
Yeah.

15:33.120 --> 15:34.120
Yeah.

15:34.120 --> 15:39.880
Well yeah I can say a few words about the meaning of those terms, how I understand them

15:39.880 --> 15:43.960
and then how this relates to this claim that you flack that the world does not exist which

15:43.960 --> 15:52.320
is short hand or like a slogan for saying that we shouldn't even be foundationalists

15:52.320 --> 15:56.760
in ontology itself which I think is not identical to physics.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.400
But just a few words about that how at least I understand those terms.

16:00.400 --> 16:09.680
So I think ontology is the systematic investigation into the meaning of existence or depending

16:09.680 --> 16:12.320
on your methodology just into existence.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
Right?

16:13.320 --> 16:17.120
So it might be a good idea to think about the meaning of existence, statements to approach

16:17.120 --> 16:18.120
existence.

16:18.120 --> 16:23.640
So that would be a good methodology that's why I'm saying it or just into existence.

16:23.640 --> 16:29.520
And epistemology is the discipline which deals with the nature and scope of what we can

16:29.520 --> 16:31.280
know about what there is.

16:31.280 --> 16:37.160
However I think that of course the two cannot be thoroughly separated because trivially

16:37.160 --> 16:39.360
knowledge exists.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
Right?

16:40.360 --> 16:48.760
So and what we've learned from just the development of modern natural science is precisely that

16:48.760 --> 16:54.240
there's a sense in which the universe insuffides the observable universe is somehow intimately

16:54.240 --> 17:02.120
tied to its nobility by creatures such as us for the trivial reason that our best and

17:02.120 --> 17:06.280
maybe only way but you will tell me about that to know anything about the observable

17:06.280 --> 17:10.200
universe is by way of interfering with it.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.200
Right?

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
By intervening.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.640
That's you know you don't know the universe a priori maybe there's something that you

17:15.640 --> 17:20.840
know about the universe without experiments such as that the universe is the universe

17:20.840 --> 17:26.280
or maybe some more demanding things but anyhow so you know I think that one of the things

17:26.280 --> 17:30.440
that we actually learn from the development of modern science is that we need to take

17:30.440 --> 17:34.160
into account that no one exists within the universe.

17:34.160 --> 17:38.840
So this is something that I would also like to discuss with some people here.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
Right?

17:39.840 --> 17:46.280
There seem to be paradigm cases of very demanding knowledge claims where we precisely cannot

17:46.280 --> 17:53.280
just distinguish between epistemology and ontology in that neat way.

17:53.280 --> 18:07.520
Oh well I have opinions about the universe but none of them is legitimated by my professional

18:07.520 --> 18:10.560
expertise I'm going to keep them to myself.

18:10.560 --> 18:18.480
And instead I'm going to talk about what existence might mean to a mathematician because

18:18.480 --> 18:27.040
it's a word that is used systematically and yet as I've thought about this for some time

18:27.040 --> 18:35.360
I in its use the use entails no metaphysical commitment whatsoever.

18:35.360 --> 18:44.040
This is certainly how I understand it now there are versions or interpretations of the foundations

18:44.040 --> 18:49.680
of mathematics say a hundred years ago people might have thought differently that it is

18:49.680 --> 18:59.400
a need to found mathematics on something that's metaphysically transparent but not so many

18:59.400 --> 19:08.720
people think that way anymore and when the word existence is so that a typical mathematical

19:08.720 --> 19:13.880
statement begins the theorem there exists such and such.

19:13.880 --> 19:19.960
Another typical opening for mathematical statement is let X be something.

19:19.960 --> 19:26.640
When you analyze that of course this is just really a performative gesture that is saying

19:26.640 --> 19:35.480
this is how one opens the discussion if you analyze that's an imperative.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.640
Now who is to whom is that imperative addressed?

19:39.640 --> 19:45.840
It's nobody who is reading it is going to object or is going to prevent this X from

19:45.840 --> 19:46.840
existing.

19:46.840 --> 19:53.640
So this is just a way of talking and you might say that mathematicians have managed

19:53.640 --> 20:01.320
to develop a coherent system of communication in the absence in spite of the disadvantages

20:01.320 --> 20:03.760
of natural language the fact that.

20:03.760 --> 20:13.720
So that's a first approach and the other thing I would say is that at least over the past

20:13.720 --> 20:19.880
well maybe 50, 70 years mathematics has been increasingly the practice of mathematics has

20:19.880 --> 20:27.440
been increasingly dominated especially in my field of number theory by the fact that

20:27.440 --> 20:33.040
our imaginations are expectations have outrun our ability to verify them.

20:33.040 --> 20:40.320
So there are large programs in which people are working.

20:40.320 --> 20:49.760
The aim of which is to construct objects whose existence in whatever sense one wants

20:49.760 --> 20:57.840
to mean that and again I don't think it's metaphysically very significant but the existence

20:57.840 --> 20:59.040
has been anticipated.

20:59.040 --> 21:03.240
So there's a that's to say there's a there are series of conjectures that such and such

21:03.240 --> 21:10.840
as structure should be invoked to explain the what has already been studied in terms

21:10.840 --> 21:14.560
of something more.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.040
So this is this is a this is a different this part of the discussion I don't want to get

21:18.040 --> 21:23.560
into it but something that one might call more fundamental although in a sense it's the opposite

21:23.560 --> 21:27.040
of more fundamental as that would be used by the physicists.

21:27.040 --> 21:33.720
So for example Peter Scholzem was given this position became the youngest professor in

21:33.720 --> 21:40.280
Germany on the basis of his contributions to constructing a theory kind of theory that

21:40.280 --> 21:48.520
had been anticipated that explain many many of the phenomena that had been or the mathematical

21:48.520 --> 21:49.520
theorems that had been developed.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.840
So I think I should just stop there.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.840
Sure.

21:52.840 --> 21:59.080
I'm I have to say I guess the two things that I want to say isn't I come to I'm an historian

21:59.080 --> 22:03.240
so I come to this question for a little bit from a different perspective.

22:03.240 --> 22:08.480
What I'm interested in is the question how question of existence ideas about ontology

22:08.480 --> 22:12.800
and specific specifically in mathematics have changed over time.

22:12.800 --> 22:18.200
So what Michael was just talking about the question about foundation right we know that

22:18.200 --> 22:23.240
interest in the foundation of mathematics really at the end of the 19th century and the 10th

22:23.240 --> 22:28.160
or 20th century really start because of the discovery of non Euclidean geometry right.

22:28.160 --> 22:34.960
So part of what interests me is how new mathematical developments new idea new research project

22:34.960 --> 22:41.440
call into question what are already kind of existing assumptions that people and mostly

22:41.440 --> 22:47.400
are both philosophers but they're also thinking about mathematicians himself are thinking.

22:47.400 --> 22:53.320
So this is kind of the the question that interests me is how this idea is about ontology and

22:53.320 --> 22:58.400
post-emology change over time in relation to research itself.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.080
And then to get to this question that you're saying about the ontology and epistemology

23:02.080 --> 23:06.560
I was very interesting because one of the things that I've been thinking about for a

23:06.560 --> 23:11.200
long time is that in a way in mathematics there is no distinction between ontology and

23:11.200 --> 23:16.360
epistemology I mean I know I'm saying I know it's a big claim and I'm throwing it on purpose

23:16.360 --> 23:23.480
out there but if you take something let's take something like that notion that there

23:23.480 --> 23:25.960
exists a four dimensional object right.

23:25.960 --> 23:31.360
For years for centuries mathematicians did not acknowledge that this is something that's

23:31.360 --> 23:37.080
even possibility it's only in the 19th century that this idea that the four dimensional space

23:37.080 --> 23:45.000
right exists comes along and then first how mathematicians learn to think about the four

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
dimension also then shapes what is the existence of a four dimension is.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.520
There's a way in which the way people think about ontology and the way of thinking about

23:54.520 --> 24:01.400
ontology are so linked in mathematics and I'm surrounded by philosophers so I kind of

24:01.400 --> 24:08.640
want to throw that back at you you know how to make that distinction historically and even

24:08.640 --> 24:11.640
right now.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.120
So I don't do philosophy in mathematics but I am interested in existence so I assume

24:16.120 --> 24:19.320
that's why I was invited here.

24:19.320 --> 24:24.080
So I think that's maybe one thing it's a couple questions just as a person coming to the

24:24.080 --> 24:31.200
outside of this that maybe I'll just enter into the discussion or downstream people to

24:31.200 --> 24:32.200
consider.

24:32.200 --> 24:36.080
How do we tell when we are using a notion of existence that is metaphysically committal

24:36.080 --> 24:39.520
or not?

24:39.520 --> 24:46.800
You might think when you're doing mathematics you don't care whether or not it is the day

24:46.800 --> 24:52.600
the numbers that you're talking about or the functions or what not really exist that might

24:52.600 --> 24:58.240
be something that's not relevant to your concerns as a practicing mathematician but you might

24:58.240 --> 25:04.480
still wonder does the fact that I don't care mean that I'm not using a notion of existence

25:04.480 --> 25:09.680
as committal or is it that I just don't care whether I am using a committal notion?

25:09.680 --> 25:11.160
I hope you said.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.240
May I interject because I have a it's not a joke.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.400
It's a true story.

25:17.400 --> 25:23.200
I was one of the reasons I'm here is the first things that happened.

25:23.200 --> 25:29.360
My career is a mathematician who was invited to talk about things other than mathematics.

25:29.360 --> 25:34.000
I was invited to review a book for the notices of the American mathematical society.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.120
In the book I made me I had to read a fair amount of philosophy including Heidegger at

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
the time which...

25:39.120 --> 25:40.960
Did you say Heidegger?

25:40.960 --> 25:41.960
Heidegger, yes.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.960
Heidegger.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.800
It was written by a mathematician but he well well...

25:47.800 --> 25:50.960
Heidegger studied mathematics people who forget that.

25:50.960 --> 25:57.080
He was an utterly agree mathematics and theology which kind of explains what's going on.

25:57.080 --> 26:02.400
So while I was thinking about this I was at a conference in minster and I was sitting

26:02.400 --> 26:11.120
at a table speaking beer with some of my colleagues and they were discussing the reality

26:11.120 --> 26:13.040
of the continuum.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.920
There was a German and American and a French.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.720
This is a true story.

26:17.720 --> 26:22.080
This is one of these things that you can't make up.

26:22.080 --> 26:27.240
So the Frenchmen said and didn't believe the real numbers existed.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.960
These are all very successful mathematicians by the way.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.560
And they all work in numbers theory.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.400
The Frenchmen said no he just doesn't believe it.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.440
It doesn't stop him from working with them.

26:39.440 --> 26:47.440
The Germans said well he doesn't believe that they exist individually but as a...

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
As a collective.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.000
They had some sort of collective existence.

26:52.000 --> 26:59.560
And the Americans said not only do they exist but he can show you one anytime you come to

26:59.560 --> 27:04.040
his computer screen he can just make them exist.

27:04.040 --> 27:09.840
So all of them are doing mathematics, the same kind of mathematics reading Joseph's papers.

27:09.840 --> 27:18.280
When that sense I would say if there's a fit metaphysical commitment it's something

27:18.280 --> 27:24.520
that escapes any of the people who would supposedly be committed.

27:24.520 --> 27:28.920
And so I would say that if a commitment is not conscious it doesn't count.

27:28.920 --> 27:34.840
One of the things the last three or so comments bring out is this idea you started in like

27:34.840 --> 27:39.000
by mentioning that some objects are positive.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.840
Some seem to be discovered based on mathematical research.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.680
Others one starts by positive.

27:44.680 --> 27:50.240
So even the idea as you say I'm a four dimensional space was originally sort of put out there

27:50.240 --> 27:53.680
as a almost like a prescriptive.

27:53.680 --> 27:59.240
And then later it seems to be an existence and maybe that's a little bit about what you

27:59.240 --> 28:00.760
were talking about at the beginning.

28:00.760 --> 28:06.000
There's this edge between the being of it, the positing of it and then the discovery

28:06.000 --> 28:10.440
of it which is more of a epistemological issue I suppose.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.440
So Chris look what you provoked.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.640
Do you want to actually carry on?

28:14.640 --> 28:18.240
Maybe part of the good change.

28:18.240 --> 28:29.960
So I liked the idea of physics as fundamental that Harold started with.

28:29.960 --> 28:42.960
In in in in particular the idea that particles in fields are fundamental which seems to have

28:42.960 --> 28:54.080
gone out in recent versions of recent news about quantum mechanics.

28:54.080 --> 29:08.000
I also liked Michael's idea that in mathematics.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.360
So entities don't exist in the same way that physical entity to do that.

29:16.360 --> 29:23.800
That existence in mathematics is a special.

29:23.800 --> 29:29.280
My early work was trying to put these together.

29:29.280 --> 29:39.360
So there's no there's no problem when you just consider pure mathematics of just saying

29:39.360 --> 29:44.520
well basically any consistent theory is fine.

29:44.520 --> 29:50.640
There is an issue though about the applications of mathematics.

29:50.640 --> 30:06.320
And so in particular people there there was a time at least when when when people argued

30:06.320 --> 30:19.400
that the same reasons for for believing in particles and fields also were reasons for

30:19.400 --> 30:27.600
believing in the existence of mathematical entities because the idea was that the reason

30:27.600 --> 30:35.280
for believing in mathematical entities is that all our business theories postulate them.

30:35.280 --> 30:40.080
But all our best theories are foreign related to the heavy mathematical language so they

30:40.080 --> 30:54.440
also postulate mathematical entities and so some same same argument that applied to particles

30:54.440 --> 31:00.880
in the fields all to apply to mathematical entities.

31:00.880 --> 31:10.920
So I didn't like Chris conclusion.

31:10.920 --> 31:16.280
I wanted Michael to see you that basically in whatever sense mathematical entities exist

31:16.280 --> 31:22.920
is just because there's a consistent theory in in faulting them.

31:22.920 --> 31:33.520
So a bunch of my work has been trying to reconcile these two things and the in the initial stage

31:33.520 --> 31:39.640
it was trying to show that you can actually formulate the physical theories without positive

31:39.640 --> 31:54.600
stability mathematical entities and in more recent years it's kind of taken a different

31:54.600 --> 31:57.520
turn but the but it reconciled the views that the two of you mentioned it's been sort of

31:57.520 --> 32:04.440
a major project of my work in philosophy of mathematics.

32:04.440 --> 32:11.320
Let me just relate to what the mathematicians sort of speak but the idea of non-committal

32:11.320 --> 32:17.320
or something when you talk to you mentioned that conference in Talaqah last year.

32:17.320 --> 32:25.280
One of the keynote speakers there was I guess who Roger Panros is actually both he is an

32:25.280 --> 32:31.480
accomplished mathematician and an accomplished physicist and Roger Panros I mean he's completely

32:31.480 --> 32:39.660
clear about his belief that mathematical objects exist and not only in the sense of

32:39.660 --> 32:42.360
let X be or something like that.

32:42.360 --> 32:47.920
Ten years earlier we had a conference with Alar Khan.

32:47.920 --> 32:55.560
Alar Khan is a totally serious about mathematical objects exist out there and this is interesting

32:55.560 --> 33:01.880
also with respect to another debate the debate between the question is mathematics discovered

33:01.880 --> 33:06.680
or is it invented and of course all these people have written a lot about this and I

33:06.680 --> 33:15.000
only want to say that it seems to me simply due to the existence of these people that

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
somehow the question is still unresolved.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.960
And I mean as you know their physicists like whatever you know David Doyle is George Ellis

33:21.960 --> 33:26.600
who now say mathematical objects are the prime cause of force for the universe.

33:26.600 --> 33:32.400
I mean George things causation is primarily from mathematical objects to the material

33:32.400 --> 33:38.600
energetic system of the universe and it's not that he's an either an incompetent mathematician

33:38.600 --> 33:44.280
or an incompetent physicist because he wrote the standard book about space time with Stephen

33:44.280 --> 33:49.880
Hawking in 1973 so I think he knows what he's doing in the technical field but he believes

33:49.880 --> 33:55.800
that right and David Doyle is also not like a zero figure in quantum computing and he

33:55.800 --> 34:00.880
also argues that you know he thinks the major mistake that the philosophers that he surrounded

34:00.880 --> 34:06.520
with that Oxford is that they do not get this so I think it is an interesting sociological

34:06.520 --> 34:12.600
piece of evidence right so there are those and there are those mathematicians and physicists

34:12.600 --> 34:17.920
right so that apparently it's not sufficient to be either a good mathematician or physicist

34:17.920 --> 34:23.160
to just to finish what I wanted to say originally the idea was actually also to have Max Tegmark

34:23.160 --> 34:24.640
here.

34:24.640 --> 34:30.680
Max Tegmark has written this book you all know it in which he claims mathematics is not only

34:30.680 --> 34:37.080
existing in the sense that it is a basis for physics but it also exists per se I mean he

34:37.080 --> 34:43.240
the book's title is the mathematical universe it exists per se and every you know if you

34:43.240 --> 34:48.200
would put kind of evolution of existence then mathematics would be the first thing that exists

34:48.200 --> 34:54.520
in his belief I mean I'm only I'm only throwing this around you know it's a little bit hard

34:54.520 --> 35:01.240
to buy I mean Max Tegmark is an extremist in this in this case but I don't know invention

35:01.240 --> 35:02.880
or discovery.

35:02.880 --> 35:10.960
Can I bring a back to history just because I always find it useful so I think that a

35:10.960 --> 35:17.920
lot of the this this conversation about the issue at stake about discovery and not to say

35:17.920 --> 35:23.640
the discovery and the relation between physics and mathematics in terms of existence is again

35:23.640 --> 35:28.760
something that becomes a real problem only in the turn of the 19th century and early

35:28.760 --> 35:34.840
20th century it was even if until then people believe that mathematics arise out of them

35:34.840 --> 35:40.600
anyway arise out of the world right if a mathematical concept understood is an abstraction right

35:40.600 --> 35:45.640
the notion of a fundamental triangle was an abstraction from you know all the individual

35:45.640 --> 35:50.400
triangles that one have seen right that's the basic idea so if you think about mathematics

35:50.400 --> 35:55.800
this way as mathematics existing abstract is something that comes from the world then the

35:55.800 --> 36:00.040
notion that mathematics then applies to physics and that you need to be in the mathematics

36:00.040 --> 36:05.240
and physics is not as problematic right it's only once at the turn of the 20th century

36:05.240 --> 36:10.360
once you mathematicians and philosophers believe that mathematics is no longer bound

36:10.360 --> 36:15.920
by the world if mathematical ideas are not just descriptive of what's out there then

36:15.920 --> 36:20.000
the philosophical question about what's the relation between physical mathematics become

36:20.000 --> 36:25.440
as troubling as it is for us today right so it's not to say there's an answer just to

36:25.440 --> 36:30.440
say that that itself has history itself as kind of a history that's I think important

36:30.440 --> 36:37.400
I think and I don't have the answer to that but I think that looking at what was the question

36:37.400 --> 36:41.560
of the turn of century helps kind of think through a little bit about how we think about

36:41.560 --> 36:45.800
this question about existence and the role of mathematics and I'll just say one more

36:45.800 --> 36:49.880
words about it at the turn of the century mathematicians really I mean there are a lot

36:49.880 --> 36:54.200
of mathematicians that really cared about it and the idea was so people like George Beacock

36:54.200 --> 37:01.000
for example or Vaitland as well they were thinking about what is it now to say that mathematics

37:01.000 --> 37:04.680
applies to physics right what does it say now to mathematics if mathematics doesn't

37:04.680 --> 37:09.240
come out of the world it's not an abstraction for the world how can we think about it and

37:09.240 --> 37:15.280
and the argument they end up making is that you know should say building on kind of a

37:15.280 --> 37:26.280
kind of Hilbert idea of mathematics mostly but the argument that they end up making is

37:26.280 --> 37:30.120
that the difference between a number and you know an electron is not one of kind but of

37:30.120 --> 37:35.080
degree that it's all abstractions all the way out and write them in that there it is

37:35.080 --> 37:41.280
and it's not that the numbers are in that terms are two different kinds so again this

37:41.280 --> 37:48.160
is all things that have been contested at moment for particular reasons right so even

37:48.160 --> 37:55.160
in even in the case of say mid-nineteenth century math like remind differentiable

37:55.160 --> 38:04.960
manifolds so there's I mean if you really think that all that exists is physical space

38:04.960 --> 38:15.840
in its contents there's so the way you standardly explain differentiable

38:15.840 --> 38:24.160
manifolds introduces things that are not in the physical space because it it introduces

38:24.160 --> 38:32.760
the attention spaces and so if you really think that all there is is physics then you

38:32.760 --> 38:44.480
might think that well you you really need to be able to read read describe the mathematics

38:44.480 --> 38:53.080
of differential geometry without going into the attention space but just using the curves

38:53.080 --> 39:01.840
in the space itself and probably that can be done but there is at least a technical challenge

39:01.840 --> 39:11.600
and so maybe maybe you think this challenges and really worth doing because because the

39:11.600 --> 39:20.640
tangent space is a fairly simple idealization but but it just depends really on your attitude

39:20.640 --> 39:27.680
to how much I do a station you are or are prepared to think is is okay

39:27.680 --> 39:36.200
I'm wondering how often some of these formulas are used as analogies and if that's relevant

39:36.200 --> 39:42.680
to what you were starting to say Chris in terms of the other realities that are somehow

39:42.680 --> 39:50.680
related to all of these these ideas and elements can you say a bit more about what you mean

39:50.680 --> 39:57.240
by analogy well I'm just I mean coming I know that there's all sorts of analogies that

39:57.240 --> 40:02.600
are drawn from physics and drawn from mathematics by people like me who don't really know what

40:02.600 --> 40:08.560
I'm talking about and yet I'm talking about something that has to do with existence and

40:08.560 --> 40:16.120
experience and I thought you were sort of approaching that realm in what you were saying

40:16.120 --> 40:18.280
earlier.

40:18.280 --> 40:28.560
So the question I was at least trying to raise was a question of how we can tell whether

40:28.560 --> 40:38.480
a theory is committed to some genuine entities or not and I was suggesting that it's not

40:38.480 --> 40:46.040
sufficient to simply look at some practitioners who are disavowing commitment to say that the

40:46.040 --> 40:53.960
theory isn't committed and maybe the kind of antidote that you were alluding to do with

40:53.960 --> 41:01.560
people that you both mentioned further illustrate that point because you can have successful

41:01.560 --> 41:07.520
theoreticians who disagree on whether or not the theory is committed to the entities in

41:07.520 --> 41:08.520
question.

41:08.520 --> 41:15.800
And so I think it takes a bit of work to figure out what actually are the metaphysical

41:15.800 --> 41:22.560
consequences of a given theory whether it's in mathematics or physics or what not it's

41:22.560 --> 41:25.960
it could be that there are some people that don't care about that and so it's irrelevant

41:25.960 --> 41:29.520
to the primary things that they're working on.

41:29.520 --> 41:37.600
And let me add that you know like you need a lot of philosophical theorizing right to

41:37.600 --> 41:43.960
state exactly what is at stake when you ask for instance say the discovery versus invention

41:43.960 --> 41:48.960
of the section so there's a very broad tendency and I think this is a mistake in ontology.

41:48.960 --> 41:54.360
So it's as it were not an obvious real mistake but you know it's a mistake that many people

41:54.360 --> 41:59.120
make I call this an e-fontalogical realism so according to an e-fontalogical realism you

41:59.120 --> 42:04.960
think that you're really committed to something that it really exists if it's mind independent

42:04.960 --> 42:09.760
right so you think of it in terms of you know how things were before they were minds or how

42:09.760 --> 42:14.440
things are if you abstract away from the fact that their minds right so remarkably you

42:14.440 --> 42:18.800
think that the hallmark of existence is what I call the world without spectators take the

42:18.800 --> 42:25.800
spectators out and what's left that exists right that is I think problematic to the as

42:25.800 --> 42:31.920
a criterion for existence trivially because minds exist right so if your views their minds

42:31.920 --> 42:36.800
they should matter and then there's matter and that this shouldn't be mental and whatever

42:36.800 --> 42:41.320
is on this side is the existence stuff and the other thing is kind of either non-existent

42:41.320 --> 42:47.120
or has to emerge supervene or do things that are not fully existing I think then you already

42:47.120 --> 42:53.000
got into like philosophical trouble and some ways of formulating some versions of formulating

42:53.000 --> 42:57.600
the discovery versus invention distinction for mathematical objects or in other fields

42:57.600 --> 43:02.120
you know fictional objects have similar you know very similar problems you know dream

43:02.120 --> 43:06.800
objects you know dream of a certain unicorn you know then you know did you discover the

43:06.800 --> 43:11.960
unicorn or did you invent it you know they're similar problems there and I think that quite

43:11.960 --> 43:18.000
often you know if we don't settle these purely philosophical issues beforehand then we get

43:18.000 --> 43:23.520
easily confused I think that's really a contribution that philosophy will make there and you need

43:23.520 --> 43:28.600
to be you know why right you need to be like a trained ontologist to be like a really good

43:28.600 --> 43:35.400
mathematician or physicist these are you know orthogonal capacities I think yeah yeah well

43:35.400 --> 43:40.440
in physics usually the practicing physicists is not concerned with these questions at all

43:40.440 --> 43:45.560
in in most cases I mean in philosophy of physics we have exceptions of course right but the

43:45.560 --> 43:51.640
practicing physicist if you ask him around ontology he will just he will either not understand

43:51.640 --> 43:58.640
you or he will close the door and keep you outside you know because he is just he goes into his

43:58.640 --> 44:04.920
lab in the morning switches on the pumps and makes his spectra and then he analyzes them

44:04.920 --> 44:13.160
and that's that's the work of 99.9% of people working in physics then there is this remaining

44:13.160 --> 44:22.840
point one percent who are actually interested in these philosophical questions and then

44:22.840 --> 44:27.480
you know the advent of quantum mechanics actually erased the attention of this point

44:27.480 --> 44:33.600
one percent you know because in quantum mechanics the first time in the history of physics the

44:33.600 --> 44:41.560
measurement itself becomes a problem that it didn't happen before and why is this so

44:41.560 --> 44:50.320
it is so because I don't know I don't go into all these formal details but conceptually

44:50.320 --> 44:57.720
speaking it is so that the state of a system that you measure has to be understood differently

44:57.720 --> 45:04.720
from the state of the system as it exists on tickle before you measure it and that the

45:04.720 --> 45:09.720
additional complication is once you measure the system you extract information so this

45:09.720 --> 45:15.880
is an epistemic process but at the same point you act back on the system so that it becomes

45:15.880 --> 45:22.960
so that it moves into a state of being the on tick state in which it was not before so

45:22.960 --> 45:28.560
the information that you extract is actually already outdated outdated when you read it

45:28.560 --> 45:34.520
out somehow and that's that's a complication that you that you never had before and that

45:34.520 --> 45:40.480
drove people crazy in physics in the early in the early days of quantum mechanics until

45:40.480 --> 45:47.480
in the 1970s some philosophers of physics Ehrhard Schuyber and others came up and really saw

45:47.480 --> 45:52.600
how they can conceptually solve this riddle with the introduction of on tick and epistemic

45:52.600 --> 45:58.400
states which is now when you go to perimeter institute and other institutions everybody

45:58.400 --> 46:03.600
talks about Scientology and scientist dimension this is this has become a standard notion

46:03.600 --> 46:10.480
in the interpretation of quantum mechanics an interesting case actually because they

46:10.480 --> 46:15.160
are it becomes important otherwise you confuse everything all the time if you don't make

46:15.160 --> 46:21.880
that distinction and of I don't know whether this is now really a and a philosophic whether

46:21.880 --> 46:27.800
this is a distinction that philosophers might understand as something that has really to

46:27.800 --> 46:33.480
do with ontology and epistemology or whether this is again only another kind of practical

46:33.480 --> 46:40.080
use of the notions you see what I mean so I don't know the issue about measurement was

46:40.080 --> 46:50.800
different I mean even even pre quantum I mean measurements do always disturb the system

46:50.800 --> 47:04.880
I mean and you can say okay well well you can reduce the disturbance to a small amount

47:04.880 --> 47:12.640
more more than you can in quantum mechanics I agree completely but I think disturbance

47:12.640 --> 47:19.240
by measurement is certainly not itself novel but I would have thought of this is the real

47:19.240 --> 47:29.160
problem about measurement in quantum mechanics is that the early formulations of the theory

47:29.160 --> 47:49.840
took it as this this special process that wasn't quantum mechanically explained so so

47:49.840 --> 48:03.400
there was supposed to be this more or less general law of quantum evolution but then it

48:03.400 --> 48:10.120
was supposed to be broken by measurement even though measurement presumably is a physical

48:10.120 --> 48:17.280
process so so how how could it could could it measurement break the general laws and

48:17.280 --> 48:29.760
I think I think around the same I do I do think that in in recent years there have have

48:29.760 --> 48:44.720
become attempts to to to resolve this problem I think I would have cited John Dell as the

48:44.720 --> 48:49.920
business that made the greatest contribution talk about these measurements now we can reduce

48:49.920 --> 48:56.280
the interaction to an extent that is almost becomes invisible anymore but I agree with

48:56.280 --> 49:00.920
you completely measurement is always an interaction that's right right but in quantum mechanics

49:00.920 --> 49:06.040
it turned out as a problem and you know of course you are right that the measurement

49:06.040 --> 49:10.560
does not follow the laws of unitary evolution that's what you're mentioning you need a different

49:10.560 --> 49:22.680
law or at least it at least in the early theories they both said that law didn't hold but also

49:22.680 --> 49:30.360
didn't offer a serious alternative law that did hold I don't want to emphasize too much

49:30.360 --> 49:35.040
but let me just mention why I still think that it is an important conceptual difference

49:35.040 --> 49:42.160
because what you come up with a quality is I mean the important insight that sequence

49:42.160 --> 49:47.280
of measurements makes a difference we call it non-commutativity of observations and so

49:47.280 --> 49:52.680
on that can be easily understood actually by the fact that when you make a measurement

49:52.680 --> 49:56.640
and you change the state then you make the second measurement of another observable then

49:56.640 --> 50:01.640
you make that measurement already on another state which means that when you when you

50:01.640 --> 50:08.760
invert the sequence of measurements different result right in that sense it becomes important

50:08.760 --> 50:18.120
and really at the basis even at the mathematical basis of the theory let me get back to mathematics

50:18.120 --> 50:25.280
that to say even starting when you talk about measurement then pretty much all the time

50:25.280 --> 50:31.040
you are talking about a measurement with respect to a theory which is based upon properties

50:31.040 --> 50:38.400
of the real number of course real we are talking about reality nothing is more real

50:38.400 --> 50:46.560
nor less real than the real numbers there were real was introduced in as it is to draw

50:46.560 --> 50:52.080
distinction with the imaginary numbers which were very problematic and even I didn't even

50:52.080 --> 51:01.520
realize this until yesterday that even Cauchy invented a theory of complex analysis of wrote

51:01.520 --> 51:06.800
somewhere that he would have preferred not for their not to be imaginary but but that's

51:06.800 --> 51:13.680
but the and what were they are there or not but they come up in the in processing equation

51:13.680 --> 51:23.040
whether real numbers or invented I guess maybe I gave that away but I could also say discovered

51:23.040 --> 51:30.680
it was that people use these things in this indiscriminately for the purposes of physics

51:30.680 --> 51:41.080
and to allow and to make it possible to to get past the pre-secratic paradoxes of continuity

51:41.080 --> 51:44.840
and so things were fine things were fine there were people were working with real numbers

51:44.840 --> 51:52.600
except that there was no there was no axiomatic complete axiomatic theory until the middle

51:52.600 --> 51:59.680
of the 19th century and then it turned out that the axiomatic theory was settled but then

51:59.680 --> 52:10.640
these real numbers have properties that people couldn't understand the the the the the the

52:10.640 --> 52:16.960
point the chronic crucial point was the discovery that the continuum hypothesis was undecidable

52:16.960 --> 52:21.800
you don't know how many real numbers there are in fact you can it's up to the theoretician

52:21.800 --> 52:29.960
to decide how many how many real numbers there are and so I'm maybe right now I should I

52:29.960 --> 52:36.240
wanted to make an apology to the set theorists because I was I've written an article in Quanta

52:36.240 --> 52:42.960
in which I suggested that the set theorists were concerned about the kind of foundations

52:42.960 --> 52:49.000
for set theory that were used in by number theorists improving for example from us last

52:49.000 --> 52:54.360
year there was a there was some controversy around that and that I actually learned by

52:54.360 --> 52:58.360
interacting with set theorists that this is not at all their concern they were not trying

52:58.360 --> 53:06.440
to establish roles for wave to the any if they're any if they set theorists are watching they

53:06.440 --> 53:14.880
were not they're not all interested in establishing rules some people not set theorists were concerned

53:14.880 --> 53:23.000
I'm not sure where this where this controversy came anyway that's the the upshot is that

53:23.000 --> 53:37.880
as to maybe to move to the 21st century that's now yes well we're not going to project the

53:37.880 --> 53:47.400
same questions remain unsettled in a sense that is to say what kind of foundations for

53:47.400 --> 53:53.080
set theory do you want and it so happens that the kinds of mathematics that are being developed

53:53.080 --> 54:03.320
not in in fact in part in order to provide mathematical the coherent explanations of

54:03.320 --> 54:09.480
some physical theories theory some some things that are being developed in in in string theory

54:09.480 --> 54:18.360
in particular involve going beyond the axioms the zermelofrankel axioms of set theory so

54:18.360 --> 54:28.640
on inaccessible cardinals for example and so then the question is who decides who decides

54:28.640 --> 54:33.720
what is what the foundations might be my what are the foundations of mathematics well it's

54:33.720 --> 54:40.760
becoming more and more popular to develop series use theories that are based on the presumption

54:40.760 --> 54:48.760
of existence of existence in the sense that one works with them of inaccessible cardinals

54:48.760 --> 54:55.680
but that means there's big big sets that are much much bigger than anything one can produce

54:55.680 --> 55:03.040
by the intellect one has to this whether called inaccessible because there's no reason cannot

55:03.040 --> 55:10.560
establish their existence on the basis of the axioms even including existence of infinite

55:10.560 --> 55:15.280
set they're much much more infinite in fact there are something called a hierarchy of

55:15.280 --> 55:19.080
different kind of infinities which where it was one want to stop within that hierarchy

55:19.080 --> 55:27.400
well the only the only historically reasonable answer that question is that mathematicians

55:27.400 --> 55:33.560
are going to use whichever kinds of foundations what for set theory that provide the answers

55:33.560 --> 55:39.400
to the questions that they that we consider to be reasonable and important

55:39.400 --> 55:49.600
I was just going to say that I mean it's it seems to me that one of the things that came

55:49.600 --> 55:53.280
out in few of the comments is this distinction between the philosopher and the mathematician

55:53.280 --> 55:57.360
and what sort of kind of what you think maybe the mathematician itself don't have certain

55:57.360 --> 56:03.440
kind of commitment but the commitment that you know that's where this is come but I'm

56:03.440 --> 56:09.680
going to try to push on that just because I'm here and why not and just ask can you even

56:09.680 --> 56:14.480
go like I mean what does it mean to go beyond the mathematicians themselves right I mean

56:14.480 --> 56:19.080
the example that Michael just gave is why in which the mathematicians are the one that

56:19.080 --> 56:24.680
getting to a point that they redefine with the foundation or the question of deciding

56:24.680 --> 56:28.480
infinities to the correct you need to read the question again what the foundation which

56:28.480 --> 56:38.760
the theory builds on right so the where the kind of questions about the existence always

56:38.760 --> 56:43.520
come from the practicing mathematicians or I mean the innocent question or I mean physicists

56:43.520 --> 56:48.800
you can think about as well so what is even the separation that you're between them the

56:48.800 --> 56:53.320
philosophy and them the kind of the mathematicians well you know mathematics is a discipline

56:53.320 --> 56:57.480
with its own rule book including a sociology you know what counts as evidence you know

56:57.480 --> 57:02.200
like a whole discipline that you can characterize in manifold ways and so is philosophy and

57:02.200 --> 57:09.320
they sometimes intersect in the history right sometimes big time Plato Aristotle some sometimes

57:09.320 --> 57:15.120
like super big time Kantor set theory right then a little less right now right so you

57:15.120 --> 57:19.080
can describe those curves and philosophy is just one of those disciplines right so and

57:19.080 --> 57:23.680
then philosophy to something so it would be of course an interesting question right I

57:23.680 --> 57:28.040
mean contemporary ontology is like a very well developed field right it's there's a lot

57:28.040 --> 57:32.680
happening in ontology and metatology and metaphysics and metamethophysic and how they relate right

57:32.680 --> 57:38.160
so that's its own development and these fields like intersect in very interesting ways and

57:38.160 --> 57:42.600
that always remains to be explored right with what's going on in contemporary mathematics

57:42.600 --> 57:48.160
my experience talking to my mathematics friends and colleagues is that indeed there's a very

57:48.160 --> 57:54.200
widespread pragmatism when you talk to you know very high level mathematicians they would

57:54.200 --> 58:02.320
say there's a sense in which right now we care less right so you know and then there might

58:02.320 --> 58:07.080
be an interesting question about why this is solved right so why in the field is this

58:07.080 --> 58:12.200
the case right but I think that what we need to bear in mind when we ask these questions

58:12.200 --> 58:16.720
about philosophy and other disciplines this is often this often goes unnoticed in particular

58:16.720 --> 58:21.960
in the Angofon world because there's a different very different way of thinking about the philosophy

58:21.960 --> 58:26.640
is you know position in the academic division of labor but in my neck of the woods you know

58:26.640 --> 58:30.800
we think of philosophy as just you know another discipline it's just one of the sciences so

58:30.800 --> 58:33.000
I want to make sure that you give me this understanding.

58:33.000 --> 58:38.240
No no no no no this is I think this is a you know so that's why you know if you ask me I

58:38.240 --> 58:42.880
think you know we all if you do philosophy off and then that's another discipline same

58:42.880 --> 58:47.040
mathematics or history of course I'm in history mathematics so I understand what you know that's

58:47.040 --> 58:50.280
what I'm trying to say it's not I'm not trying to say that philosophy has no place there was

58:50.280 --> 58:56.040
not really the really question was try to say how do you explain the the relation when

58:56.040 --> 58:59.960
you think about those specific question right about ontology of when we're talking here

58:59.960 --> 59:04.880
about ontology mathematics now then how do you understand the relation between the philosophy

59:04.880 --> 59:09.760
and the mathematics is again historically right how do you understand the way in which the

59:09.760 --> 59:16.520
ideas that arise from mathematics then infronts the kind of philosophical debates or that

59:16.520 --> 59:20.000
the way right now you do think that there is obviously there's two ways yes it goes two

59:20.000 --> 59:24.960
ways yeah yeah like but how do we that's the question was related to say how do you understand

59:24.960 --> 59:28.800
that relation yeah I would ask Michael Fenson skin or the way in which Michael developed

59:28.800 --> 59:33.400
his relationship you know towards set theory you know I would want to know whether you would

59:33.400 --> 59:38.640
you know so there's a view let's just call it you know mathematical pluralism and you

59:38.640 --> 59:42.640
know I'm heavily simplifying but you know like roughly it go would go something like

59:42.640 --> 59:46.840
that look they're very different you know it depends on the foundations that you choose

59:46.840 --> 59:50.960
right so there's a really there's a sense in which you can just choose your axiom system

59:50.960 --> 59:56.560
this is something we learned from mathematics of the second half of the 20th century right

59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.040
and and then there's this mathematics and this other mathematics and the the choice between

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.560
the axioms can be you know in terms of like elegance they can be all sorts of mathematical

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.760
internal criteria for why I am a mathematician mathematician would say I go for this rather

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.800
than that right and then this kind of pluralism would just mean that there's no you know then

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.040
this would raise for instance for me a philosophical question you know is there even a universe

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:29.000
of mathematical entities you know if we interpret the contemporary mathematics realistically

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.480
right so so even if we think that they're comitable you know given mathematical pluralism

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.640
is that like a universe of mathematical objects given what mathematicians know right now that's

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.320
something that would come to my mind but this would also depend you know like we have a

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:50.240
leading philosophy of mathematician here so I don't know how Hartree looks at this how

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:57.160
you would describe this discourse right so just I I I view myself as a pluralist here

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:04.120
and and so just sharpening the issue of slightly in the in the terms of the example that Michael

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:17.680
raised about so Michael said that the continuum hypothesis is under side of all I mean in

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.800
in some sense is radically understated things in that you can give almost in the answer you

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:29.480
want to what it sizes and it will be consistent with the rest of the axioms of

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:43.080
of said it's a no it's a no it's a theory yeah but so so a version of the pluralist

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:52.200
view that that I kind of like is that there really is no serious question what is the

01:01:52.200 --> 01:02:04.720
real size of the content you are there are basically any any consistent answer is perfectly

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:12.800
okay and the idea of of asking which is the right one is just a wrong way to think about

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:20.680
it and that this marks a serious difference between mathematics and physics where where

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.600
basically there is a right answer even if we don't know it aren't you considering that

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:35.800
there might be at a later time a reason to choose there are the set there is yeah I want

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.920
to they want to find right maybe add an axi because the set of right seems was just established

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:48.520
to make set theory workable and use useful and if they have access right but more right

01:02:48.520 --> 01:03:02.360
but but but what they do is they offer aesthetic criteria for for saying well you know it's

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:08.600
it's a prettier theory if you make the size of the content you own the smallest possible

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:19.480
or the second smallest or or whatever and and different people offer different aesthetic

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:25.000
criteria that you mentioned a different geometry before we have it could be described perhaps

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.760
this way and then using the dimensions and how does that decision get made and is that

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:42.440
an aesthetic one or other consideration well so I'm not sure I understand the question

01:03:42.440 --> 01:04:00.680
I mean one thing which I think may be your question but but probably isn't but but so

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:13.400
theories of differentiable manifolds are developed using the theory of the real numbers and the

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:21.560
different answers to the size of the continuum give you different pictures of what the real

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:33.800
numbers are like so but so there's a separate question as to how much objectivity there is

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:45.400
about say lines in physical space but even if you thought it was completely objective

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:53.560
what the size of in affinity of the of the lines in in physical space was

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:05.160
that doesn't really settle the size of the continuum as mathematicians tend to view it because

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:14.200
because mathematicians tend to think well mathematical reality is it's one thing physical reality is

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:22.920
something else of course we we we got to our conception of the mathematical real numbers

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:28.200
by thinking about physical space but still there are different things it could turn out

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:38.280
empirically the physical lines aren't anything like the real numbers I mean maybe there's just

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:48.360
like the rational numbers but but the mathematical realist things well that doesn't tell you anything

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:54.600
about the real numbers it just shows that the physical lines need to correspond to the real

01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:04.840
numbers so so even if there is a question as an objective of question as to the size of an

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:14.040
affinity of physical lines I think the the typical mathematical non-pluralist is going to say well

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:24.920
there's no obvious reason why the answer to the question of the size of the genuine real

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:33.720
numbers has to be the same as that I was sorry yes I just wanted to get to the other realities

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.400
yes exactly that was my point too yeah I think that has enough to do with the notion that that

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.360
popped up in some of the commentary in the last maybe 10 minutes the notion of pluralism

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.440
you know in the in the sciences when you look at the development of the sciences I mean physics

01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:00.040
is the paradigm example but the others too talking about ontology always had I think historically

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:10.440
speaking the the or or brought the implicit request not only to talk about something that exists but

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:16.520
actually to talk about one thing that exists not many levels not pluralistic one fundamental

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:23.000
ontology and of course this has good reasons I mean for physics one of the interesting reasons

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.560
behind that was actually that physicists try to formalize mathematically and in the mathematics you

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:35.880
can very powerfully do that with symmetry principles and and this is the symmetry increasing the

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.840
symmetry always has the kind of taste of the unification picture unification picture leads to

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:54.360
one fundamental ontology now this fundamental way to look at things also created the idea that

01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:01.080
in physics this is actually a byproduct it's secondary but it's created by the fundamentalisms

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:06.600
let me speak let me say that everything can be reduced to this fundamental level so all other

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:14.680
descriptions like thermodynamics hydrodynamics physical chemistry can somehow be reduced and of

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:21.000
course then we have to explain in detail what we mean by that to a kind of elementary fundamental

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.720
ontology and I think this program has I mean it from the very beginning it was of course not

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:35.720
realized to its full extent but people were thinking in principle this is doable and now in certain

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:44.680
areas we know for sure that it's that it's not working that way we know now I mean this is still

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:51.000
not covered in the textbooks but we know that thermodynamics cannot be reduced to statistical

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.280
mechanics I mean what I'm saying is the knowledge that we have at statistical mechanics is not enough

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:04.760
to create thermodynamics and the fact that Lord Kelvin and others Boltzmann they they had this

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.800
heuristic guess of this of the relation between the kinetic energy of the molecules and the temperature

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:17.480
was completely heuristic we only understand that really fully since the 1970s through quantum

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.000
through quantum field theory and developments by Rudolf Harg and others this is algebraic quantum

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.880
field theory only at that late time hundred years after the heuristic guess it became possible to

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:36.760
build the bridge really in a pro mathematically profound way and then it turns out that you in

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.960
order to make the bridge it's not enough that you know that you know the lower level the mechanical

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:48.920
level you have to you have to select a context at the higher level and implement that at the lower

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:55.160
level and then you can make the bridge formally in a formerly sound manner so this this is in a

01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:01.480
way in an example for a kind of pluralism because if it is if this is so then you have to assume

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:08.840
that the temperature of a container of gas is also a property that exists in the ontological

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:16.600
sense in physics it cannot be fully reduced to the to mechanical properties I'm keen to

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:24.840
explain that more fully I don't I don't know if it makes it just my I don't know if I do want it to

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:36.200
say well that's stronger than I know to say but but I I would like to be convinced in more detail

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:42.280
of course this because yeah okay technical pretty extraordinary but we can make it

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:50.600
you know but they know something I'm ready to do that actually but I'm only giving you this picture

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.560
because everybody knows what temperature is and everybody knows what the motion of molecules

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:01.880
somehow is and it's it's actually a simple example which I wanted to use to really talk about

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:13.000
now to get the discussion into the pluralism thing and and I think for us in physics we in some way

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.160
we have to to give up this kind of deep seeded conviction that everything goes back to the

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:25.240
particles let me ask a question about other reality maybe you don't want to answer this because

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:33.320
much more radical than than the emergence of temperature as a separate property is the notion

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:39.480
that you can actually quantify over all possible anthologies and then there are I don't know how

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:48.840
seriously physicists take the notion of multiverse but is that okay is that what is uh but I but

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:55.560
people certainly do talk about it quite a lot I know I see

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.400
so and this is a this is a different idea of pluralism because if you if you go that way

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.880
then you have you have all these levels of description that I want to have as pluralistic

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.280
you have you you double the pluralism in each universe you have them again and in the next

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.160
university of all of that again and this is that I mean I know this is an interpretation of quantum

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:27.720
mechanics which some people um appreciate I don't I want to switch the register a bit to get more

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:35.160
to the other realities because from the outside mathematics and number carry the notion of real

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:44.760
truth the reality is carried by by the numbers whether it's polling numbers or you know how many

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:51.560
people believe such and such and I think it's had a profound effect on our society and our culture

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.840
and Alma has written and worked on the whole idea of how numbers get used in terms of the political

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:06.520
scene and I mean I think you maybe don't realize the amount of authority that we on the outside of

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:12.360
your world project onto number and I'd like to understand that a little bit in terms of how it

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:20.520
affects the other realities not just what the other realities are is that of interest to you Alma

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:29.560
to me it's of interest but I'm I'm in a company I mean I should say just that there's a I wonder I

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:35.400
wonder to what degree this to conversation relate to one another I think that you absolutely

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:40.040
write it that they greet the which the reality or kind of so there's a very famous book in the

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.880
Eastern mathematical by a that protocol trust in numbers which really deals to this question really

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:55.320
of how making numerical argument have you know one in a sense why why and he has I mean the argument

01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:02.280
is much more complicated than this the history that he tells but this notion that if you were saying

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.560
that numbers have a certain kind of numerical argument has certain kind of validity that

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:15.000
other sort of argument might not have but I wonder to what degree and I'm asking that back I mean to

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.120
a degree that relates to the ontological question of number I don't know right I mean he's just a

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:27.320
convent the numbers used as conventions here when people make new argument based on kind of

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.640
numbers or is it really has to do with that other question that we were talking about until now

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:40.200
which is down the existence the real existence of numbers so I'm kind of going to throw that back

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.600
I would have thought that the reason why numerical arguments that use a lot of numbers

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.960
tend to sound more convincing is just because they get the appearance precision and oftentimes

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:01.320
they are more precise so it's clearer to see what the argument is so that's not a very deep observation

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:07.480
I suppose but amidst it's what this precision that's I think a deep question

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.400
why is precision important?

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.480
Yeah, where is the subjective factor that gets related to these things?

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:22.600
If you have quantum mechanics or if you have a electro dynamics and you solve a sort of problem

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:29.880
then you get a solution and experiment coincides with that solution let's say in five digits after

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:37.000
the comma and after that if you measure further than it deviates now you do quantum electro dynamics

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.520
you get the next three digits correct in that in that sense precision might be an important thing

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:49.480
to test your theory precision in terms of numbers but the way it is precision of a true value that

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:55.160
you know no I think I think the way in which we as physics I mean it is in theoretical physics

01:15:55.160 --> 01:16:01.320
or mathematical physics the way in which we apply let me say mathematics has nothing so much to do

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:09.080
with numbers it's really what we apply is the structure it's actually a qualitative feature

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.520
but that goes into the physics when you come from math and then of course when we solve it

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:21.160
and we have equations you can have an equation and then it sits there but then you want to solve it

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.480
and then you know you put in initial conditions and all this kind of stuff initial conditions are

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:31.960
not something that I think mathematicians feel so much with they just have to form a structure

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.480
I mean yeah yes and no but I think another strategy if I was trying to say since

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.360
we were more responsible I think we we would find more precise arguments more compelling because

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:56.440
a more precise statement is more easily is one for which it's more easy to figure out whether

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:03.080
or not it's a correct yeah and people that are willing to assert responsibly who are responsible

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:09.800
about making assertions will be willing to assert statements that are more easily falsifiable

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.960
proportionate to the degree to which they've evidence for them and so that in an ideal culture

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:24.120
we would ideally try to state things that have a degree of precision proportionate to our evidence

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:31.160
for them and maybe you know we're not obviously we're not there yet but given that that is something

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.520
that we could imagine as an ideal it wouldn't surprise me that looking outside we think oh this

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:41.560
is this guy saying something sounds very precise he must have really good reasons to say it like

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:48.760
what the rocks said at least on this side can i bring in another reality where you see I think

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:53.720
that some of these ideas about precision and the relationship or truth break down quite quickly

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.400
right I mean take most of the things that we all believe to be true such as there's a certain

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.360
amount of you know there's either finite or we're clearly finite but you know either an odd or

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.720
even number of people in this room right or here there's either an even odd number of people here

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:15.160
right now that is in some sense not very precise it's not quantum mechanical fine resolution

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.760
because from the quantum mechanical standpoint it's going to be hard to find the people here

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.960
right but it's perfectly all right and objectively true and completely unproblematic and just true

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.040
that there's either an odd or even number of people here even though probably no one in this

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.920
room or not all scientists together in the world right now can tell you what one person is because

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:38.040
we don't know what unifies an organism etc etc right so I think there are like very good

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.560
exceptions to the rule that a scientifically rigorous statement that's not what Chris intended

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:50.360
right with precision but I think that if if the scale of precision that we deploy and thinking

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:56.280
about the objectivity of truth etc etc right is modeled along the lines of the progress of modern

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:02.760
mathematical physics then I think we run into very serious political problems right so if you know

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:09.000
like social problems cannot be tackled in this way clearly not now so you know like if we

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.360
wonder you know the unification of physics and reduction is a hard enough problem but going from

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.680
there to like making a real prediction was going to be the next president of the United States of

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:25.000
America right there are very very many gaps right that you cannot fill out you we can fill them out

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.680
as a world almost and try all right right in a in a group of you know like here we can maybe

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:36.760
figure out whether we should be reductionist about social facts or not right but in the real

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:42.280
world you know where this stuff matters there's going to be a different form of precision right

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:48.520
so and I think that it will be ultimately you know very problematic on the real level of social

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:55.000
facts or political facts to think that you know decision procedures there should be mathematical

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.720
or etc in that sense so there are different kinds of precision an example that one of my

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:04.440
you know professors in philosophy always gave for this you know the relativity of precision

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.400
problem is simply this right I mean you fall in love with a certain person right and then there's

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:16.520
a degree of resolution of that person's phase in which you can still recognize the person and

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:22.040
fall in love etc right if you come to close and you look at you know like whatever you know molecular

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:28.440
details then then the object that you're dealing with in this particular case simply dissolves

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:35.800
so I think there's no you know there's no absolute thing you know precision and that is the that

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.400
is you know like be precise and then you're more likely to say something true I think quite often

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.840
if we if we have precise mathematically we're going to say something false

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.560
yeah not in mathematics right of course there's not a point about mathematics but we don't only

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.520
think about mathematical objects if we think about them at all I think that's one of what was a wonderful

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:02.520
place to put pause to our conversation and maybe invite a few audience to come up and ask questions

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:18.520
Tess some of you indicated that you believe that mathematical objects exist in the real universe

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:33.080
and Roger Penrose next peg bar not not withstanding the fact of the matter is that we described the

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:40.360
physics of the real universe with abstract concepts like Euclidean or Riemannian geometry

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:49.240
and differential equations and these are all based on abstract concepts that do not exist in the

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:57.720
real universe a point a line a plane a manifold even a particle do not exist in the real universe

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:06.840
so my question is can any one of you give me an example of a mathematical object or more specifically

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:18.120
a geometric object that you believe exists in the real universe then then you would tell I mean I

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:23.400
would have a question for you I would say I need a better grasp on what you think is a real the

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:29.400
real universe because for some people this is real for some people that may be real well if you let's

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:36.360
start with the most basic object in mathematics a point in geometry a point does a point exist in

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:43.160
the real universe the mathematician who thinks about mathematical realism in the sense like Roger

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:49.560
Penrose does yes well it's mathematical realism but it's not physical realism there's no such

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:53.960
thing as a physical point well but you know it's fact real things like what he says let's say

01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:02.840
which I think we would say racism exists but you can't little point to well your racism exists but

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:07.560
it can I don't believe that it could be described mathematically you think New York City system

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:12.760
is correct do you think New York City exists in the real I believe I believe in existence but

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:25.800
my question is using mathematics to describe exactly the existence of real objects is a fallacy it's

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:34.360
an approximation at best even I want to say if if you I mean as I do actually have a pluralistic

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:40.520
worldview then I would say biological species exist in biological reality physical species

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:47.000
exist in physical reality mathematical species exist in mathematical reality minds exist in

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:54.200
mental reality and free will exists in free will reality I don't know okay but I but my question my

01:23:54.200 --> 01:24:01.160
original question was I thought that some of you agreed with people like Penrose and Tegbark that

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:08.040
mathematics mathematical objects actually exist in real universe uh-huh that the real

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:12.760
universe consists of what we call mathematical objects this is I have to apologize this is

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:18.920
not the idea we just brought this up in order to have something to discuss right I'm not I don't

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.680
I know I believe that here I know that I thought some of you said that you do believe that not

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:32.280
that I think okay oh I don't know maybe does anyone does anyone I don't even sure I understand

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:46.520
what the question is okay yeah okay I have two questions for you um the first is is there any

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:54.360
work on whether this issue is decidable so as you said there are crucial issues in mathematics

01:24:54.360 --> 01:25:01.960
so they've been decided that we have discovered are not decidable and I'm wondering whether you

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:09.560
feel that one can look at this question from a perspective of is it won't be possible ever for

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:16.040
us to decide this issue is there any work going on in that arena which question is that exactly

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:25.080
or whether math math objects are real or bad so this and the second question is this we are creatures

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:34.840
formed from evolution we believe and there is some sense in which that limits how we can see the

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:44.360
world and I'm wondering if there's any work on whether that inherently will affect the type of

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.480
beliefs that we can come up with and the types of reality that we can come up with and whether

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:56.840
that then plays into the the question of whether this is decidable or not so two related questions

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.880
well I think there's a lot of work I mean contemporary philosophy is like there's going to be a huge

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.120
landscape I don't know about philosophy of mathematics whether there's like a prominent like skeptical

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:14.680
position right now where someone would say that you know the answer to the to certain ontological

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.800
questions in philosophy of mathematics is somewhat unknowable or undecidable it's clearly not a

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:25.160
prominent view I don't know if this but you know for any I think for any you know so that's

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.600
that landscape is very rich and the other question you know this there's of course a huge

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.800
literature and discussion about that I mean most recently now I think people are debating the

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:43.080
Donald Hoffman book the case against reality right so this is a nice you know case for for I think

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:48.200
your second question you know the most recent version of neuroscience has discovered for such

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:53.720
and such a reason we cannot know reality I think this is nonsense but it's a very widespread kind

01:26:53.720 --> 01:27:05.560
of argument I didn't understand your answers whether there is serious work like specifically

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.320
on the side of this question of the philosophy of mathematics question yes just general I don't

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.000
know I don't know that's I would ask if I if you ask me you to ask I would ask I would ask

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:25.560
you to ask somebody else if I want to hear what I can say is there is an interesting book

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:32.520
which collects dialogues between a mathematician I mentioned the name before

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:39.240
L.R. Kahn who is a convinced a convinced playfulness in that sense with with a brain research

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:46.520
person Jean-Pierre Georgie and they talk about this issue and it's a discussion it's it doesn't

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:52.440
result of course there are two there are two points which they try to make over 250 pages

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.520
and at the end you decide

01:27:54.520 --> 01:28:04.520
I'm sorry you know this is are you know that book probably right sorry you know that book

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:10.520
I don't know the title I'm trying to remember but if you if you go by the authors con c o n n e s

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:18.280
and charge you that's you find it okay well this I'm always bringing in the another issue but it

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:26.440
relates to pluralism and it relates to painting in particular and also to the question previously

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.880
painters have particularly always thought they want to find the truth or do they want to find

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:38.520
the truth within the world of painting and early on in painting in the Renaissance they saw for

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:44.040
linear perspective for anatomy for understanding the body and as painting evolved they became more

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.240
and more involved in this very issue of what are they searching for are they searching for

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:55.640
similar for similitude in the world or are they searching for something ontological in terms of

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:02.120
internal or external search and I think right now is a very pivotal time in the arts and particularly

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:09.560
in painting which I know where there's a lot of confusion about of the motivation for the creation

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:16.600
of works of art and there are painters more in the in the 40s and during the wartime where they

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:24.920
explored topological space they went against non non-neuclidean space and they attempted things

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.640
but then when they dealt with it they didn't deal with it probably with the true logistics of the

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:35.160
way a physicist or mathematician would deal with it but it's very much a pivotal issue

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:43.000
do we do we follow what we what we are searching for internally in our internal brain structures

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.320
or are we looking at the world precisely and trying to reproduce the world obviously painters and

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:55.480
not can no longer need to reproduce the world and the way they once did so I came today because I'm

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:01.640
very fascinated by this very crux of problem ontology and epistemology in which many painters

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:07.880
have arguments about with one another about what they're trying to do I don't I don't know if you

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:14.600
can even be good but just I just some of your thoughts may be on the possibility even of an art

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:21.640
form entering any of this discussion I'll go ahead I just want to say that there actually have been

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:27.080
work on that have argued that the kind of there's this the moment of the turn of the century is a

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:32.200
modernist transformation but there is a relation between the modernist transformation in both arts

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.720
and mathematics specifically so I'm thinking about the work of Jeremy Gray and I started

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.880
mathematics that actually made the link specifically that this sort of question like you were saying

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:49.160
about what is mathematics about what is painting about etc are actually quite similar so there have

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:52.520
been I don't know but I can't answer the question right now I can say that they have

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:58.680
been works that looked at this moment in the turn of the century and made that comparison directly

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:02.600
and physics as well yes it's part of exactly yeah

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.880
yeah I mean I recommend a forthcoming book by this gentleman art and object that's a debate

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:13.880
between Graham Hammond was the author of the book that I recommend and Michael Freet about this

01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:21.000
issue you might find that interesting so there's a whole recent trend in ontology of art you know

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.320
which relates to that you know so that might be interesting looking you know Michael Freet set

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:31.240
the tone for a long time but they're like recent ontological trends also in philosophy of art that

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:37.880
might speak to that question yeah because the traditional aesthetic theories don't really hold

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:43.240
in terms of what the real problems are now or even in the middle of the 20th century yes yes that's

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:48.360
why there's like a whole new like strand of theorizing about this which in the art world goes by the

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:52.440
title of speculative realism so you might find that material interesting

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:59.560
it may say one small one small thing it might be interesting to look in whether or not there are

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:07.240
analogies in the philosophy of music so music it's a tone structure it has there's structures

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:15.400
that musical pieces exemplify and there are similar questions about the ontology of music so is the

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:22.760
is the symphony the the physical performance is it the physical inscription on the paper or is it an

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:28.600
abstract object that's represented by those things and that's why one and the same symphony can be

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:35.080
performed in different places it might it might be that because the nature of music is is more

01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:41.240
easily detachable from particular performances of it in a way that a painting doesn't seem to be that

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:47.240
the the questions will seem more parallel if we're considering those art forms rather than maybe

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:52.600
architecture has some architecture would be another one to think about this is also this very interesting

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:58.200
analogy i'm not sure whether it applies across the board but there have been instances here where

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:03.240
we hear we learn that mathematicians or physicists don't spend that much time wearing without their

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:09.320
ontology many physicists and i think mathematicians would say well that's good and we need to we'll

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:13.480
look at it and if we're interested in it we might look at it the question is is that a quick

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:18.920
prescription for painters or artists as well should they be spending a lot of time thinking

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:23.880
about the ontological implications or is that really what art is about is a good idea we're a

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:28.680
bad idea to focus on that should they do that more of it than mathematicians or physicists say i'm

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.920
not sure i know the answer but similarly what what would you how does the following sound to you

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:37.480
you know the philosophers are currently discussing whether they should spend any time on doing

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.440
mathematics right i think this would be like a bad headline and i think similarly the other

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:47.720
headline is equally bad mathematicians now this and physicists now you know think that they should

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:53.160
do less ontology i think it's equally bad you know and just go back to the great moment you know

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:59.000
we you mentioned the foundation foundational crisis and quad mechanics etc you know Einstein wrote

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.880
you know like one of my colleagues we just moved him from caltech he edits Einstein's papers he spent

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:09.880
a lot of time reading neo-kantian philosophy literature writing reviews which are now published

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:14.520
it with the Einstein papers etc and so forth for the other great figures and that might not have

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:18.760
been a coincidence that often physicists right now worry about the grand unification and when

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:23.560
it's coming and then they are doing honestly speaking incompetent metaphysics like max tech

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.200
marker i think this is terrible metaphysics what's going on there or Donald Hoffman is just an incompetent

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.720
philosopher of mind and so you know like so that's you know he is bad news neuroscientists care much

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:39.640
less about ontology right now are you saying this is good or bad i think this is terrible equally bad

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.480
because it becomes a philosopher who doesn't care about mathematics you know that's what the baby

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:49.480
with the bath water because you know you can do bad metaphysics as he i mean i agree with you and then

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:56.920
typically what physicists have you know learned to say is when someone does metaphysics at all it's

01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.920
all automatically bad physics or bad metaphysics but there is very helpful metaphysics also of course

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:08.440
someone mentioned the name of john bell i don't know you you mentioned john bell came up with

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:14.440
actually two metaphysical assumptions and then he derived for one of the assumptions classical

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:21.080
local reality and inequality by which you can test whether this assumption is right or wrong so you

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:27.160
can make you can make empirical tests that are motivated by metaphysics but then it has to be good

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:34.360
metaphysics yes of course i think i think with the artist or with painters it's really the study of

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:40.360
the brain because i don't think it can really be controlled of what they're thinking in categories

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.960
i think very often that the arts come closest to an attempt at some kind of unification of the

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:51.080
intellect the mind the emojis and so therefore it's very hard to say well don't think about this only

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:58.600
think about that because the act of creation is an exploration and a search for where they stand

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:04.040
and where how they relate to the world so i i think the divisions are very dangerous in terms of

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:10.440
creativity and probably in science too if you go deep into it i don't know enough i have a good i

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:17.560
i'm sorry i don't want to dominate this but since we are talking about art now it's uh i this is not

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:24.120
directly about ontology and episode but it has to do with it there was this German artist who was

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:30.920
made ridiculous who was ridiculed by many people Joseph Boyce Joseph Boyce had really he had a

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:36.840
philosophical philosophical talent to some extent and in terms of his actions he did this action

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.800
art even here in New York in New York City the the the the action with the coyote i mean i don't

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:50.680
what what what Boyce did conceptually was he undercut the subject object distinction because he as the

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:58.200
artist made himself an object of his own art by the action so he this is this is i think remarkable

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.680
it's it's a great idea just to show people that um it's not that here's the artist and here is the

01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:12.600
painting he just puts himself into that room and together with the coyote right and and he does it

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:17.960
in such a way that people were standing there and looking through the glass through the window

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:25.000
and wouldn't go away for hours because they thought something must be happening and nothing

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.440
happened except he was lying there with his i don't know you know all these these stuff that he

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:35.880
usually brings with him and then there's the coyote you know that was amazing and people were of

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:41.080
course they were getting angry because they were expecting something and nothing happened but they

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:48.920
didn't go away amazing then see he really had this talent to to do something that is philosophically

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.000
highly relevant in a way that affects people it was just i mean i'm just you know but Michael

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.880
what is the same thing i was just going to say that the history of art is a good place to look

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:09.160
for a history of the of the value attached to precision because there are different periods when

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.480
a precision is considered an important value but then it doesn't always mean the same thing

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.480
and in fact it can take opposite meanings and there's also uh this is not unrelated to the

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:28.600
history of objectivity as analyzed in the book of dastard and gallisin which again the valence

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:36.200
objectivity in that case is the value but what it means takes it becomes moves to its opposite

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.480
from one time yeah i just wanted to say also as far as ontology and mathematics there is

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:48.120
a small group of mathematicians who are talking to philosophers it's called the n category cafe

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:54.760
and the uh it's been online for quite some time the original motivation was precisely

01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:02.840
uh the the some concern or not necessarily concern about the uh development of

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:11.400
mathematical uh practices that were not based on on the axioms of set theory specifically that

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:19.560
were uh and the but what i've noticed is that this there's not any much interaction between

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:27.000
this uh this circle which was mathematicians and philosophers and physicists and the rest of

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:33.080
uh philosophy so there's a lot of researching contemporary ontology in europe and france in

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:38.200
particular of category theory as a matter of fact so that idea i've also like happened to have

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:43.160
written something about this so there there's uh you know there's just a little more there but

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:49.720
yeah so that issue you know like given that so category theory was uh you know like people

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:53.560
became aware of this and it's through interaction with mathematicians yes yes

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.440
through self-centaction actually with some of the founding fathers actually

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.680
in the most in the french context uh oh okay i'm familiar with this i know you know this

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:07.320
i'm familiar with it yeah but this this is a different because this is there are mathematicians

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:12.840
from various uh different fields this is because to keep the category theory so we're working

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.760
we're talking to the french philosophers were category theory that was that was what they did

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.000
they were not yeah they were somewhat isolated within mathematics yes this is something different

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.800
yeah i had the question about history and it was mentioned that um

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.280
in popular imagination the fourth dimension at the beginning of the last century

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:41.160
uh and then when i was a kid watching tv watching twilight zone uh i think his name was surling

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:49.080
he talks about the fifth dimension and now we're in the internet age and we were during the

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:56.680
introduction uh we talked about the three audiences the audience in this room the audience beyond

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:06.840
this room the future audience that might be looking at the archive of this event and many of us who

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:13.880
are observing and participating right now may be in that audience right because when this is

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:21.000
uploaded we can all look at it so i guess my question is about the the culture and how um

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:29.160
um the past president future is changing so quickly um and how our our participation in the

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:35.720
technology is accelerating that and there's a buzzword uh post truth i'm sure we've all heard that um

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:43.720
and what that could possibly mean so i guess my general question is about um what is all this how

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:50.520
is this impacting our culture and our our imagination and our politics sort of a broad question

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:57.240
and if there's anything you know now that you did not know at the beginning of this conversation

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.960
i would be very curious about that thank you

01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:09.320
i know that i have to withdraw some of my projections onto math that's very important

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.320
lesson and also i've been thinking about daniel connamans uh endowment principle

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:21.160
uh of how much what we endow is having value because we know it or we have it

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:27.480
changes our perception of it and its value in the world and throughout this conversation i've

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:37.800
been thinking about that that whole endowment principle idea anyone else yeah i was i i actually

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:46.440
wanted to ask you that later tonight what do you think of don huffman's book but now i know yes

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:52.840
you know i run a research center of reality in crisis a center for the human being in the

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:59.320
digital age it's a large international research network uh withstands disciplines here at uh

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:04.920
and my new university of Tokyo of picking university and pericine kamrich in the future and um and so

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:10.280
it's uh deals with all these uh post truth etc phenomena on various levels so i think that

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:15.720
you know let me be very brutal about this i think that some of this huffman's style material is

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:20.280
you know what people worried about here in the 90s in particular in philosophy about you know

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:26.040
post modernism and so forth giving up the truth and richard rorty and so forth i think the kind of

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.880
incoherence what really people worried about this has now infiltrated politics neuroscience

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.920
but other disciplines too you know like rovelli the way in which rovelli speaks about physics

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:44.040
and nobility i think it's the same so i think that's like a whole i call i call this climate of uh

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:51.000
misdegotten conceptions of knowledge uh food Kantianism you know it's the worst of koko and the worst

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:57.320
of Kant and it's also crazy Kant food Kant it's also it's a valgus form of Nietzscheanism and i think

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:01.320
donald trump you know like if you look at this you know Nietzsche it's the first of what Nietzsche calls

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:08.440
the blonde beast and uh and this whole truth thing i mean there you know everything that we worried

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:13.720
about you know decades ago from philosophies like you know now this has come become a principle

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:21.160
almost everywhere and i think there's a lot uh of work for philosophers to be done and in many

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:27.080
in europe the contemporary philosophical trends are therefore often associated with the label of

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.800
realism new realism that's just my word and speculative realism and this realism and that

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:37.560
realism and the reason why in particular philosophers in europe have you know moved to the realist

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:45.880
cam broadly speaking right uh is you know resisting that we have our own version of it you know the

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.720
in germany the christian democrats but since people don't think about this you know you think

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:53.800
about the far right when you think about political problems in germany but we have the christian

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.240
democrats that's nasty i shouldn't have said that on the record

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:06.040
well i did say that was the last question but we will have one one last question now

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:08.280
but yeah the whole thing i'm sorry i'll make a little nervous

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:18.680
well i suppose this has to do with realism um in veda there there's 40 aspects well one is

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:24.920
yoga and there was this patongently who cognized it four chapters the third chapter is called city

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:33.080
sidhi and sanskrit often translated as perfection power uh super normal ability attainment

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:41.240
cities are are listed as things like levitation walking through walls and visibility strength of

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:49.000
an elephant um being in multiple bodies at the same time knowledge of past and future knowledge

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:58.440
of the contents and nature of other people's minds uh challenges to our understanding of reality and

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:04.040
veda deals with these seven states of consciousness neurophysiological states of consciousness

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:12.120
beyond the first three being waking dream you've sleep so we've been talking a lot is about mathematics

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:18.120
as kind of a one application of mathematics is to describe physical reality but here you have a

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:26.200
physical reality which is you know right here i mean in the room if some of these things

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:34.840
um actually exist which doesn't seem to be challenged um so what are your thoughts about this uh

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:43.640
this knowledge has you know quite serious um um history and uh

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.800
maybe i can't say two things about this there have been attempts to actually in some of the

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:59.400
labs particularly in the u.s even in Princeton to demonstrate phenomena like this and much of

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:05.320
that has been shown to be um some experiments haven't been done well designed some experiments

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:11.640
have been well analyzed and so i'm doubtful about that material but still there are other

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.640
situations in which these cases happen spontaneously i mean not under under laboratory conditions

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:26.440
and then um my first reaction would be is that really something that fits into the range

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:33.800
of validity of physical theories i mean i think we all agree that the world does not only consist

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:39.400
of consist of physics and physical reality right there's more to depend on that and for instance

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:45.640
what we do not understand at all up to the present day uh not withstanding all all neuroscience and

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:50.280
brain and stuff and so on it's the relationship between the mental and the physical we don't have

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.960
any clue we can measure correlations but we don't know where they come from what they do and so on

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:01.560
i don't know what science will bring us when we understand this better i'm not saying that we

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:08.520
can explain this all this all then but i'm only saying that it is maybe not the not the best reaction

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:16.600
to try and ask physics to explain that because it maybe may go far beyond what physics is designed

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:23.960
for it to explain so well thank you everyone for an excellent afternoon and i'm looking

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:45.400
forward to looking at this for years to come on youtube

01:48:53.960 --> 01:49:11.880
so
