00:00.000 --> 00:18.160
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:18.160 --> 00:25.720
Welcome to the Hill Center's final event for the spring of 2022.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.440
And again, we're sorry to report that we've continued to have to be a Zoom-only presentation,

00:31.440 --> 00:35.640
but this is also available on YouTube in perpetuity.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.920
Today, I have the, well, I'm Gerald Herrowitz.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.000
I'm the Associate Director of Hill Center.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.800
And I'm here with this illustrious panel of discussants who are going to discuss the

00:46.800 --> 00:51.440
rather large topic of metaphysics.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.560
Let me take a moment to introduce our panelists, and then we'll get our conversation underway.

00:57.560 --> 01:04.000
Of course, future HELEX programs will be announced in due time, which will start again, start

01:04.000 --> 01:07.680
up again in the fall of 2022.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.440
And we're hoping that those will include live round tables.

01:12.440 --> 01:18.780
So first, I'll introduce Harold Atman-Spacher, who is a Senior Scientist and Staff Member

01:18.780 --> 01:25.920
at the Collegium Helvetikum University of Zurich and ETH Zurich since 2007.

01:25.920 --> 01:31.560
After his PhD in Physics at Munich University, he worked as a Research Scientist at the Max

01:31.560 --> 01:37.720
Bong Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics at Garching until 1998.

01:37.720 --> 01:43.860
Then he served as head of the theory group at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology

01:43.860 --> 01:46.960
at Freiburg until 2013.

01:46.960 --> 01:52.040
His fields of research are the theory of complex systems, conceptual and theoretical aspects

01:52.040 --> 01:59.120
of algebraic quantum theory, and mind matter relations from interdisciplinary perspectives.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.320
He is the President of the Society for the Mind Matter Research for Mind Matter Research

02:04.320 --> 02:12.480
and Editor-in-Chief of the Interdisciplinary International Journal Mind and Matter.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.280
Moving on, Elizabeth Barnes is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia.

02:17.280 --> 02:22.760
Her research interests are divided between metaphysics, social philosophy, feminist philosophy

02:22.760 --> 02:23.760
and ethics.

02:23.760 --> 02:27.840
She's particularly interested in the places where these topics overlap.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.280
She's written a book on disability called The Minority Body and is currently writing a

02:33.280 --> 02:35.160
book about the nature of health.

02:35.160 --> 02:42.600
Lately, she's also been thinking a lot about the metaphysics of social structures.

02:42.600 --> 02:47.200
Hans Halverson is the Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.760
He has written extensively on the foundations of quantum physics, philosophy of science

02:51.760 --> 02:56.360
and the relationship between science and theology, with articles appearing in the Journal of

02:56.360 --> 03:01.880
Mathematical Physics, Physical Review and the British Journal of Four Philosophy of Science,

03:01.880 --> 03:03.360
among others.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.800
Jefferson has received a Mellon Foundation New Directions Fellowship, a Cushing Memorial

03:07.800 --> 03:14.400
Prize in the History and Philosophy of Physics, best article a year by a research PhD, and

03:14.400 --> 03:22.040
10 best philosophy articles of the year, both in 2001 and 2002.

03:22.040 --> 03:27.880
Greg Yeager is a Professor of Natural Science and Mathematics at Boston University.

03:27.880 --> 03:34.520
Her postdoc will work in the history of science and experimental quantum optics physics, sorry,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.280
quantum optical physics.

03:36.280 --> 03:41.480
He assumed his current interdisciplinary professorship in 2006.

03:41.480 --> 03:48.040
He was awarded a Cavill, a Cauvley Fellowship in 2008, for his work on quantum computing,

03:48.040 --> 03:53.280
holding two fundamental patents, and co-edited Philosophy of Quantum Information and an Add

03:53.280 --> 03:57.360
in Tanglement on Cambridge University Press.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.880
He is the author of the monograph's quantum information, entanglement information and

04:02.880 --> 04:07.560
interpretation of quantum mechanics, and quantum objects.

04:07.560 --> 04:13.400
Most recently, he co-authored quantum metrology, imaging, and communication, and co-edited

04:13.400 --> 04:15.240
quantum arrangements.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.680
His current work focuses on the ontological status of elementary particles in quantum

04:19.680 --> 04:21.640
field theory.

04:21.640 --> 04:27.200
Finally, Arkady Blatnitsky is a distinguished Professor of Literature, theory, and cultural

04:27.200 --> 04:32.280
studies program, and philosophy and literature program at Purdue University.

04:32.280 --> 04:37.840
He has published nine books, several edited or co-edited collections, and about 200 articles

04:37.840 --> 04:43.200
on continental philosophy, romantic and monodist literature, the Philosophy of Mathematics and

04:43.200 --> 04:47.760
Physics, and the relationship among literature, philosophy, and science.

04:47.760 --> 04:54.280
His most recent book is Reality Without Realism, Matter, Thought, and Technology in Quantum

04:54.280 --> 04:56.280
Physics.

04:56.280 --> 05:02.920
His next book, Logos and Alagon, The Thinkable and The Unthinkable in Mathematics on the Pythagoreans

05:02.920 --> 05:08.200
of the Moderns, is forthcoming from Springer Nature next year.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.960
So with that, I'd like to get things rolling.

05:10.960 --> 05:18.640
I thought we might start by having each of our discussions make a brief comment about,

05:18.640 --> 05:22.160
let's say, what they think metaphysics is and what it's for.

05:22.160 --> 05:26.880
I think it would be nice if it would be brief and then we can get the conversation rolling.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.280
So whoever wants to volunteer, they go first.

05:29.280 --> 05:42.160
Let's go for it.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.520
Do I have to pick someone?

05:44.520 --> 05:47.360
On to it, take a shot.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.920
You look like you're making a move.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
Okay.

05:50.920 --> 05:57.800
Well, I'll say a couple words about my own professional background because I've had the

05:57.800 --> 06:03.320
good fortune that although my primary field of study was philosophy as an undergraduate

06:03.320 --> 06:09.360
student and then I became interested in, I mean, it became very clear to me that philosophical

06:09.360 --> 06:15.680
research, I think, benefits a lot from looking at what's going on in science, hopefully to

06:15.680 --> 06:20.720
learn for itself, but also actually I hope the contribution can go the other way.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.560
One of the main reasons for me that was important is I was educated in the United States my

06:25.560 --> 06:26.920
entire life.

06:26.920 --> 06:32.120
I got in many ways what I thought was a good scientific education, but I thought it was

06:32.120 --> 06:37.680
a scientific education that said, stop at a certain point asking certain questions, right?

06:37.680 --> 06:44.320
Because we need to focus our time on calculations and new technologies and we don't want to

06:44.320 --> 06:48.520
get hung up in these big questions about like, why do we exist?

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
Why is there a universe?

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
Things like this.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.120
So that's what naturally led me into philosophy.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.400
But then I was fortunate that I was around philosophers that said, hey, these are really

06:58.400 --> 07:00.360
the same conversation.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.880
So although I would not actually consider myself a metaphysician because within philosophy

07:04.880 --> 07:10.200
there are some who have very special professional competence in metaphysics, but I actually think

07:10.200 --> 07:17.120
that anyone who's reflecting on the nature of reality is to some extent doing metaphysics.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.640
And I think even scientists who may feel like it's important for them professionally to

07:21.640 --> 07:23.800
say what I'm doing is physics.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
It's not metaphysics.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.560
I think that's actually unfortunately not really true.

07:27.560 --> 07:32.160
I mean, I think they are doing metaphysics even if they're not being completely honest

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
about that.

07:33.160 --> 07:36.640
So I'm glad that we're able to talk about this openly here and that we have people with

07:36.640 --> 07:41.320
sort of both, you know, angles on this, both coming from the sciences and from philosophy.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Great.

07:42.320 --> 07:48.120
If I could follow up on what Han says, because I have a somewhat different background.

07:48.120 --> 07:53.080
I'm not as nearly steeped in the sciences, but I agree with a lot of what he said in terms

07:53.080 --> 07:55.800
of what metaphysics is.

07:55.800 --> 08:01.040
I mean, if I, I think it's kind of a foolhardy project to try to give definitions of any

08:01.040 --> 08:06.640
aspect of philosophy because it's so slippery, but I guess in a nutshell, I would think of

08:06.640 --> 08:16.040
metaphysics as something like questions about the nature of reality that aren't better or

08:16.040 --> 08:19.680
at least completely addressed by empirical means.

08:19.680 --> 08:25.080
And of course, it's a somewhat often fraught and tendentious question exactly what those

08:25.080 --> 08:31.800
questions might be or the extent of what empirical inquiry inquiry can show us or what linguistic

08:31.800 --> 08:34.480
inquiry can show us or that kind of thing.

08:34.480 --> 08:40.160
But in terms of what metaphysics is for, my own background is that I came to metaphysics

08:40.160 --> 08:41.480
from a place of skepticism.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
I didn't like it.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.960
And I didn't want to do it.

08:43.960 --> 08:49.680
And I wanted to do ethics and sort of the more humanistic end of philosophical inquiry

08:49.680 --> 08:51.120
without doing metaphysics.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.880
And I found that I couldn't avoid it.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.360
I mean, my philosophical trajectory has kind of been like me yelling at metaphysics.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.800
I wish I knew how to quit you.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.840
And I haven't been able to.

09:02.840 --> 09:08.760
It seemed to me that one of the key aspects of metaphysics as a part of philosophical

09:08.760 --> 09:17.200
inquiry is just that these questions always come up, it always comes up.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.400
What is the difference between correlation and causation?

09:21.400 --> 09:24.360
If we have these observed regularities, what do they explain?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
What do they say?

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
What are these things?

09:26.360 --> 09:30.800
What parts of this thing that we're saying is just an aspect of theory into what extent

09:30.800 --> 09:31.960
does it represent reality?

09:31.960 --> 09:37.680
And they're like all of these things inevitably involve metaphysical questions.

09:37.680 --> 09:43.760
And so I would say, for me personally, the primary role of metaphysics is most of these

09:43.760 --> 09:47.960
inelimitable questions that are not primarily empirical questions, but they are questions

09:47.960 --> 09:55.040
about what the world is like.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.240
There seems to be this, oh, Greg, I think you're muted.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.240
You want to go ahead?

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
Sorry.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
Yeah.

10:01.240 --> 10:05.040
Yes, I was going to say, I mean, I think that this discussion has gone very nicely in the

10:05.040 --> 10:09.240
sense of people painting their own sense of what metaphysics is and why it's important

10:09.240 --> 10:10.240
for me.

10:10.240 --> 10:18.360
I'm also someone who has studied different aspects of learning and have inquired about

10:18.360 --> 10:22.280
the nature of reality my entire life, which is why I've studied mathematics, physics,

10:22.280 --> 10:25.360
and philosophy my whole life and tried to do them regularly.

10:25.360 --> 10:30.640
And the thing which really drives me to metaphysical questions is the whole issue of precisely

10:30.640 --> 10:34.960
what is the relationship between our theory and reality.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.160
And it doesn't really matter what science you're in a Carnapian sense.

10:39.160 --> 10:42.680
It doesn't really matter which science you're talking about, which part of the humanities

10:42.680 --> 10:45.720
you're talking about, you're trying to understand the world in a certain sense.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.040
So I'm a physicist primarily or interested in philosophy of physics.

10:50.040 --> 10:55.120
And so when I approach these things, I always imagine the standard sort of thing of physicists

10:55.120 --> 10:59.480
would think, which is, well, reality, you know, it's definitely physical in some way.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.600
And the default position metaphysically for most physicists is realism.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.960
So if there's an objective reality out there exactly how does the various sciences and

11:08.960 --> 11:11.880
methods of thinking connect with each other.

11:11.880 --> 11:17.400
And in the sciences, you know, you have this natural tower of the sciences with presumably

11:17.400 --> 11:23.120
physics at the bottom and then chemistry and then biology and then perhaps mind at a higher

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
level.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.880
And there's an attempt to reduce these things down to the lowest level.

11:26.880 --> 11:32.160
So that's why I'm primarily focusing now on the ontological status of elementary particles

11:32.160 --> 11:36.920
because the default position in physics has been for a long time that if you understand

11:36.920 --> 11:40.480
the things at the lowest level, then you can understand these other things.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.760
So it's a sort of natural drive to metaphysics, the physics and science in general, natural

11:44.760 --> 11:47.040
sciences brings, I think.

11:47.040 --> 11:56.600
I know I was about to jump in and say, I know there's this history that I think we

11:56.600 --> 11:57.600
seem to be past.

11:57.600 --> 12:03.680
And I'd recommend that it's a title for this roundtable originally is metaphysics dead

12:03.680 --> 12:10.520
because there had been this long, you know, reign of logical positivism and the analytic

12:10.520 --> 12:16.320
philosophers who had sort of claimed that metaphysics should be eliminated as best it

12:16.320 --> 12:17.320
can.

12:17.320 --> 12:22.560
And so the job of philosophy is just to clean that up and make metaphysics as minimal as

12:22.560 --> 12:23.880
possible.

12:23.880 --> 12:29.240
And now there's been a little bit of resurgence and I think it's really interesting to see

12:29.240 --> 12:30.840
why that is.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.920
And we're we're headed with that.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.800
So, Arkady, do you want to make a comment about your thoughts?

12:37.800 --> 12:43.960
Yeah, I'm kind of new to the word metaphysics, although not to the subject because, you know,

12:43.960 --> 12:48.240
my I have a double trajectory in my intellectual life.

12:48.240 --> 12:55.400
My and was originally trained in quantum field theory and mathematics.

12:55.400 --> 13:00.960
And my first graduate degree wasn't that specifically group representations and things like that.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.320
And then I got interested in certain trends and continental philosophy.

13:05.320 --> 13:11.360
And in both of these, the metaphysics was, I wouldn't say dirty word, but just about

13:11.360 --> 13:18.600
and the and the reason for that part of the reason for that I think is that in some of

13:18.600 --> 13:23.920
these previous comments, it seems to me that there is a kind of sense of metaphysics.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.000
Well, the term has many various meanings.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.760
For example, the question, what is reality and what is representation of reality and

13:31.760 --> 13:37.760
the difference of that type could be seen as metaphysicals or may not be seen as metaphysical

13:37.760 --> 13:40.240
depending how you define metaphysics.

13:40.240 --> 13:47.280
I think in both of the trends to which I came into both of the subjects of my interest,

13:47.280 --> 13:49.800
these questions were of course all these asked.

13:49.800 --> 13:54.840
But the reason that there was skepticism about metaphysics, especially in subtle continental

13:54.840 --> 14:02.520
philosophy apart from one philosopher whom I know, Algio Delus, who used the word was

14:02.520 --> 14:09.000
not so much these questions, which were always asked, but the way we ask these questions,

14:09.000 --> 14:14.680
I think that's the one thing which I wanted to say that the question is how we ask these

14:14.680 --> 14:18.520
questions rather than simply these questions as such.

14:18.520 --> 14:25.080
And anyway, as I mentioned to Greg earlier, my thesis for today is there is no metaphysics,

14:25.080 --> 14:26.960
there is only metaphysics.

14:26.960 --> 14:34.760
So that's a double statement which I think is true depending on how you define metaphysics.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.760
Thank you.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.640
So the king is dead long with the king.

14:39.640 --> 14:45.760
Anyway, Harold, you want to make a comment?

14:45.760 --> 14:50.720
Oh, you're viewed in Harold.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.120
Yeah.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.640
Am I unmuted now?

14:53.640 --> 14:54.640
Yes.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.640
Okay, good.

14:55.640 --> 15:00.400
So I want to connect up with what Hans actually said at the beginning and start with what

15:00.400 --> 15:07.560
I was studying and what the problems were that our teachers actually confronted us within

15:07.560 --> 15:09.600
our studies.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.120
And interestingly, I think Hans is completely right.

15:14.120 --> 15:19.640
Whenever questions came up to the meaning of this or that, and then typically the response

15:19.640 --> 15:27.880
was this has become a winged word shut up and calculate.

15:27.880 --> 15:35.000
And then I entered into a phase in my studies when I went Hans Primoz at the ETH in Zurich.

15:35.000 --> 15:41.200
He was actually a professor of theoretical chemistry, but he was much more than that.

15:41.200 --> 15:47.160
He was actually a mathematical physicist with strong philosophical inclinations.

15:47.160 --> 15:54.880
And he would always say, you know, when scientists claim that they have no metaphysical position

15:54.880 --> 16:00.200
that they usually have a poor one because they are just unconscious of it.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.800
And of course, every scientist, he would say, must have a metaphysical position.

16:04.800 --> 16:12.400
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to do science, even the practicing physicist in his lab goes

16:12.400 --> 16:17.560
with the assumption that there is something there that he does experiments with, even

16:17.560 --> 16:25.280
though specifically in quantum physics, we know that our empirical access to the system

16:25.280 --> 16:29.080
out there changes that system or the state of that system.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.920
So we never see the reality out there.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.480
Just by trying to access it, we change it.

16:36.480 --> 16:43.880
This is pretty clear now in quantum mechanics, but it's also pretty clear in cognitive science.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.760
What we see out there is not what is out there.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.080
There are very interesting experiments about that.

16:50.080 --> 16:56.640
So in my trajectory, it became more and more obvious that the metaphysics has the study

16:56.640 --> 17:06.360
of what is there other than what we see there or what we can empirically do experiments

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
with.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.080
This is an important question.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.520
So that's why I got into that.

17:12.520 --> 17:28.240
Well, there's this issue of the fact of metaphysics being the foundation of a lot of physical science.

17:28.240 --> 17:34.080
And this other interesting fact that some scientists seem to want to deny it.

17:34.080 --> 17:41.400
I wonder if there are so many wonderful historical examples of scientists informed by their

17:41.400 --> 17:43.000
metaphysics.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.560
And rightly and wrongly, I think some of the examples that are often put forward as being

17:46.560 --> 17:52.720
a wrong example of metaphysical influence and science would be, let's say, alchemy.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.160
I mean, many other examples.

17:55.160 --> 18:01.320
Of course, Newton was completely absurd without me and yet produced all this wonderful science.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.440
And there are other examples where scientists obviously did have some form of a metaphysical

18:06.440 --> 18:11.800
position and it really did help them very much in their scientific research.

18:11.800 --> 18:17.480
So I wonder if there are any thoughts you might share about that.

18:17.480 --> 18:24.880
Well, I could say that one of the examples that usually comes up when people think about

18:24.880 --> 18:27.720
the relationship between physics and philosophy is Heisenberg.

18:27.720 --> 18:34.320
And Heisenberg was, of course, the person who's most closely associated with this idea that

18:34.320 --> 18:39.080
looking upon something can influence it and restrict potentially your ability to see it

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
in itself.

18:40.080 --> 18:45.040
And he certainly did bring in philosophical ideas in order to try to move forward.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.960
One of the most important things, which I've been interested in is his investigation of

18:48.960 --> 18:50.640
quantum potentiality.

18:50.640 --> 18:54.960
That when you start talking about the mathematics of quantum physics, what you're really talking

18:54.960 --> 19:00.080
about is mathematical description of the thing in itself, but you can never really access

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
that thing.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.960
But when you go and measure it, you do see something real and there's a certain mathematical

19:04.960 --> 19:09.600
relationship between those two things that the external reality has a potential, but it's

19:09.600 --> 19:13.880
only actual when you see it and it takes a form which we can understand when you actually

19:13.880 --> 19:15.520
do make that observation.

19:15.520 --> 19:20.520
So I think that's a case of not a bad, but actually a good example of somebody bringing

19:20.520 --> 19:26.440
philosophy in the physics and he was a very thoughtful person, obviously.

19:26.440 --> 19:34.200
I think this is a great point and great because in the beginning, in the pioneer phase that

19:34.200 --> 19:39.440
we say of quantum mechanics, there was an interpretation of quantum mechanics that was

19:39.440 --> 19:42.680
called the Copenhagen interpretation.

19:42.680 --> 19:50.400
And the Copenhagen and Heisenberg was part of it and part of the founders and the Copenhagen

19:50.400 --> 19:55.920
interpretation tried to stay away as much as possible from saying something about the

19:55.920 --> 19:58.920
metaphysical or what you call the potential now.

19:58.920 --> 20:03.080
Heisenberg moved forward from that in his later years when he came up with the ideas

20:03.080 --> 20:04.880
that you just mentioned.

20:04.880 --> 20:13.040
But of course, the Copenhagen interpretation is a knowledge-based interpretation whereas

20:13.040 --> 20:20.600
many people in reaction to that, quantum mechanics, tried to find an ontological basis for it.

20:20.600 --> 20:26.520
And this was the starting point of ongoing discussions about which one is the right interpretation

20:26.520 --> 20:32.280
to be the epistemic, the knowledge-based interpretation or the ontological interpretation.

20:32.280 --> 20:39.240
Now, the modern point of view now is that it's not really quite right to play these interpretations

20:39.240 --> 20:41.000
out against one another.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.960
The really interesting question is how they hang together, how one plays into the other

20:46.960 --> 20:55.160
and maybe even find some rules, how something that is out there due to an experiment or

20:55.160 --> 21:04.160
due to an observation comes into our mind-dependent representation.

21:04.160 --> 21:14.600
I have a little bit of difficulties with some of these terms because first of all, there

21:14.600 --> 21:17.840
is no such a thing as a single Copenhagen interpretation.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.680
It's never been.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.120
That's of course, Jia.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.560
Because for example, even from the very beginning, Bohr and Heisenberg's interpretation were

21:26.560 --> 21:27.560
somewhat different.

21:27.560 --> 21:34.240
It is also true, however, as Karl pointed out, that Heisenberg changed somewhat his views

21:34.240 --> 21:35.400
of things.

21:35.400 --> 21:42.320
In fact, if you look into his earlier book in 1930 on the physical principles of quantum

21:42.320 --> 21:44.560
theory, there is a very interesting comment.

21:44.560 --> 21:53.520
We shared with him that one of the reasons that we cannot see, there was always a kind

21:53.520 --> 21:59.160
of ontology in the Copenhagen interpretation that has to do with what we see in measuring

21:59.160 --> 22:00.240
instruments.

22:00.240 --> 22:06.160
That was assumed to be real and in fact, representable by means of classical physics.

22:06.160 --> 22:11.520
The question is that classical physics could not explain how what we see comes about and

22:11.520 --> 22:13.040
could not predict it.

22:13.040 --> 22:18.440
So Heisenberg made a point in which he said, look, it's not so surprising because our

22:18.440 --> 22:24.160
brain evolutionary developed in dealing with the object consisting of billions of atoms,

22:24.160 --> 22:25.160
et cetera.

22:25.160 --> 22:32.040
So there is no special reason to assume that it can deal with how nature is constituted

22:32.040 --> 22:33.400
at the ultimate level.

22:33.400 --> 22:40.680
So his position in that way was saying that was much closer to Bohr, which Bohr sort

22:40.680 --> 22:46.280
of always maintain and for Bohr was always central, the classical description of measuring

22:46.280 --> 22:53.200
instruments later on in the book where he talks on potentiality, especially physics and philosophy

22:53.200 --> 22:56.400
to which I presume Greg in part refers.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.960
He takes a very interesting position following in part, responding to Kant.

23:00.960 --> 23:07.160
Big part of this book is his response to Kant, idea that we cannot really know things on

23:07.160 --> 23:08.160
themselves.

23:08.160 --> 23:14.160
I cannot go into detail, but he said it may be that for a physicist, if things on themselves

23:14.160 --> 23:17.800
exist, they would at all, they would be mathematical.

23:17.800 --> 23:23.080
It was influenced by quantum field theory and group representation and all these things

23:23.080 --> 23:25.400
and Dirac's ideas.

23:25.400 --> 23:31.920
So I think so from that point of view, first of all, so he has a somewhat different view,

23:31.920 --> 23:38.760
but the second point which I want to make that in a way, the things I agree with the

23:38.760 --> 23:44.440
point that the things that are epistemological and ontological are kind of mixed, we also

23:44.440 --> 23:50.280
need to define these terms because ontology can have two meanings.

23:50.280 --> 23:55.040
One is assumption that there is something outside us which is real.

23:55.040 --> 24:01.240
And another one is the assumption that we could describe or represent or at least conceive

24:01.240 --> 24:03.840
of what it is outside.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.400
So I think these are two different meanings of ontology.

24:06.400 --> 24:12.160
And I think from within most people in Copenhagen interpretation, certainly born in Reisenberg,

24:12.160 --> 24:16.040
there was an assumption of the outside material reality.

24:16.040 --> 24:21.480
The question is, to what degree you could represent the ultimate constitution as opposed

24:21.480 --> 24:26.720
to the effects which it has on what you actually observe.

24:26.720 --> 24:34.400
And I think in parallel development, actually the psych analysis and Freud's theory, et cetera,

24:34.400 --> 24:40.360
use the idea of unconsciousness, the unconscious, which had some of connections of this line

24:40.360 --> 24:46.160
that we see the effects of the unconscious, but not necessarily the unconscious itself.

24:46.160 --> 24:52.800
I think there's a lot of very nuanced structures to this, to this, to this, to this, to this

24:52.800 --> 24:53.800
term.

24:53.800 --> 25:00.200
I think it's a little bit so difficult to, so that's what I would want to add as a footnote

25:00.200 --> 25:02.040
to this comments.

25:02.040 --> 25:09.920
I wanted to, because that's a lot of really interesting commentary.

25:09.920 --> 25:14.360
I wanted to make my own brief interjection and bring it down the ground a little bit.

25:14.360 --> 25:22.080
I always think of the quantum revolution as being a case where perhaps, and you can correct

25:22.080 --> 25:27.320
me if I'm wrong for the first time, this sort of physical theory outstripped any sense of

25:27.320 --> 25:28.960
where it's connected to reality.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.440
It reminds you a little bit of those cartoons where the character runs out over it off the

25:32.440 --> 25:35.880
end of the cliff and is out in the air and doesn't know where it is.

25:35.880 --> 25:40.720
How exactly to interpret the Schrodinger equation, whether or not it referred to some physical

25:40.720 --> 25:45.440
thing or not, seemed to be to be a unique problem that physics found itself in.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.520
And maybe that is something to do with the return of metaphysical thinking among some

25:49.520 --> 25:52.320
of the later generations.

25:52.320 --> 25:59.200
I would say that's a fairly unique situation where the science insisted on a metaphysical

25:59.200 --> 26:09.000
interpretation, whether you like it or not, so to speak.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.920
My comment on that would be that I believe that there's some historical momentum because

26:12.920 --> 26:18.600
of the success of classical physics that presented this default that things would naturally

26:18.600 --> 26:22.400
work out very well if we just thought about the world as made up of core puzzles moving

26:22.400 --> 26:27.120
around according to specific sorts of differential equations that we could make all the predictions

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
we wanted.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.840
Of course, that wasn't actually the case, but that was the sense.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.880
And I think that that's why this feeling of going off a cliff was so severe in the case

26:34.880 --> 26:35.880
of quantum mechanics.

26:35.880 --> 26:41.280
I think in the stretch of history, maybe it wasn't so unique, but certainly it's the

26:41.280 --> 26:42.760
closest and very dramatic.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.400
So I would agree with you in that sense.

26:45.400 --> 27:04.680
I'm wondering if it might be okay to come back to something that Greg mentioned earlier

27:04.680 --> 27:08.160
that I think I'm just quite curious.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.200
I think we probably have a very different range of opinions about this was that Greg

27:11.200 --> 27:16.040
mentioned the sort of traditional picture of the layers with physics at the bottom and

27:16.040 --> 27:19.560
chemistry and so on and so forth.

27:19.560 --> 27:27.400
And I certainly, I mean, I've done some physics myself and I understand that sort of intuition.

27:27.400 --> 27:33.120
I would say though, I think more recently I've started to think, I'm not sure I understand

27:33.120 --> 27:39.200
why we would think that way as a sort of descriptive layering just in the sense that it may be

27:39.200 --> 27:42.720
motivating in a certain sense to physicists and they think, you know, we're getting down

27:42.720 --> 27:46.560
to the deeper, deeper, deeper part of reality.

27:46.560 --> 27:54.240
But I mean, I would say my sense is that we're not making more progress in sort of seeing

27:54.240 --> 27:56.320
the, I mean, this relates to the quantum thing.

27:56.320 --> 28:01.040
It's not like we're seeing more progress now explaining the common sense world from the

28:01.040 --> 28:02.040
physics.

28:02.040 --> 28:05.360
It's actually kind of like the physics is getting so weird that we're getting further

28:05.360 --> 28:09.960
away from sort of, you know, making sense of the world around me.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.200
I mean, it's not like now I can look around me and go, well, now it makes sense because

28:13.200 --> 28:15.920
I understand the Schrodinger equation.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
It's sort of the opposite.

28:16.920 --> 28:23.320
Like the Newtonian picture was almost like, oh, I can just replace, I can replace the

28:23.320 --> 28:27.520
manifest image around me with the Newtonian picture and it's like, okay, that's better.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.720
It's like, it's hard for me to think I can replace the manifest image of the world around

28:31.720 --> 28:34.720
me with the quantum mechanical picture.

28:34.720 --> 28:41.040
It starts to me to feel like, okay, that's a great, you know, it's a great story or like

28:41.040 --> 28:44.840
sort of great painting of what's going down at the very bottom.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.320
It's a very useful painting.

28:47.320 --> 28:51.040
It certainly does a good job of describing experiments, but I'm not sure it's helping

28:51.040 --> 28:54.440
to make sense of the world around me better.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.600
I'm just curious what the different attitudes were that because I think that it almost

28:58.600 --> 29:01.840
divides people I found sort of in terms of philosophical intuitions.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.320
And there are those who just think, yeah, everything at the bottom is just the physical

29:05.320 --> 29:07.920
stuff and everything else kind of you pull it out of it.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.800
And there are those who resist that.

29:09.800 --> 29:15.240
Let me just just say that that is, I mentioned this is the default position, certainly not

29:15.240 --> 29:16.680
my own position, by any means.

29:16.680 --> 29:20.680
And in fact, I agree with you wholeheartedly, except that I would say give a little bit

29:20.680 --> 29:26.520
of, you know, support to that idea and not insane basis for that, which is that, you

29:26.520 --> 29:31.240
know, the nature of science has been to spread our, the scope of our knowledge and the scope

29:31.240 --> 29:35.840
of our knowledge has been where we've understood fairly well, we can go to the moon with pretty

29:35.840 --> 29:40.400
lousy, I would say physics in the sense of not very sophisticated and a computer, which

29:40.400 --> 29:42.560
is no like the cell phone that I have here.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.520
And that can get you to the moon.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.320
So that's pretty impressive, right?

29:46.320 --> 29:49.680
And so we develop all this technology for us to see different scales.

29:49.680 --> 29:53.160
And when we get to the atomic scale, then we have this interesting thing where, well,

29:53.160 --> 29:57.720
okay, it looks a little bit difficult to understand in our ordinary way of understanding what's

29:57.720 --> 29:58.720
going on there.

29:58.720 --> 30:02.600
But at the same time, if you look at the alcohol process, for example, building up the nature

30:02.600 --> 30:08.360
of the, you know, the periodic table, just from your basic mathematics of it's not so

30:08.360 --> 30:12.520
different from the classical version that you can actually see a structure build up and

30:12.520 --> 30:15.680
you can think of chemical things as built up of those pieces.

30:15.680 --> 30:18.960
And then you can get biochemistry and then you can explain biology and then you can

30:18.960 --> 30:19.960
explain the brain.

30:19.960 --> 30:24.640
Now, I would say like Descartes, well, mind is a different story perhaps.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.360
But you know, there is some basis for thinking that in successive sciences, what I want to

30:28.360 --> 30:30.440
say, but I agree with you, otherwise.

30:30.440 --> 30:38.240
Well, you know, the Anderson, of course, in 1973 famous article, more is different, was

30:38.240 --> 30:39.240
anti-reductionist.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.720
It's a very important article.

30:40.720 --> 30:47.760
I agree entirely that it's, I don't think we could even reduce chemistry to physics,

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
strictly speaking.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.200
There is a lot of chemistry as Greg just noted, which could be explained by means of chemistry,

30:54.200 --> 30:59.280
but it's very hard to reduce it to physics, except very simple case.

30:59.280 --> 31:06.360
It has a basic explanation of, with Bohr's atomic theory of the table in terms of electron

31:06.360 --> 31:07.360
levels, et cetera.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.560
But it doesn't mean that it can do much of chemistry.

31:10.560 --> 31:17.240
On the other hand, I do think that that's the point which Heisenberg and Park made, that

31:17.240 --> 31:25.680
we should not expect that quantum theory should help us to understand the world around us.

31:25.680 --> 31:33.320
I think Hermann Weil at some point said about mathematics, actually, and he said to relate

31:33.320 --> 31:41.120
the intuition of continuity in mathematics, he was referring to Kantor's theory to our

31:41.120 --> 31:43.600
everyday intuition is meaningless.

31:43.600 --> 31:51.320
But he said we can use this very abstract mathematics in physics, including in relativity

31:51.320 --> 31:52.320
and quantum physics.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.080
And the way you can say that the whole history of mathematics, beginning with roughly the

31:57.080 --> 32:02.240
end of the 19th century, was a developing of abstract mathematics, which had very little

32:02.240 --> 32:06.040
connections to the description of the world.

32:06.040 --> 32:11.920
And remarkably enough, if you think about that, quantum theory Heisenberg, of course,

32:11.920 --> 32:17.320
he didn't use the language, but he essentially used Hilbert spaces over complex numbers.

32:17.320 --> 32:25.160
It's not an object which in any way is related to our intuitive or other descriptions of the

32:25.160 --> 32:26.160
world.

32:26.160 --> 32:33.080
And that's why I think that point about the connections between quantum physics or its

32:33.080 --> 32:35.080
story, et cetera.

32:35.080 --> 32:44.440
And the relationships between the world as we see it is really complex and maybe impossible.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.440
It may be impossible.

32:45.440 --> 32:50.200
I think behind Professor Halberts, when I see painting, which is kind of abstract, and

32:50.200 --> 32:56.280
made me think about Kandinsky and other painters who were contemporary of quantum theory, who

32:56.280 --> 33:02.920
created all these images, which you cannot really connect to the world.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.920
Unlike somebody like Picasso, who always scrambled reality.

33:06.920 --> 33:13.280
Somebody like Kandinsky just came up to totally different, of course, he related it to some

33:13.280 --> 33:18.320
spiritual reality and commenting on this book on spiritual and art.

33:18.320 --> 33:24.600
But I think the point is that I think it would be hard to expect that a quantum theory has

33:24.600 --> 33:27.680
much connections to the actual world.

33:27.680 --> 33:34.920
In fact, to think so in terms of even classical theory is already complicated.

33:34.920 --> 33:41.560
A classical physics is not necessarily, it was born as a mathematical refinement of our

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
intuition.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.560
This is true.

33:43.560 --> 33:48.280
But by 19th century, it's already developed if you think about Maxwell electrodynamics

33:48.280 --> 33:52.440
and things of that type, very far from what we do.

33:52.440 --> 33:58.440
And I don't think it can explain this different emergent level of how we do so.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.280
We need different explanation.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.560
And in a way, you can say different metaphysics, which operates at different levels of explanation.

34:05.560 --> 34:12.880
I think it might be useful here to make a distinction between different senses of explanation.

34:12.880 --> 34:20.920
So there might be the question of, like, does physics explain ordinary everyday reality

34:20.920 --> 34:27.000
as we encounter it in the sense of, like, if we studied a lot of physics, would we be able

34:27.000 --> 34:31.800
to understand how to make dinner or things like that?

34:31.800 --> 34:34.920
So that sense of, like, would it give us epistemic insight?

34:34.920 --> 34:39.160
And then there's a more metaphysically loaded sense of explanation, which is, like, you

34:39.160 --> 34:46.520
know, if we understood the nature of the fundamental physical particles or something like that,

34:46.520 --> 34:53.160
would that then give us the metaphysical grounding or would it, like, would it explain the nature

34:53.160 --> 34:54.160
of everything?

34:54.160 --> 34:55.880
Would you kind of get everything else for free?

34:55.880 --> 34:59.720
You know, if you were God and you were creating the world, would you basically just have to

34:59.720 --> 35:06.120
create the fundamental particles and the laws and say, you know, let it be thus?

35:06.120 --> 35:09.320
And then you would get the manifest image.

35:09.320 --> 35:13.000
So I guess the difference between, like, is there epistemic emergence?

35:13.000 --> 35:17.240
Or there's some facts that you just couldn't know by knowing the fundamental physical facts?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.080
And then maybe is there ontological emergence?

35:19.080 --> 35:33.120
Is there some stuff that isn't just some basic recombination of the fundamental physical

35:33.120 --> 35:34.120
particles?

35:34.120 --> 35:36.840
Or, like, you could understand everything there was to understand about the nature of

35:36.840 --> 35:41.920
that reality by understanding fundamental reality?

35:41.920 --> 35:46.160
And certainly, like, one of the things I've been interested in thinking about the metaphysics

35:46.160 --> 35:55.880
of the social world, social ontology, is, you know, might there be some interesting ontological

35:55.880 --> 36:00.600
and metaphysical claims about that the nature of the world as we have made it, where we just

36:00.600 --> 36:06.640
need different explanatory tools, we need different concepts, we need different ways

36:06.640 --> 36:11.880
of talking about what the world is like precisely because we're talking about reality.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.760
That is in part social.

36:13.760 --> 36:21.000
It's part of the way that we have made reality to be that you don't necessarily just get

36:21.000 --> 36:27.040
for free by thinking about the nature of fundamental particles.

36:27.040 --> 36:34.640
But, you know, that's a very, very, very complicated metaphysical question that wouldn't necessarily

36:34.640 --> 36:41.000
be settled either way by settling whether, you know, if you did enough physics, you would

36:41.000 --> 36:46.360
be able to understand what flamingos look like or something like that.

36:46.360 --> 36:54.480
Well, Elizabeth, you mentioned earlier this interesting issue of correlation and causation,

36:54.480 --> 37:00.320
which often arises in these large ensembles, like large groups of elements.

37:00.320 --> 37:05.280
And then the question becomes, how do you decide whether some sort of correlation is

37:05.280 --> 37:09.400
causative or that's just hanging together in some other sense?

37:09.400 --> 37:14.200
And typically when that arises, it also pulls into question whether everything just comes

37:14.200 --> 37:16.280
down to billiard balls, right?

37:16.280 --> 37:20.120
Because now you've got the action of all these ensembles.

37:20.120 --> 37:26.480
I think it's a really interesting handle on this problem.

37:26.480 --> 37:30.680
Well, I'm going to go ahead and come back.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.680
Oh, sorry, Craig.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.520
So I would just say quickly, you know, the real question that comes to mind there, if

37:35.520 --> 37:40.000
you're a true believer in this kind of physicalist view is, you know, kind of mathematics do

37:40.000 --> 37:42.440
it and the answer is no, the mathematics can't do it.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.960
The mathematics will probably never do it, absolutely.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.160
But on the other hand, you know, we didn't really understand why the sky was blue until

37:48.160 --> 37:52.000
we did enough quantum field theory, which is not very well-informed fact.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.960
But as a matter of fact, this particular sort of scattering is something that is understood

37:55.960 --> 37:59.640
best and probably only correctly after quantum field theory.

37:59.640 --> 38:04.640
So it's a very complex question, but I would agree with you on the basic level of it.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.720
It's a fantasy to think that you're just understanding some elementary particles you're

38:07.720 --> 38:17.160
going to understand the mind or social reality or anything terribly complicated.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.680
My strong sense is, again, I speak as someone who's, I hang around a lot of philosophers

38:21.680 --> 38:24.960
and even meta positions, although I don't think I would call myself meta position.

38:24.960 --> 38:32.040
My sense is that, you know, so somebody, you know, physics, when one is doing physics,

38:32.040 --> 38:35.440
the job description is fairly clear.

38:35.440 --> 38:38.640
It's, I mean, it's fairly institutionally fixed, what a physicist does.

38:38.640 --> 38:44.400
I think my sense is for metaphysicians, their self description of their task is probably

38:44.400 --> 38:47.840
quite different from meta position to meta position.

38:47.840 --> 38:52.840
And my sense is that the way Elizabeth described her way of thinking is very different from

38:52.840 --> 38:57.040
some other meta positions who sort of think, my job is to look at all the sciences and

38:57.040 --> 39:02.480
just tell you how everything kind of flows out from the bottom to the top.

39:02.480 --> 39:06.720
Yeah, I think sociologically, that's definitely right.

39:06.720 --> 39:12.720
And I mean, one thing I've like personally been interested in criticizing the idea of

39:12.720 --> 39:17.240
like the goal of metaphysics is to describe the nature of fundamentality or something

39:17.240 --> 39:18.240
like that.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.600
So there's this idea that, you know, we figure out what's fundamental, what the basic reality

39:22.600 --> 39:28.520
is that sort of, you get a lot, there's a lot of interesting word choice and so you get

39:28.520 --> 39:30.560
the language of like purity.

39:30.560 --> 39:37.200
So the pure reality or the, you know, the ungrounded or the all this kind of stuff.

39:37.200 --> 39:41.400
And so it's like, if we could just describe that, then the task of metaphysics is sort

39:41.400 --> 39:48.880
of carving the beast of nature at its joints or is talking about the absolutely fundamental.

39:48.880 --> 39:55.440
And then everything else is maybe just kind of derivative on that or grounded in that or

39:55.440 --> 40:02.120
explained by that or an ontological free lunch or something like that is the phrasing that

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
you sometimes use.

40:03.120 --> 40:10.320
And I think that's a very common way of thinking about the projects of metaphysics within at

40:10.320 --> 40:11.320
least analytic philosophy.

40:11.320 --> 40:15.360
But I think it's also a way of thinking about project of metaphysics, which a lot of people

40:15.360 --> 40:22.920
have been critical and that there's a lot of really interesting metaphysics that's not

40:22.920 --> 40:24.240
doing anything like that.

40:24.240 --> 40:30.640
So two of my colleagues at the University of Virginia who both self describe as metaphysicians

40:30.640 --> 40:31.840
have just published books.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.880
And one of them is about the nature of personhood and personhood over time, like what makes

40:35.880 --> 40:43.080
you the same person that you were 10 years ago, 15 years ago, can we give any sort of

40:43.080 --> 40:44.560
account of that.

40:44.560 --> 40:54.880
And the other is about dependence and explanation and basically trying to criticize the idea

40:54.880 --> 40:59.400
to criticize the assumption of foundationalism, that explanation always has to come to an end.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.240
So could there be infinite change of dissent?

41:02.240 --> 41:04.480
Could there be circular chains of explanations?

41:04.480 --> 41:10.680
Did there, you know, so there's big discussions of explanation and non-well founded set theory

41:10.680 --> 41:12.800
or things like that.

41:12.800 --> 41:18.960
And they both think of themselves as doing metaphysics, absolutely.

41:18.960 --> 41:23.640
But they're not trying to carve the beast of nature at its joints.

41:23.640 --> 41:28.360
They're not trying to explain the nature of fundamentality, but nor are they doing something

41:28.360 --> 41:30.800
that they think of as just conceptual engineering.

41:30.800 --> 41:34.480
We're talking about, you know, what's reality like?

41:34.480 --> 41:40.520
I think the real question is, you know, you just brought that up, carving nature at its

41:40.520 --> 41:42.720
joints, right?

41:42.720 --> 41:50.400
Because nature has, you know, joints, primarily, or is it our descriptions that produce joints

41:50.400 --> 41:58.200
that we try out to describe nature and decompose it into elements that are connected by these

41:58.200 --> 41:59.200
joints.

41:59.200 --> 42:04.000
So I think a very interesting proposal, which goes along the lines of what you were saying,

42:04.000 --> 42:11.680
Elizabeth, is already due to Kwein in 1960, something where he tried to relativize ontology.

42:11.680 --> 42:17.320
So actually, the article that he wrote has a title, Ontological Relativity.

42:17.320 --> 42:23.120
And the idea is, and of course, Kwein says that in much more detail than I can, reproduce

42:23.120 --> 42:29.640
it now, the idea is something like every domain of description that we choose for a certain

42:29.640 --> 42:35.840
situation to describe it can be considered ontologically or not.

42:35.840 --> 42:40.800
And then we can have many ontologies, which are connected to one another and actually

42:40.800 --> 42:47.120
Kwein charges us that we should find translations between these ontologies.

42:47.120 --> 42:51.400
And this is actually his program of ontological relativity.

42:51.400 --> 42:56.280
And once you, but once you look at a certain situation and find the best way to describe

42:56.280 --> 43:02.240
it, then you should commit yourself to that ontology and not change it during the description

43:02.240 --> 43:04.040
all the time.

43:04.040 --> 43:08.720
Hillary Putnam actually had the same or worked this out with his idea of internal realism,

43:08.720 --> 43:13.920
which is a little bit different in the nuances, but essentially the same idea.

43:13.920 --> 43:22.120
And that's the way to find a middle path between foundationalism, which Kwein rejected Putnam

43:22.120 --> 43:27.640
II, and the other extreme of something like radical emergence where everything is possible

43:27.640 --> 43:30.880
and nothing is connected with one another.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.720
So complete arbitrariness of descriptions.

43:33.720 --> 43:41.080
I think this is a proposal which is still somewhat understudied in the sciences, although

43:41.080 --> 43:47.840
it has received some serious consideration philosophy, of course.

43:47.840 --> 43:56.440
Well, of course, if you look at the word meta to start with, like restotials books on metaphysics,

43:56.440 --> 44:02.280
which was not his title, was added by somebody, some say, it means, it just means that the

44:02.280 --> 44:06.800
books come after metaphysics, next set of books.

44:06.800 --> 44:15.120
I think the word meta implies in a way that you describe one system in terms of an other,

44:15.120 --> 44:19.240
which is can comprehend the system from outside to some degree.

44:19.240 --> 44:23.560
So I think so from that point of view, you can have a very different level of metaphysics

44:23.560 --> 44:26.480
depending what you define as physics.

44:26.480 --> 44:32.960
One of the main big contributions and my view in quantum mechanics, especially in the

44:32.960 --> 44:39.640
Bohr's interpretation of an early Heisenberg, I'm not sure about Copenhagen, is that we

44:39.640 --> 44:44.480
and I think you extend it can be for at least in physics.

44:44.480 --> 44:49.160
We always deal with our interaction with the world.

44:49.160 --> 44:55.120
To some degree, clients different level of ontology describe different levels of this

44:55.120 --> 44:56.120
interaction.

44:56.120 --> 45:02.920
In that sense, if you take an extreme position, which I actually like and we're not completely

45:02.920 --> 45:08.240
taking it, that everything is metaphysics in terms of it.

45:08.240 --> 45:11.680
We can only have a human description of anything.

45:11.680 --> 45:18.040
Part of Heisenberg's point was, with which I started here, that there is no reason to

45:18.040 --> 45:22.560
believe that we could describe the ultimate level of reality or maybe some other level

45:22.560 --> 45:23.560
of reality.

45:23.560 --> 45:30.680
We hear that we were fortunate that mathematics is to some degree free of limitations of common

45:30.680 --> 45:35.880
language and concepts and it can predict what happens in quantum mechanics.

45:35.880 --> 45:43.280
But we don't necessarily can hope that it could work in any other set of areas.

45:43.280 --> 45:49.120
I think it's true that the metaphysicians, in part for that reason, define this task very

45:49.120 --> 45:55.440
differently from most physicists beginning with Galileo and after who could think in

45:55.440 --> 46:00.720
terms of mathematical description of predictions of what is going on.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.560
Because technically, that's why the origin of the so-called the heart problem of consciousness.

46:05.560 --> 46:13.400
We really don't have a physicalist, functional interpretation of our conscious experience

46:13.400 --> 46:14.640
in terms of coalesce.

46:14.640 --> 46:21.760
I think that really tells you that it may not be possible to describe many things to

46:21.760 --> 46:26.200
which we relate to the worth of our mind in mathematical terms.

46:26.200 --> 46:33.280
So I think that seems to me that that is the, it's very hard to believe that that program

46:33.280 --> 46:39.360
of from bottom, on the other hand, I'm not quite sure who would subscribe to that extreme

46:39.360 --> 46:43.840
view that everything it really doesn't matter.

46:43.840 --> 46:49.960
There's all these connections and there's always some sense of systematicity in description

46:49.960 --> 46:52.960
and the interaction between various levels.

46:52.960 --> 46:59.040
Since you're talking about the meaning of meta, Arkady, do you know what Karlab said

46:59.040 --> 47:00.040
about that?

47:00.040 --> 47:02.040
Yes, I do, yes.

47:02.040 --> 47:05.000
Whatever you do, I can do meta.

47:05.000 --> 47:13.760
Exactly true, because there is all this system which, you know, Lakota Shka's has

47:13.760 --> 47:18.680
an interesting comment on that as well, you know, but the Lakota Shka's, you know, it's

47:18.680 --> 47:23.600
a great statement of Lakota Shka's that all physical theory have the same probability

47:23.600 --> 47:26.640
to be true, namely zero, right?

47:26.640 --> 47:37.120
So in a certain sense, it's always our engagement with the world in different domain through

47:37.120 --> 47:44.360
mathematics and technology and physics, which produces because while the ultimate likelihood

47:44.360 --> 47:49.120
the theory is to be true even though Einstein believed that thermodynamics will probably

47:49.120 --> 47:55.560
always be true is the local possibility of how it works.

47:55.560 --> 48:04.680
So in that sense, it is a kind of workable theory which is at this giving moment is we

48:04.680 --> 48:10.960
accept, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it continue to be and therefore from that

48:10.960 --> 48:17.040
point of view, and I say there's only metaphysics, I mean by that, that we don't have any description

48:17.040 --> 48:23.960
except the ones which produce by who we are as evolutionary developed by biological beings

48:23.960 --> 48:29.640
with the brains which produces the mind which we don't know how it does either.

48:29.640 --> 48:34.320
And only briefly my second comment to what you said about the heart problem of consciousness

48:34.320 --> 48:39.640
is it's only a brief comment, I'm just coming back from the consciousness conference, the

48:39.640 --> 48:44.800
big consciousness conference in Tucson which takes place in Tucson every other year and

48:44.800 --> 48:51.200
you would be astonished how many neuroscience people still believe there's only the brain

48:51.200 --> 48:53.200
that we have to talk about, right?

48:53.200 --> 48:56.040
No, I'm not astonished, I know that's called.

48:56.040 --> 48:58.600
Yeah, of course I know that.

48:58.600 --> 48:59.600
That's true.

48:59.600 --> 49:08.920
Yeah, I was going to say, look, I think I need to defend those who take a slightly more

49:08.920 --> 49:12.720
hardcore view about, you know, we just want to describe, you know, reality like it is

49:12.720 --> 49:13.720
not.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.680
I completely agree with the phrasing for example that, you know, every description is a human

49:18.680 --> 49:24.200
description but the thing is, I think that's also can be interpreted in a negative way

49:24.200 --> 49:26.880
where somebody says, okay, so then there's no more standards, right?

49:26.880 --> 49:32.360
I mean, like my description is my description, your description is your description.

49:32.360 --> 49:39.480
So you know, I think that taken in the wrong way, it can just, it can sort of destroy the

49:39.480 --> 49:44.680
grand scientific project or even the minor individual seeking truth projects we have

49:44.680 --> 49:46.320
as individuals, right?

49:46.320 --> 49:51.360
Where you somehow always have to tell yourself, my view, the view that's influenced by who

49:51.360 --> 49:56.760
I am is probably in many ways very wrong because of who I am, because of my perspective, because

49:56.760 --> 49:58.360
of various things inside me.

49:58.360 --> 50:01.600
So what's, you know, I think I feel that I think that longing that some people have

50:01.600 --> 50:06.000
and they say that but there's just that description of the way things are is because they're trying

50:06.000 --> 50:10.040
to say, remember, not every description is equally good.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.000
So I think that's one thing we're missing here is we, you know, what is that standard

50:13.000 --> 50:14.760
we're trying to live up to?

50:14.760 --> 50:15.920
That's very true.

50:15.920 --> 50:20.880
But I don't think you need to have one need to take this position is also some do that

50:20.880 --> 50:26.080
meaning that every, as you say, you agree that every is a human interaction doesn't imply

50:26.080 --> 50:32.720
because within each giving the main there reasons, you can, you can still do quantum

50:32.720 --> 50:39.640
mechanics under the assumption of all the constraints which are involved without necessarily assuming

50:39.640 --> 50:44.160
that you strictly describe the ultimate nature of reality.

50:44.160 --> 50:49.520
I don't think anyone like I said, in fact, bore, you know, as a great statement says

50:49.520 --> 50:56.800
about complementarity, he says the complementarity actually contrary to Einstein fulfilled all

50:56.800 --> 51:03.200
the basic principle requirement as science as a mathematical experimental engagement

51:03.200 --> 51:04.960
with nature.

51:04.960 --> 51:11.960
Science, including institutionally has this type of rules and constraints which tells

51:11.960 --> 51:18.640
us something about that is to say we may not know things about reality but our interaction

51:18.640 --> 51:21.840
with reality is not free.

51:21.840 --> 51:24.880
You know, it's not strictly free.

51:24.880 --> 51:29.160
It's not it's a matter of how it plays itself out.

51:29.160 --> 51:33.640
So I cannot, you know, come out and say without any constraint.

51:33.640 --> 51:40.240
Look, as I think that there is some universal consciousness somewhere, et cetera.

51:40.240 --> 51:42.120
It's not a scientific statement.

51:42.120 --> 51:49.200
So from that point of view, we are governed by this rule, some of which could be personal.

51:49.200 --> 51:53.920
The question is what you believe as a ground and wish you stand and for many people as

51:53.920 --> 51:59.560
you say to believe that you describe reality, give you such a ground, but such a ground

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
is not necessary.

52:00.560 --> 52:07.120
If you think about people like nature and to some degree, they believe in each famous

52:07.120 --> 52:13.800
because they say long live physics because it gives us the sense of integrity, right?

52:13.800 --> 52:18.520
But at the same time, he believes in certain in the radical perspectives.

52:18.520 --> 52:26.120
I think it's a I think your comment is extremely good because it is a very complex landscape

52:26.120 --> 52:33.040
of negotiating between how you ground what you say about your interaction with the world.

52:33.040 --> 52:36.280
So that seems to me is a crucial point.

52:36.280 --> 52:41.320
You can't grow them in reality, but you don't in the ultimate constitution of reality, but

52:41.320 --> 52:44.400
you don't necessarily need to in my view.

52:44.400 --> 52:48.400
But just to follow up on what Hans, the point that Hans was making, no, I do think there

52:48.400 --> 52:55.400
is like, there's something about and you don't have to go as far as like scientific realism,

52:55.400 --> 53:00.960
but something about like the metaphysical assumption that there is an external reality

53:00.960 --> 53:06.560
that we are attempting to describe, that we are attempting to, you know, to describe

53:06.560 --> 53:08.480
with scientific theories.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.160
That's maybe different.

53:11.160 --> 53:14.800
And that's a different type of project than we might be doing in other types of humanistic

53:14.800 --> 53:22.320
inquiry that does seem to be an important constraint on the practice in some cases, or

53:22.320 --> 53:26.200
at least like a hopeful aspect of the practice.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.760
And of course, you can distinguish between thinking that it's what we're trying to do

53:29.760 --> 53:33.680
and thinking it's what creatures like us are able to do.

53:33.680 --> 53:39.240
Like, you know, in my everyday life, I'm trying to treat everyone equally and everyone fairly

53:39.240 --> 53:40.760
in order to try to be a moral person.

53:40.760 --> 53:47.360
I also kind of don't believe that someone like me is actually capable of doing that.

53:47.360 --> 53:52.360
You know, I think inevitably I am going to be influenced by bias and influenced by nepotism

53:52.360 --> 53:56.920
and influenced by being grumpy and like all these sorts of things.

53:56.920 --> 53:59.600
And yet, nevertheless, it's what I'm trying to do.

53:59.600 --> 54:05.880
And it's also what I think that someone like me is never going to be in a position to do.

54:05.880 --> 54:11.840
So we might think that like our theories are trying to describe a structure of reality

54:11.840 --> 54:18.680
and yet are never in a position to actually do that because they're done by limited fallible

54:18.680 --> 54:21.840
creatures and because it's really hard to distinguish between what's the element of the theory

54:21.840 --> 54:25.280
and what's the element of, you know, the thing being represented and so on and so forth.

54:25.280 --> 54:30.800
And it does seem like sometimes we want to be able to criticize practices for having

54:30.800 --> 54:32.300
gone wrong.

54:32.300 --> 54:36.120
Whereas if we thought like all you need to do is have like ideological presuppositions

54:36.120 --> 54:41.800
and a coherent way of viewing the world and then get your theories to work out right,

54:41.800 --> 54:46.160
there might be places where it's hard to provide a critique that we want to be able to provide.

54:46.160 --> 54:52.920
So this isn't physics, obviously, but you know, there are these famous cases in psychological

54:52.920 --> 54:58.040
research where studies of whether ESP is real.

54:58.040 --> 55:02.080
And what seems to be the pattern in the research on this is that like people who believe in

55:02.080 --> 55:09.840
ESP design all these really great, well-organized studies and they go and they find ESP and

55:09.840 --> 55:11.640
they find evidence that ESP is real.

55:11.640 --> 55:16.440
And then people who don't believe that ESP is real are like that can't be right.

55:16.440 --> 55:21.960
And they go and they describe design all these really well-organized, you know, great well-designed

55:21.960 --> 55:25.440
studies and they prove that ESP is not real.

55:25.440 --> 55:29.880
And so you've got this practice going on where you've got two set, you know, you've got different

55:29.880 --> 55:36.760
communities that have different assumptions and, you know, different ideological stuff

55:36.760 --> 55:40.680
affecting what they think the world is like and then they're doing scientific practice.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.960
But it seems like what we want to say in this case is, look, either ESP is real or it's

55:43.960 --> 55:44.960
not.

55:44.960 --> 55:48.640
And something's going wrong when science is like this.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.840
You need to be able to figure out what's going wrong here.

55:51.840 --> 55:58.480
But if you don't have that assumption that like either ESP is real or it isn't and the

55:58.480 --> 56:04.920
goal of scientific practice is somewhat imperfectly to figure out what the world is like, then

56:04.920 --> 56:11.040
you can't kind of make that external critique in a way that seems important in an epistemic

56:11.040 --> 56:12.520
situation like that.

56:12.520 --> 56:18.800
Well, it depends on the sense that, you know, it interacts with what I said, it depends on

56:18.800 --> 56:22.160
the level on which you assume ontological reality.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.360
I don't have to make an assumption in physics in principle.

56:26.360 --> 56:31.800
You know, I make an assumption and most physicists do it's very hard to do without it, all the

56:31.800 --> 56:32.800
possible.

56:32.800 --> 56:39.640
There are four layers of Berkeley and fundamental physics that there is exist an external reality

56:39.640 --> 56:45.080
in the sense that the world existed before we came on the stage and will continue to

56:45.080 --> 56:52.000
exist after we are gone from the stage is going to be very soon by the standards of the scale

56:52.000 --> 56:53.560
of the universe.

56:53.560 --> 57:01.120
But that does not mean that I can make any unambiguous or meaningful statement about

57:01.120 --> 57:04.920
how the world really is ultimately.

57:04.920 --> 57:11.360
But I can make an ambiguous and correct statements about the interaction with the world through

57:11.360 --> 57:17.520
technology and mathematics through which I can predict what's going to happen.

57:17.520 --> 57:23.760
And in the case of extracellular perception, you can pause it in a similar way.

57:23.760 --> 57:29.680
You can check to what degree these things correspond to the experiments of which we

57:29.680 --> 57:30.680
conduct.

57:30.680 --> 57:34.640
It doesn't really undermine that on the other hand, even in physics, there is still

57:34.640 --> 57:41.160
always disagreement between people who take ontological position and who don't take ontological

57:41.160 --> 57:43.680
position or there is still different theory.

57:43.680 --> 57:48.480
You know, there are people who are strong believers in so-called bombing and mechanics

57:48.480 --> 57:53.720
and you cannot really, they will not be convinced on kind of similar ground.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.800
It's always to some degree ideological.

57:55.800 --> 58:01.960
But my point is that you could conduct science without making an assumption that the ultimate

58:01.960 --> 58:06.080
nature of reality could be represented by a series.

58:06.080 --> 58:11.080
But there are all these will be levels which will need to be so represented as, for example,

58:11.080 --> 58:17.440
in physics, we need to describe measuring instrument because otherwise we cannot really

58:17.440 --> 58:18.440
do it.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.560
So I think it's not, there are different level.

58:21.560 --> 58:27.120
It's really the level of, as Harold pointed out, Wack-Wine, it's at the level of ontology

58:27.120 --> 58:29.880
and reality which you have to assume.

58:29.880 --> 58:35.960
And if you deal with kind of social metaphysics as you pointed out, it will be different from

58:35.960 --> 58:39.240
doing the metaphysics and physics.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.320
That would be my position on that.

58:41.320 --> 58:48.400
That you don't have to assume that something is real, they assume that something is real,

58:48.400 --> 58:54.800
but you don't have to assume that you could describe even in principle what is real.

58:54.800 --> 58:56.760
You don't have to make this assumption.

58:56.760 --> 59:01.960
But after all, we have no idea what elementary particles are in terms of the physics.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.480
We can only observe the effects on measuring instrument.

59:05.480 --> 59:09.880
Nobody has ever seen an actual elementary particle on its own accord.

59:09.880 --> 59:16.040
You can only see the photographs which they live by collisions with instrument and things

59:16.040 --> 59:19.040
of that.

59:19.040 --> 59:21.240
There's, yeah, please.

59:21.240 --> 59:25.600
I was going to say, Arkady, what would you say then though is that, I mean, if one thought,

59:25.600 --> 59:32.400
okay, I think there's a reality, but it can't be described, what should the goal then be?

59:32.400 --> 59:35.000
So what should the scientist be trying to do?

59:35.000 --> 59:42.480
Well, as I just said, you describe and predict what's going to happen in experiment which

59:42.480 --> 59:44.480
you observe, right?

59:44.480 --> 59:48.040
Or describe reality at the level where you can describe them.

59:48.040 --> 59:54.480
I mean, it was really crucial nuance that you cannot describe the ultimate nature of reality,

59:54.480 --> 59:58.800
but it does not mean, as Carl said, that you can or they must describe.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.480
So you have plenty of goals.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.280
Look, my goal is to develop, listen, I think Paul Girock was quite interesting about that

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.520
because he was very mathematical.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:14.600
So he wasn't even thinking, one of the people who didn't probably have metaphysics, although

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.720
I would write the wrong about that.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:22.800
But the goal was to write an equation which predict was going to happen if a relativistic

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.080
electron hits the screen, right?

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.120
So he writes the equation which leads to the discovery of a positron.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.480
But what is a positron?

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.680
It's another assumption of something which if you hit the screen in a particular way,

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.040
you have this and that type of data.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.120
That's a pretty good task to perform.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:46.320
It's a good task, but I'd say I want to come back to sort of for me at the very beginning

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:53.280
of this, I'm a little bit afraid that that sort of idea is what led to a lot of what

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.480
I see in science education.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.200
No, no, no, listen, I'm not in disagreement with that.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.920
Look, you can, this idea is just a little bit forgiving for that comparison.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.160
That's why somebody like Nietzsche could be very dangerous as he said himself because

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.600
you can use these ideas in all manner of wrong way, you know, like you have some so-called

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.280
postmodernist philosophers, people like De Reda, Foucault de Lewis, et cetera, whose

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:28.080
ideas were quite complex and controversial, but the way they were used, including in education,

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.320
is sometimes ridiculous, you know, but they try to base them with these philosophical

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320
things.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.840
I think it's very not fair.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.520
I think it'd be interesting to outline for people for our audience, especially too that

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.680
there's a little bit of a caricature of the history of analytic philosophy that sort of

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:49.160
leaves out some of the struggles with foundationalism.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.280
And this also goes over into the philosophy of mathematics, where, you know, a number

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.720
of them, including Rudolf Kornop, who's been mentioned here several times in the point,

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:03.040
have moved along toward saying having the sort of naturalistic posture whereby they say,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.080
okay, well, look, science is, we're going to assume science is largely correct.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:14.160
And now, how do we proceed now, because we're going to not assume, it says something foundational

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.760
about the ontological reality, but we'll say it does provide true statements.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.640
So what can we do from there?

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:29.200
And from there, things like quine, quine's relativized ontology, relativize comes out,

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.200
and they were moving along to a sort of like a little bit of a lazy Susan of ontologies,

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.440
like, you know, pick the ontology one.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.040
Now, Katie made this interesting comment earlier about the difference between, I think, is

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:45.320
what Hider called on tech versus ontological, whether you could argue within science about

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.800
what are the fundamental elements that your field is interested in, which is more of an

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.200
on tech consideration.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.120
What are the things that are relevant to what we're doing?

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.880
And they may not be objects, they may not be physical objects.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.120
And then what is the meta, what is it at the metal level that can we say something about

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.120
that?

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:11.000
Naturalizing metaphysics has had this benefit of holding on to what we know within science

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.760
and seeing what we can do from there, not necessarily to produce some sort of ultimate

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760
foundation.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760
Is that?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.760
And finally, Davidson like Karnaugh had this notion that collaboration between people

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.920
and having everyone debate this, the scientists involved in these various disciplines was

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.960
the way to arrive at some sort of like quote unquote real truth of what's going on, rather

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:40.960
than to be completely nullified.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.720
And does that have or anything else?

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:50.560
I'll just say one thing about my own education experience.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.800
Like I think that has had some very positive effects.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:59.480
So because I think in philosophy of physics, one of the things people do is they think,

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.120
well, actually it's come to be that there's sort of two camps here, the camp that I was

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:09.160
sort of trained in was, yes, you take it to be largely correct, but probably not fully

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.640
understood.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.960
And so the philosophers job is to go and dig deeper and say what really is going on here.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.440
So for example, with non-locality and quantum mechanics, you know, is that really cause

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.000
and effect, stuff like that.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.400
There's another camp of philosophers of physics though, who think, you know, maybe it's not

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:31.360
largely correct, maybe because they're sort of cutting corners, maybe they're not actually

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.040
doing their ontology properly, we should probably try to improve upon what they've done, or

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.040
maybe even try to try to urge them to do it differently.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.920
Obviously, I think that first of the way that I think that's been a very positive influence

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.600
in philosophy, it's given, you know, many people kind of a fun, interesting careers,

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:59.320
doing science that's a little bit more sort of metaphysically oriented.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:04.880
I would say certainly in terms of the influence that it would have on metaphysics, I think

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:11.680
like so much of, so much of the trajectory of contemporary metaphysics could be seen

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:20.600
as a response first to the, you know, you have the skepticism of the sort of like the

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:26.840
positives, the positive, sorry, I can speak, the positivists, the Carnapian era, that kind

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.880
of thing.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:36.560
And then you have Klein where this is sort of rehabilitation of ontology, but like ontology

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:44.120
light, it's not the kind of ontology that likeness was into, this very, very, very sort

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.080
of minimal thing.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:52.200
And then from there, you have this building backup of the field of metaphysics, but in

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.400
this very, especially with David Lewis, right, with this very, very intensely naturalistic

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.400
spirit, right?

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:10.920
So like, can we do metaphysics in this way that is cohesive with the practice of the

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:15.600
natural sciences, or maybe even much more strongly, like, and I don't think this would

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.720
have been what Lewis thought, but what a lot of people think, like in service to the natural

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.200
sciences can be like metaphysics can like trim around the hedges at the places where the,

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.040
you know, the science is going to get a little bit confusing or you need someone to, you

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.680
know, to come in and do some cleanup or say, what exactly does this mean?

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:40.560
Or maybe metaphysics can, I guess, like, so Ted Sider has argued that one thing that metaphysics

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:47.040
can do is just provide like explanatory tools or resources that could be useful in the discussion

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.240
of the natural sciences to try to figure out exactly what we're doing.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:59.520
I think that there is increasingly strands of thought in metaphysics that push back against

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.680
that and say, well, no, that's like, we're doing a lot more than that.

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:10.600
You know, there's a lot that's going on in metaphysics that isn't necessarily related

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.720
to the, you know, the sort of foundational claims or isn't necessarily just in the spirit

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:21.200
of like, like, highly minimalist ontology or things like that that is more just like,

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.760
again, questions about what the world is like, the nature of reality, which might be questions

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.080
about the fundamental, but they might not, but that aren't necessarily going to be addressed

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.680
by empirical means.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.940
And sometimes that might be with an assumption of realism.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:40.160
Sometimes it might be with like more to try to argue for a certain type of deflationism.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.880
But the cool thing about any of these debates is that they all kind of end up being debates

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880
about metaphysics.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:51.120
You know, philosophers like Nelson Goodman who tried to give this like incredibly metaphysics

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:56.200
free view of the world and end up with like one of the craziest metaphysics out there.

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:02.600
So it does end up always being debates about the nature of reality that aren't empirical

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:08.040
one way or another, even if you're trying to argue that, you know, there's no there there.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:22.280
Sorry, I'm sorry about that.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280
I was on mute.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.160
I was a bit of fantastic conversation.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.400
I wonder if people feel it would be a good time to open up questions from our audience

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.480
because we do have some that have accumulated.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.560
Does that sound okay to everybody?

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:34.560
Sure.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.560
Great.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.560
Great.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.240
Thank you for Alex to come in.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:40.240
Okay.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:47.120
Yeah, people, you could write questions in the Q&A in the bottom panel or if you're on

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:53.520
YouTube right in the comments on the live.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.520
So we first have a.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.920
We have wind shorts.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.520
It's sort of referencing was said earlier.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.160
So from elementary zilch particles to persons, what about the other way?

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.200
Given what we are able to do, what we take ourselves to be, does our understanding slash

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.560
claims about the elementary particles allow us to get to us, emergent properties emerging

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.840
from what?

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.920
And then they also add maybe a zilch particle is a person with almost everything left out,

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.680
top down rather than bottom up.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:34.840
So any thoughts to that question?

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.600
That sounds like live minutes to me.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.600
That's right.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.680
I mean, he was a fantastic metaphysician, I think.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.040
I mean, so it's his ideas, live minutes, his ideas sound pretty wild to us today, but

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.960
it's sort of, it's interesting that it takes someone like live minutes and compare them

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.080
to what people or metaphysicians are doing today.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:03.040
Live minutes in certain sense, he was like his age is greatest physicist and then thought

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.160
he just needed to go further.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.480
And so he thought the only way you can really under, the only way you can sort of really

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:16.120
explain all of the stuff you know in physics is by having this additional layer, the monodology.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.360
And therefore, not that I understand that stuff at all, but it certainly does.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:25.520
You know, he ends up having mind and body come together in the fact that the fundamental

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.120
things are these mental things, the monads.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.520
Now, I take it actually, I'm no expert on this, but is that I'm sure someone else here

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:40.720
does is this not somewhat similar to like Chalmers, for example, today, David Chalmers.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.160
It related to something because monads are the kind of atoms of the soul.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:52.320
So they windows into the or rather windows without windows if I can put it that way.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:59.680
But in lightness as opposed to somebody like, let's say, others coming from quantum theory

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:10.520
or even in mathematics, there is such a thing as in in top of theory as things without points,

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:19.320
you know, so the monads that they it monads could be read, not by Leibniz himself, as

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.640
the image of our interaction with the world.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.120
Leibniz of course, made an assumption, which was metaphysical and realist.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.920
You are absolutely right in terms of his problem, but I doubt that we can never get as Greg

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:42.240
suggested earlier from elementary particles to the this as a kind of level.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:52.280
I think in the time of Leibniz, there was a little simpler picture of the layers of reality.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:58.600
I think right now we have this incredibly complex picture of the layers of reality because even

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.200
in fundamental physics, we obviously cannot reconcile quantum field theory and relativity,

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.880
which is a huge problem.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.000
And nobody knows how it's going to happen.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.360
But I do agree with you that bringing up monads is a very, very interesting point that Leibniz

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.880
who was very different from Newton in terms of his calculus and things like that type,

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.560
but his idea of monads is a quite a remarkable idea, which tried to push it obviously beyond

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:34.760
and see how we, there is a metaphysics and that sounds.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:39.960
So Leibniz's metaphysics, as soon as you come to the monodology is of course an idealist

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:46.160
but of course, no of course, no, it's completely the opposite of a physicalist metaphysics,

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.240
which started as a matter of a particle.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.240
And then it comes somehow because the question was about the relationship between persons,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.880
if I got that right, and elementary particles.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:04.440
So we are talking about two different domains here, which are very hard to reconcile.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:05.440
What is that?

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.360
The Shakespeare line says, we'll come and unwilt on thing at once.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.240
It's hard to reconcile.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:15.960
You know, that's really the question is, and do we need to necessarily reconcile it?

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.440
Yeah, that's the question.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:18.440
Yes.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.880
Well, but then we go back to Hans's question about Chalmers, for any way that panpsychism

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:29.440
seems to constantly reemerge in these conversations, right, every so often, we hear more about

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440
it.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:36.760
And I guess Leibniz was one of the most colorful proponents of that sort of approach, right?

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:44.300
Well, I don't think he was panpsychist in that way as some of the people who come from

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.800
Chalmers' problem do not everyone.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:54.400
I think, you know, no, no, Leibniz, I think was more idealist, as Carl just said, that

01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:01.120
it doesn't mean that he projected any form of consciousness on material things.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.040
You know, Berkeley was contemporary of Leibniz.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:09.560
So I think I think it was a somewhat different view from flanpsychism, in my view.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.560
Oh, yeah.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:15.280
I just want to add, when wrote as Hans was talking about Chalmers, they mentioned Nagel.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.600
I think they're referring to Thomas Nagel.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.600
Yeah.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600
Yeah.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
Okay.

01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.600
Well, thank you, Wynn.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.400
So you have a question from a team music on YouTube.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:29.240
He wrote a few things, I'm just going to get to one, just because other people are writing

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.240
in questions.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.640
So they wrote, how do you define consciousness?

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.000
And then which aspects do you focus on when you try to define it?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
And with what?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah, anyway, so.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's a small question.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yeah, keep it to a few words, please.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.120
Simple as possible.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.360
Can we all just think the answer?

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:59.160
David, show or not tell?

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.120
I guess just to add, because I know there was a comment made about neuroscience and I

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:07.720
guess the limitations of metaphysics within how neuroscience is currently applied.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.320
And so having done, I'm currently a research tech within a neuroscience lab.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:20.720
Yeah, the lab I'm generally using more behaviorist techniques to try to deduce depression and

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.920
satiation with regards to anodonia.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:29.760
So I'm not obviously, I'm not like a distinguished panelist here, but it's definitely hard for

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.520
a neuroscience perspective to sort of answer that question given that it's very much

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.400
caromentalized and limited to whatever field that the neuroscience is looking in, in terms

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400
of their research.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:44.720
I also didn't want to belittle that question, it's a perfectly great question actually.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.760
Oh yeah, I just needed just a gigantic one.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.400
If I was to answer honestly, and succinctly, I would say, in terms of like, how do you

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.200
define consciousness, I would say I don't.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.200
Right.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.880
I don't make that attempt.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.160
I think it's also perhaps one of these areas.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.680
There may be quite a few in metaphysically rich areas of philosophy where there might

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.520
not be a single thing that we're talking about here.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.880
There might be multiple overlapping things that we care about that sort of give rise

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:22.680
to this cluster of features that we care about and that are great, you know, phenomenological

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.680
and normative importance to us.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:29.600
So I wouldn't even, I mean, I'm not a philosopher of mine, but I wouldn't even begin to know

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.800
where to start trying to define consciousness.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.000
And sometimes these definitional projects seem like the kind of thing that are doomed

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.120
to failure.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:46.920
So for something as rich as consciousness, yeah, we've got to have no idea.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.520
Yeah, there's certainly no single agreed upon definition of consciousness when you look

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.640
into all these consciousness studies related fields of research.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:04.200
And even if you go back into 1904, there's this very influential paper that William James

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:10.080
published, which at the title does consciousness exist question mark and he even would deny

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:17.080
that consciousness exists in the sense that it has no ontological quality to it.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.760
It's something very superficially would say.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760
1904.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.600
Well, Freud started as a neuroscientist and the originally scientific project of scientific

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:32.840
psychology was a kind of attempt to relate memory to neurons.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:40.880
But of course he gave up because he knew that's not possible.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.480
You're a mute out.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:52.200
Okay, go to the next question.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.600
Thank you, team music.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.760
Constance old on zoom wrote, would it be possible to use a metaphor from another discipline,

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.760
I use word metaphor in another field of study?

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.800
Can you repeat the question?

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.240
Yeah, maybe Constance could rewrite it.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.520
Go to the next one, but they wrote, would it be possible to use a metaphor from another

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:18.680
discipline, for example, use a word metaphor in another field of study?

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.880
I could go on the next one and ask her to write and flesh it out.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.800
I wonder whether whether that refers to the idea that, you know, for us to understand

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:34.080
something, we often borrow metaphor or anyway, analogies from other disciplines.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:40.080
It seems that physics is often the favored one because based on our earlier conversation,

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.520
it's thought to be the foundational science, let's say, and we borrow some ideas from physics

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:52.200
and important to chemistry and biology and computer science and neuroscience, et cetera.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.200
And then the question is it always should always be barred in that direction from what

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.200
used to be considered a lower tier like physics in the upper tier.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:06.040
These are such a things borrowed in the other direction.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:08.200
That's how I, that's the sense I make of the question.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:16.480
I think working with metaphors is very important and also useful, but you have to memorize that

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.600
it's a metaphor because if you don't do that, at the end of the day, you think everything

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.600
is physics.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.600
If you use physical metaphor, that should be avoided.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.640
Well, and of course, physics uses a lot of metaphors.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.000
All of them, it's just the question that I, Harold, is completely right.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.760
You have to keep in mind the level of its application because it could be useful to explain some

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.720
of these things at a certain level, but it has limits, but it's extremely productive

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.640
analogy and metaphor.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.560
And it goes in both directions.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:59.880
I mean, it's quite clear, you know, if you read people like Heisenberg, Bohr, Hermann

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:06.240
Wahl, all these type of people, a very rich metaphoric field from all manner of things,

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:11.920
but it's a level of explanation, which you have to constantly keep in mind the limits

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:17.520
of its application because there's no distemptation to think that metaphor explains it, but it

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.240
nails it, but it doesn't.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:24.320
There's some interesting discussion about this actually with the uses of teleological

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:32.120
metaphors in the naturalistic sciences, so a lot of scientific research or scientific

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.120
papers will avail themselves of Taylor's like strongly, teleological language.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:43.200
So they'll say like, you know, the X wants to fight or it's designed to fight or it's

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.120
like all this kind of stuff.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:49.840
Talking about things as though they're purposive or that they have intention or, and if you

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.280
ask people about this, they will say, Oh, of course, it's just a metaphor.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280
It's just a metaphor.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.640
It's not to be taken seriously.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.720
But then sometimes if you dig down a little bit into the details of the theory, it looks

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:08.960
like actually the teleological explanation is pulling a lot of weight.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:15.000
It's not obvious just how metaphorical the teleological language is because some of the

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.800
explanations that are being offered in the theory are sort of relying on the idea that

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.360
the explanations are counterfactual in some way, they're relying on the idea that there

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:32.240
is this almost sort of explanatory oomph to the idea of teleology that's it's not clear

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.560
how naturalistically supported that is.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.600
So I think it's a good example of a place where sometimes the metaphors that we use,

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.560
we can kind of dismiss them and say, Oh, it's just a metaphor.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.880
We're not taking it seriously, but in the actual practice of giving explanations here,

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:52.040
it's not clear just how seriously people are taking the metaphors, which I think is really

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
interesting.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.880
Well, that's very true because at early stages of quantum theory, the phrase nature makes

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.600
a choice was really very big discussion.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.600
Yeah.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:07.320
It took a lot of time to explain it on the other hand Einstein, of course, as a brilliant

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.760
rhetorician, he was an atheist, but he knew that to say that God played dice makes your

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.360
statement immortal.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:18.640
If you just say nature played dice, nobody will pay attention.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640
Yeah.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.200
Also, you know, it's interesting to go back to this very quick reference to Nagel, which

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.960
I think which is Nagel that he referred to in his discussion about consciousness, what's

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.400
it like to be a bad?

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:37.800
And it's interesting to think how much metaphor is a lot of what consciousness is about in

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.800
some way, right?

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:45.640
Because we, if what it's like to be is sort of asking a metaphor, a question about a metaphor,

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.640
isn't it?

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640
Ultimately.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:59.000
I mean, actually, what Nagel wanted to point out with this is that the experiential quality

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.520
of a mental state is different from the neuroscientific description of a mental state.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.520
Yeah, absolutely.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.280
He was a sort of precursor of what later Dave Chalmers called the hard problem of consciousness

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:18.480
or other people called the explanatory gap between qualitative experience on one side

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:22.440
and brain functioning on the other side.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:28.400
And this was, I mean, Tom Nagel's paper was a very important paper.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:33.080
Historically, because the term consciousness was actually out of discussion.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.040
It was almost like a forbidden term from the beginning of the behaviorist school, like

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.480
Skinner and others, right?

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.120
They didn't talk about consciousness at all.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:49.400
So between the beginning of the 20th century and 1974, I think when Tom Nagel's paper appeared,

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:55.760
consciousness was not it was just like exercise, even from psychology, where it intrinsically

01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:01.240
belongs to action, right?

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:05.200
Constance also commented to consider political science.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:08.760
They referenced justice as an example.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:14.480
Any comments you could add to that given what else has been said about metaphors?

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.720
The topic of justice.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:24.200
Yeah, like with regards to way to discuss with metaphors.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.480
If there's not much you think he could add, I could go on to the next question.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.280
I just thought to mention it because she wrote that as you guys were talking.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:39.080
Okay, I'll go to the next one.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.080
Let's see.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.520
Don't worry, Scott.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.000
I see your comments.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I'll get to you.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.160
There's one question on YouTube before you from Johannes Wecky.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.560
I hope I didn't mingle your last name.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.800
They wrote is physics necessary for metaphysics?

01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.960
Well, in what sense of necessary I'm going to get in some sense, physics is necessary

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.960
for reality.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.880
Well, yeah, they will.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.440
So they wrote is it well, they wrote in the sense of like, can you study it without a

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.920
good understanding of physics?

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.920
But I think there's also that other that other realm that you were sort of referencing that's

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:18.280
also I think quite interesting to discuss.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.720
I mean, I think that the answer to that question has a lot to do with what we discussed earlier

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:27.680
about different methods in metaphysics because I actually do think that my sense is there

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:32.200
is a movement among metaphysicians where they're like, yeah, we really got to know our physics

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.960
because otherwise, you know, we at least need to have a, you know, know enough about the

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.480
things we say latch up to it the right ways.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:44.320
But I take it there's other metaphysicians who think, you know, the part of reality I'm

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.560
focused on, yeah, it's not really physics, so it doesn't really matter that much as I'm

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.360
not, you know, very up to speed and physics.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.120
So I think it kind of depends on the metaphysicians methodological presuppositions.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.880
Yeah, I mean, speaking just as someone who does metaphysics for a living, like I don't

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.160
know very much physics at all.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.880
I could just be bad at my job.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:20.440
So I think it depends exactly as Kansba saying on like any field, there's disputes about

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:26.880
how, you know, the best methodology for practicing in that field.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.160
And so there are definitely people who think, yeah, I know we need to be able to understand

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:38.120
what the science is saying so that we can understand how to make our metaphysical theories not

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:43.880
only consistent with the science, but also know like at what point is it time to hand

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:49.320
over the mic to the meta physician to say like here's where empirical inquiry runs out

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.480
and so the meta physician might have something to say.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:27:00.760
I mean, a lot of the work that I do is on stuff about the nature of social reality, like

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.480
can we make sense?

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.120
What do we mean if we say that something is socially constructed?

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.240
Like is that can we make sense of that claim?

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.640
There's about 10 different things at least that people seem to mean like at the same

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.400
time when they say that.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.200
Are social kinds real?

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:18.600
Are they different from national kinds?

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:24.440
Like for me doing that, I don't necessarily think that knowing a lot of physics would

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.040
be helpful to me for that explanatory reason that we talked about earlier.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:35.200
I need to know a lot more about areas of the social sciences.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.200
And so I think it partly depends on the fun thing about metaphysics is that there's like

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.520
metaphysics of X for most any X.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.600
So partly depends on what kind of metaphysics that you're doing.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.480
It partly also depends on what you think the project of metaphysics is and what the task

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.640
of metaphysics is.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.760
I have an interesting follow up question I propose both to you Elizabeth.

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.320
But all the panelists I want to hear how it has to say about this as well.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:09.520
But when one performs an experiment on let's say in any particular scientific field that

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:19.000
may test different metaphysical views of the world, does that turn the metaphysics into

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.880
physics or neuroscience or social science?

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.720
Like does it move it across the line from what was formerly metaphysical?

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.680
If you're able to extinguish with two different forms of metaphysics one understanding?

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:37.920
Well clearly not necessarily because in some aspects of psychology and sociology you do

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.880
that in a different way.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:47.480
I think it has a lot of historical and ideological baggage this debate because to get what you

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:55.440
talk to Greg's friend Aristotle because the term physics coming from physics and nature

01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:02.880
emerged through modern science like why this type of meaning because in 18th century the

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:07.520
word nature referred as much to human nature.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.840
So I think that what was said about different levels of metaphysics that you could certainly

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:21.440
have a metaphysics in a real sense of explaining nature without physics if you give nature

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:25.280
a broader meaning which nature deserves incidentally.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:35.600
So from that point of view I think the answer is it really has a big historical and cultural

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:43.280
baggage because of the dominance of science even relating to the form the terms of nature

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.640
and understanding nature.

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:51.200
It goes back to as Greg said the reduction is a problem that when I was young so much

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:57.680
younger than today I thought to my physics professor that I have difficulty with chemistry

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.600
and he said of course you have difficulty with that because chemistry does not exist.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:05.120
So it's only it's only physics but it is wrong.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.760
It's not true.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:15.280
So I think that I do agree that the and Harold that it's metaphysics is defined what your

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:23.160
system X is which I mentioned before the metaphysic is the X additional level of the system X

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.560
and your system does have to be physics.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:35.320
It can't be social, ethical, moral or whatever and that's why I think as it was said before

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:42.480
by Professor Halverson I believe that physicists tend to have a kind of agreement in terms of

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:51.520
demarcating the field they do but the metaphysicians have a much more complex stratification of

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.960
what they do as a field.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:59.720
You know they do different things under the name of metaphysics.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:06.600
I wanted to add something to to Gerys question which actually I thought Greg might respond

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:12.600
to because Abner Schimone and I think Greg you were working with Abner Schimone for a

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:20.320
long time he coined the notion of experimental metaphysics which seems to be contradiction

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.840
in terms because experiments are never metaphysical experiments are experiments that provide knowledge

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.320
so they are epistemologically grounded.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:34.520
But I think what Schimone meant to say what they were meant to describe but this idea

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:44.040
is that you can if you have a good theory that comprises something that you would ascribe

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:52.640
to a metaphysical domain and also comprises something how the metaphysical domain might

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:58.200
appear to us when we do an experiment then you can do the following you can test two

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:05.240
different theories which have metaphysical which have different metaphysical presuppositions

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.400
and also have different experimental realizations by doing the experiment and then you can backward

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:19.520
infer by the result of the experiment which was the correct metaphysical assumption within

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.280
that theory right.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:28.080
So this is exactly what happens in in bell type experiments you have two different metaphysical

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:34.200
assumptions we have the assumption of local realism and non-local realism both assumptions

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:40.760
give you different predictions for bell type experiments and then what you find is that

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.960
in the experiments one of the assumptions is violated right.

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:52.400
This is a nice example of this seemingly contradictory notion of experimental metaphysics.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:59.640
Well, so I agree and that really gets down to the question of what is metaphysics like

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.960
so for example of clearly ontologies part of metaphysics.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.120
So if you're a physicist and you say well I'm with Newton I believe that things are corpuscular

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:12.480
or I'm with the other people who believe that there are waves and those are the fundamental

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.320
things and so which is right and then that changes your ontology but that's the extent

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.400
to which that's really metaphysical is suspect.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.440
I mean there is an overlap and that's the interesting place if there is an overlap that you experiment

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:27.760
with if you can't there isn't you're not going to reject an entire deep metaphysics by any

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.240
experiment of course which is the whole point of seeing it as being oxymoronic on the other

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.240
hand that's one of the reasons I'm interested in ontological status of elementary particles

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:41.680
because physicists endlessly speak about elementary particles it's been going for 50 years past

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.600
the time when many people said no they're only quantum fields and I happen to believe

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.840
that they're both and you need to understand the relationship between them but you know

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:53.200
this is this is you know the the schmony thing which makes a lot of sense and I think when

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.640
you find yourself at the certain point in dealing with your physics it's sufficiently

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.720
difficult their novel you're faced with this question of how deeply do I need to go into

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:07.760
the boundary to define my at least my ontology and many of the paradoxes come from bad ontology

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.120
bad ontological assumptions which is you know part of this whole reaction that we don't

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:16.120
want to do any philosophy like it messes up physics well that's you know quite wrong

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.240
right but so yeah that's it very interesting.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.480
I totally agree.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:21.480
Yeah.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.400
This is the truth the physicists are keen to reconcile their own theories with what they

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:31.320
understand or of metaphysicians are keen to reconcile their views with what they see as

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:37.000
current day physics there must be some interplay between them like they're at some point.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.080
So I think that there's there's always going to be interplay but it's not many I I think

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.360
just to follow up on what Greg said like I'm skeptical of the idea that you could just

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:51.800
like wholesale you could have a metaphysical theory and then you would have like an experiment

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.840
that could just tell you that it was wrong or something even just for the simple question

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:01.720
and you know the fact that data always under determines theory choice or because there's

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:09.600
always going to be these added philosophical questions that you have to contend with which

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:16.120
is not at all the say that the empirical stuff is just unrelated.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.000
So I'll give you an example that's not anything to do with physics but again this is more in

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.480
my wheelhouse so like a lot of the work that I have done recently is on the relationship

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:34.760
between disability and well-being and the question of like does having a disability automatically

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:39.920
reduce a person's well-being or their quality of life or can we make sense of claims about

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.440
disability that are made within the disability rights movement that it's like just a way

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.920
of being different but not necessarily being worse off.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.000
Now psychologists are also interested in this claim they're very interested in the question

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.720
of the relationship between disability and well-being and there's a ton of empirical

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.320
data on it and so you might think well isn't that just an empirical claim like you should

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.040
just go and look at the science but of course when you go and look at the science for one

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:09.520
thing the way that they do you know the way that the experiments are structured it's kind

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.120
of like you go and you survey people and you ask them rate your happiness or rate your

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.040
life satisfaction on a scale of one to ten.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:24.680
Now that is really interesting data what it actually tells me about what I as a philosopher

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.480
I'm interested in when I'm thinking about well-being is a very complicated question and there's

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.200
all sorts of things about like comparing different people and there's also different things that

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.240
they might mean by disability and different you know the study populations that they're

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:43.080
looking at so I think it would be a mistake for me as a philosopher interested in disability

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.520
to just pretend like that data doesn't matter.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.680
That data is incredibly interesting and important to me but I also think it would be a mistake

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.320
for me to be like oh this thing that I'm interested in it's just an empirical question because

01:36:56.320 --> 01:37:01.640
psychologists are studying it too I need to look at their data and be like okay what do

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.960
I think any of this means and how if at all does it relate to this philosophical question

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.200
that I'm interested in and might there be ways that I as a philosopher might be critical

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.920
of some other methodology or say I don't think that this shows what you think it shows or

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.360
various things like that.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:23.480
So I think similar things can often be said about the relationship between a philosophical

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:30.960
and great and an empirical inquiry I'm sure Hans has thoughts on this.

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.200
I mean I think this all I mean I'm actually sort of coming up with new thoughts as we go

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.720
because it was very interesting inputs I was also really grateful to hear Greg's reflection

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.000
I mean I've got a great abner's a great hero in philosophy of physics and he's also a great

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.800
hero for really trying to I mean in one way reviving the philosophical spirit in physics

01:37:53.800 --> 01:38:00.560
sort of you know physics is exciting because physics tells us stuff about what metaphysicians

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.400
have been asking about for ages.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:11.560
So the one thing I'll just say is like I mean this is just sort of off the cuff a little

01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:17.760
bit I don't know where the line is between empirical science and metaphysics or even

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.040
just philosophy in general in some sense it often has to do I'm this is going to be an

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:28.280
oversimplification but often I think has to do with the normative right so that the you

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.200
know what should be the case.

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:35.160
And I think they can come up in a lot of different ways one is this the simple way of language

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:40.480
engineering in other words like we have choices about how to use words and the thing is though

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.760
in science often I think that's kind of forgotten right because you have these sort of you know

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.160
the terms are fixed you know you ask a person you make a survey you say how do you feel

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.560
you know is your pain level you know 10 or whatever but we don't say like what should

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:59.440
we mean by you know the term well being or things going well stuff like that so I think

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:05.040
that's something we're philosophers we have a bit more of a degree of freedom to say maybe

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.760
we should change the way we're talking about this.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.720
And then also I think we're always sort of looking over our shoulders and thinking in

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:16.080
philosophical inquiries like and so so I you know Elizabeth brought out the keyword that

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.120
you know in flop we always say what does it mean and the thing is I think that often is

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:26.120
like what should I do about it right so it's like it's not just the data sitting there

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.760
it's like so I wake up tomorrow what shall I do in the light of this fact so and that's

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:37.600
true an experiment can't tell you what to do right I mean experiment you get okay that's

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:42.080
the result of the experiment you can hold on to the old worldview if you want to you

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.560
know that's again the theory under theories under determined by data so I think it's a

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.440
super interesting question you know but it's man I this is maybe one of the things again

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:56.360
where you just say maybe we shouldn't try to give a shark you know this is where the

01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:03.600
science stopped and this is where the the metaphysics begins although I think it's also

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:10.040
bad to sort of like look there there's of course territorial battles sadly in current

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.320
culture the humanities whatever counts as humanity's usually lose right so in other words

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.840
like people think all just science you know all you do is the science and the rest of

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:23.640
that stuff is like you know somebody somebody has to you know sit in those chairs that exist

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:29.680
in the humanities buildings but in my sense is really good to remind to remind people that

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:35.400
the experiments there's a lot more to discuss after the results come in.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:40.960
Great you want to move on to the next question?

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:45.080
Yeah so how many more are you feeling because I have four from people I haven't asked so

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:48.040
how are we feeling about?

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:49.480
We feel four is that okay or?

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.240
I think four might do it let's see how we feel.

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.360
Okay yeah so it's going to be Scott then Walter then you know just so people know because

01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:03.520
I saw Walter was posting a few times just to make sure he knows I got him anyway so Scott

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:10.240
thank you Scott for writing a question it's kind of a run on so I'll try to fix it up

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.240
he could lamb basme later he's my friends so if I get it wrong he could critique me later

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:21.080
but I'll try my best so he wrote is there any middle ground between the idea that science

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:26.080
and mathematics are our human interpretation of the world and that there is only the human

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.600
perspective on the world and there's no view from nowhere and then as an aside I think

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.480
because that's sort of a question in terms of I guess idea an idealized world but he seems

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.200
to then suggest that in terms of how it's actually done there seems to be only a human

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:45.960
world the world and a scientific realism that seems to be the default attitude for most

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.920
Americans in the 21st century that science and mathematics are the fundamental structure

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:56.920
reality and our study of these fields therefore allows access to such structure.

01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.360
Well this is a little bit what Hans brought up was bringing out raising earlier as a concern

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:10.720
right this idea what has been unleashed when we think of scientific study as being a social

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.680
construct right.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.400
Well it doesn't seem to be a question about so much social construct that's an additional

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:28.160
level of that discussion because you could use the view that we only have human interaction

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:34.580
with the world through mathematics and technology and the social dimension was as additional

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:41.920
question in all these debates in the so-called social studies of science few years back and

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.920
social constructivism that was involved to what degree you know there is a symmetry between

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.600
social sciences and natural sciences from that point of view and there is much more complex

01:42:53.600 --> 01:43:02.640
view on this point now but I am all this little bit uneasy with people looking for a third

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:11.600
way or way sort of in between because it seems to me that one could perfectly do well science

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:18.160
under the assumption which as I said people like Niels Bohr and that it is about our

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:25.920
interaction with the world through the experiment the technology etc rather than making the

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:33.440
claims concerning making such a claim that the nature even in the physics level is described

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:38.280
by mathematical equations and things of that type of window I do know that many people

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:48.280
do believe in that but I would call this unfalsifiable metaphysical assumption because you know look

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:55.400
von Neumann made similar type of thing he believed that quantum mechanics described the

01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:03.040
independent behavior of the and only experiment and their fears was that and brings in probability

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:10.600
etc but I think it's an unfalsifiable ontology the only thing we can falsify is what we see

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:18.040
the experiment and how well our theories predict that but I don't think we can the advantage

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:26.400
of seeing the world in terms of interaction in scientific theory and technology is falsifiability

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:32.280
you know for me even the theory of relativity even the most people believe that it but not

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:40.920
all there are philosophers of science who I think push or don't believe that general relativity

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.560
actually describes it's an idealization which enables us to predict very important effects

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.720
right I think this position allows us to do science and it is you can say it is a form

01:44:53.720 --> 01:45:01.560
of metaphysics because it makes an unfalsifiable ontological assumption about the fact that we

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:08.000
cannot describe or represent the universe but it's different from making assumption that

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.440
we can because there is a symmetry in them because that assumption is non falsifiable

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:20.240
there is no way in my view to falsify the assumption that the nature is described by

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:25.560
any mathematical equations apart from our existence on the other hand I can perfectly

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:33.320
well falsify theory such as quantum mechanics classical physics which can predict experiments

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.680
some of which has a kind of metaphysical flavor not only Bell theorem rightly brought up by

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:45.280
Harold but even the double slit experiment initially Schrodinger and Heisenberg's views

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:54.040
of quantum mechanics were very different metaphysically so it's all so in any event I don't think

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:59.640
I understand the temptation of the third way or the temptation of scientific realism but

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:05.200
I don't think they're necessary and it's not made a matter of welcome razor it's a totally

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:13.280
different question why one take one position or another on that I cannot explain why I

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:19.680
take this interactive position versus scientific realism I don't know that I think it's very

01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:27.280
difficult to explain maybe Elizabeth can explain that because she deals in her domain you deal

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:33.120
precisely with discretion they are psychological historical philosophical they're not mathematical

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:39.960
there is no explanation why I believe in that type of position I can offer some but I could

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:48.320
be a scientific realist but I'm not okay thank you Scott fish fine you didn't do it

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:55.040
yeah he said he's on the train so I'll relay him later if he missed out he told me later

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.760
if I didn't mess up how he wanted that asked so thank you Scott so next we have three more

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:06.720
so this is from Walter K. Lou thank you Walter they wrote I'm gonna use the latest when he

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:12.720
wrote which he wrote as meta linguistic and meta perceptual activities respectively to

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:18.040
what extent are poetry and cinema both physics and metaphysics in the senses discussed today

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:34.440
that's an interesting one well I mean it right they partake of metaphysical subject matter

01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.640
right or their subjects might encourage a metaphysical reflection is that a fair way

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:48.120
to frame it out everybody also like what comes straight to mind is a lot of movies both very

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:56.280
popular and even I guess more was seen as high art are using the multiverse concept in their

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.440
storytelling now right like everything everywhere all at once the recent movie I was mentioning

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:06.160
to you earlier yeah yeah and then another one I was thinking so obviously it's being used

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.760
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the more pop culture reference and then another one

01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:15.800
I thought of as you guys are talking was it was a short series by the guy Alex Garland

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:22.200
on Hulu called devs which was about sort of Silicon Valley company making a computer that

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:33.480
sort of predicted sort of predicted how you just I guess some examples that come off the

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:39.760
top my head with the flesh out the cinema aspect of that question yeah so I think actually

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:46.080
one really interesting way and maybe where these places can interact is that maybe especially

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:52.400
speculative fiction to pick up on that can give really really interesting thought experiments

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:58.800
for thinking about metaphysical theories that is good sort of this is again one way in which

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:05.120
I think you can think about the way that metaphysical inquiry goes beyond pure empirical inquiry

01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.840
because you're thinking about situations that you know by their nature don't exist but nevertheless

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.840
might tell you something interesting about the nature of reality if they give problems

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:23.280
for your theory so you know very often when we're talking about the metaphysics of persons

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:27.400
for example somebody's going to mention something that happened in Star Trek the next generation

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:32.360
because here's a thing that happened when there are two rikers after they go through

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:37.320
the transporters and what like which one is the real riker and I think I don't just

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:43.080
think that that is people goofing off I think it's that like interesting questions about

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:51.080
how we think about ourselves can be raised by purely fictional scenarios that allow us

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.720
to sort of like filter out the noise of the everyday world a little bit and just think

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.040
about like well what is the nature what do we care about when we care about personhood

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:03.960
what do we care about when we care about survival there are also really interesting questions

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.640
just about like you know what is the nature of fictional representation like how is it

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.120
both like true that Frodo took the ring to Mount Doom and also true that Frodo doesn't

01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:17.280
exist because there's no such thing as Hobbits and things like that so like well these are

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:20.960
the kind of puzzles that philosophers worry about so there definitely is like interesting

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:21.960
overlap.

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:27.960
Great stuff. Alright when I move on I think we want to get through these last two if possible.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:33.160
Yeah yeah so it's just Ruth and Ena so Ruth wrote a comment a question the comments I

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.360
think pretty funny was not a question it was I like the point that those claim to shed

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.680
the metaphysics often have the wildest implicit metaphysics I just like to add also that when

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:47.560
I heard that I generally think of Neil deGrasse Tyson because I think it's a fortune a lot

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.440
of science communicators I'm kind of resort to those viewpoints I think like him also Lawrence

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:56.720
Krauss I think he's been kind of discredited due to me too but then also Sam Harris a little

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:02.280
bit when he talks about philosophy I kind of tune out because it's not it's not great

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:08.800
anyway to their question they wrote why would metaphysicians need to know physics rather

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:14.720
than chemistry I think as a comment made to the previous question without already assuming

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.840
that chemistry reduces the physics which is a hefty assumption.

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:31.360
Any quick answers to that I it doesn't turn to know chemistry and physics you're muted

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.800
arcadey you're you're immune but you can stratify it you can have metaphysics of chemistry as

01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:45.920
you know it's true that the philosophy of chemistry was a very marginal aspect of the history of

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:51.840
philosophy of science but actually it is an extremely interesting or even history and philosophy of

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.960
chemistry so you can certainly have a metaphysics of chemistry and or you can have I do think that

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:07.120
if you take the emergence view you would you would qualify that any claims you make and

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:14.720
concerning the metaphysics in terms of fundamental physics could have limit in other domains so I

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:21.040
think you have two approaches there and that from that point of view just like you can have

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:28.240
metaphysics of biology or the unconsciousness or whatever you know or sociological things I think

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:35.360
you can perfectly well have metaphysics of chemistry or philosophy of chemistry without assuming that

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:42.560
it is reducible to physics even though at some level you can make this assumption it just practically

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:50.240
is not true because a lot of chemical phenomena cannot be explained by in terms of physics in

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:57.440
very practical terms and it has its own history and its own scientific thinking which is very

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:03.280
long going all the back to alchemy and things of that time. Just to pick up on the bit from

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:09.360
risk question I just think was really interesting this this idea of metaphysical inquiry is kind of

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:13.440
inevitable like you just always end up doing it is like even just the very question of whether

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:19.440
metaphysicians need to know metaphysics sorry they do need to know metaphysics whether metaphysicians

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.400
need to know physics is itself this really substantial metaphysical question like you just

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:29.920
the annoying thing about this these questions but also kind of the cool thing about them is that

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:37.280
like you you just run into them constantly you can't get away from them. Okay I would also

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:41.920
just like to add I've heard sort of the the same thing talked about physics from mathematicians where

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.200
they say oh physics isn't real math is right because usually they nitpick the fact that in physics

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:51.440
you make a lot of assumptions while you shut the pill from the ground up and math so it's the

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:59.120
cycle continues I guess they say and then I guess last but not least so I have to find it on okay

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:04.320
Enoch, Aldina thank you Enoch they wrote in what is the role of language in metaphysics?

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:12.080
Another small question yeah very the beginning there was such an important yeah it's important

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.240
right anyone want to take a shot at that?

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:26.080
Well I maybe we can reference some we made a number of references to sort of the

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.520
tradition of analytic philosophy which is all about that question

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.200
but by the way I made a reference earlier to Karnaugh and Davidson as people who are

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.000
seeking consensus within the discipline I meant Richard Vordi not Donald Davidson

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.960
what I meant in that comment about different how different fields can you rely on sort of

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:52.720
democratic process among your participants to settle on what the truth might be or anyway

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:59.920
what they're striving for the truth but I'm sorry I just didn't object because Walter I think

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:05.120
wanted more of the emphasis in poetry and cinema as inherently inquiries into language and perception

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.760
in and of themselves so I think I could kind of add to it to what Enoch was asking and also to

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:13.280
maybe better answer what Walter wrote previously sorry

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:22.560
so anyone else want to say something about linguistics and it's a big topic

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:28.880
Wittgenstein in the end of Treg Thetas my language is my world you know so I think it's

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:34.400
irreducible because there is no language result thought and there is no thought result language

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:40.480
so the language plays a huge role and actually in the history of quantum mechanics there are

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:46.560
people including Reisenberg who reflect that as well as more on the necessity or even common

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:53.120
language that you cannot avoid it you know so I think that that's the but it will be used different

01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:00.640
I'd love to I love the I mentioned of Wittgenstein this context because we've mentioned how so many

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.720
people so many thinkers have said they want to do without metaphysics and then develop their own

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:12.560
terrible metaphysics or rely on it anyway I think Wittgenstein is a wonderful and elegant

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:19.840
example of someone who tried his darndest to sort of get rid of metaphysics or any way to be

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.920
an anti-metaphysician and yet he's created industry of metaphysics so I which is a lot more elegant

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:32.160
and sophisticated than some of the other folks we've touched on um anyway I want to thank everyone

01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.680
I think you've had an incredibly stimulating conversation and I'm not surprised to find that

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:44.000
I'd love for it to continue on further I want to thank you all for participating and I hope you

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.240
all will consider coming back in the future for other PLX talks to be determined we're going to

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:55.200
be starting up again as I said in the fall and we will be sending out announcements to all of our

01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:00.080
audience members about when that will take place almost certainly sometime in September

01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:08.000
anyway thank you all again that was been wonderful thank you Mr. Dope thank you thank you everybody bye bye

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:21.040
it's unmeasable if you say that so how how do we get out of here

01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:32.320
you just I'm worried about that but let's talk about it yeah so well yeah at least they they they

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:53.280
attract people

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.880
you
