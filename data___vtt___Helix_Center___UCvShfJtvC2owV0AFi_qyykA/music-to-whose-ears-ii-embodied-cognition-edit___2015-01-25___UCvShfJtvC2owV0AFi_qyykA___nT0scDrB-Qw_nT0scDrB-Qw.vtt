00:46.440 --> 00:54.800
Then on Saturday, February 21st, particle fever, the quest, it will be both a morning and afternoon

00:54.800 --> 01:01.960
program will be screening the film particle fever, Mark Levinson's award-winning 2013

01:01.960 --> 01:07.040
documentary for which Helix Center Executive Committee member, Carla Solomon, was a producer.

01:07.040 --> 01:12.600
It tells the remarkable story of the monumental search for the Higgs Boson, the elementary

01:12.600 --> 01:17.840
force particle that was predicted by the standard model of particle physics.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.080
Following the morning screening in its entirety, we will have at least one roundtable.

01:24.080 --> 01:30.040
We're working on the possibility of two, but among the participants, producers Carla

01:30.040 --> 01:34.520
Solomon and Andrea Miller will be joined by Alberto Mangro.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.840

02:05.800 --> 02:08.600
Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.800
And then Saturday, March 14th, we'll have a program on curiosity at which Alberto Mangro

02:13.800 --> 02:15.720
will again distinguish our roundtable.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.520
So watch for further announcements about those.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.080
Now on to today's program.

02:21.080 --> 02:26.880
One of our participants is coming from upstate and head to dig out of the snowfall, so he'll

02:26.880 --> 02:30.240
be joining us shortly, we understand.

02:30.240 --> 02:36.120
But as I say your name, if you can raise your hand, so the audience members recognize

02:36.120 --> 02:37.120
you.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.440
Now Armani, Armani is a master ethnic percussionist, multi-instrumentalist and composer currently

02:43.440 --> 02:45.160

02:55.000 --> 02:56.880
and educator.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.240
Beyond his early classical training, Nacho has studied traditional rhythms from around

03:00.240 --> 03:03.800
the world specializing in North African and Flamenco rhythms.

03:03.800 --> 03:09.960
He has a degree in pedagogy and philosophy from the Universidad completence de Montreud.

the New York Open Center's Sound and Music Institute.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.200
He's developed drawing programs from incarcerated women and juveniles, rhythm and tempo based

03:22.200 --> 03:26.880
groups for children with pervasive developmental disorders, as well as adapted live percussive

03:26.880 --> 03:30.240
sound for clinical use in pediatric therapeutics.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.040
His innovative technique of elemental sounds and rhythms is based on natural patterns of

03:34.040 --> 03:37.640
growth that promote brain function and body alignment.

03:37.640 --> 03:43.160
His critically acclaimed first album, Silence Light, in 2007 with the Nacho Armani World

03:43.160 --> 03:47.680
Flamenco Sex Tet was counted one of the ten top jazz albums of the year by All About

03:47.680 --> 03:49.080
Jazz.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.920
He's performed and recorded with Lionel Luke, if I'm saying his name correctly, Liz Wright

He's the president of the Electric Rocket Propulsion Society and also director of Princeton's 3D

04:35.200 --> 04:38.200
audio and applied acoustic slab.

04:38.200 --> 04:45.080
The profile of Edgar by Adam Gopnik appeared in the January 28, 2013 New Yorker, music

04:45.080 --> 04:49.520
to your ears, the quest for 3D recording and other mysteries of sound, in which he was

04:49.520 --> 04:54.960
described as quote, a distinctly modern type engineer, a steed, unquote.

04:54.960 --> 05:00.920
Vijay Iyer, a Grammy nominated composer pianist who was described by Pitchfork as quote, one

05:00.920 --> 05:06.240
of the most interesting and vital young pianists in jazz today, by the Los Angeles Weekly as

05:06.240 --> 05:10.840
a boundless and deeply important young star and by Minnesota public radio as an American

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
treasure.

05:11.840 --> 05:17.440
He was recently named Downbeat Magazine's 2014 pianist of the year, a 2013 MacArthur

05:17.440 --> 05:21.320
Fellow and a 2012 Dara Stuke performing artist.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.680
The New York Times observes there's probably no frame wide enough to encompass the creative

05:24.680 --> 05:27.240
output of the pianist Vijay Iyer.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.960
He's released 20 recordings, most recently for the ECM label.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.560
These latest include mutations featuring his compositions for piano, string, quartet and

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
electronics.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.920
Rade, Rade, am I saying that correctly?

05:38.920 --> 05:40.920
Rade, Rade.

05:40.920 --> 05:47.880
Rights of Holly, a silent film by Prashant Bhargava with his score performed by International

05:47.880 --> 05:53.360
Contemporary Ensemble and the forthcoming break stuff featuring the Vijay Iyer trio held

05:53.360 --> 05:57.520
by pop matters as quote, the best band in jazz.

05:57.520 --> 06:03.480
In 1999, Vijay received an interdisciplinary PhD in the cognitive science of music from

06:03.480 --> 06:05.680
the University of California, Berkeley.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.520
His dissertation, subsequent research and creative work are focused on embodied music

06:09.520 --> 06:10.520
cognition.

06:10.520 --> 06:14.480
He's published articles in numerous journals and anthologies and in the forthcoming Oxford

06:14.480 --> 06:17.360

06:17.360 --> 06:21.320
He is the Franklin D. and Florence Rosenblatt Professor of the Arts in the Department of

06:21.320 --> 06:23.920
Music at Harvard University.

06:23.920 --> 06:29.440
Vijay Iyer's trio's new album, Break Stuff, is out February 10th.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.120
Marina Carcicova-Cran is a professional pianist and scholar in music cognition.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.040
Her research is focused on emotional responses to music and on the perception of melodic

06:39.040 --> 06:40.960
transformation.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.000
Currently Marina teaches music cognition at Turo College and she performs regularly as

06:45.000 --> 06:50.080
a member of Union City Chamber Players and is the author of books and scientific papers

06:50.080 --> 06:56.440
her latest book being Music as Magical Journey, the story of tonal gravity melodic objects

06:56.440 --> 07:01.960
and motion in tonal space which makes a friendly introduction to the science of music.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.040
Tristan Parrish who is on his way is a composer and sound artist whose work is inspired by

07:07.040 --> 07:10.280
the aesthetic simplicity of math, physics and code.

07:10.280 --> 07:16.040
Wire magazine described his compositions as an austere meeting of electronic and organic.

07:16.040 --> 07:21.680
One bit music, his 2004 release was the first album ever released as a microchip programmed

07:21.680 --> 07:24.800
to synthesize his electronic composition live.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.220
His latest circuit album, One Bit Symphony, has received critical acclaim, New York press

07:29.220 --> 07:34.520
calling it sublime and the Wall Street Journal saying its oscillations have an intense hypnotic

07:34.520 --> 07:37.840
force and a surprising emotional depth.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.800
His award-winning work coupling One Bit Electronics with traditional forms in both music such as

07:42.800 --> 07:49.040
his work active field and observations and visual art in his machine drawings and micro

07:49.040 --> 07:54.320
tonal wall has been presented around the world from sonar and arse electronica to the Museum

07:54.320 --> 07:56.840
of Modern Art and Bit Forms galleries.

07:56.840 --> 08:12.000
Without further ado, our panel.

08:12.000 --> 08:26.000
Well I'll ask what sounds like a stupid question but I would be interested to hear what my

08:26.000 --> 08:37.520
fellow panelists would say if I asked what is music because I don't really know if there

08:37.520 --> 08:39.960
is a stable definition of it.

08:39.960 --> 08:47.320
There is no, this is the most amazing art and for me, and a professional musician and

08:47.320 --> 08:52.560
scholar and music technician, music is a sorcery.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.360
It's a magical thing.

08:54.360 --> 09:00.120
We can learn about the foundations of music, about the elements of music, the sources of

09:00.120 --> 09:08.080
music but why music affects us so deeply and what ways music is able to deliver not just

09:08.080 --> 09:14.320
emotions and they are not basic emotions, they are complex emotions and even general

09:14.320 --> 09:15.320
ideas.

09:15.320 --> 09:20.720
This is still, it's a magic.

09:20.720 --> 09:26.560
And the most amazing thing about music is its accessibility.

09:26.560 --> 09:32.000
Everybody understands what music is and music is able to reach everybody.

09:32.000 --> 09:40.560
It's a truly universal language that has no barriers, it affects everybody.

09:40.560 --> 09:46.280
People with no music education, people with no musical training, people with different

09:46.280 --> 09:56.480
cultures are able to understand the heart of music even when they listen to exotic music.

09:56.480 --> 10:03.440
My own research shows that people with no musical training, not only feel with great

10:03.440 --> 10:09.800
precision, the most important elements of music but they also are able to recognize

10:09.800 --> 10:17.000
musical styles as a technology for music, musicologists.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
If I was asked to give a definition about this music, kind of a very dry definition,

10:26.000 --> 10:33.760
I would say music is a distribution of perceived tonal tension along the era of time, artful

10:33.760 --> 10:34.760
distribution.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.280
You said perceived tonal tension.

10:39.280 --> 10:46.920
Yes, because perceived tonal tension, it's the main morphological principle of music and

10:46.920 --> 10:55.880
it's so primitive that it's exactly this primitive nature of music communication that

10:55.880 --> 11:02.600
makes music available for everybody.

11:02.600 --> 11:11.320
And we feel tonal tension on the level of muscle responses.

11:11.320 --> 11:17.400
With their visceral responses, their subconscious, their intuitive responses, we don't need to

11:17.400 --> 11:22.200
be trained, we just need to be born into human society and have normal hearing.

11:22.200 --> 11:28.840
We don't need special training to understand the language of music and the foundations

11:28.840 --> 11:37.760
of melodic elements of music that in the physics of sound, this is another important thing

11:37.760 --> 11:42.560
that we are dealing with just direct context section, intersection of the physics of sound

11:42.560 --> 11:43.560
and human neurobiology.

11:43.560 --> 11:49.200
And of course it's a cultural construct available only to people.

11:49.200 --> 11:56.640
Just to fill you, we started with UJ's question, what is music?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.640
Sorry, I'm...

11:58.640 --> 12:01.640
You're not ready.

12:01.640 --> 12:07.320
Hi, everybody.

12:07.320 --> 12:12.080
Are we kind of all offering our answers?

12:12.080 --> 12:20.200
Gosh, well, I'll give you a shot.

12:20.200 --> 12:25.600
I mean, I guess if we take for granted the perception of pitch, then we're talking about

12:25.600 --> 12:30.840
higher level things, like the organization of sound over time and rhythm and these things

12:30.840 --> 12:37.360
that probably we all respond to in a variety of different ways, I think that our perception

12:37.360 --> 12:41.440
of music comes from a lot of different interacting things.

12:41.440 --> 12:48.680
So more social, some are physical, some are more cognitive, I'm sure, and some are just

12:48.680 --> 12:50.480
purely aesthetic, whatever.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.280
Maybe that's something...

12:53.280 --> 12:57.120
That's what I took from the last part of what you're talking about, but I might be misinterpreting

12:57.120 --> 12:59.600
it.

12:59.600 --> 13:06.600
But one of the ways that, at least I interact with music a lot and where the music that

13:06.600 --> 13:12.720
I write comes from is finding this intersection between simple patterns, things that we can

13:12.720 --> 13:20.720
understand on a very basic cognitive level.

13:20.720 --> 13:25.640
Things like repeating structures, simple rhythms, simple melodies that build up into

13:25.640 --> 13:30.880
forms that are more complex than those parts, but nonetheless based on these very simple

13:30.880 --> 13:33.000
ideas that we can understand.

13:33.000 --> 13:44.280
And part of that for me is that that is taps into the part of our experience of the world

13:44.280 --> 13:49.400
where we are attracted to things that we can understand.

13:49.400 --> 13:56.840
And so an example of that is if you learn about biology, then you can understand how

13:56.840 --> 14:01.640
the animal form can grow from some simple biological rules, or if you understand physics,

14:01.640 --> 14:13.160
and you can understand the sort of more basic ways of building blocks of nature form complex

14:13.160 --> 14:14.160
things.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.480
And we find beauty in that simplicity.

14:16.480 --> 14:22.480
I think we can connect on a sort of profound way, and clearly I'm just jumping in because

14:22.480 --> 14:28.640
I just ran up from the car, but I think we can connect to these things that we can understand

14:28.640 --> 14:33.600
in a different way than just something that's more aesthetic or more resonant.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.480
I think that when we can understand something, when it gives us something to latch onto,

14:38.480 --> 14:41.960
then we can find some sort of beauty in that.

14:41.960 --> 14:47.000
And that is true in a lot of different art forms and how we see nature, but also true

14:47.000 --> 14:50.320
in the perception of music, I think.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.120
I think I just brought up too many different points there.

14:54.120 --> 15:01.400
Well, for me, I see and I understand music like a multi-dimensional experience.

15:01.400 --> 15:08.240
For me, music is an experience, which is really, really hard to record.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.320
We do that, right?

15:09.320 --> 15:17.160
But we know, unless we developed three-dimensional immersive sound, that music engages so many

15:17.160 --> 15:21.440
different levels of the human being.

15:21.440 --> 15:28.200
And the most important thing, as I'm saying, is an experience, really hard to reproduce

15:28.200 --> 15:30.120
again.

15:30.120 --> 15:34.320
Engaging different parts of the brain, different parts of the body with resonance, the brain

15:34.320 --> 15:39.720
with entrainment, just these two simple basic principles of music, like resonance, like vibration,

15:39.720 --> 15:45.920
the reason really engaging the body in every cell of the body, and entrainment engaging

15:45.920 --> 15:48.520
the brain, right?

15:48.520 --> 15:51.560
So these two elements, for me, are the most important thing.

15:51.560 --> 15:57.760
It would talk about more like principles of sound, resonance, and entrainment.

15:57.760 --> 16:04.880
But for me, above all, music is a tool for transformation.

16:04.880 --> 16:11.240
A tool is pure technology that has been used for thousands of years in different communities

16:11.240 --> 16:18.440
of the world as service to the community for challenges, for really, really go through

16:18.440 --> 16:19.640
daily life.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.640
Why?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.640
Because all these principles, right?

16:22.640 --> 16:28.680
But music has been in cultures through the very first thing.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.880
Sound, basic, before music, is what I want to talk about.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.920
It's the source of life.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.000
Sounds promote movement.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.680
Sounds really create vibration, and we are vibration.

16:40.680 --> 16:46.120
We were discussing in Atlanta, it's like our favorite relationship with the world when

16:46.120 --> 16:49.160
we were nine months in the womb of the mother.

16:49.160 --> 16:54.240
Our relationship with the world is through sound, is through vibration.

16:54.240 --> 16:59.360
So that's how we codify emotions, that's how we codify language and information.

16:59.360 --> 17:03.280
And it's really interesting because if you pay attention when we were in the womb, our

17:03.280 --> 17:05.840
ears are plucked.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.680
So how we perceive sound?

17:08.680 --> 17:12.320
We perceive sound through vibration, through bone conduction sound.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.920
And then I'm going to do a little experiment with you.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.920
Can I do it?

17:16.920 --> 17:17.920
Sure.

17:17.920 --> 17:24.040
So does anybody, can I hear this?

17:24.040 --> 17:27.040
Can you listen?

17:27.040 --> 17:29.800
Can I do something with you?

17:29.800 --> 17:33.040
Do you mind if I put this on your head?

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
It's all right?

17:35.040 --> 17:36.040
You sure?

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
Okay.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.400
So let's do this.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.480
Now anybody can hear this?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.680
All right.

17:43.680 --> 17:50.160
Can you give us the tone?

17:50.160 --> 17:58.960
How is it possible?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.640
Because sound moves through our bones.

18:01.640 --> 18:07.600
Through vibration sound and through our bones connects directly to our inner ear, which

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
is you know what?

18:08.600 --> 18:13.520
The cochlea is one of the first, first, first things that is developed in uterus.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.640
To get information through life through sound.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.880
So this is, we are vibrational beings.

18:20.880 --> 18:25.520
And through vibration we codify life.

18:25.520 --> 18:33.360
So just to remark these principles, but remind us, remind also this cultural effect of sound

18:33.360 --> 18:35.240
for communities.

18:35.240 --> 18:42.320
How sound and rhythm has been always there as a tool for the communities to transform

18:42.320 --> 18:43.760
and go through their life processes.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.920
That's why I understand music.

18:45.920 --> 18:56.200
I should confess that I don't have a faintest idea what music is on a fundamental level.

18:56.200 --> 19:03.400
And I have even a problem drawing a line between perception of sound, which is you

19:03.400 --> 19:09.040
were describing almost primordial activity and music itself.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.880
And that line seems to me very culturally conditioned.

19:12.880 --> 19:18.280
What is a simple tone for you could be music with somebody else?

19:18.280 --> 19:23.080
What is a core tone singer in Arabia could make somebody one out of the room, could charm

19:23.080 --> 19:24.280
somebody else?

19:24.280 --> 19:33.120
So these are all, I find the line shifts so much that from a scientific level, I can

19:33.120 --> 19:40.600
give a definition which is almost banal that music is sound that gives someone pleasure,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.160
to some extent, who moves you.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.960
And that's really not very prevalent, doesn't tell you much.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.800
But only then I can have a definition.

19:48.800 --> 19:54.520
Anything beyond that is so culturally conditioned, so complex, so beautiful and so powerful.

19:54.520 --> 20:00.680
And that it kind of evades pinpointing as a definition.

20:00.680 --> 20:08.600
And particularly enchanted or terribly interested in how humans interact with the spatial aspect

20:08.600 --> 20:10.800
of the sound.

20:10.800 --> 20:16.320
And it's interesting because we experience sound on a daily basis, not just as pitch,

20:16.320 --> 20:21.520
rhythm, melody, extent in time, repetition, and so on, timbre.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.840
We experience it as localized in space somewhere or moving in space somewhere.

20:26.840 --> 20:33.280
Yet it doesn't, in music, because we have limitation in performance, we cannot make

20:33.280 --> 20:35.560
violin fly around the room.

20:35.560 --> 20:42.680
So it seems to be a limited extent to which spatialization has been used in composition.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.840
To give you an example of what I think, why I think spatial aspect is terribly important

20:47.840 --> 20:53.120
in music and one component that now with technology can be for the first time really used as part

20:53.120 --> 20:55.640
of the palette of the musician.

20:55.640 --> 21:03.240
Imagine waking up in the morning nicely to the sound of a bird song right outside your

21:03.240 --> 21:04.880
window.

21:04.880 --> 21:12.160
Very nicely we all love bird songs and composers wrote great music based on bird songs.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.480
So that's one day.

21:13.480 --> 21:22.040
Now imagine the same exact experience, the same bird, the same melody, and the same

21:22.040 --> 21:27.520
melody wake up that you go through except this time the bird is inside the room with

21:27.520 --> 21:29.520
you.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.840
And it would be very unnerving because first your mind tells you from the river, from the

21:34.840 --> 21:39.520
acoustics of the room, you know right away your brain knows that way there's a bird trapped

21:39.520 --> 21:41.000
in the room.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
So there's an anxiety being trapped with a wild animal is not something, even a bird

21:47.000 --> 21:48.320
can be threatening.

21:48.320 --> 21:55.560
So on one day the experience is that of musical experience that's blunning, that's very comforting.

21:55.560 --> 22:03.360
On the next day with that bird trapped in the room the spatial aspect of the sound which

22:03.360 --> 22:08.480
is the only thing that has changed can be terrifying, can create anxiety, you have a

22:08.480 --> 22:09.800
bird trap in your room.

22:09.800 --> 22:19.040
So I'm very interested in how the spatial aspect of the sound can tremendously color

22:19.040 --> 22:22.680
your connection or your experience of the musicality of the sound.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.640
And I'm very interested, I'm not a musician, I'm a scientist, I study the interaction

22:27.640 --> 22:33.440
of humans with how humans perceive sound, especially how humans perceive the localization

22:33.440 --> 22:34.440
of sound.

22:34.440 --> 22:39.520
And I'm very interested from sitting among musicians to hear how if I give you today a

22:39.520 --> 22:46.080
technique where you can project sound anywhere in space and play it back for your listeners

22:46.080 --> 22:51.400
anywhere in space, which we can do almost right now for the first time using advanced

22:51.400 --> 22:54.800
computers and technologies, how would you use it as a musician?

22:54.800 --> 22:59.800
So that's the next question I want to put around the table as musicians, how would you

22:59.800 --> 23:04.040
use such a pillar, such a tool?

23:04.040 --> 23:09.440
Imagine the entire space is now your canvas, so you're not limited to just pitch rhythm

23:09.440 --> 23:13.720
you know melody and so on, but now you can say I want to violin to come from infinity,

23:13.720 --> 23:20.080
come whisper in my ear, fly off and then I want somebody to whisper my other ear song

23:20.080 --> 23:23.600
as opposed to sing always from a speaker in front of you.

23:23.600 --> 23:30.320
So, at least for me, that's something that I'm specifically not trying, I'm trying to

23:30.320 --> 23:34.880
do the opposite of that in my own work, I'm trying to make us very aware of the sound

23:34.880 --> 23:42.920
source as a point in space coming from a physical material so that if you play a note on a pitch

23:42.920 --> 23:50.240
on a violin that we are as listeners very aware of this string vibrating in space as

23:50.240 --> 23:56.040
bowed by this hair of this bow with a little bit of friction and the resonance of the body

23:56.040 --> 24:00.600
of the violin amplifying that sound and spreading outwards from a location over there coming

24:00.600 --> 24:01.600
towards us.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.640
But that is the stationization in his home.

24:05.640 --> 24:15.040
But it's one that's extremely explicit and very direct and very much tied into our experience

24:15.040 --> 24:21.000
of sound, like you said about that we typically think about sound as coming from points or

24:21.000 --> 24:26.240
when it's from the ocean we kind of think of it as a spatial thing but still very much

24:26.240 --> 24:28.600
delineated in space.

24:28.600 --> 24:35.480
And for whatever reason, this is just me and I'm not meaning to close off your inquiry

24:35.480 --> 24:42.360
at all, but I'm interested in this sort of separation almost.

24:42.360 --> 24:48.920
A separation that just makes us more aware of what we're experiencing, this kind of,

24:48.920 --> 24:57.200
I guess is the idea that the piece of music for me is, and this is why I think live sound

24:57.200 --> 25:01.920
is so important as opposed to recording for instance, is that the piece of music is an

25:01.920 --> 25:07.400
experience that's unfolding by the means of physics in space with us as listeners and

25:07.400 --> 25:16.160
our experience of that music is very much tied to the sound production in space.

25:16.160 --> 25:33.000
Would it be fair to say that in a sense your one bit music sort of underscores the aspects

25:33.000 --> 25:38.920
of the embodied music cognition by disembodying it in a certain sense?

25:38.920 --> 25:44.160
Well, yeah, I should say I work actually a lot with electronics even though I'm interested

25:44.160 --> 25:49.920
in acoustic instruments, but the way I work with electronics is very low level.

25:49.920 --> 25:55.800
I use this one bit waveforms which are just on and off, also, of electricity that make

25:55.800 --> 25:58.880
the speaker membrane move in and out like this and create sound.

25:58.880 --> 26:03.120
It's a very, very primitive approach to electronic sound.

26:03.120 --> 26:09.400
And a lot of that is to make us aware of the speaker as an instrument.

26:09.400 --> 26:16.080
And I would call that embodied and I'd even maybe go a step forward to say that it's

26:16.080 --> 26:22.960
trying to make us aware of how the electronics are even working, that the more we can see

26:22.960 --> 26:28.440
that system is something very mechanical and physical, the less magic it has, and the

26:28.440 --> 26:33.880
more we can kind of be connected to it experientially.

26:33.880 --> 26:41.840
But that's really just my approach, which is this very kind of concrete approach.

26:41.840 --> 26:49.800
But in experiencing the sound, the listener is listening the sound that has been reflected

26:49.800 --> 26:52.840
off surfaces around him or her reaching their ear.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.320
So the reverb is part of the experience.

26:56.320 --> 27:02.080
But that's what I'm referring to, being able to control that or use it as part of your

27:02.080 --> 27:06.520
own palette, and not actively you're not when you compose the one bit music.

27:06.520 --> 27:13.760
But to what extent you feel that the entire spatial aspect of the reproduction is important

27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
to the listener?

27:14.760 --> 27:17.080
Yeah, well, it's very important.

27:17.080 --> 27:21.280
But for me, that's an aspect of the performance of a piece of music in a space.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.520
And like us in this room hearing our voices reflect...

27:24.520 --> 27:29.880
That's very informal for acoustic music, production is to reproduce the reverb of a room.

27:29.880 --> 27:35.160
And when you have a 3D audio technique to do that, you can then create the illusion that

27:35.160 --> 27:39.400
you are in a real space or actually produce a real space, which for the first time now

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
can be done.

27:40.400 --> 27:47.000
Well, it's really interesting because my approach to music is always from traditions, traditional

27:47.000 --> 27:52.040
music, but always music and sound happens in space, always.

27:52.040 --> 27:58.400
Yeah, I want to tell something about the space in music.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.840
So on one hand, we are dealing with acoustics.

28:02.840 --> 28:06.320
And acoustics is about vibration and some medium it could be.

28:06.320 --> 28:11.240
Air or water, it could go through metal, through bone.

28:11.240 --> 28:16.680
And this is the basically space of acoustics, of the physical sound.

28:16.680 --> 28:22.760
But when we are talking about music, as we all understand, so this is a pitch being something

28:22.760 --> 28:28.360
which is made of melodies and harmonious, we discuss very different space.

28:28.360 --> 28:32.120
It's a space of tonal relationships.

28:32.120 --> 28:39.320
And it's kind of very, very separated from acoustics because you can take the same melody,

28:39.320 --> 28:42.600
let's say, Mary had a little lamp.

28:42.600 --> 28:48.360
Somebody could start playing it on violin and other person would finish it singing.

28:48.360 --> 28:55.720
So the timbers differ, violin could be on a radio and somebody would finish it on the

28:55.720 --> 28:58.200
radio, so physical space is different.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.440
But the melody is the same.

29:01.440 --> 29:08.640
It has, it's an object, it's a melodic shape, which can be divided between different players

29:08.640 --> 29:11.920
and it can be produced in different spaces.

29:11.920 --> 29:18.760
But still we feel it is something united because this melody exists in tonal space.

29:18.760 --> 29:29.280
And not long time ago, there was a very interesting book written by a very interesting person.

29:29.280 --> 29:36.480
They can serve as a philosopher, Rogers Groton, who, the book has named the Stégixo music.

29:36.480 --> 29:42.440
Rogers Groton, he's not only author of more than 40 books, mostly on philosophy, he's

29:42.440 --> 29:44.600
a conscientious philosopher.

29:44.600 --> 29:49.240
But he's also a composer of two operas, Stégix and Prague.

29:49.240 --> 29:55.400
So in this book, he reminded about so-called acasmatic space.

29:55.400 --> 30:04.200
This word came from ancient Greece, acasmaticus, that was the name for the students of Pythagoras.

30:04.200 --> 30:15.320
Rogers used to lecture from behind the screen, so not to distract their attention, so they

30:15.320 --> 30:18.000
will listen to them.

30:18.000 --> 30:26.480
So when we listen to music, we listen to shapes, to ideas, we go into this special space which

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
transcends acoustics.

30:28.480 --> 30:36.440
It's not just sound production, it's not just sound events, those sound events that

30:36.440 --> 30:45.600
they came together into melodies and harmonic sequences thanks to special forces, forces

30:45.600 --> 30:47.560
of tonal attraction.

30:47.560 --> 30:53.640
And what is amazing about music, it's actually a fantastic thing about music, that the music

30:53.640 --> 31:00.720
we are doing, the phenomenal space of tones of phenomenal gravity, because the main thing

31:00.720 --> 31:09.080
about tonal system of reference, which is just musical scale, that the tones differ in

31:09.080 --> 31:16.080
their frequencies, and this is acoustical characteristics, but they differ in psychophysics, they differ

31:16.080 --> 31:19.800
in the degree of attraction to tonal center.

31:19.800 --> 31:26.800
It's very easy to illustrate, may I?

31:26.800 --> 31:31.240
I have to go to the piano just one second to make it every particular.

31:31.240 --> 31:50.220
Alright, I would like to bow in my

31:50.220 --> 32:09.520
So, if you have just seven basic elements, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

32:09.520 --> 32:14.640
just seven basic elements, all the incredible wealth of music that we know today.

32:14.640 --> 32:19.860
It's made just seven basic elements and they are repeated again and again because space

32:19.860 --> 32:22.380
of music is organized cyclically.

32:22.380 --> 32:25.180
It's the same seven names.

32:25.180 --> 32:29.260
This is how we got 88 keys on the piano.

32:29.260 --> 32:36.220
So playing with just seven notes, basic elements, we are able to create incredible compositions

32:36.220 --> 32:38.140
and incredible structures.

32:38.140 --> 32:47.740
And we feel motion in music because we have stable tones and unstable tones.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.380
This is unstable.

32:49.380 --> 32:54.220
This is stable.

32:54.220 --> 33:02.220
So all we have in music, it's a playing with tonal attraction.

33:02.220 --> 33:06.300
We are within the field of tonal gravity.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.900
It's gravitational forces.

33:09.900 --> 33:15.100
And this is so simple to perceive that music is available for everybody.

33:15.100 --> 33:26.100
Already a newborn have different patterns of brain activation for dissonant and consonant.

33:26.100 --> 33:34.060
Already two months old recognized that this is pleasant to the air and this is not.

33:34.060 --> 33:39.220
We are born with musical expertise.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.020
And when they listen to music, it's tonal space.

33:42.020 --> 33:53.180
I guess I find this particular construction to be pretty specific to Western culture and

33:53.180 --> 34:05.700
Western culture.

34:05.700 --> 34:18.700
And I think you would probably agree and perhaps you would too.

34:18.700 --> 34:25.340
There are a lot of other ways of putting music together and also a lot of ways of experiencing

34:25.340 --> 34:27.180
music.

34:27.180 --> 34:32.620
I think what you are calling dissonant.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.740
It was to hide in.

34:34.740 --> 34:42.660
It was less dissonant to Mozart and even less dissonant to Brahms and certainly not really

34:42.660 --> 34:46.460
dissonant at all to someone like Schoenberg.

34:46.460 --> 34:55.860
And there is also the possibility of incorporating a certain amount of tension into what you

34:55.860 --> 35:03.500
might call a sound that produces pleasure, which is how you define music.

35:03.500 --> 35:10.580
So in the same way that with food we can accommodate a certain amount of bitterness in the course

35:10.580 --> 35:19.620
of a meal, if I had a shot of espresso, which I just did, even though I am not acting like

35:19.620 --> 35:27.380
I did, that I did.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.620
That can be pleasurable too.

35:29.620 --> 35:36.900
This thing that we might perceive as tense is actually useful at the moment.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.660
And I think also stability is relative.

35:38.660 --> 35:47.780
I mean if you listen to blues, it has dominant chords as stable entities.

35:47.780 --> 35:53.660
And if you listen to someone like Phonius Monk, he will incorporate roughness like the

35:53.660 --> 35:59.620
auditory experience of tones rubbing against each other as part of the aesthetic.

35:59.620 --> 36:04.780
And that can be, we can tolerate a certain amount of roughness and in fact even enjoy

36:04.780 --> 36:11.100
it in the course of musical experience.

36:11.100 --> 36:18.500
I guess I have been, you know, I am thinking back to my first, my opening question because

36:18.500 --> 36:23.260
I have been trying to see if there is a way that we are all talking about the same thing.

36:23.260 --> 36:28.700
And I am not actually sure that we are yet.

36:28.700 --> 36:33.620
It is not, we don't even have to exactly.

36:33.620 --> 36:39.980
But my, I suppose in particular we have been talking about music as something that happens

36:39.980 --> 36:46.780
to us, that we perceive or receive, which means that generally it seems that we think

36:46.780 --> 36:56.620
of music as not our own doing, but somehow coming from somebody else.

36:56.620 --> 37:03.860
And so I guess I just think back to, well a friend of mine Gary Tomlinson, he is a professor

37:03.860 --> 37:09.980
at Yale and he has a book about to come out, I think it comes out in a week or so, called

37:09.980 --> 37:14.580
Musicking the First Million Years.

37:14.580 --> 37:21.260
And as you know, we as a species are only a tenth of that in terms of our own, you know,

37:21.260 --> 37:25.620
the amount of time that we have been on this planet as homo sapiens.

37:25.620 --> 37:30.180
So what could he possibly be talking about?

37:30.180 --> 37:33.980
And these are the kinds of questions that I am interested in because if we are going

37:33.980 --> 37:40.020
to start making assertions about the cognitive universals of music like that everybody in

37:40.020 --> 37:47.340
the world hears something as dissonant or something like that, we have to make sure that

37:47.340 --> 37:50.140
we are really talking about everybody in the world.

37:50.140 --> 37:56.900
And for me it makes more sense to start from the opposite end, which is what must it have

37:56.900 --> 38:07.780
been like to be not yet human for example, but find yourself walking early hominids.

38:07.780 --> 38:13.580
You know when you go to the Museum of Natural History, the sort of canonical scene of early

38:13.580 --> 38:18.660
hominids or as a little nuclear family walking through the woods or something like that,

38:18.660 --> 38:19.660
right?

38:19.660 --> 38:28.540
And then you start hearing each other walking in sync, like you hear the footsteps starting

38:28.540 --> 38:34.340
to synchronize and then could that be the beginning of what we are calling music?

38:34.340 --> 38:42.660
In other words, is music actually come from not just sound of anything but sound of us?

38:42.660 --> 38:45.620
Because that to me is what makes the most sense.

38:45.620 --> 38:52.580
If we are going to even use this word, which is a very fuzzy word, and I mean for me the

38:52.580 --> 38:55.620
biggest problem is I don't know where music stops.

38:55.620 --> 39:03.620
If we say it starts in a certain place, like it starts with sound or it starts with tonal

39:03.620 --> 39:08.220
gravity or it starts with rhythm, where does it end?

39:08.220 --> 39:10.740
What is the other side?

39:10.740 --> 39:18.180
Is there an experience that is not music?

39:18.180 --> 39:23.860
And that is actually there is no answer to that because it is going to entirely a cultural

39:23.860 --> 39:27.580
decision about what the bound view of this thing that we call music is.

39:27.580 --> 39:32.220
In fact it is bound up with our name for it, you know we say this is music.

39:32.220 --> 39:36.020
But the other thing that is bound up with is that we in the last hundred years have gotten

39:36.020 --> 39:40.940
used to receiving music without seeing it.

39:40.940 --> 39:48.140
So basically we have in our midst like in everyday life the equivalent of our acoustmatic music,

39:48.140 --> 39:51.060
which is what we call recorded music, you know.

39:51.060 --> 39:54.300
And that has only been around for a hundred years and if you think about music in the

39:54.300 --> 39:59.860
less million years, the less even a hundred thousand years that humans have been here,

39:59.860 --> 40:03.820
a hundred years doesn't make, doesn't have any significance, evolutionarily speaking.

40:03.820 --> 40:10.500
So we evolved to something that we were before we had recorded music, which was to hear each

40:10.500 --> 40:13.740
other making sound, right?

40:13.740 --> 40:18.100
Not just to hear sound in general, but to hear each other.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.620
That's what we're really good at doing.

40:19.620 --> 40:22.540
I mean we've evolved to be really good at hearing each other.

40:22.540 --> 40:23.940
We can hear footsteps.

40:23.940 --> 40:27.860
If I hear footsteps I can tell if it's a man or a woman most of the time.

40:27.860 --> 40:31.540
I mean that's statistically true that most of the time you can tell.

40:31.540 --> 40:39.100
In fact that's so true that when people audition for the symphony they also audition behind

40:39.100 --> 40:42.940
a curtain and not only that, but they put a carpet down so that they can't hear your

40:42.940 --> 40:53.460
footsteps because it was found that people who you know decide who's the best in these

40:53.460 --> 40:57.820
auditions were somehow being implicitly sexist.

40:57.820 --> 41:03.860
So they actually conceal gender in order to get the best players.

41:03.860 --> 41:09.220
So that's how good we are at hearing each other, that we can hear properties of somebody's

41:09.220 --> 41:13.420
body just by hearing them walking for example.

41:13.420 --> 41:17.860
We're also really good at hearing our environments.

41:17.860 --> 41:26.220
My graduate advisor had a moment in the early 70s where he got to hang out with Stevie Wonder.

41:26.220 --> 41:32.980
And at the time Stevie Wonder was making Intervision's or Talking Book of one of those albums.

41:32.980 --> 41:41.500
And so my friend got to go with Stevie Wonder to the head of what was at the time Columbia

41:41.500 --> 41:48.340
Records which is at the top of the Sony building and they wrote an elevator up to the top floor

41:48.340 --> 41:54.540
and you exit the elevator into this pyramid shaped atrium.

41:54.540 --> 42:01.220
So Stevie Wonder comes out of the elevator and he says, you just stood there for a second

42:01.220 --> 42:03.580
and he said there's something up this room.

42:03.580 --> 42:08.620
It's like the walls are triangular or something like that.

42:08.620 --> 42:15.780
So that's how good we are at hearing space, you know, hearing the space around us.

42:15.780 --> 42:20.660
But that's partly because we've evolved to perceive each other.

42:20.660 --> 42:27.220
I want to talk to many things I feel strongly about and mostly very much what you said.

42:27.220 --> 42:33.340
One thing you mentioned early on when commenting on Marina's little experiment is the fact

42:33.340 --> 42:39.460
that what we perceive as something let's say an unstable or atonal can evolve taste wise,

42:39.460 --> 42:44.060
can evolve across even the same culture technically going from Hado to Schoenberg.

42:44.060 --> 42:47.300
But also as I said earlier can evolve across culturally.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.620
It could be something dissonant and nice.

42:49.620 --> 42:58.460
But there are turns out going to some recent research some very, very universal feelings

42:58.460 --> 43:03.660
we get from some sounds which are almost common to all of us, we'll have to do with our revolution.

43:03.660 --> 43:09.300
For example, it's been shown quite recently with research on how we interact with reverberation,

43:09.300 --> 43:15.300
late reflections that if I take, if I give you headphones or if I can simulate 3D sound

43:15.300 --> 43:20.140
from speakers and simulate the sound of very early reflections.

43:20.140 --> 43:24.980
In other words, make it click and make it sound as if it's coming to you very early

43:24.980 --> 43:28.660
from the reflections come to you very early.

43:28.660 --> 43:29.900
You will be very anxious.

43:29.900 --> 43:32.380
All of us will be very anxious.

43:32.380 --> 43:37.100
Almost 100% of subjects feel anxiety of some sort because that simulates the sound of what

43:37.100 --> 43:39.300
happens if you're trapped in a corner.

43:39.300 --> 43:44.580
And your brain knows that this is as humans have to evolve in getting away from danger

43:44.580 --> 43:45.820
that we are trapped.

43:45.820 --> 43:51.180
Now if I take you to an anicoid chamber and I have one in my lab or if you're going

43:51.180 --> 43:55.820
in an anicoid chamber or it's similar if you stay in the wild in the open, there are

43:55.820 --> 43:57.140
no reflections.

43:57.140 --> 44:06.340
And there almost all humans have a sense of enhanced alertness or you know, we are

44:06.340 --> 44:07.340
tens alertness.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.500
It has to do with the fact that we are exposed to danger.

44:09.500 --> 44:10.980
We don't get any reflections.

44:10.980 --> 44:12.620
That means we are totally open.

44:12.620 --> 44:15.940
So holes are designed to have just the right amount of reverb.

44:15.940 --> 44:19.780
What I'm getting to is something you touched on is that where is the limit of what music

44:19.780 --> 44:20.780
is.

44:20.780 --> 44:26.660
If I define music as simply as I designed earlier, which is a sound that gives us some

44:26.660 --> 44:32.620
kind of feelings or emotions or pleasure, then it seems to me the limit is almost nowhere.

44:32.620 --> 44:39.100
It's almost to the point where even a verb by itself can just the reverb of this click

44:39.100 --> 44:43.980
in the room only open can give us anxiety, all of us, or give us pleasure.

44:43.980 --> 44:47.020
And I found that tremendous that we have these fundamental mechanisms.

44:47.020 --> 44:50.340
Probably have to do with the fact that we have to survive or worry about predators coming

44:50.340 --> 44:52.580
at us and feeling trapped or not trapped.

44:52.580 --> 44:55.380
Absolutely, we react to auditory stimuli.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.700
That's true.

44:57.700 --> 45:00.620
Just I think we are discussing about musikas.

45:00.620 --> 45:03.580
And there are different directions.

45:03.580 --> 45:09.420
For example, I was a music by Exynakis, which was very popular recently.

45:09.420 --> 45:15.780
And he used random numbers to create something really interesting.

45:15.780 --> 45:18.460
And some of his creations are very beautiful.

45:18.460 --> 45:24.500
But this is not exactly what we would tell, name music, because still today we understand

45:24.500 --> 45:29.340
music, something which is made of melodies and harmonies, something you would think to

45:29.340 --> 45:33.860
be a child or recognize its familiar melody.

45:33.860 --> 45:36.300
Music really gives people pleasure, by the way.

45:36.300 --> 45:42.740
Music activates biological reward pleasure, nuclear circumference, which also reacts to

45:42.740 --> 45:44.980
sex and food.

45:44.980 --> 45:48.220
Even sad music, because it gives us pleasure.

45:48.220 --> 45:49.220
Even Zanakus?

45:49.220 --> 45:52.220
He used random numbers to cast it.

45:52.220 --> 45:56.940
No, I'm asking you, does Zanakus give us pleasure?

45:56.940 --> 45:58.860
I found it interesting.

45:58.860 --> 46:01.180
But that's not what I'm asking you.

46:01.180 --> 46:02.740
I'm asking you to spend it.

46:02.740 --> 46:03.740
I don't know, but it is.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.100
Yes, it still did research.

46:05.100 --> 46:11.980
I think what happened, because I was bitten by a scientific bug, so I'm looking for precise

46:11.980 --> 46:12.980
data.

46:12.980 --> 46:18.820
So when we're talking about melodic universals, and when I say the universals, it's not just

46:18.820 --> 46:20.060
conjecture.

46:20.060 --> 46:25.740
It means that people around the world recognize octave, which is the first overtone of harmonic

46:25.740 --> 46:27.060
series.

46:27.060 --> 46:35.300
And octave to just a thousand years ago was sometimes substituted with fifth, quinta,

46:35.300 --> 46:36.900
which is the next overtone.

46:36.900 --> 46:41.700
My point is that melodic elements are defined by the physics of sound.

46:41.700 --> 46:47.460
If you have two harmonic series, two different thoughts, which have the beginning of the harmonic

46:47.460 --> 46:51.380
series overlapped, the strongest overtones overlapped.

46:51.380 --> 46:57.180
The appreciative does dissonant, most likely it's related to the neural cost of processing.

46:57.180 --> 46:58.180
It's easy to process.

46:58.180 --> 47:02.140
It makes this event silent.

47:02.140 --> 47:03.340
And also another thing.

47:03.340 --> 47:06.460
Can I just ask?

47:06.460 --> 47:14.980
When you ask someone, do you perceive this as dissonant, even in a scientific setting?

47:14.980 --> 47:18.340
There's already culture around them to figure out what that even means.

47:18.340 --> 47:20.340
Yeah, but octave is not culture.

47:20.340 --> 47:25.300
Well, octave is octave around the world, even for Australians that do not have melodies.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.540
I mean, I'm a britianist.

47:26.540 --> 47:28.180
I don't want to be obnoxious.

47:28.180 --> 47:33.740
It's just they don't have melodies and harmonies that European music has, but they do recognize

47:33.740 --> 47:35.060
octave.

47:35.060 --> 47:39.980
My point is that melodic elements, they are not ordered by somebody.

47:39.980 --> 47:42.460
It's a discovery of human mind.

47:42.460 --> 47:46.220
It's discovered through all visceral reactions.

47:46.220 --> 47:53.140
And as far as tonal tension and release, we know about music by Schonberg and his students,

47:53.140 --> 47:56.820
Bergen Webern, who wrote the 12th tone music.

47:56.820 --> 48:03.100
Basically they try to escape the dictatura of tonal tension.

48:03.100 --> 48:06.620
In the music they use noble technique of polyphony.

48:06.620 --> 48:12.220
They would take, create a melody made of all chromatic tones, never repeating any of the

48:12.220 --> 48:17.620
tones, so to avoid any tonal attraction, any preference, any hierarchy.

48:17.620 --> 48:19.900
And they would work with this series.

48:19.900 --> 48:26.140
They would invert it, they used it in different timbers, they would, when collapse it, nobody

48:26.140 --> 48:27.620
sings those melodies.

48:27.620 --> 48:29.300
It's interesting music.

48:29.300 --> 48:32.380
But when we talk about blues, it's still tension and release.

48:32.380 --> 48:38.300
If you start to play for us, we would immediately recognize that this sounds less tense than

48:38.300 --> 48:39.300
this.

48:39.300 --> 48:40.300
That's Marina.

48:40.300 --> 48:49.780
I mean, if we go more than 500 years ago, we will not even talk about music about this

48:49.780 --> 48:50.780
in these terms.

48:50.780 --> 48:56.460
We will not talk at any time, we just do it.

48:56.460 --> 48:57.460
And that will be enough.

48:57.460 --> 49:00.220
What do you mean 100 years ago?

49:00.220 --> 49:07.980
That what you're talking about is basic on an agreement of 100 years ago of Western music.

49:07.980 --> 49:11.180
I don't think so.

49:11.180 --> 49:12.180
I think it's a discovery.

49:12.180 --> 49:15.420
And I want to talk about the results of the studies.

49:15.420 --> 49:20.860
It's my personal study in perception of tonal modulation, which is discovery of European

49:20.860 --> 49:21.860
tradition.

49:21.860 --> 49:26.340
It's a very sophisticated thing for music theories and it's nothing but people with

49:26.340 --> 49:28.100
no music education.

49:28.100 --> 49:32.460
What I found, the people from different countries from around the world, they listened to harmonic

49:32.460 --> 49:37.460
progressions that medulate to different degrees and they perfectly recognize what is.

49:37.460 --> 49:38.460
There is no modulation.

49:38.460 --> 49:40.820
I'm not in many, many cultures and musical cultures.

49:40.820 --> 49:45.820
Yeah, but my point is that European tradition, it's not an agreement.

49:45.820 --> 49:48.540
It's a discovery that became accepted.

49:48.540 --> 49:49.780
But okay, that's great.

49:49.780 --> 49:50.780
It's European tradition.

49:50.780 --> 49:54.820
But we have other continents in the world that create music.

49:54.820 --> 50:00.620
And probably European tradition is based on all this music that has been done for 100,000

50:00.620 --> 50:01.620
years ago.

50:01.620 --> 50:06.260
Let's say 50,000 years ago, after today, this is the conservative estimate that music

50:06.260 --> 50:08.140
exists at least for 50,000 years.

50:08.140 --> 50:09.140
So perfect.

50:09.140 --> 50:16.780
So then we have 15,000 years of music, of doing it, of sharing it, of being in circles like

50:16.780 --> 50:17.780
this.

50:17.780 --> 50:20.820
We have to pay attention how music was performed.

50:20.820 --> 50:26.660
And for me this is the key because music was a part of the community, probably always

50:26.660 --> 50:32.740
in circle for certain, certain, certain objecties to promote, to promote to the individual and

50:32.740 --> 50:34.140
to the community.

50:34.140 --> 50:38.300
So first of all, the music production and recording scenes 100 years ago, the stage in

50:38.300 --> 50:42.140
music for me is the most unnatural thing for music, the stage.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.140
You're not alone.

50:43.140 --> 50:48.660
Glenn, who did not like to perform stage Victor, did not want to be seen when he was performed.

50:48.660 --> 50:49.660
Exactly.

50:49.660 --> 50:52.260
So I think you promoted a great question.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.260
What is music?

50:53.260 --> 50:58.180
And I agree we have to speak the same language because if not, we are lost in concepts.

50:58.180 --> 51:00.260
And for me, music is not even a concept.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.260
It's not a concept.

51:01.260 --> 51:02.260
We are trying to really...

51:02.260 --> 51:03.740
It's a leading tradition.

51:03.740 --> 51:10.140
It describes something that has been existing before us maybe.

51:10.140 --> 51:11.580
Sound has been before us.

51:11.580 --> 51:20.420
And we just jump into this pause of life, of this vibrational field that then we, as humans,

51:20.420 --> 51:26.500
we start to pick up some elements from there and we just start creating music for what?

51:26.500 --> 51:29.620
For me the question is, we do music for what?

51:29.620 --> 51:33.660
But the key is that we do music for 15,000 years ago till now.

51:33.660 --> 51:39.980
With years like with 30 years one tone, I can demonstrate here, you know, to really

51:39.980 --> 51:46.580
complex harmonies because the human existence evolve and the music evolve with it.

51:46.580 --> 51:52.580
But we cannot just explain music as the last 100 years ago.

51:52.580 --> 51:55.780
Because music is something that comes from human nature.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.940
And I think it's really interesting what you're talking about.

51:57.940 --> 52:00.300
It's like, what is about pause?

52:00.300 --> 52:01.300
What is this?

52:01.300 --> 52:10.820
There is no harmony here.

52:10.820 --> 52:12.740
There is no tona progression.

52:12.740 --> 52:13.740
This is pause.

52:13.740 --> 52:14.740
It's rhythm.

52:14.740 --> 52:15.740
We can discuss if this is part of music or not.

52:15.740 --> 52:17.980
I think it's one of the elements of music.

52:17.980 --> 52:22.780
But what is true is that in many traditions ago, this is a chord.

52:22.780 --> 52:24.940
They were doing music with elements.

52:24.940 --> 52:26.940
With each community, what do we have?

52:26.940 --> 52:27.940
We have a stone.

52:27.940 --> 52:29.220
We start creating pause.

52:29.220 --> 52:30.300
For what?

52:30.300 --> 52:32.700
Because maybe we have a pause.

52:32.700 --> 52:37.540
We can be together in a space and that will promote something in us.

52:37.540 --> 52:39.340
Maybe a sense of security.

52:39.340 --> 52:44.820
Maybe to dance because if we attend, each tradition has rhythm for what is the rhythm.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.460
I wonder if...

52:46.460 --> 52:53.020
I'll almost go back to actually what you were talking about in terms of our pace, our walking,

52:53.020 --> 52:54.020
our steps and stuff.

52:54.020 --> 53:01.220
That was so interesting because it's something I've thought about before in terms of mathematics,

53:01.220 --> 53:07.060
actually, is that our experience in the world, as human beings, is based...

53:07.060 --> 53:09.460
How can I say this?

53:09.460 --> 53:11.860
Like walking is very intrinsic to us.

53:11.860 --> 53:16.820
It's ordering time into these discrete steps, whether they're uneven or uneven or whatever.

53:16.820 --> 53:19.100
There's sort of step zero, step one.

53:19.100 --> 53:23.260
Something might be like 10 steps away.

53:23.260 --> 53:25.540
We also have our breathing.

53:25.540 --> 53:31.260
That's this discrete unit-based activity, which is very different, for instance, than when

53:31.260 --> 53:37.140
you have a bird soaring through the sky from one tree to the next, which is not the same

53:37.140 --> 53:43.220
way we subdivide our entire experience of the world, which to me connects to rhythm.

53:43.220 --> 53:48.820
But then I was also thinking about how maybe we can connect rhythm and pitch in terms of

53:48.820 --> 53:53.900
just multiplying multiplications of some event.

53:53.900 --> 54:01.620
If a fundamental tone is a certain frequency, how we find multiples of that, the overtone

54:01.620 --> 54:09.260
series or mathematical ratios of that to be pleasing or displeasing, etc.

54:09.260 --> 54:13.220
The simple ratios, more pleasing, more stable, etc.

54:13.220 --> 54:15.380
There's something true also about rhythm.

54:15.380 --> 54:18.940
The rhythm you played, for instance, was very regular that was based on some sort of unit

54:18.940 --> 54:27.020
and that had these kind of like meter that fell into meter that changed, but was still

54:27.020 --> 54:33.100
this kind of grouping into some number of elements or something.

54:33.100 --> 54:42.700
I think that in both of these worlds, I think that evolutionarily clearly it's tapping into

54:42.700 --> 54:46.340
the things that we relate to.

54:46.340 --> 54:50.900
I think a lot of it comes from our need to understand where sound comes from and to understand

54:50.900 --> 54:55.060
the voice of your family, which is based on pitch.

54:55.060 --> 54:56.060
I mean, you need to know pitch.

54:56.060 --> 55:00.500
I'm sure there are so many, so many evolutionary reasons for us being attracted to understanding

55:00.500 --> 55:01.500
certain sound.

55:01.500 --> 55:05.660
I don't remember what I was going with that.

55:05.660 --> 55:12.660
I mean, that starts to finally get to the title of this conversation.

55:12.660 --> 55:18.100
The reason that you've been listening to more about rhythm is to know from both scientists

55:18.100 --> 55:22.660
and musicians about the mind in bodily action.

55:22.660 --> 55:28.980
I mean, because you're describing something about the movement of the body, the sensory

55:28.980 --> 55:33.480
elements that you're receiving.

55:33.480 --> 55:37.820
What about those aspects of your experience of music?

55:37.820 --> 55:45.940
Well, you know, I go back often to this quote by one of my favorite pianists.

55:45.940 --> 55:47.420
His name is Cecil Taylor.

55:47.420 --> 55:54.020
There was a film called Imagine the Sound that came out in the early 80s, and it opens

55:54.020 --> 55:55.820
with this line.

55:55.820 --> 55:59.860
It's an interview with Mr. Taylor.

55:59.860 --> 56:07.260
He says, well, to me, what music is is everything that you do.

56:07.260 --> 56:09.060
So he grounds it in it.

56:09.060 --> 56:12.780
Not everything you hear, but everything you do.

56:12.780 --> 56:15.660
So he grounds it in action.

56:15.660 --> 56:22.020
And of course, our actions are, you could say, constrained in the sense that there are only

56:22.020 --> 56:25.140
certain things that we can do with our bodies.

56:25.140 --> 56:28.900
There's only so fast you can walk.

56:28.900 --> 56:31.940
We don't walk at 10 hertz.

56:31.940 --> 56:40.020
We walk closer to one or two hertz, right, in terms of cycles per second, right?

56:40.020 --> 56:43.700
We don't breathe at 10 hertz.

56:43.700 --> 56:50.620
We breathe at one or less than half a hertz or more like a tenth of a hertz if you're

56:50.620 --> 56:52.220
meditating.

56:52.220 --> 57:01.540
So these kind of create these natural constraints on action which are temporal and then grouping

57:01.540 --> 57:10.500
those actions like you say in ways that are either regular or not, but that we can synchronize.

57:10.500 --> 57:18.340
Because I guess for me, if it's about everything that you do, who's the you, first of all?

57:18.340 --> 57:19.460
It's all of us, right?

57:19.460 --> 57:24.340
So it's everything that we do together as well, which means like our ability to synchronize

57:24.340 --> 57:33.580
our actions, which is so fundamental to music making and music listening is that well, the

57:33.580 --> 57:39.700
fact that we can actually generate a pulse and then have everybody clap that pulse together,

57:39.700 --> 57:45.740
for example, and then that we can sing in unison and these kinds of things.

57:45.740 --> 57:52.020
I saw this one paper, this scientific paper about, you know, there's a lot of speculative

57:52.020 --> 57:53.340
origins about music.

57:53.340 --> 57:55.820
Like, why are we even able to do this?

57:55.820 --> 58:03.100
And one idea was that if I clap by myself, it's only as loud as I can clap, but if we're

58:03.100 --> 58:08.620
able to clap in unison, then it suddenly twice as loud, which means it reaches twice the

58:08.620 --> 58:13.700
distance, which is four times the area, which is four times as many people.

58:13.700 --> 58:18.140
So suddenly it's this massive communicative leap because we can do things together.

58:18.140 --> 58:23.340
You can reach more people and we can synchronize more.

58:23.340 --> 58:31.100
So that to me seems like it's so grounded in us doing things together that I don't see

58:31.100 --> 58:34.820
how we can talk about music without thinking about it in social terms.

58:34.820 --> 58:39.820
It's really interesting that we were talking about also about grouping the pulse, which

58:39.820 --> 58:41.700
for me is eternal.

58:41.700 --> 58:43.420
The pulse is always there.

58:43.420 --> 58:46.860
We just can open to listen to the pulse, but we are pulse.

58:46.860 --> 58:50.540
I mean, our heart is pulsating, but also there is something pulsating.

58:50.540 --> 58:56.780
Then how we organize the pulse is the key for starting to talk about, which are the cycles

58:56.780 --> 59:01.860
because the pulse is eternal, kum, kum, kum, but then depending on how we organize that

59:01.860 --> 59:08.260
pulse into cycles, then we're going to be able to breathe and walk.

59:08.260 --> 59:13.140
And through the breathe, then for me melody starts to happen.

59:13.140 --> 59:15.260
So for me this is like the key of music.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.660
It's like this pulse that is eternal that is always accessible.

59:18.660 --> 59:22.060
And if it's steady, we can just create anything.

59:22.060 --> 59:28.060
But then that cycle that we decide is going to generate the breath and from the breath

59:28.060 --> 59:29.860
the melody.

59:29.860 --> 59:30.860
And that's it.

59:30.860 --> 59:34.820
So then when we all come together, you want to do guys like in the experiment, maybe doing

59:34.820 --> 59:36.140
something.

59:36.140 --> 59:38.900
So let's just do this.

59:38.900 --> 59:40.860
Right?

59:40.860 --> 59:46.260
So this is just like an entrant like pulse, as it's always right there.

59:46.260 --> 59:51.900
So as he said, if we just start, for example, doing...

59:51.900 --> 01:00:00.380
Okay, now what is the cycle?

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:07.780
So you see how fast we get into it without not even thinking about it.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:11.260
But then if we start adding the melody, just would be the way that we breathe.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:17.580
I like to understand that each country, the difference about music is different ways

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580
of breathing.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.820
It's different with breath, you know.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.820
And rhythms is...

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.900
Each culture has a different rhythm, you know.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:28.700
But I believe that also there is like underneath the roots, there is a common rhythm and a

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:33.620
common pulse that we can really all get together and really communicate.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:40.140
So maybe a better title for this would have been embodied cognition and embedded cognition

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:44.180
in the sense that it's not only about the sensory motor of the individual, but the social

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.180
connection that...

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180
I believe that is a social...

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.980
That cognition is embedded also in the interaction.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980
But it's a social...

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:58.300
It's a very interesting part of the social communication between humans that has not involved

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.300
ideas.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.820
I mean, one thing music is miserable at doing, which I find remarkable, is communicating

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:05.820
ideas.

01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:11.060
Stravinsky said music is incapable of communicating ideas.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.300
By ideas I mean something not like feeling or emotion.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.260
For example, let's take an idea.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.180
Let's say child labor is abhorrent.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.700
I can write a poem for trade out no problem.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:29.420
I can write a painting showing child labor somewhere in the powers of some factory in

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:34.380
India and make you revolt in the new feeling of injustice.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.660
I can make a movie, I can make a...

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:43.820
But try to make a symphony that portrays the sentence child labor is abhorrent.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.820
It's very hard.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820
Let me ask you.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.820
And I find that spectacular.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:53.100
It points to the visceral power of music, what you are talking about.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.220
None of us mention ideas, by the way, which I think is natural.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:01.700
We don't think of music as a little paragraph in the New York Times can portray more ideas

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.340
than all of Beethoven's non-sympany.

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:11.940
Yet we all think they are incredibly powerful.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:17.980
You said something using your voice in rhythm and with pitch.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:20.700
And you then said that that wasn't music.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.820
And so that involves you having drawn a line about this is outside of music.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:28.980
Me saying something is not music.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.140
So you're saying that speech is not music.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.420
And that to me is not so clear a distinction.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.220
You're making a distinction about sonorous human action.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:42.660
I'm using my early, very simplistic definition of music as sounds which interact with us.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.100
Of course, once you put speech in the middle of that line, this is why I started saying

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.100
I really have no clue what music is from the beginning.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.620
And I diversed myself on any really good knowledge of the whole business, especially

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.780
in front of musicians.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:59.660
But once you start putting speech and tonality, of course I'm making, I'm using these.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.740
But I'm talking, can you imagine just using pure sounds?

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.620
You can probably portray ideas, especially if it's a cultural context.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.620
But it's not the most efficient way of all forms, I think.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.020
That's one of the middle ground's most code.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:20.260
Which is like using rhythm specifically to encode information.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:28.900
And I mean, I think on a working level, I do agree that they're, I don't want to get

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.100
too caught up in this part of the conversation.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:37.900
But I do think that there is sort of like the absolute truth of what is music.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.100
And I cannot argue with the entirely open end-endness of that.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:47.460
But I do think that culturally in 2015 or whatever.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.420
On the Upper East Side.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.260
We can, like probably there's a consensus about what music is.

01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:57.940
And written, spoken word does not necessarily fall into that.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:02.860
Which basically, or at the very least we can talk about music that includes language or

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.780
something that specifically has identifiable meaning in music that doesn't.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.420
Maybe we could at least not say that it's only, that's the only kind of music.

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:19.620
And at least for me as a composer, I am really not interested in communicable narrative through

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:20.620
text and language.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.020
I'm much more interested in abstract forms and stuff.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:28.340
So my music falls to the non-verbal side of things.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:36.020
And that's one of the reasons I think I can even do like music at all is that I really

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.820
don't have much to say for the narrative side of it.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.020
I think that's actually the definition of music.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.740
It's a non-representational way of communication.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:49.740
This is why we even cannot compare it with Morsey because Morsey still gives you letters.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.180
In music we have no recognizable images.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.820
We have no words to translate.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.540
We have nothing tangible.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:06.220
We just have a flow of sounds organized in tonal relationships.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.140
Or it's a rhythm.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:14.140
Because in music, like in conventional music we are talking about two dimensions, most

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.140
important dimensions.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:21.220
It's time dimension, era of time, rhythm, meter and rhythm, and tonal relationships.

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.580
And music can be without tonal relationships.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:29.820
And it could be very effective as natural demonstrates.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:34.700
You can use different rhythms to include people in different psychological state and produce

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.700
different results.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.020
And it's really spectacular.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:46.300
Do you think that music can get away from any kind of metaphorical representation?

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:52.700
When you have alterations in time, in space, or tone, it almost seems that it implies a

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.260
certain metaphoric interpretation on some level.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.100
And that how can you really get away?

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:06.140
It's not the same as using words, but one tone might be higher than the other.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:10.740
And this is going to create certain spatial metaphors in the arts.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:16.540
But it also maps onto something, again, getting back to embodied cognition.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:22.540
It maps back onto bodily experience and experiences in time and space.

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.620
Basically, this is what I tried to find in my studies when I measure people responses

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:31.820
to different tonal tension, to different tonal distances.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:37.660
And there are responses to tonal distances expressed in the sense of perceived tension,

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.220
but also in the sense of perceived brightness and perceived warmth.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.740
Do you think, why do you never dance?

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.740
I did not finish it.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740
I did not finish.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:54.380
So basically, when we listen to music, when we perceive this world, we are the very comfortable

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.380
and very relaxed.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:07:01.060
We can be frightened, we can be tense, and it's physical tension.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:07.580
So we can think about our life in general as a sequence of tension and release.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.060
Like it's a very simplified, terribly simplified explanation of music.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.820
That music captures this particular aspect of living.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:24.740
It basically gives us sequences of tension and release that somehow creates emotion,

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:32.820
creates our living, when we listen to music, we live through music.

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.780
It's always in time.

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:37.100
It's tightly controlled in time.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.180
We experience psychological state in time.

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:46.580
It's developing through those tension and releases, through those synestatic reactions,

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.700
warmth and brightness.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:54.580
Some music does something to us that makes us live in parallel.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.460
It's a sorcery.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.820
Like I told you, I was a applied philosopher.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:05.340
I looked into the V.A. Foundation of Music and I'm trying to give something tangible,

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.340
some explanation.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.100
This is what I found with data.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:13.780
I think this is cultural.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.780
What is once?

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.620
What is called?

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.620
What is cultural?

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.020
If we do an experiment with tapping into different cultures, maybe we can agree on that.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:28.420
But my perception, for example, for me is a seven, a cycle in seven, super stable.

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.420
Nobody will say that.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:32.860
A cycle in five, for me, is really stable and also for the brain.

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.060
But let me finish.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:43.020
So brightness, warmth, tension, harmony, those concepts, I don't think that really even

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020
define music.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.020
They do not.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.020
This is very important.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.500
I'm not talking about global music perception.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.860
I'm talking about where it begins.

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:58.980
Like a single cell doesn't define human organism, but we need to study human cell-how functions

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.940
and not understand how the organism functions.

01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:07.220
And as far as cultural constructs, yes, music is cultural construct.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:13.660
But the same study, the replica of it, of my study, was run in India with people who

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:19.020
never had this experience of moving on different tonal distances, modulations.

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:21.740
And the results were the same.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.380
I'm talking about subconscious, pre-cognitive perception.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:30.420
Yes, there is European tradition, there are different traditions, but the study show again

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:37.140
and again that people, culture, the heart of musical message, even this musical message

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.460
comes from different cultures.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.540
Music is the universal language.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:47.100
All other languages, if I start talking in French or Russian, only a few people would

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.100
understand me.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.260
Why are the music falls into that category too?

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:57.660
I think there's a lot, probably most of the kinds of music in the world are not necessarily

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:02.700
music to everybody at first listen.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:11.620
I for one listen to a lot of noise music that's built specifically on a richness of harmonic

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:19.620
overtone and spectrum that wouldn't collapse nicely into the clean ratios at all.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.820
You mean folk music or inventing music?

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:30.940
I guess I'm coming at it from noise music, particularly maybe an electronic sound.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.780
Oh, I'm talking only about folk music.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:38.060
Only about living traditions, something which was developed by people through real musical

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.060
practice, not invention.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:46.220
What happens in music and this is really fascinating, yes, there are all these experimentations

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.140
and the limitations are wonderful because they give impetus for development of new expressive

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.780
means.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.180
But there's also such things as craftsmanship.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:02.480
When you look into the creations of Jürgen Sibachinbach, even his sons called him Old

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.420
Wig, like old-fashioned.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:10.940
But if you look carefully in his compositions you would find politicality, you would find

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:16.940
whole tone scale, you would find some amazing thing which we already see that is developed

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:17.940
as avant-garde.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:25.820
I am very much for avant-garde experimentations because this is what gives new life to music.

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:34.380
What do you think about the inherent problem in pitch between pure intonation, like just

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.380
intonation and equal temperament?

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.260
It's a fantastic theme.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:41.380
I remember I was torturing.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.180
Well, so just to…

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.180
I was torturing.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.180
Yeah, it's about the tuning.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:52.340
There are two approaches to tuning the sort of natural one which maybe we often sing in

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:58.900
which is frequencies being clean, multiples and ratios of frequency to one another.

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:07.100
And then in western music in particular, for instance, with the invention of the piano,

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:12.300
I don't know my music history so well, but equal temperament is a way of sort of pushing

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:17.420
this clean mathematical representation of pitch into something that is more regular and that

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.740
can be, for instance, transposed and…

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.740
Exactly.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.300
You've got this idea of keys and stuff like that.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.900
But it mostly lines up and it doesn't quite line up.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.540
It's a fantastic theme.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:33.100
Let me give some foundation for that again.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.300
I don't know if you were finished with your remark.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.460
Well, there's this kind of inherent divide between them.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:45.700
You can either go one way towards this sort of pure world of sound which happens to actually

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:49.940
be like what we natively sing in and it has…

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:52.100
There's sort of so many things to say about it.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:56.660
I'm not sure where to start exactly, but it's always built off of a fundamental frequency

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:02.620
which is kind of like your unit of time whereas in equal temperament, which is, for instance,

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:08.580
where the piano example came from, everything is slightly out of tune so it is to make it

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:09.580
work.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.580
And they're pretty close.

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:14.460
So it mostly works, but there is kind of like this fundamental problem.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:19.060
I actually want to shift a little bit.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.100
Typically important just one minute.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.740
We can always get back to it during the question and answer period.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.580
We haven't had a chance to hear a little bit more about your acoustical research and

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.980
I thought it was a very important dimension to bring in to…

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.420
My parochial interest.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.460
But I think there is a…

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.940
Despite the chatter, so to speak, there is a common…

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:47.980
I think we can all agree that there's a whole spectrum from all the way from very culturally

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:54.700
conditioned perception of sound that we call music, we can change across time, as you said,

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.180
across cultures.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180
But there's also some…

01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.180
I think also…

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.860
I think what you're saying has…

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.860
I agree with a good part of it.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:08.020
There's some fundamental built in perception of music that has to do with our evolution

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020
most likely.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020
So the whole spectrum…

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:13.380
I don't find that shocking at all.

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:19.100
I do think that taking out of context, many music can be a boring.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.620
It can be…

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.580
If you take popular music of one culture, put it in another, even today, despite the internet,

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:32.940
it can elicit at least boredom, if not revolt in some cases.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.940
So that's definitely…

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.940
But I don't think…

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:37.340
I don't see anything shocking about it.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:41.900
Also, I added the fact that it's not particularly good communicating ideas.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.780
It doesn't mean it cannot communicate ideas.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.380
Stravinsky went to extremes that it can't.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.380
It's incapable.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.020
But I don't think it's the best way if you want to write an op-ed to write it in a sonata

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020
form.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.660
It's better to write.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.300
You know, so…

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.300
So I think we all…

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.300
Despite…

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:58.780
I think we all covering different same ground at the end.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:04.660
But I'd like to ask another question that maybe changed the perception of the discussion

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:09.140
a little bit in your own realm as musicians.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:17.740
What you find lacking in terms of tools, so to speak, not tools I'm talking about,

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.660
but what is it that you would like to be able to do that you can do now?

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:24.220
Is there anything you reach…

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:26.260
I mean, of course, you're all accomplished musicians.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:30.340
And I've actually, this morning, I said in bed, listened to all of you.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.340
And it was remarkable.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.020
The variety in tremendous spectrum.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:40.980
But as musicians, do you feel that there is an exploratory part of what you do, aside

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:45.340
from performance, that you're reaching for something that hasn't been done or you want

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.340
to do?

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:49.180
If it is so, what is it?

01:15:49.180 --> 01:16:00.660
Well, I could say as an improviser that we're always…

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:05.100
You know, kind of make it our business to reach for the unknown.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:13.100
I mean, that's like the name of the game.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:22.060
You know, you get…or in other words, what really transforms and what really communicates

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:28.220
is in that moment, in the improvisative moment.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:38.740
Somebody or a group of people on the edge of what they know, on the edge of what their

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:46.220
masters at, where you find it maybe almost breaking apart to this space where you're

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.780
not even sure if it's music anymore, where you're right on that boundary.

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:58.220
And that to me, that vulnerable place is the most rewarding aspect of music.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.140
I mean, I experienced it last night.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.100
I really didn't know what was happening, but I knew that we were all experiencing it

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.100
together.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:07.900
I mean, everybody in the room.

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:15.780
And that is to me…so I guess I'm not really saying like, what don't I have?

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.220
Because I am very fortunate to get to say I had that experience last night.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.340
Which is an atmosphere that you are reaching for.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:26.700
So you're reaching that moment in the improvisation where you are almost untethered from everything

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.620
you've heard before and you're experiencing something new.

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:30.620
Well, yeah.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.340
You know, for me it's terrifying to be pianist like you.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:35.900
I mean, for me, if I was a pianist like you were sitting on piano, I'm thinking of

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.900
Thelonious Monk.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:41.460
I'm thinking of, you know, every great jazz pianist before me and I'll be terrified

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:45.260
that I'm…what am I going to…what am I going to go from there?

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.940
Except every good musician's performance without this fear.

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:53.740
And you said you do so by pushing yourself to an edge and I'm trying to get a feeling

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.260
to what that edge is about.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.740
So what happens there when you get to that point?

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:04.580
You know, the thing is that we've all been…we've all been there.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.460
I mean, we're all improvisers.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.580
I mean, in the same way that we can debate until the cows come home if they ever do.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.460
I don't know if people stay there anymore.

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:19.420
But what music is, we can also have a similar conversation about what improvisation is.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:25.020
And the more you examine that concept, it also kind of melts away in the sense that, well,

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:28.860
everything we do is improvised, except the things that aren't.

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:34.100
And that stuff we know, like, well, oh, they all did the same thing at the same time, so

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.860
they probably weren't improvising.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.020
Like they must have…how do they know how to do that?

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.340
You know, or they…you know, but even that is an illusion that can be, you know, like

01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:48.820
dancers use this…they do this…there's an improvisational dance technique called

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:54.740
flocking, where, you know, if you just follow the person in front of you and I started doing

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:58.860
this, then we all started doing this and suddenly it looks choreographed, you know?

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:06.100
So that kind of thing of like the fact that we can just in the spur of the moment do something

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.100
in sync or in unison.

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.100
It's in a residence.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.100
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:16.180
So, you know, so another…what I was going to say is that improvisation is something

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:22.500
we're born doing in the sense that we're…you know, it's how we explore the world, it's

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:27.740
how we come to learn about our environments, it's how we learn to do everything, it's

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.860
how we learn to talk, how we learn to eat.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:36.220
You know, I mean, very…how we're willing to walk is by a lot of stumbling around and

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.820
eventually finding a path, you know?

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:44.100
And that's really, to me, we're always doing that.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.740
So that's a very primal experience.

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:51.740
And so experiencing that in the course of performance, where, you know, you develop all

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:56.460
this mastery at these different instruments and stuff, but then you also take yourself

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:10.780
to this point where this…the sort of ideas side or the kind of intellectual side or

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:18.740
the deliberate side of you, like the stuff that the part of you that plans what to do

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:23.980
next and when to do it and how to do it, that seems to become relaxed.

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:30.020
It's almost like being drunk, actually, when you just make a lot of bad…bad decisions.

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:37.140
But sort of like having no…well, Charles Lim, you guys may know about his work, he

01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.940
did MRIs, FMRI's of people improvising, which is a very strange thing.

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:48.220
I mean, they were lying down on their backs with a keyboard strapped to them.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:52.660
And he had that one control condition where they played a memorized piece, another controlled

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:58.820
another condition, the test trial where they were asked to improvise on a blues or something

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.940
like that, on a keyboard.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:15.220
So then he found that certain cognitive functions are relaxed, like the self-guiding kind of

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:22.300
the self-consciousness is basically relaxed, and then you find yourself just acting.

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.420
So when there's a sort of unity of thought and action, I guess that's sort of the

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.660
thing that to me is kind of like…I guess it's also been described as a flow state

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:33.620
and that kind of thing.

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:43.060
I wonder if that pursuit of that moment and improvisation, that sort of threshold, to

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:49.300
me I see that as the pursuit of the live experience, like the total live-ness, like being in

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.140
the moment where the future is in the future and the past is in the past and you're sort

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.020
of like right there between them.

01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:03.660
And I 100% agree with you in the improvisational context, but I think that that actually is

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.580
part of all of our experience, even if we're playing a piece of music that we've rehearsed

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:14.980
a thousand times, like there's still no certainty that the next moment will be what was planned

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.020
or it will be something different.

01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:20.900
And that is a fundamental bit of difference between the live experience and the recorded

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.060
experience.

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:30.340
And going back to the word body in the title, I think that the sort of live experience is

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:35.580
the presence of our body in this space, listening to someone play music and not necessarily

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:41.220
knowing what's next, which is so fundamentally different than listening to a recording.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:46.420
And it's true your CD player might die the next moment or things might interrupt the

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:54.060
listening experience, but the expectation, the sort of like state of listening to a recording

01:22:54.060 --> 01:23:00.100
is one of listening to something that's already been like set in a record, in a recorded

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.820
form, in like a archived form.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.500
And that doesn't afford this uncertainty.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.500
Right.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.980
Still an important pleasure.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:09.980
Of course.

01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:10.980
Yes, sure.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:17.900
I mean, I recently found on YouTube a little solo of Johnny Hodges playing all of me and

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.700
I played 25 times in a row.

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:24.580
And then I found somebody who plays you that I am on YouTube who actually reproduced the

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.940
solo on guitar, note per note.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.180
The sound of Baku's sound was exactly the same.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.180
So even something...

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.180
I think I know her.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.180
You know...

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.180
I think it's a he or she.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.180
I know her.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.180
I think.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:36.180
I think.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:37.740
Jack of Turban is the name of the guitar.

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:43.900
But the point is even something as ossified or as frozen as a recording done in 1954 in

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.860
Switzerland, which was the case, can be in quite a source of pleasure.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.020
But I'm curious to ask you this question.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:53.460
On the other end of improvisation, which is when something is superscripted, even to

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:54.900
the point of taking the human out.

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.740
Now John Cage tried exactly to do that.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:01.340
He took the I chain and tried to take the human completely out.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.060
And even the duration of the notes, the picture of the notes, everything was prescribed by

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:08.060
dice and he obtained a composition.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:11.220
Of course, when you play it, you have all these uncertainties that you're talking about.

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:16.820
But how can you then explain, should the opposite end of the spectrum from your improvisation?

01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:18.300
That's really interesting.

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:23.340
How do you explain the musicality of such a thing as a musician?

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.940
Because there is an intention.

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.900
Before doing it, there is an intention of why I'm doing this.

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.220
And where is my internal setting?

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.780
And that's going to affect completely.

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:38.020
The music, but most of all, the tone and the resonance of what I'm doing.

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:43.020
So sometimes you can have the tone and we have the same tone or the same solo.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:47.180
But what is going to make that experience being different for you that I listen to and for

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.580
me that I'm playing that, the intention of the player?

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:53.100
That's going to shift everything.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.820
So it doesn't matter if it's improvisation or if it's like abstract music.

01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.820
What is this?

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.060
For me, sound is a container.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.980
Or music is a container.

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:02.980
A bakeable.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:07.220
But you put your intention there and then sounds travel and it's going to hit you.

01:25:07.220 --> 01:25:09.380
And what is going to hit you is not even the sound.

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:13.300
It's going to hit you the intention, which is information.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.500
So maybe it does a language you were referring before.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.500
Well information is not ideas.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.060
Ideas are emotions.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:28.220
Yeah, I mean, a lot of contemporary composition and I guess people who call them, I mean,

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.220
I'm also a composer.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.780
So I'll put myself in this category.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:36.700
But people who call themselves composers, they're in the business of scripting actions

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:44.820
for musicians, for performers to then perform and become the vessel for the composer's intention

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.980
or will or something like that.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:53.540
But what I find is so a friend of mine, Steve Schick, the first time I met him was about

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:54.540
20 years ago.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:57.100
He was performing this piece called Bone Alphabet.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.220
You know this piece by Vinko Global Car?

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:06.420
It's like what you were talking about but it's worse in the sense that it's extremely

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.940
intricate polyrhythms, you know, 7 over 11 over 13, stuff like that.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.820
Every bar is different.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.900
He said he had to learn one measure a day for about five weeks.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.900
That was all he did.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.500
Was put himself through his thing.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:29.020
And it was like in the end though, when I saw him perform it, it wasn't about the composer.

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.580
It was actually about him.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:35.780
It's sort of like you're saying in the sense that he so fully embodied this piece to the

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.300
point that he owned it.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.900
I mean it was his.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:48.460
And the way he described it was that when he is really popping, when it's really popping,

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.020
when it's really together, there's this flow that he described as like yoga.

01:26:54.020 --> 01:27:01.540
Which is what yoga means is, I mean the word literally means yoke in that sense of tie

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.820
together and it means tying together the mind and the body.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:09.180
That's basically what the meaning of that is.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:12.660
So basically what he meant is that he feels connected.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.860
This is really about the body.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:22.220
This is really interesting because another title of the discussion about embodied connection.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:29.740
So what I want to be united with yoga, that's the meaning of yoga, to be united in body

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:30.740
and mind.

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:36.300
I mean the experience of as a performer is like how I can achieve my best performance

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:42.740
and also in sync and jumping to the unknown with certainty that I'm going to be safe is

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.660
relying on the body.

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:48.900
It's really getting out of my mind of what should be played now.

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.900
What is the next part?

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:55.700
How this should sound is like my intention is to jump and to jump with you and meet you

01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.580
there and I don't know what is going to happen.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:02.140
But you know what happened when the performers, even in a composition, we create from that

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:08.140
place the audience jump with you because they really experience that it's a jump, jumping

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.740
into the unknown.

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:16.620
And when that synchronicity happens with the members of the ensemble, is this amazing

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:23.460
feeling of unison and unity with something else that aligns your body and your mind and

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:27.060
aligns the body and the mind of all the performance.

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:32.980
And what happened next for me is the important thing because what I want to achieve is after

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:36.340
the moment is silence.

01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:42.260
So what I want to promote you know with the music is silence because silence is stillness.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:48.660
After all this movement that sound and music has provoking you for you to organize and

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:52.380
change in your molecular level, your psychology.

01:28:52.380 --> 01:29:00.380
But just silence is that space when we can really finally be different and reinvented

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.740
and created again.

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:07.140
And on that note, we're going to open things up to the audience members.

01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:13.540
I would encourage you to state your name and please put your comments in the form of a

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:16.300
question for the participants.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.940
You can line up and use the microphone there.

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:27.940
Don't be shy.

01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:41.100
Thank you.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:43.020
Is this on?

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.820
Thank you so much for your comments and all of this.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:49.100
I'd just like to, I've been tangling with these same questions for a lifetime.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:53.900
And it finally occurred to me reading here and there that music fundamentally you know

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:58.820
is emotion experienced and expressed in a different way, a safe way.

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:02.700
When you hear that, I'm just wondering how you respond and people like Alice Miller,

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:07.540
the drama, the gifted child for your own good, she said emotion attaches meaning to experience.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:10.140
You can't take anything you've learned, studied or read.

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.620
It will not make sense unless you attach an emotion to it.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.740
And so music on two levels, I'd just like to say real fast, Orpheus, when he played

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:24.180
his lute 2500 years ago, Prometheus stopped having his livid torn out, Tandalus got out

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:29.980
of the river and stopped with the low hanging fruit and sisyphus on his stone and all the

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.540
spirits and Hades just stopped their torment and torture.

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.260
And we also have a career to be hearing it.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:42.660
How many thousands of young people have died hearing the drum and the trumpets in military

01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.860
expressions for thousands of years?

01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:51.940
So this whole thing about emotion being expressed safely through music but very little understanding.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:56.900
And in India, they say, resonance produces light.

01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.140
We live in it.

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:05.020
I would just love to hear any of your reactions to the connection between emotion learning

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:06.020
and music.

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:07.020
Thank you.

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.860
You know, there's a French economist named Jacques Atali, did you ever read his book

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:13.860
Noise?

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:18.060
It's from the 70s, it's called Noise, the Political Economy of Music.

01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:22.620
It's really a landmark book.

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:27.260
And he basically talks about the history of Western music but as an economist.

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:35.060
So it's actually about like more social questions basically about why this sort of thing might

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.340
have come about.

01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:45.260
And one thing he said was that in the beginning when society started to organize in ways that

01:31:45.260 --> 01:32:02.220
had music that represented a ritual of control to combat the prevailing sense of chaos in

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:03.460
the world around us.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.900
You know, the sense of complete unpredictability.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:15.460
There's a way where we can control ourselves, control each other and work together, do something

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.740
that is organized.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:22.740
It may have been the first organized thing that humans ever did.

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:27.820
And it's a way of staving off that basically the fear of the unknown, the fear of death,

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:34.260
the fear of predators or the fear of whatever might befall us in the next moment.

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:37.740
So it becomes this ritual of safety.

01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:38.740
You know.

01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:46.580
Yeah, I think especially the fear of unknown because historically music, we didn't touch

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:55.740
on religion but historically until now to a large extent, music was enshrined in religion.

01:32:55.740 --> 01:33:01.620
The secular aspect of music was until recently was a minority so it was because it was a

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:02.820
narrative rarely.

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:08.780
So the fear of the unknown, which is to my opinion as a non-religious person who respects

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:11.740
religion, is central to religion.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:20.020
And I think in that same vein I explain the centrality of music as an experience.

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.340
It's a spiritual way of dealing with the unknown.

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:28.820
And this is the best way to express religion, religious thought, one of the best.

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:33.020
And the central way of expressing religious thought has been through music.

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.340
And emotional component of music.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:39.740
Both speech and music came from vocal production.

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:43.380
When we talk we always give emotional color.

01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:51.500
If we start talking about emotional input, the speech would become very boring, mechanistic.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:58.740
So at some point in human evolution, the first signaling system, the expression of pleasure,

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:07.220
of pride, beforcated on symbolic representation, language, and music, the melodic component

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:12.900
of the first signaling system became used for emotional expressiveness.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.380
Yeah.

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:25.900
And in the model of triune brain by Paul McLean, which is a model which was developed by

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:34.340
Yac Bunksepp, the first layer is our reflexive reactions to the world.

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:42.740
The next layer is our emotional understanding of our reactions to the world.

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:46.220
And next level is thinking about thought.

01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:53.820
And it's clear today that there is no clinically healthy thinking without emotional impact.

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:58.740
So this is what music carries on, it's emotional communication.

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:05.900
And it does it in a very simple way, available for everybody, but still is able to deliver

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.140
stunningly complex messages.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:11.140
I'm also saying this difference between life and death.

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:19.060
There's always, I think, we see rituals around the world, there's always music.

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:25.340
And why? Because music supports that process in funerals.

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:31.180
In, for example, in India, in the nursing homes, during the process of dying, you're going

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:37.820
to be surprised because about culture, which kind of music they put for when people are

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:40.020
dying, they are not using hard melodies.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.780
There are a lot of percussive, percussive sound, really intense.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.620
Do you maybe believe that?

01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:50.540
Because we will see that emotionally we want this kind of harp and yalic sound.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.100
They use a lot of percussion, maybe because rhythm carries, they believe that rhythm carries

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.380
the soul and can go there.

01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.380
And also, you know what?

01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:07.100
Being in Mexico also in some rituals and funerary rituals, when music is not just for the soul

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:13.100
that is traveling, it's also for the family that is around to be able to handle pain,

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:18.300
music we can rely on that structure that is provided through rhythm, basically, and sometimes

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:23.860
through melody to really release and balance our emotions.

01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:30.900
And of course, if we go around the world, all the prayers, which is to connect to the

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:35.700
unknown, to really communicate, are based with melodies.

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.060
As always, we always just devoise praying, you know?

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:44.460
So for me, it's really, really important that why we look a little bit back, look for

01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:47.100
traditions and rituals and see how they've been using music.

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.660
Because it's really basic.

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:54.020
Melodies, for me, has been the prayers, how the internal being, the psychology of the

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:59.620
spirit, communicates with the transcendental and rhythm promotes dance and dance of the

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620
community.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:04.900
And that's how with that tools, we can really balance our emotions and go through daily

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:09.620
life, being able to go through the challenges because there are challenges.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:17.740
And now in our ages, for me, sometimes tension is really good because tension matches the

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.300
tension of the soul.

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.820
So if I'm tense, I don't want to listen really like music.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.940
I want, I love to listen a lot of jazz, I want to compose a lot of tension because that is

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:29.700
going to match my emotion.

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.940
And you know what music does?

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:36.380
And you match that emotion without judgment and you are with that naturally, with that

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:42.220
tension, what music does is going to come to a flow to a new balance, which maybe is

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:43.380
released.

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.180
But sometimes balance is tension.

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:51.900
Well, these ideas are also very consonant with the experience of the infant in the kind

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:55.980
of call response with the mother's voice, that the mother's rhythmic touching and the

01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:02.980
intonations of the mother's voice also helps control, organize and provide a sense of safety

01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:07.420
for the infant to organize the infant's incoy experiences.

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:14.380
So it's all very, I think, resonant with the earliest experiences of the individual.

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.380
Any questions?

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:19.540
I'm Christine Haderpoutus.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.900
I'm an English PhD student at CUNY.

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:27.220
And thank you so much for this amazing talk.

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:31.460
And in the interest of call and response, I'm really interested in music as a conversation

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:36.780
and when you had mentioned silence, I'm really excited because I'm interested in this idea

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:43.500
of regulation of breath and how in a conversation there's this desire or intention for a response

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:49.540
and this like holding a breath to listen to the other side and this difference between

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:56.260
listening and hearing and spirit and breath have an etymological history.

01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:03.460
And I was wondering if you could talk since you were talking about time, how spirituality,

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.900
transcendentalism, religion affects music.

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:11.380
For example, the difference between someone who believes in an afterlife and someone who

01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:14.580
doesn't, whose time operates differently.

01:39:14.580 --> 01:39:21.740
If time is a construct and music is social or socially constituted, then how does our

01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:25.700
perception of time affect music?

01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:35.740
I mean, it really does really just, Christine is like when we create a cycle of measure,

01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.620
that is going to affect completely the breath.

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:43.140
So that is going to completely affect you the experience of the music.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:47.260
So for example, if I have a pulse, I used to compose rhythm with my fingers.

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:54.540
So it's really different if I count in five, one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three,

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:57.260
four, five, one, two, three, four.

01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:11.340
I'm creating a cycle and you start breathing with me.

01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:15.380
But if I do six, one, two, three, four, five, six.

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:30.860
You see that it's completely different and everything relates in how I'm with cycle I'm

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:38.200
creating and that is going to completely guide you into a breath and that breath into melody

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:45.300
or harmonic rhythm if you are creating church, does that make sense?

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:53.860
I guess I'm going to, in my experience in performance, you know, playing in rooms full

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:59.620
of people, you know, where we can all hear each other.

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.540
And in particular, we can hear each other breathing.

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:12.460
I mean, as we actually can hear, if we really listen, and you know, what I've found is my

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:24.060
best sense of whether, you know, I make it as a performer, my job to make sure I somehow

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:28.300
reach everybody in the room, you know.

01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:33.340
And if I don't do that, I can tell, like I can tell when that's not happening and I

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.500
can hear it, you know.

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:40.180
And there are moments that I've experienced where you actually hear everybody breathe

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.700
together.

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:48.060
Like really everybody takes a breath for the same moment because music brought them to

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.060
that.

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:59.540
Because it's somehow, it's helping us synchronize our internal actions to that point, you know.

01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:05.940
So that to me is, I mean, when we talk about spirituality, it seems like we're starting

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:12.460
from experiences like that, like this sort of sense of the stealth kind of expanding

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:20.780
to encompass others, you know, and suddenly we have this awareness of non-singularity.

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:33.340
And that to me is, anyway, that's how I'll answer you.

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:41.740
I think that time and I'm not sure I'm going to put this all together, but time and spirituality

01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:47.500
are related in the sense of either being contained or being open-ended.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:54.620
And that is maybe grounded in our experience or grounded outside of our experience.

01:42:54.620 --> 01:43:01.820
And I work a lot with electronics and my music and I program these very basic microchips

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:08.060
to synthesize sound and they play alongside an ensemble.

01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:09.660
And so there's a communication thing there.

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:17.580
But in one piece of mine, I have the music eventually settle into a chord.

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.180
And it's sort of a musical event.

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.900
You get to this chord that's slower and slower.

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:26.580
And then that chord is programmed to play forever.

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:31.420
Of course things like the battery run out or maybe, you know, it gets destroyed or something.

01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:36.140
So there are, you know, laws of entropy prevent it from being, from playing forever.

01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:39.340
But nonetheless, the gesture is towards infinity.

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:43.060
And that's, I think, more like a mathematical gesture.

01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:45.900
And I think I'm bringing maybe too many ideas here.

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:50.300
But computation is sort of this embodiment of mathematics.

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.580
It's sort of like mathematics in the real world.

01:43:53.580 --> 01:44:02.140
And through computation or even a simple instruction like play this note forever, you kind of gesture

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.140
towards the infinite.

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:06.740
Whether or not you can actually attain it.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:10.380
And I think that that gesture is a gesture towards something larger than us.

01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:16.100
In fact, it's a gesture towards something larger than the universe probably, we don't

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:17.100
know.

01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:21.100
And to me, that's maybe as close as it comes.

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:26.380
Yeah, you're pointing out the metaphorical power of music, which I think is, we haven't

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.380
touched on.

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:30.980
You mentioned something about silence.

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.700
In some music traditions, silence is very important.

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.700
In some other, for example, in Arabic and traditional, Arabic music, traditional Japanese

01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:40.460
music, silence can be integral part of a piece.

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:45.140
While in Gaelic music, if you listen to Scottish Batpipes, there's a drone going on all the

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.740
time, you're never going to stop.

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.940
They show you that there's a flow.

01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:56.100
Both operate metaphorical, I think, arrows, so to speak, the point to breath, maybe to

01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:02.940
the salvation, to security, and the operator may be on a very mechanistic level, but we

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:04.460
find him very aesthetically pleasing.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:08.540
If you listen to a drone going on, the same thing with the continuum in Baroque music,

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.460
it has a function of giving you sustenance.

01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:16.580
While note that stops can give you, you know, eerie feeling.

01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:23.980
If you go to Krakow, there is a bell tower, and every one hour there's a trumpet that

01:45:23.980 --> 01:45:24.980
plays.

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:31.580
It plays this haunting, beautiful trumpet theme, and suddenly stops.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:34.900
Every hour of the day, forever.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:45.660
Since the guy who played it was one time during the invasion at some point in the 14th century,

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:49.980
I think of Poland, who was shot by an arrow in the middle of his tone.

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.140
So to commemorate that act, there is that tone every day for one hour, and it doesn't

01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.180
matter how many times you hear it.

01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:59.820
The sudden stop of that tone invokes, you know, loss.

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:05.260
So the metaphorical arrow towards loss that plays on a fundamental level, I think, is

01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.260
very powerful part of music.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:13.060
Ian, I'm going to give you the last question.

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:17.820
And before you get to it, I'm going to ask, maybe not show, there are some things you

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:20.860
haven't used yet, but we'll do that after the question.

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:24.980
And I thought it would be a nice way to end the round table to maybe invoke a kind of

01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:31.060
communal experience with Ian Buckingham.

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:37.940
Maybe appropriate in this setting to recall that Sigmund Freud was famously non-musical.

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:43.300
And this is attributed to various things, including particularly perhaps that he couldn't

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:49.260
stand the sound of his younger sister practicing on the piano.

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:57.260
But I think this may illustrate for us is that music, obviously, is culturally determined,

01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:04.420
but also psychologically determined, determined by individual and group psychology.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:12.740
And I think perhaps it ties in with what a number of speakers have said, that crucial

01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:20.300
aspect of music is conveying of meaning by sound, has to do with meaning.

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:27.220
So I'd be interested in the views of the panel on that.

01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:37.540
It seems that the music is the most effective instrument of transfer of their complex information

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:42.540
in a very simple way, because of the main morphological principle, perceived tension.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:46.260
And it's so primitive, so simple.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:56.340
This is how music reaches children with autism, people with very bad Alzheimer, basically

01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:04.580
gives them some kind of sanity for a period of time, helps somehow people with Parkinson

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:09.700
don't to restore coordinated movement for a while.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:16.620
And somehow also music helps to restore speech and people with broken zafasia, immunologic

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:20.860
and tenetian therapy.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:28.820
It's a very strange way of communication, very, very powerful, that's true.

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:37.020
And it also seems a very powerful way of prophylaxis for the brain, cognitive prophylaxis.

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:45.580
You know that children who are trained in music, they gain a few IQ points.

01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:49.660
They basically relate to short-term memory, which shows.

01:48:49.660 --> 01:49:02.420
Verbal included on numbers recall, but now recent studies show that music training helps

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:05.420
people in their 60s, 70s, even 80s.

01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:16.980
Even if people start musical training in you at the material age, starting musical instrument,

01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:22.300
gives them cognitive advantage, creates each compensatory mechanisms.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.220
And it happens most likely because of multi-sensory integration.

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:34.340
When people look into notation and find, write notes and listen and predict melodic future,

01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:36.460
it activates different parts of the brain.

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:42.180
And this multi-sensory integration basically helps brain to stay in better cognitive health

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.540
for longer time.

01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:49.780
I'll take this opportunity being in a house of psychoanalysis to an apropos of Freud to

01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:57.380
suggest that embodied cognitive science is really rediscovering and expanding Freud's

01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:58.380
initial insights.

01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:04.820
And when he said that the first ego is the body ego, that as analysts, we're always

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:09.780
listening for the metaphorical representations of the body in the earliest experience and

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:15.460
how this maps emotional connections to objects.

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.460
Yes.

01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:19.860
And you see the respond to music.

01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.660
It's not intellectual response.

01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:24.220
We also can have intellectual response.

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:29.100
For example, if you listen to some incredible, some fugue by Bach, and if you know it very

01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:33.500
well, you can follow each voice and enjoy melodic transformation.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:40.260
But in general, what music gives us, it's visceral pleasure and music affects our breathing,

01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:48.100
our heartbeat, our hormonal system, electroconductivity of skin, gives us pill direction, the shivers.

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.620
So it affects us so directly.

01:50:50.620 --> 01:50:54.380
And it gives us the sense of living through life again.

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:56.380
And it stays the way.

01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:59.820
So natural for something else to demonstrate.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:05.500
And I have to create some sound with you.

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.780
We're talking about two hours.

01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:10.100
I really thank you for giving me the opportunity.

01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:13.460
May I just say, natural gifts tonight are the concept.

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:20.140
Well, it's just like a little flamenco show up with this.

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.980
So I want to just have a little experience.

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:29.500
Why I want to welcome you, if you want, is to, you want to close your eyes and just put

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:34.460
your hands like that.

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.380
Exactly.

01:51:36.380 --> 01:52:06.220
And just try just to perceive with your hands.

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:13.380
Thank you.

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:22.740
All of our participants today.

01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:31.900
Thank you all.

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:38.900
Thank you, everybody.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:45.900
I felt we needed something to bring us all together.

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:50.900
And that was just beautiful.

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:53.900
Oh, yeah.

01:55:53.900 --> 01:56:03.900
Thank you.
