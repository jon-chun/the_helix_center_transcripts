Hi, I'm Edward Narcissian. I'm the director of the Center.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.400
Before we get on with today's program, I'd like to announce the next program which is

00:11.400 --> 00:22.040
on April 22nd. And the subject, the title of that program is Design in Nature. It is

00:22.040 --> 00:30.360
inspired by a quote from Leonardo da Vinci who said that though human ingenuity may make

00:30.360 --> 00:37.440
various inventions, it will never devise any inventions more beautiful, nor more simple,

00:37.440 --> 00:43.560
nor more to the purpose than nature does. Because in her inventions, nothing is wanting

00:43.560 --> 00:52.080
and nothing is superfluous. Our round table is called Design in Nature. And Andre Bajan,

00:52.080 --> 00:58.560
who is a professor who has invented modern thermodynamics and the construction law of

00:58.560 --> 01:06.160
design and evolution in nature. Robin Collins, who is a philosopher. Caleb Scharf, who's

01:06.160 --> 01:12.000
been with us before, who's a cosmologist. And Mark Norell, who is a paleontologist,

01:12.000 --> 01:24.280
and at the museum. So about today, music to whose ears, music and healing, this is the

01:24.280 --> 01:30.560
third one in the series, Music to whose ears, and it's called Music and Healing. It was

01:30.560 --> 01:38.240
suggested to us by Marina Korsakova Krine, who is a professional pianist and scholar

01:38.240 --> 01:48.160
in music, perception and cognition. As I call your name, please indicate who you are.

01:48.160 --> 01:54.920

02:28.280 --> 02:43.840
Function. Thank you.

02:43.840 --> 03:04.160
Well, who's getting us started? Marina?

03:04.160 --> 03:13.200
I think we should start the round table with questions to practitioners. To people who

03:13.200 --> 03:21.920
practice music therapy, and you have two practitioners, actually three practitioners. Andrea Norton,

03:21.920 --> 03:27.680
she does amazing studies with people who suffer a phasor due to stroke. She practices music

03:27.680 --> 03:35.600
neurologic therapy and helps people to restore their speech. And Concheta Tomeno, she works

03:35.600 --> 03:45.760
with elderly people. She's an amazing researcher and thinker. I have tremendous respect to

03:45.760 --> 03:55.200
her writings and her conversations. And Mr. Rossetti, he works at the Mount Sinai Hospital

03:55.200 --> 04:02.560
with various patients, including Primus. So he has important experience to share with us.

04:02.560 --> 04:09.400
21 started with the healing part. Yes. Okay.

04:09.400 --> 04:14.320
In my work, I've been in the field of music therapy as a professional music therapist

04:14.320 --> 04:22.080
since the late 70s. And was introduced to the power of music to affect people, especially

04:22.080 --> 04:28.000
in recovery of function, or at least maintenance of function for people with neurologic diseases.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.800
And it was obvious back then that there was something about music the way music could

04:32.800 --> 04:38.600
arise and stimulate function and people who seemed to have lost function in such a way

04:38.600 --> 04:44.760
that I really felt needed to be studied. And we know most people know how much music can

04:44.760 --> 04:50.000
help them individually. And what we've been interested in as therapists is how can music

04:50.000 --> 04:55.440
be used specifically to really help people not only maintain function, but to bring it

04:55.440 --> 05:00.760
back if they've lost it. So people who've had strokes and can't speak or people who

05:00.760 --> 05:06.680
have Parkinson's disease and can't walk. But they can do these things specifically with

05:06.680 --> 05:12.240
music because of the way the patterns of sound, aroused and stimulate specific areas in the

05:12.240 --> 05:16.840
brain into function where that person can't draw upon that by themselves. That's really

05:16.840 --> 05:21.920
been the impetus for my work for the past almost 40 years.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.360
And Connie, when you started, it really wasn't much.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.000
Not in the near-neck.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.080
The field of music therapy was established in the United States in the 1950s as a profession,

05:34.080 --> 05:40.720
as an academic training program. I started actually initially working with seniors in

05:40.720 --> 05:45.840
the nursing home within stage dementia. But my background before that was as a pre-med

05:45.840 --> 05:51.800
biology student. So although I was trained at NYU and most of my training was in psychotherapy

05:51.800 --> 05:58.280
and the psychotherapeutic aspects of music therapy, when I saw people who supposedly

05:58.280 --> 06:03.720
weren't able to recognize anything in the world around them, people with end stage dementia,

06:03.720 --> 06:09.480
respond to a familiar song, I had asked the question, how does that happen? How does somebody

06:09.480 --> 06:16.200
who has no cognition or cognition that can't be measured by any other means recognize sound

06:16.200 --> 06:23.160
in the environment as music? How does their brain recognize that melody as an old familiar

06:23.160 --> 06:29.160
song? So that was 1978. And it was in 1980 that I happened to come to Bedebrim or all

06:29.160 --> 06:35.120
of his sex was working. And so for the past, up until his passing, we worked together trying

06:35.120 --> 06:40.880
to ask those questions. What is it about music that reaches us and helps us maintain function

06:40.880 --> 06:42.040
as much as possible?

06:42.040 --> 06:49.400
It is probably, I know we've talked about this before, and for Andrea as well, it has

06:49.400 --> 06:55.120
to be targeted to the individual. You can't just say music. And I think Bach is great

06:55.120 --> 07:00.600
music. But if I play it for you and you have no reason to respond to it, you won't respond.

07:00.600 --> 07:07.240
Right. Well, there's some universals in the sense that auditory timing can be purely

07:07.240 --> 07:15.120
stimulated. The motor response to rhythm can be purely produced by an auditory signal of

07:15.120 --> 07:20.440
a certain beat. Most of us perceive rhythm the same way no matter which country we're

07:20.440 --> 07:26.000
from or how we've developed, some have developed more sensitivity to rhythm and complex beats

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
depending on their culture. But when it comes to actual music, melody and song, there's

07:32.000 --> 07:37.960
really no universal because how we all experience that music in our lifetime then changes our

07:37.960 --> 07:42.520
emotional response and our associations to that. So from the point of birth, or even

07:42.520 --> 07:48.680
before birth, because there's musical, some kind of rhythmic perception in utero, we start

07:48.680 --> 07:53.920
developing these very strong associations to music from the first time, first breath we

07:53.920 --> 08:02.400
take. And those then get encoded in neurologic responses that we can either call upon or

08:02.400 --> 08:07.400
whatever. But that's what really makes music unique to us in our own special way based

08:07.400 --> 08:11.840
on our life experience and associations. Can I follow up on this? I know very little

08:11.840 --> 08:18.000
about music therapy. I'm more on the basic, yeah, science side. So given this point about

08:18.000 --> 08:23.880
huge variability across people and what kind of things might drive them or get them around

08:23.880 --> 08:30.720
or housed or harmed. So how does it work in practice? So is it a kind of therapy where

08:30.720 --> 08:36.240
a patient plays a more active role so that they share information with you guys? Or is

08:36.240 --> 08:39.640
there like some period where you're trying to find out what it is that the patient might

08:39.640 --> 08:44.000
be most responsive to? Like how would a, if I come to you with a particular problem,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.960
how would the whole process of therapy work?

08:47.960 --> 08:55.800
So every patient that I work with that mostly in oncology, excuse me. The first thing we

08:55.800 --> 09:03.360
do is an assessment. And an assessment of course has to do with medical aspects, also

09:03.360 --> 09:09.720
has to do with psychosocial aspects, cultural aspects, we're looking for trauma, things

09:09.720 --> 09:20.200
like what might be a person's song of kin, significant music. What it seems that what

09:20.200 --> 09:25.920
the research is pointing towards is that what might be most effective, and I really don't

09:25.920 --> 09:34.400
think this is rocket science, is that it needs to be music that people like. So the I will

09:34.400 --> 09:42.320
be more effective in reaching clinical goals. It depends on what population you're working

09:42.320 --> 09:47.680
with in music therapy. For myself that means working mostly with cancer patients.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.480
And it also depends on what the goal, Andrew's right, and what the goals are. For people

09:52.480 --> 09:57.080
who are working psychotherapeutically, they could be a very active interaction with the

09:57.080 --> 10:03.080
client because you want to draw out some of the inhibitions, the hidden responses, and

10:03.080 --> 10:08.440
so how they play music maybe feels something about what they're going through. I work

10:08.440 --> 10:13.400
a lot with people with neurologic impairment. And in that case, it's actually knowing some

10:13.400 --> 10:17.720
of the structures of music and how music affects the brain. And that could be very prescriptive

10:17.720 --> 10:23.960
at times. Whereas a certain rhythm can drive motor function and somebody with Parkinson's

10:23.960 --> 10:28.440
disease, it doesn't matter whether they like the rhythm or not, it's going to cause this

10:28.440 --> 10:33.040
kind of motor entrainment. And the same thing with somebody who has a speech problem or

10:33.040 --> 10:40.560
aphasia being able to use the melodic contour of sound and the rhythmic structure of speech

10:40.560 --> 10:47.880
and music helps them therapeutically if that's used in a very directed way. So the field of

10:47.880 --> 10:51.680
music therapy is quite broad, depending on the background and the training, just like

10:51.680 --> 10:57.400
medicine. You know the field of medicine is as broad as the practitioner and the training.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.000
And so the field of music therapy is there broad as well.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.400
Is there like a clear ontology of the kinds of things that they do? Is there like a clear

11:06.400 --> 11:09.280
set of programs or is it just really heterogeneous?

11:09.280 --> 11:14.040
No, there's a standard of practice by the American Music Therapy Association that talks

11:14.040 --> 11:19.600
about the different populations and the range of training within those populations. So somebody's

11:19.600 --> 11:24.920
working psychotherapeutically and maybe analytical music therapy and maybe another type of music

11:24.920 --> 11:29.320
therapy. If somebody's working with people with neurologic diseases, it may be neurologic

11:29.320 --> 11:34.600
music therapy which is more prescriptive. And then there's more humanistic approaches

11:34.600 --> 11:41.520
too that's dynamic. And some therapy is very passive. It could be as simple as programming

11:41.520 --> 11:47.240
like music to help somebody relax but it's done with the music therapist's analysis and

11:47.240 --> 11:49.640
carry over their work.

11:49.640 --> 11:55.720
That's a good point. So I'm going to pick that up there. The thing about what sometimes

11:55.720 --> 12:00.280
it's called receptive music therapy or passive listening, things like that. That's sort of

12:00.280 --> 12:09.320
the lowest common denominator. But even so, there are situations where we cannot use live

12:09.320 --> 12:16.280
music which is what I think most people would agree seems to be most effective. So using

12:16.280 --> 12:22.240
prerecorded music is an option. For instance, in radiation oncology, there isn't a way for

12:22.240 --> 12:31.560
me to provide live music therapy during treatment. But I can prescribe music for patients to listen

12:31.560 --> 12:36.760
to. So the first thing would be an assessment of what the patients' needs are. So let's

12:36.760 --> 12:41.720
say you have someone who's very anxious. Well, first they would identify the type of music

12:41.720 --> 12:49.800
that they like to listen to. And then we would take music and music that they've identified

12:49.800 --> 12:56.800
and analyze it and then place it in a sequence to obtain a sedation effect.

12:56.800 --> 13:06.640
What are any effects are you aiming for as a sedation? I mean you talk about therapy.

13:06.640 --> 13:14.080
What are the symptoms if you will that you're tackling? That's a huge question.

13:14.080 --> 13:21.040
It is. So a good example, and Andrew, you could speak to it too, somebody who has a

13:21.040 --> 13:26.600
stroke for example and loses their speech. There's still the potential of that person

13:26.600 --> 13:33.120
recovering some form of communication by stimulating other networks in the brain that are still

13:33.120 --> 13:41.520
intact that still help with word retrieval and the prosody of speech but they're dominant

13:41.520 --> 13:46.520
in music-scented areas. So music is processed throughout the brain. It's not just a right

13:46.520 --> 13:53.160
left situation like the thought of in the past. Somebody who loses the ability to find

13:53.160 --> 13:57.400
words may have damage in the specific area in the left part of the brain but they still

13:57.400 --> 14:02.280
have the ability to use those words if it's in a certain structure and that structure

14:02.280 --> 14:07.920
tends to be musical in nature because that part of the brain is still intact. And so

14:07.920 --> 14:13.600
people like Andrea who do melodic intonation therapy treatments are using those structures

14:13.600 --> 14:20.160
in the musical way to help recover speech. So what we do is quite different from music

14:20.160 --> 14:27.200
therapy in that we're using music as an intervention in a clinical trial so everybody gets exactly

14:27.200 --> 14:34.560
the same intervention. And the people that we work with have had severe strokes. Many

14:34.560 --> 14:40.320
of them have lost as much as the entire left hemisphere of their brain and what's fascinating

14:40.320 --> 14:45.920
what fascinated me because I don't have a medical background or a music therapy background.

14:45.920 --> 14:53.840
I'm a choral musician and conductor and singer myself but came to this through music education

14:53.840 --> 15:02.000
research and seeing how music affected children's learning and then made this leap to clinical

15:02.000 --> 15:09.840
research with music. And the people that have these strokes that are so massive if you ask

15:09.840 --> 15:14.080
them to speak the words of happy birthday they can't do it. They can't get anything

15:14.080 --> 15:19.000
out at all. And if you ask them to sing the song you wouldn't know they'd had a stroke.

15:19.000 --> 15:26.760
It's a preserved function in their brain that melody. So melodic intonation therapy actually

15:26.760 --> 15:33.760
capitalizes on that preserved brain tissue. And so what we're looking at in a neuro imaging

15:33.760 --> 15:40.960
study and with behavioral testing before, during and after therapy is how does music change

15:40.960 --> 15:46.360
the brain over the course of treatment. So the people that we work with are people who

15:46.360 --> 15:51.960
are chronic patients. They've had a stroke at least a year ago. They've had lots of regular

15:51.960 --> 15:59.040
speech therapy but not music therapy and we find that they make huge improvements over

15:59.040 --> 16:05.600
the course of treatment. Now the treatment that we're able to give in this research setting

16:05.600 --> 16:11.160
is much more intensive than anybody's insurance will pay for. So it's really a luxury on our

16:11.160 --> 16:19.280
end that we get to see this progression of no speech at all to whatever people end up

16:19.280 --> 16:24.320
with in the end. And not surprisingly what people put into it is often what they get

16:24.320 --> 16:29.880
out of it. And those who practice more and use it more do better over time but there

16:29.880 --> 16:36.760
are all sorts of other factors that we see anecdotally things like family support and

16:36.760 --> 16:41.960
positive attitude that adds to this music effect. So I think there are more studies

16:41.960 --> 16:49.720
to be done afterward that will tease this out but it's fascinating to watch people be able

16:49.720 --> 16:56.000
to take this simple treatment which is no more than singing what you would speak. It's not

16:56.000 --> 17:00.640
about singing a song or listening to a song or what's your favorite music. It's about

17:00.640 --> 17:08.520
what do you want to say. So if I want to say hello nice to meet you. I'm so happy to be

17:08.520 --> 17:15.880
here today. You use the same basic pros that speech would have any syllable that would

17:15.880 --> 17:20.880
be accented in speech gets the higher note anything that's not accented gets the lower

17:20.880 --> 17:27.680
note so anybody can pick it up and it's a treatment that you can over time learn to

17:27.680 --> 17:35.040
do yourself. So I can say more about that but that's just one that's one small piece.

17:35.040 --> 17:40.440
Those of us who work with patients who have chronic pain there's some good scientific

17:40.440 --> 17:46.000
research that shows how there's a top down gating of the perception of pain if somebody's

17:46.000 --> 17:53.480
listening to music. There's also Isabelle Parrot's at Montreal is doing some research on that

17:53.480 --> 18:00.400
so we can gate the perception of pain if somebody's listening to pleasurable music. We can help

18:00.400 --> 18:09.840
with early childhood development for children to develop language. Children with autism

18:09.840 --> 18:14.920
doing some work with that too in the lab. Children who are pre-linguistic can learn

18:14.920 --> 18:20.560
the structures of communication through music even though they can't conceptualize what

18:20.560 --> 18:27.680
words are yet. So an idea of a happy sound or a sad sound they can start acquiring the

18:27.680 --> 18:32.920
building blocks of emotional language even though their brain can put together what words

18:32.920 --> 18:37.080
are. So all that comes through music. I mean it's one of the reasons why music is such

18:37.080 --> 18:42.960
a... We talk about it as a powerful tool. I don't mean that casually but it really is

18:42.960 --> 18:48.720
because it touches so much of it and a lot of it is neurologically based how our brains

18:48.720 --> 18:52.120
perceive sound and how we organize that perception.

18:52.120 --> 18:58.680
You know there's this old saying of music is the universal language which to me as always

18:58.680 --> 19:03.160
seemed like well speech is a universal language as well doesn't mean that just because I can

19:03.160 --> 19:08.080
speak I can understand somebody from Mongolia. You know there are different languages within

19:08.080 --> 19:14.120
speech and it seems like it's the same thing with music but do you know Tom Fritz at the

19:14.120 --> 19:19.040
Max Planck Institute in his studies with the MAFA people where he went into the Highlands

19:19.040 --> 19:26.600
of Cameroon to a group of people who had really no contact with Western culture, Western

19:26.600 --> 19:33.720
music and just showed them three pictures. A happy face, a sad face and a scared face

19:33.720 --> 19:39.320
and then played them music and found that the MAFA people who had never heard this music

19:39.320 --> 19:45.200
had never heard anything except their own regional folkloric music were consistently

19:45.200 --> 19:50.000
able to identify the happy pieces as happy, the sad pieces as sad, the scary pieces as

19:50.000 --> 19:55.600
scary by pointing at the appropriate face in front of them. He then took their music

19:55.600 --> 20:02.080
back to Germany and did the same test there and Germans who had never heard this music

20:02.080 --> 20:05.840
were able to consistently point to the happy face because it turned out all MAFA music

20:05.840 --> 20:11.040
is happy. It's just the way it worked.

20:11.040 --> 20:18.000
So I mean it seems like there's some kind of universality to music. I'm not ready to

20:18.000 --> 20:24.960
say it's a universal language but there are some kind of elements of it that seem to be.

20:24.960 --> 20:34.000
The idea that the rhythm of music is related to how we move. So a song that would sound

20:34.000 --> 20:42.200
depressing or melancholic would be very slow and tempo because when we're sad we move slowly.

20:42.200 --> 20:47.800
If it's very laborious in the way we move. If you're very happy, if you would play something

20:47.800 --> 20:55.040
very upbeat and fast rhythmically, the person might say that music is very happy.

20:55.040 --> 21:00.440
And so a lot of our music is related to how we as humans move and relate to the world.

21:00.440 --> 21:05.520
So that could be universal. But because some of us humans are also musicians

21:05.520 --> 21:12.520
and creative types and like to subvert expectations, you have things like Calypso which went

21:12.520 --> 21:19.920
Calypso formed as bouncy happy music and the message it was delivering was overthrow the

21:19.920 --> 21:26.800
white man, get him off our island, you know, resurrection, revolution, insurrection. You

21:26.800 --> 21:32.480
know, that was the message of that was being delivered in this very kind of jaunty, carefree

21:32.480 --> 21:35.040
music. So that's how they got away with it.

21:35.040 --> 21:41.160
A couple of different things going on here. I think what we were talking about before

21:41.160 --> 21:48.320
about associations, associative processes with music. All music creates associations.

21:48.320 --> 21:55.440
We could argue that music is metaphoric in nature. So I think part of what we're looking

21:55.440 --> 22:02.840
at is why I think that music is likely more culturally dependent than not is because we

22:02.840 --> 22:12.040
have our own set of cultural metaphors for things that might differ. So associative processes

22:12.040 --> 22:17.480
and metaphoric processes, why me have your last, your last statement because I lost my

22:17.480 --> 22:19.000
thread of thought here.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.760
About the reggae. I mean, about the Calypso. Oh yeah, yeah, just the tension between the

22:25.760 --> 22:28.920
message and the kind of the music that was delivering it.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.160
Right. So the multiple layers of...

22:31.160 --> 22:37.640
Thanks for doing that. So the other thing that I think comes up is how when we listen to music

22:37.640 --> 22:42.240
and we're looking at the emotional content of music, there are two different processes

22:42.240 --> 22:47.880
going on. One is how we perceive the music to be and the others are our response to it.

22:47.880 --> 22:52.960
So I can listen to a very sad piece of music and feel strangely uplifted. Right. Right.

22:52.960 --> 22:57.800
So perceived versus how we identify it. Sure.

22:57.800 --> 23:03.240
I think it's related to the fact that music is dealing with aesthetic emotions. They're

23:03.240 --> 23:09.880
just for basic emotions according to last classification. But aesthetic emotions, it's

23:09.880 --> 23:19.600
such a complex thing. And it just happens that music is able to talk, to deliver information

23:19.600 --> 23:25.720
that no other means of communication are able to deliver the same certainty and precision.

23:25.720 --> 23:32.760
And it's not my thought, it's the thought by Susan Langer, a wonderful American philosopher.

23:32.760 --> 23:39.400
So she compared linguistic language with music. And she wrote that music is more precise.

23:39.400 --> 23:48.080
Basically, it was your thought. And another very important idea about music, that music

23:48.080 --> 23:58.200
delivers, gives us the logic of emotion. When we follow the flow of music, we recreate intuitively

23:58.200 --> 24:09.040
emotion inside us, we live another life when we listen to music. And it's life we're abstract.

24:09.040 --> 24:15.360
It's very precise and same time we're abstract because there is no objects. There is no such

24:15.360 --> 24:20.240
precision as for example language has. We can take any language and translate to other

24:20.240 --> 24:25.560
languages. There is nothing to translate in music, as you can do it with pictures. But

24:25.560 --> 24:31.480
still music is so sufficient language. There is no cats, hats, houses. It's something that

24:31.480 --> 24:38.240
goes directly to our system. But how it goes directly, we still don't understand. Perhaps

24:38.240 --> 24:44.400
some understanding of the very fundamental things in music. And it's fun to learn them.

24:44.400 --> 24:51.280
Because at least there are some tangibles. But on the top of that, why music makes us cry?

24:51.280 --> 24:58.320
Why we have goosebumps? How music delivers important ideas? Philosophical ideas sometimes.

24:58.320 --> 25:05.720
We still don't understand that. But this is the most exciting thing about music. How it

25:05.720 --> 25:12.680
happens? Do you think it's different whether it's instrumental music or music with words?

25:12.680 --> 25:18.520
Because once you do add language to music, now you've really muddied the waters at that

25:18.520 --> 25:24.440
point. But it's not just music, it's already words. And as my friend told, sometimes better

25:24.440 --> 25:30.600
not to understand words for some songs. It's so beautiful. I would challenge the claim

25:30.600 --> 25:36.000
that music is more precise. I would challenge any musician to be able to express something

25:36.000 --> 25:42.000
like my husband thinks it's raining. There's a very limited set of messages that we can

25:42.000 --> 25:47.840
convey through music. And it's arguable how broad that range is. But certainly it's not

25:47.840 --> 25:53.760
the kind of rich communication system that we have through language which makes our species

25:53.760 --> 25:58.680
stand out for many other species in terms of the richness of meanings and the arbitrariness

25:58.680 --> 26:06.680
of meanings we can convey. So I think the precision scale is maybe not the right end to put language

26:06.680 --> 26:11.680
and music on, but rather the kinds of information that they convey.

26:11.680 --> 26:21.800
Absolutely agree. Because linguistic language, we have cognitive constants. The certainty,

26:21.800 --> 26:28.440
this absolute precision of delivering information in the words. Of course music has different

26:28.440 --> 26:34.760
precision and delivers just the most difficult things who we are. Our psychological states,

26:34.760 --> 26:39.680
our feelings that they difficult to express in words.

26:39.680 --> 26:47.000
So that's who. I mean, I don't know. That's a hypothesis, right? I mean, some people find

26:47.000 --> 26:51.400
it quite easy to express their feelings and words. I mean, I think that's that varies

26:51.400 --> 26:52.560
hugely across the world.

26:52.560 --> 26:58.320
We've seen many, perhaps too many examples of people who use words in very precise ways

26:58.320 --> 27:02.320
and are still misunderstood. Oh, that's really true. That's certainly true.

27:02.320 --> 27:08.960
And there are musicians like Meredith Monk, the great American composer and vocalist who,

27:08.960 --> 27:18.760
despite being a singer, almost never uses words because she feels like music can be very precise

27:18.760 --> 27:23.960
in getting to emotions that are, if you think of emotions not as little discrete packets

27:23.960 --> 27:31.560
of fear and joy and sorrow or whatever, but as a spectrum, as a continuum, that music can

27:31.560 --> 27:37.760
get to those gray areas that we feel emotionally that we don't have names for.

27:37.760 --> 27:44.280
The Brazilians talk about saldage. We don't really have a good American word for that.

27:44.280 --> 27:49.200
And nostalgia doesn't really come close. But Brazilians know it when they feel. We know

27:49.200 --> 27:56.240
it when we feel. We just don't have an English word for it. And music can kind of emotionally

27:56.240 --> 27:58.840
target those kind of areas that should...

27:58.840 --> 28:04.760
Sure. But music is certainly not the only thing, right? I mean, so so language is the

28:04.760 --> 28:09.280
system that we use to exchange thoughts with one another. I mean, that is our primary means

28:09.280 --> 28:12.880
of communication. But sure, you can express yourself through painting. You're going to

28:12.880 --> 28:18.680
express yourself through dance, through music. And one thing that I've been very interested

28:18.680 --> 28:25.920
in whenever I've thought about all of these strands of words that use music therapy is

28:25.920 --> 28:32.800
one, what aspects of music are driving? What are the shared mechanisms that, for example,

28:32.800 --> 28:38.200
help you either recover speech or become less depressed or tolerate pain better? And also

28:38.200 --> 28:42.960
how specific... And it's a related question. How specific is it to music? Right? And so

28:42.960 --> 28:48.360
given that... Because understanding how specific effects are is kind of key to understanding

28:48.360 --> 28:53.160
what the shared mechanisms might be. And some people have tried to kind of take different

28:53.160 --> 29:00.240
components of music therapy apart by, for example, controlling with conditions like, you know,

29:00.240 --> 29:04.720
theater therapy, right? Where you also engage with other people, you find some alternative

29:04.720 --> 29:08.520
ways of maybe expressing yourself through body language or facial expressions or something

29:08.520 --> 29:12.840
like that. So that's trying to, you know, control for one aspect of it. But it sounds

29:12.840 --> 29:17.840
like the kinds of music therapy that people use are so, so rich and there are just so

29:17.840 --> 29:24.080
many things that go into that big bag. And for people who want to just help other people,

29:24.080 --> 29:28.320
they may not care about taking it apart. They just want something that will make someone

29:28.320 --> 29:32.800
better at, you know, whatever their problems are. But it seems like ultimately would be

29:32.800 --> 29:37.920
really helpful to understand what drives these recovery effects so we can then maybe capitalize

29:37.920 --> 29:41.160
on the things that work really well or whatever components are most efficient.

29:41.160 --> 29:48.040
Sure. Well, yeah, you've bought up so many really interesting points to talk about.

29:48.040 --> 29:56.240
On a mechanistic level, that's still a huge gray area. What you're saying about the difficulties

29:56.240 --> 30:01.480
of research in music therapy, that's just a reality. I mean, it's impossible to do a

30:01.480 --> 30:15.280
double blind with music therapy. You've bought up a point about specific mechanisms for clinical

30:15.280 --> 30:19.480
practice. And Connie started talking about pain. I think we could talk a little bit about

30:19.480 --> 30:25.280
that. We started mentioning gating and things like that. So what Connie was, I think what

30:25.280 --> 30:32.560
she was starting to talk about, is Milzak and Katz, gay control neurometrics theories.

30:32.560 --> 30:40.240
And so following that, there are areas of the pain response. It is a multidimensional

30:40.240 --> 30:48.400
subjective response that has different domains. Some of those domains are things that we can

30:48.400 --> 30:56.040
work with as therapists with the idea, for example, there is an emotional content always

30:56.040 --> 31:00.320
to physical pain. I'm not talking about emotional pain and suffering. So emotion is something

31:00.320 --> 31:09.320
that the music is made of, we could argue. So using music to modulate an emotional response

31:09.320 --> 31:14.240
to pain is something that is very effective and relatively easy to do. There are other

31:14.240 --> 31:19.560
domains. There's a cognitive discriminative domain to it as well. We can use music in

31:19.560 --> 31:30.160
a process with that as well. I don't, because it's impossible for everybody is somebody

31:30.160 --> 31:34.000
is going to know that music is happening. Does everybody know here what double blind

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
studies are? I mean, I just know people's background. Would you explain it? Yeah. Well,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.720
I mean, it's just basically when neither the therapist nor the patient is aware of which

31:40.720 --> 31:44.480
treatment group they're in. So there's no biases on the side of the patient or on the

31:44.480 --> 31:48.840
side of the... Right. So it's impossible not to know. Somebody knows that somebody's getting

31:48.840 --> 31:55.280
music. Yeah. Right. But it seems like I don't know, again, I'm sorry, I don't...

31:55.280 --> 32:01.920
So if you had a group who had pain or were going for the same procedure and then get music,

32:01.920 --> 32:07.680
and another group who got music, and then we found out which ones had felt less pain,

32:07.680 --> 32:11.640
and was in the double blind? No. Because they know what they got. Yeah.

32:11.640 --> 32:16.680
There's been studies with both groups get headphones and one might get white noise,

32:16.680 --> 32:20.280
and the other one will get some music, and then you could do really a double blind study

32:20.280 --> 32:25.080
in that kind of situation. Still say the patient knows. The patient knows. But then

32:25.080 --> 32:29.560
that's what we're going to hear. Yeah. Yeah. So we do a double blind study where we're

32:29.560 --> 32:35.280
doing non-invasive brain stimulation in conjunction with melodic intonation therapy.

32:35.280 --> 32:42.480
And the TDCS or transcranial direct current stimulation unit that we use, the very small

32:42.480 --> 32:47.440
thing, which is actually on a wire, which is behind the patient's back and being controlled

32:47.440 --> 32:53.240
by another researcher. So you can give one of two kinds of stimulation or you can give

32:53.240 --> 32:58.520
sham stimulation so that the patient doesn't know whether or not they feel the same kind

32:58.520 --> 33:05.640
of ramp up as the current is turned on in the sham stimulation as they do in either of

33:05.640 --> 33:13.240
the other current modes. And I, as the person doing the melodic intonation therapy with

33:13.240 --> 33:18.160
them, am unaware of what they're getting. So that is a double blind study. It's not

33:18.160 --> 33:24.280
double blind with the music part of it. But we do, just to answer your question from

33:24.280 --> 33:31.480
earlier, our study is looking at a specific control intervention that we designed to take

33:31.480 --> 33:36.280
the music part away. Everything else is the same. So we have melodic intonation therapy

33:36.280 --> 33:42.080
and speech repetition therapy. So the stimuli are exactly the same. The way it's administered

33:42.080 --> 33:48.560
is the same except for the singing and the hand tapping, which engage that same.

33:48.560 --> 33:55.040
So even another part to further talk about studying researching music, I think one of

33:55.040 --> 34:00.360
the challenges is that when we talk about the dynamics, interpersonal dynamics of music

34:00.360 --> 34:06.840
therapy, that's hard to study because it's real time interactive music making. But a lot

34:06.840 --> 34:13.760
of the research that's been done has been on the components of music, of rhythm and sound

34:13.760 --> 34:19.880
and arousal mechanisms. And those can be studied on a neuroscience basis because they can be

34:19.880 --> 34:25.640
isolated. But then you have to realize that music is so broad. So we have the sound, we

34:25.640 --> 34:32.280
have vibration that can have an impact on function. But once it gets into song, song

34:32.280 --> 34:38.720
not, song meaning music, composed music, once it gets into an organized musical sound, then

34:38.720 --> 34:45.840
we get into a different hierarchy of processing that becomes more difficult to study, I think.

34:45.840 --> 34:53.320
So when you do rhythmic entrainment for someone, say, with Parkinson's, could that person just

34:53.320 --> 34:58.640
be using a click track? Yeah. So when the first studies were done, it was by a rhythmic

34:58.640 --> 35:05.160
sort of metronomic type click track. And that works fine. What we did find out though is

35:05.160 --> 35:10.240
that if the person can, if there's a melody that they can hold on to, so if that melody

35:10.240 --> 35:16.640
has a rhythmic pattern to it, they can self-intrain. Because that part of the brain of imaging,

35:16.640 --> 35:19.400
imagining that sound could also drive the same mode of mechanism.

35:19.400 --> 35:22.760
Interesting. Because in Indian classical music, the-

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
The top of the play is-

35:23.760 --> 35:25.680
The top of the play. Yeah, they do that. Yep.

35:25.680 --> 35:31.000
They have, you know, they can go and do their own solo performances for an hour or so. But

35:31.000 --> 35:35.520
usually there's a very simple repeating-

35:35.520 --> 35:39.520
Happened, that keeps it together. A melody played by another instrument. And that instrument

35:39.520 --> 35:45.480
is simply accompanying. You know, the melody is just there to kind of keep the ear where

35:45.480 --> 35:51.680
it's supposed to be, you know, focused on them. And it's the rhythm that takes you some

35:51.680 --> 35:54.040
place. One of the interesting things I think about

35:54.040 --> 35:59.400
music, at least when we study it in patients who've lost cognitive function, is that the

35:59.400 --> 36:05.960
components of music are processed at sub-cortical levels. So when you look at the piece of art,

36:05.960 --> 36:09.640
when you listen to language, that's all high-acortical processing.

36:09.640 --> 36:13.520
Not all? Not all. Okay. Sub-cortical contributions as well to some of us.

36:13.520 --> 36:20.280
Yeah, yeah. But, well, maybe then maybe I'm wrong. But that this component of our motor

36:20.280 --> 36:26.160
system and physiological system that can be driven purely by patterns of sound. So even

36:26.160 --> 36:32.080
if somebody has severe cortical damage, there's still ways of entraining them to sound, that

36:32.080 --> 36:36.560
is impossible, poo-verbal interaction. And so many times we'll work with people with

36:36.560 --> 36:41.680
severe brain injury to sort of jump-start areas of the brain that still may be available to

36:41.680 --> 36:46.400
them and bring it into a higher level of action. But tell me about what you were-

36:46.400 --> 36:50.640
Well, I mean, I mean, it's, I was just saying that there's sub-cortical contributions to

36:50.640 --> 36:55.920
three months now to many, many high-level cognitive functions. But I think also one thing to keep

36:55.920 --> 37:01.880
in mind when- so when you were talking earlier, you said that music kind of engages the whole

37:01.880 --> 37:07.120
brain. And in some ways, it's certainly true because, you know, if you're a musician listening

37:07.120 --> 37:10.320
to music, you're going to activate your motor cortex to some extent, right? Because you're

37:10.320 --> 37:16.080
thinking about actually playing that piece. And of course, there's huge swaths of auditory

37:16.080 --> 37:20.320
cortex that are active. And then musical is all sorts of emotions. And so the emotional

37:20.320 --> 37:24.400
centers are active. And there may be some kind of, you know, thoughts that get generated

37:24.400 --> 37:28.040
by music, like, you know, thinking about your loved ones and so your social system may be

37:28.040 --> 37:32.880
active and so on. But I think it's really important to also keep in mind- so I'm coming

37:32.880 --> 37:37.080
back to this question of specificity- there are some parts of our brain that appear to

37:37.080 --> 37:41.840
be really, really specifically responding to music. Okay, so there are some parts of the

37:41.840 --> 37:47.560
auditory cortex that respond very, very robustly when we process music and all kinds of music,

37:47.560 --> 37:52.760
including familiar and familiar, different cultural, music from different cultures. But

37:52.760 --> 37:57.480
these same regions don't respond at all when we hear speech, when we hear animal noises,

37:57.480 --> 38:01.480
when we hear all sorts of mechanical noises. So it's a really, really, really specific

38:01.480 --> 38:06.920
response. And there's nearby regions, of course, that respond to speech, speech sounds. And

38:06.920 --> 38:11.680
those regions are- this is before we get into the language domain. These just respond to

38:11.680 --> 38:16.920
the acoustics of speech. They respond just as much to foreign speech as they do to familiar

38:16.920 --> 38:25.440
speech. Anyway, so these are the kinds of regions that when damaged will lead to problems

38:25.440 --> 38:30.320
which are specific to music. So you mentioned Isabelle Pirez as one of the kind of leaders

38:30.320 --> 38:36.980
in that field who has documented very interesting cases of patients who appear to have really

38:36.980 --> 38:42.120
quite selective deficits with some aspects of music following stroke. Now, you may have

38:42.120 --> 38:46.800
damage to some aspects of your motor cortex or emotional system and may lose some ability

38:46.800 --> 38:51.880
to either enjoy some aspects of music or process some aspects of music. But it's really these

38:51.880 --> 38:58.640
parts of the auditory cortex that are music selective that seem to be- have this one-to-one

38:58.640 --> 39:04.640
relationship with musical abilities and ability to perceive music. That said, I think the place

39:04.640 --> 39:10.800
where a music very useful interacts with the rest of the brain is through this very extensive

39:10.800 --> 39:17.080
bilateral system which people call many, many names in the literature which is never helpful.

39:17.080 --> 39:22.600
But you know, it's- the network is known as task positive network because it gets engaged

39:22.600 --> 39:27.280
in many, many tasks where the cognitive control network or the executive system network or

39:27.280 --> 39:32.080
the attention network. The bottom line is it's a system that gets engaged in a broad,

39:32.080 --> 39:36.880
broad range of goal-directed behaviors. It seems to care about prediction in general.

39:36.880 --> 39:40.720
So we predict the world all the time. We try to predict, you know, what happens, what you're

39:40.720 --> 39:44.000
going to say next or how you're going to move next, where if I'm listening to a piece of

39:44.000 --> 39:49.280
music, you know, what kind of structure might come up, come next and so on and so forth.

39:49.280 --> 39:54.040
And that system has been linked to things like fluid intelligence, flexible behaviors,

39:54.040 --> 39:59.520
kind of another real hallmark of our species. Monkeys have like an equivalent system. It's

39:59.520 --> 40:03.640
just not quite as good. Some people argue it's qualitatively different in some ways, but

40:03.640 --> 40:07.560
the evidence for that is a little scan. But anyways, so we have this huge, huge system

40:07.560 --> 40:12.160
that allows us to engage in all sorts of goal-directed behaviors and planning. And that's

40:12.160 --> 40:16.680
a system that gets engaged very robustly by music and rhythmic stimuli. And it seems

40:16.680 --> 40:22.000
like that's where it may actually intersect with things like some aspects of language

40:22.000 --> 40:26.240
or some aspects of, you know, motor function or some aspects of kind of general emotion

40:26.240 --> 40:33.280
attention components. But there's another kind of sort of crossover, a kind of a gray

40:33.280 --> 40:40.920
area between speech and language and Andrea working with people with aphasia. I mean,

40:40.920 --> 40:47.640
it's always struck me that people who grow up speaking tonal languages like Mandarin,

40:47.640 --> 40:55.840
that line, that differentiation that we make between speech and song is less clear when

40:55.840 --> 41:00.920
your language, when every word in your language can have three different meanings depending

41:00.920 --> 41:06.200
on whether it's pitched high, medium or low. So it's not quite at the level of language

41:06.200 --> 41:10.040
though still. It's at the level of speech perception. So there's indeed very interesting

41:10.040 --> 41:14.840
words suggesting, for example, that tone deafness is a lot less common in Mandarin speakers,

41:14.840 --> 41:20.840
for example. And again, there's work suggesting that in the auditory cortex, there is some

41:20.840 --> 41:25.800
shared bit that responds to pitch across domains. So there it doesn't matter if it comes

41:25.800 --> 41:31.720
from a, you know, train horn or music or speech, but it's this very, very sensitive to pitch

41:31.720 --> 41:36.440
modulation region. And that's potentially where some of these interactions may happen

41:36.440 --> 41:40.640
along with potentially brain stem areas which also have been implicated. But that's again

41:40.640 --> 41:47.520
kind of before you get into the realm of mapping thoughts onto linguistic forms which is kind

41:47.520 --> 41:52.000
of what the kind of high level language is, right? It's once you're passed with the acoustic

41:52.000 --> 41:57.800
signal. And at that level, it seems like there is really, really very clear separation between

41:57.800 --> 42:02.040
the regions that support language and the regions that support music, modulo this very,

42:02.040 --> 42:07.440
very domain general system, the frontopridal system. I mentioned where every kind of engaging

42:07.440 --> 42:15.400
task will overlap. But in terms of the processing mechanism we use for language and music, those

42:15.400 --> 42:20.640
appear to be quite distinct. And there's been a lot of confusion in the literature because

42:20.640 --> 42:26.240
many people have argued that there is something like an abstract hierarchical processor of

42:26.240 --> 42:31.760
structure in language and music. And some people have also added math into the same bag. But

42:31.760 --> 42:37.880
the evidence for those kinds of claims all came from studies where the paradigms would

42:37.880 --> 42:43.200
be something like you're listening to a piece of music and then you have something that doesn't

42:43.200 --> 42:48.400
fit with the preceding context, right? Like violating exactly. Exactly. And so similarly

42:48.400 --> 42:52.960
in language you would get a sentence and then something will disagree in gender or number

42:52.960 --> 42:56.560
or whatever language you're using, though, basically a grammatical error, right? And

42:56.560 --> 43:00.400
as you can imagine, when you're processing a familiar stimulus and you get something

43:00.400 --> 43:04.320
that doesn't fit with the context, a lot of things happen in your brain. You're like,

43:04.320 --> 43:08.280
wow, you know, this is an error. Something is wrong. I'm going to try to fix it. Did they

43:08.280 --> 43:14.000
mean this, right? And so some of the work that we've done has shown that this kind of

43:14.000 --> 43:19.080
overlap, it does happen, but it doesn't happen in some abstract hierarchical processor. It

43:19.080 --> 43:23.560
happens in this very domain general system that just reacts to basically unexpected events

43:23.560 --> 43:27.920
in the world and it will respond just as much to, you know, a sequence of blue circles and

43:27.920 --> 43:33.200
then a red circle as a would to a violation of hierarchical structure in music or grammatical

43:33.200 --> 43:41.280
structure in language. I just want to follow an arena that language is to my understanding.

43:41.280 --> 43:49.520
This kind of intellectual endeavor, while in music, we don't invest intellectual efforts

43:49.520 --> 43:58.000
to receive music. This is why it's available to people with Alzheimer, to autistic children,

43:58.000 --> 44:02.240
to people with tremendous cognitive problems. We are dealing with a very special way of

44:02.240 --> 44:11.000
communication and this special way is to explain the power of music therapy, basically, because

44:11.000 --> 44:18.440
as Kanchata wrote, that music is dealing with different pathways to accessing our memories

44:18.440 --> 44:25.720
or whatever. It's like, let's say that music gives something like temporary winter, winter

44:25.720 --> 44:31.480
of sanity to people with Alzheimer, but they suddenly recognize their relatives. They

44:31.480 --> 44:36.040
could not recognize for months already. Or they suddenly have these flashes from their

44:36.040 --> 44:44.880
memory or they suddenly start citing the words of the songs in their youth. We are dealing

44:44.880 --> 44:54.040
with very special phenomenon which is very accessible. Yes, it's auditory information,

44:54.040 --> 44:58.920
of course, and it goes through all the processing delays. And we know there's some difference,

44:58.920 --> 45:06.640
like in the sense of brain hemisphere, more responsible for speech and more for music.

45:06.640 --> 45:12.160
There's a lot of shared mechanisms, but altogether, in music, we are dealing with a very simple

45:12.160 --> 45:19.600
way of encoding complex information and decoding complex information. And this simplicity explains

45:19.600 --> 45:29.320
this kind of generosity of communication through music. You don't need to have special training

45:29.320 --> 45:33.320
to get very complex messages of music. This is my point.

45:33.320 --> 45:36.480
So, we are still training to get messages from language either. In fact, people with

45:36.480 --> 45:41.880
severe mental disability, like some individuals with Down syndrome, who would score very poorly

45:41.880 --> 45:46.160
on a lot of IQ tasks, they never the last can understand language and produce language.

45:46.160 --> 45:51.800
But they need to learn words. Of course, you need to learn words. Dogs can learn. Of course,

45:51.800 --> 45:54.320
you need to learn words to communicate with it.

45:54.320 --> 46:00.120
It's interesting, some of our patients who had severe phasor, we forget how much our facial

46:00.120 --> 46:07.800
expression informs communication. And so, you'll see people who stop mimicking the lip movements

46:07.800 --> 46:13.440
of somebody if they're trying to understand what's being said. So, I think as a language

46:13.440 --> 46:20.040
species, we tend to really depend on verbal communication to understand each other. But

46:20.040 --> 46:24.880
when we lose the ability to express ourselves verbally, we get creative. We get creative.

46:24.880 --> 46:30.640
And there's a lot of nuance that we use both through movement, through facial expression,

46:30.640 --> 46:36.080
even through, you know, visceral exchanges and feelings and gut responses that are part

46:36.080 --> 46:41.280
of communication and the way of sharing. And I think music informs some of that. I think

46:41.280 --> 46:48.680
that's why people who have severe brain damage can still appreciate and respond emotionally

46:48.680 --> 46:55.040
because some of those contextual elements can be accessed in lower parts of the brain.

46:55.040 --> 46:59.600
The other thing, sorry, the other thing that's interesting is when somebody, you were talking

46:59.600 --> 47:04.400
about the executive functioning and being able to plan ahead, but some of the work that

47:04.400 --> 47:10.560
Charles Lim is doing now in improvisation talks about when somebody's in this super-creative

47:10.560 --> 47:16.400
process, the frontal part of their brain isn't as active. They're not self-monitoring anymore.

47:16.400 --> 47:21.600
And I think what happens in a lot of our music therapy sessions where we have improvisational

47:21.600 --> 47:27.560
of music making, people who can't plan because they've had a trauma, you know, that affects

47:27.560 --> 47:32.880
the frontal cortex or can't think through steps of doing things. In the moment of play

47:32.880 --> 47:38.480
and spontaneous interaction, they are able to access function because this part of the

47:38.480 --> 47:42.480
brain isn't needed anymore. They're working on some other aspects. So there's so much

47:42.480 --> 47:43.480
going.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
There's a few opposing systems.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.480
Exactly, yeah.

47:45.480 --> 47:49.400
The executive system has kind of its arch enemy, which is the system which people kind of

47:49.400 --> 47:57.680
say is aimed at kind of introspecting and recalling things and thinking about others'

47:57.680 --> 48:03.760
minds. And it's kind of known as the default mode. Some people link it to social functions

48:03.760 --> 48:06.720
so they would talk about the system as a social function because a lot of what we do

48:06.720 --> 48:11.200
when we are not actively pursuing a task is think about other people because we're a

48:11.200 --> 48:16.840
very social species. And anyway, so how those two systems trade off in complex cognition

48:16.840 --> 48:23.120
is a very interesting question. And the interplay between the two systems has been implicated

48:23.120 --> 48:26.720
in a lot of psychiatric disorders, actually the various disbalances.

48:26.720 --> 48:33.240
It's interesting to think of complex music making where that prefrontal area is kind

48:33.240 --> 48:37.240
of needs to step out of the way. That's right to make it.

48:37.240 --> 48:43.120
There's a musical technique called hockeying, which is you hear it in some of the music of

48:43.120 --> 48:46.800
Duke Ellington, you hear it in Indonesian, Gamelan music, you hear it in the music of Steve

48:46.800 --> 48:52.360
Reich, where nobody plays the whole melody. You play the first note, I play the second,

48:52.360 --> 48:57.360
you play the third, then you play the fourth, I play the fifth, you play the sixth. And

48:57.360 --> 49:04.680
I've asked many musicians who employ this technique what it's like to do it. And universally,

49:04.680 --> 49:10.120
the answer is you just stop. You stop thinking and you just, and after a while you don't

49:10.120 --> 49:16.320
remember who's doing what, it's just, it becomes its own sort of closed system. And

49:16.320 --> 49:25.360
of course it takes training. You have to internalize the individual parts, but the idea is to

49:25.360 --> 49:31.800
get to that point where the front of the brain shuts down and you just go on instinct.

49:31.800 --> 49:36.800
I think it's really important to concentrate on your thing, thought that we have language,

49:36.800 --> 49:41.360
we are dealing with high processing basically. Yeah, there are some other layers, but still

49:41.360 --> 49:48.920
it's high processing. What about music? Well, there's higher processing in music. I mean

49:48.920 --> 49:54.920
musicians do it all the time where we listen, we process with the sounders, with the key

49:54.920 --> 50:01.360
is, with instruments of playing, with the harmonic structures. So that's very high. And

50:01.360 --> 50:06.320
in fact the more exposed we are to music, the more we're able to appreciate complex

50:06.320 --> 50:12.320
music. Whereas a novice musician may find some abstract music very disconcerting. Whereas

50:12.320 --> 50:17.840
an expert musician might see the excitement in, you know, stock housing or something.

50:17.840 --> 50:24.480
But I don't think that the expertise and so and so important. Because people basically

50:24.480 --> 50:30.120
don't need to learn language. I mean we could use five or six words to pretty much get

50:30.120 --> 50:36.720
around. It's not true. I mean, no, no, I'm saying that there's some universal. There's

50:36.720 --> 50:42.520
certain basic things that we get out of music and we get out of language that we could survive

50:42.520 --> 50:48.840
with. That's right. But to really be creative and spontaneous and be able to engage at a

50:48.840 --> 50:52.920
higher level, we need all those other elements available to us.

50:52.920 --> 51:00.040
I'm rooting for something different. You see, music therapy can help premise. It can help

51:00.040 --> 51:06.760
artistic children. And sometimes the artistic children can be kind of very much on the limits

51:06.760 --> 51:12.640
of spectrum, like non-negristic kids. It can help people with various cognitive problems

51:12.640 --> 51:18.200
like Parkinson's when it's already cognitive problems. And of course in that's humor.

51:18.200 --> 51:26.640
So there's some channel in music that kind of not necessarily reaches the highest levels.

51:26.640 --> 51:33.000
But he uses some precognitive mechanisms to deliver important information by going to

51:33.000 --> 51:44.040
the memories and going to motor behavior, going to the feeling of well-being. And I think this

51:44.040 --> 51:52.240
is a very important thing in the discussion about music therapy, these precognitive mechanisms.

51:52.240 --> 51:56.080
Well, you were mentioning the limbic system as well. I mean, there's certainly a lot of

51:56.080 --> 51:57.080
sort of...

51:57.080 --> 52:01.240
Sure. I think one of the things is, again, the hierarchy of music development and how

52:01.240 --> 52:06.520
it gets paired or how it's parallel to other aspects of functions. So something like the

52:06.520 --> 52:12.200
structure of language is also parallel to the structure of music. So when somebody loses

52:12.200 --> 52:18.520
the ability to verbally communicate, the structure of that sound can inform some of the linguistic

52:18.520 --> 52:24.680
elements. I mean, there's so many... Same thing like the motor system has parallel pathways

52:24.680 --> 52:31.920
to our processing of rhythm. So the motor system works on an on-off signaling system, right?

52:31.920 --> 52:38.920
And so those shared pathways are very robust and shared by music as well as other kinds

52:38.920 --> 52:42.960
of function. Different from other kinds of odds because...

52:42.960 --> 52:43.960
Yeah, they are...

52:43.960 --> 52:49.800
These are fundamental structures. But I think music arose or was developed out of the fundamental

52:49.800 --> 52:57.360
structures that we as an animal species already had available to us. So again, movement as

52:57.360 --> 53:04.080
representative of activity and feeling and sound as relative to feeling and emotion.

53:04.080 --> 53:09.080
So I think music came out of our internal system.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.080
So for thought.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.080
Yeah.

53:12.080 --> 53:15.440
For thought. Let's talk about neonates. You can put some.

53:15.440 --> 53:22.880
So pre-verbal, you can't be any more pre-verbal than that. Neonates, while fetuses can distinguish

53:22.880 --> 53:28.640
rhythm in about 16 weeks, long before they can distinguish moms, voice or anything like

53:28.640 --> 53:40.160
that. We have a study that was done in 11 different NICUs that looked at entrainment,

53:40.160 --> 53:49.760
which was something that you bought it before, in stabilizing and reducing O2 saturation,

53:49.760 --> 53:55.720
heart rate and respiratory rate. And so these are... They couldn't be any more pre-verbal.

53:55.720 --> 54:02.840
There's no such thing as music psychotherapy with a neonate, at least not verbally. But

54:02.840 --> 54:11.160
through entrainment, not mechanical entrainment, we were able to stabilize and actually lower

54:11.160 --> 54:16.240
heart rate and respiratory rate and stabilize and oxygen saturation.

54:16.240 --> 54:17.480
In utero, you're saying?

54:17.480 --> 54:18.480
No, these are neonates.

54:18.480 --> 54:19.480
These are neonates.

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Okay.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.240
Thirty, two weeks, maybe.

54:22.240 --> 54:27.280
Do we know if that kind of an approach would work with animals, non-human animals, at

54:27.280 --> 54:28.280
least other primates?

54:28.280 --> 54:30.920
I've never worked with animal babies, no.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.880
I mean, that would be useful to know.

54:32.880 --> 54:33.880
There weren't too many in the hospital.

54:33.880 --> 54:34.880
Sorry.

54:34.880 --> 54:40.520
That would be useful to know. It still wouldn't quite tell us about species specificity because

54:40.520 --> 54:45.720
the in utero experiences might have differential exposures to music, although you can control

54:45.720 --> 54:50.400
this with reared monkeys, of course. But I mean, it would be useful to understand whether

54:50.400 --> 54:54.800
it's a very kind of low level physiological thing that would work on any mammal or at

54:54.800 --> 54:57.480
least primates or, you know, tractors and words.

54:57.480 --> 55:00.320
Yeah, this is what we're talking about, periodicity.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.320
Yeah.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.320
In the last four.

55:02.320 --> 55:03.320
Sure.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
Yeah.

55:04.320 --> 55:13.880
I have a kind of hypothesis about these differences between language and music that most likely,

55:13.880 --> 55:18.240
they both came from the same route, which is the vocal production.

55:18.240 --> 55:22.720
So it was first signaling system in animals.

55:22.720 --> 55:27.520
It's expression of well-being, expression of danger.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.800
It's the vocal production.

55:29.800 --> 55:35.800
So gradually it was development into two, like, bifurcation.

55:35.800 --> 55:41.800
So one branch became language with precision of communication.

55:41.800 --> 55:45.560
And here we come with ritzelages, et al.

55:45.560 --> 55:49.000
The neurons that neurons were involved in creation of language.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Okay.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.040
So I'm just a little skeptical of the mirror.

55:52.040 --> 55:53.040
Yeah.

55:53.040 --> 55:57.120
But anyway, so anyway, somehow we came to those cognitive constants.

55:57.120 --> 56:05.280
On the other side, we get emotional component of first signaling system going into music.

56:05.280 --> 56:11.240
When it was discovered that sounds hips to two relationships, the hierarchy of those

56:11.240 --> 56:16.120
relationships that allows us eventually to develop melodic thinking.

56:16.120 --> 56:23.320
So we have rhythmic things, which are working for movement, for language, and for music,

56:23.320 --> 56:27.520
but we have something very special that works only for music.

56:27.520 --> 56:32.520
It's a relationship between musical sounds, tonal relationships, that allows to create

56:32.520 --> 56:33.520
melodies.

56:33.520 --> 56:37.120
And those relationships are very primitive.

56:37.120 --> 56:44.800
So it doesn't matter what will listen, a simple melody or complex piece played by symphony.

56:44.800 --> 56:52.120
It's the same very simple principle of tonal relationships that could be explained as interplay

56:52.120 --> 56:56.360
between dissonant sounds and consonant sounds.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.320
So we have difference in pitch.

56:59.320 --> 57:00.840
And then not a lot of them.

57:00.840 --> 57:02.640
We have very few elements of music.

57:02.640 --> 57:06.000
The parsimonial of musical matter is fantastic.

57:06.000 --> 57:11.520
There's basic seven elements, the atomic scale, plus five chromatic scales, and they repeated

57:11.520 --> 57:13.440
the game cyclically.

57:13.440 --> 57:16.000
But the relationship, this is what's interesting.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.480
They work like phenomenal fills of gravity.

57:18.480 --> 57:24.080
We have very stable tone, and we have all other tones, the difference pitch, that have

57:24.080 --> 57:26.960
different level of attraction to this tone.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.200
And this is how we travel in tonal space.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.480
And we don't need to be trained to get it.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.600
So there is no words in music.

57:34.600 --> 57:39.640
We don't need to learn that this is mal or chord or chard or cad.

57:39.640 --> 57:43.360
We just know, okay, this is something that's going on.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.120
And we tune to that.

57:45.120 --> 57:49.040
And there's just relationship between different musical sounds.

57:49.040 --> 57:52.400
And it happens, I guess, on a very simple level.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.720
We don't need to be trained to understand consonances.

57:55.720 --> 58:02.640
So this is a little bit because we can see different responses, brain responses in newborn

58:02.640 --> 58:04.880
for consonances and consonances.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.680
And we can have studies, and we already have studies.

58:08.680 --> 58:13.520
If you're two months old, you play for them consonances and they recognize it.

58:13.520 --> 58:18.760
But at that point, they've had two months plus, you know, a few months in utero experiences

58:18.760 --> 58:21.080
with Western tonal music, right?

58:21.080 --> 58:28.280
And that's why recent work on the Tumani in Bolivia, this is led by Josh McDermott at

58:28.280 --> 58:35.840
MIT suggesting that at least the valence aspect of consonances does not seem to be culturally

58:35.840 --> 58:37.080
universal.

58:37.080 --> 58:43.440
And even though people living right nearby in Bolivia who have had exposure to tonal

58:43.440 --> 58:48.880
music do have a preference, albeit it's still not quite as strong as it is in MIT undergrads

58:48.880 --> 58:54.600
or whatever his control group is in the US, the Tumani who have very different kind of

58:54.600 --> 58:59.360
music, they just don't, they can tell the difference and they can do control tasks like

58:59.360 --> 59:04.120
they will judge, you know, crying as sad and laughing as happy, but they don't have the

59:04.120 --> 59:09.320
preference for consonant sounding as kind of happy and pleasant and the dissonant sounding.

59:09.320 --> 59:10.320
Yeah, absolutely.

59:10.320 --> 59:11.320
It's just interesting.

59:11.320 --> 59:15.720
Recently they had a pilot study with adults, Lebacievsky.

59:15.720 --> 59:23.320
And we, so we were looking into the variability of heart beat, heart rhythms, and we played

59:23.320 --> 59:24.320
different music.

59:24.320 --> 59:30.920
So one of the pieces which was loved every body was second movement from Mozart's concerta

59:30.920 --> 59:34.160
I think when it's when it's third.

59:34.160 --> 59:36.080
And everybody was just happy to listen to that.

59:36.080 --> 59:43.880
As a contrast I took a P role there by Schoenberg which is quite dissonant.

59:43.880 --> 59:49.320
I could imagine one of the participants was particularly attached to this space and I

59:49.320 --> 59:56.160
was thinking how it happened, it's possible that those idioms from orthonomusic, they

59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.720
kind of went into popular culture through films like suspensions, something good which

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.000
needs to happen and people like it.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.280
So it's not necessarily a balance.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.280
Oh yeah.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:13.720
It's just different because there's a perception of dissonances, the consonances, its body

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:20.800
responses perceive tension and there was studies starting from 80s that demonstrated that this

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.000
perceived tonal tension actually translates into physical tension.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.840
This is why I like so much your thoughts about enrollment of motor system because I believe

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:41.480
that when we listen to music it's not just rhythm that involves, let's say, our like

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:53.760
basal ganglion but it's built into system of muscle responses, fleeting responses to

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.360
music and this is how people memorize melody perhaps.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.800
It's not that they remember just auditory information.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.320
It's possible, it's just a hypothesis.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:14.200
It's possible that it's our body, but remember those fleeting muscle responses to melodic

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:20.320
information and this is why music is so available because motor responses, they are the simplest

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320
ones.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.720
The feeling of tension is pre-meval.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.640
If something not right, they are tense.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.640
Is everything okay?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.640
They are relaxed and this is what music exploits.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:40.560
You are saying it's just a kind of thing but if you look at individuals who were either

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:46.800
born paralyzed or lacking limbs, they can certainly experience music in arguably as

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800
richly.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.960
It's not the case that the motor system is a core part of experiencing or enjoyment.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.240
It's just something to keep in mind.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:02:02.440
I'm thinking about studies that Sandra Treehop had done about language development in newborns.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:10.680
How their ability to process a range really close sounds at birth are all similar no matter

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.920
what part of the world they come from.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.360
As they get exposed to their mother tongue, just being in the environment with other

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:25.080
adults, that window of change happens pretty rapidly.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.960
They stop perceiving these nuances of microtones between pitch and actually start going to

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.560
whatever is the most constant in their native tongue.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.760
So I think all children when they're born have a broad range of perception as long as

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.720
there's no damage to the auditory cortex.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:48.920
So it's cultural how these other nuances.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:53.280
Even the visual response, I'm thinking we were just talking about Joe Lidue's work in

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.200
memory and trauma.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:01.680
A newborn who doesn't have the ability to understand the word around them is only developing

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.040
visual memory from birth.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:09.080
Because they can't put things into contextual meaning because it's all experience.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:14.280
And so a lot of trauma that becomes really deep seated are these visual memories that

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.720
become part of our makeup that we don't know about until somebody helps this process that

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.120
they're coming from.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.160
So a lot of why early, early development is on the visual system, for sure.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.440
Because we don't have the cognitive constructs to make sense of it yet.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.680
You know it's interesting hearing you talk about how the brain is a very efficient mechanism

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:40.000
and it will pare down those pathways that it doesn't need anymore.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.160
And Jamshed Barucha, who for many years was at Tufts and then at the new school, grew

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.080
up playing both Western and Indian classical music and did an interesting presentation

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.240
at a World Science Festival panel that we did some years ago where he just kind of drew

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.440
all of these connecting lines between, you know, it was just like a schematic diagram

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:11.560
of neurons and how, you know, if you'd grown up in one set or another, all of these lines

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.960
would have disappeared and you would have these 12.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.520
But growing up in two different traditions simultaneously, he had all these neural connections

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.800
and for him the idea of the kind of the flattered sixth and seventh of certain raga scales was

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:35.640
as natural as the perfect fifth and, you know, the major third, which by the way, if you

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:41.840
hold a major third for a long time, it is crushingly dissonant.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:49.320
Our major third is the Western major third is off by a tiny fraction that when held over

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:57.120
a long period of time becomes increasingly clear to the, whereas if you're, you know,

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.200
because we, our Western sense of harmony is a human creation.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.840
The Bodger's, yeah, but you're this beautiful, overtone serious based skill.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:11.960
Our third is, it should be a ratio of four to three, but our third is the twelfth root

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.960
of two.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.960
Because we can not.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:14.960
And irrational, non repeating.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.520
Well, it makes me think when, you know, when I was talking to people at Yamaha when they

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:27.480
developing the digital keyboards, one of their challenges was to make the acoustic experience

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:32.120
rich enough because when the well-tempered clavier was developed, you know, Beethoven

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:40.640
was composing for the string instrument or Bach, sorry, but, but composers at that time.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:46.480
And I'm thinking about Beethoven only because certain pieces that were done with violin

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:54.880
and piano were done in certain keys because of the acoustic response of like an E flat

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.320
and the key of E flat with the violin and the piano as opposed to if you were playing

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.480
by Hopsichord, you know, or something else, you know, where it wouldn't been as close.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.440
Yes, fantastic, fantastic case of the simplicity.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:15.080
What happened during the, during the 16th century, the temperate scale was actually discovered

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.000
mathematically in China for completely different reasons.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.920
And then Europeans knew about that at the end of the 16th century.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.200
And they did not want to apply it purely to the beginning of the 20th century.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.400
They tried to dance around that.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:37.040
So if you look at historical tuning, they all tried somehow how to salvage the naturally

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.400
solid scale.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.640
And well-tempered clavier was one of the variants of temperament Bach liked that.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:51.960
And the well-tempered clavity, you have penalties with, you know, modest key signature which

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:58.440
are closer to natural scale than the nullities with extended kisig which are like 5-6.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.360
They really sound bad.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.200
But most likely he used that.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.560
Well, but even Bach, you know, when he sat down and composed, he had to first decide,

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.760
am I using Verkmeister 3 or Kurnburger 2?

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.760
I mean, he had all these positive tunings available to him.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.360
And they all had different effects.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.360
That was the point.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:23.920
There was a famous treatise called the affect in Lara, the doctrine of effects by Johann

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:28.480
Matheson probably in the 18th century.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.360
And Pythagoras did this, you know, 2000 years earlier, where he went through all of the

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:37.560
keys and said, you know, the emotional impact.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.800
This is the emotion.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:45.200
This is the, this is the effect of E-flat, which is why Mozart saved E-flat for certain

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.440
things and G-minor for certain other things, C-major, you know, for the coronation mass,

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.560
you know, because they felt those differences.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:59.040
And there was a whole kind of scientific, quote unquote, you know, scientific as they

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:06.720
were in the 18th century, trying to figure out what each scale did to us, did to us emotionally.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:11.320
So, so are the way we perceive dissonance is actually evolving?

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.320
Absolutely.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:18.920
Oh, yeah, because E7, sharp nine is not an ending chord until you listen to Jimi Hendrix,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.920
right?

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.920
That's right.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:26.360
And it's evolving not just as we go along, you know, as a culture, but it evolves in each

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:32.880
of us individually because, you know, if I, as a kid, I would have heard Marla and just

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.920
thought, what's that noise, you know?

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.720
You have to grow into a, you know, you have to evolve your own sense of hearing.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.680
Otherwise, I mean, this kind of brings us right back to where we started because if it doesn't

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.600
mean something to you, you can't use it.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:55.000
And that's why there's no, in music therapy, why it's such a process because we don't know

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.960
what that person's life experiences with music.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:03.560
And we don't know how we can use that music to really reach the elements or to achieve

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.840
the goals that we want to achieve or they want to achieve, we want to help them.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.640
So it is this detective work, you can find out who they were, what was their life experience,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.840
how does their body respond to sound, how did they mentally respond to sound, what are

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.200
the associations and feelings they have to sound.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.040
So all of that comes into play.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.240
I mean, it's like being a good doctor too.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.400
I mean, somebody comes in with all these symptoms, you have a sort of a checklist of things

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.960
it's not, you know, and then you try to figure out and hone in where it's coming from.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:39.440
You can see therapy is sort of pulling on a thread and seeing what comes along with it.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.240
Do you remember in the 1980s, you know, at the height of the New Age music movement,

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.880
there were all these records coming out that made claims of being quote unquote healing

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880
music.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.320
Personally, I found this stuff to be like itching pattern.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320
I know, yes, yes.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.320
It was like crazy.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320
What is this?

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320
What does it heal?

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:04.800
I mean, this is a therapist, one of my pet peeves is this idea of the healing power of

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800
music.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:13.200
Well, as far as I know, there's no empirical evidence that music heals anything at all,

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.800
but it can certainly be used in a healing process.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.280
Did I stir something up here?

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280
Yes.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.720
We still did not mention very important system, the biological reward system, that music

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.840
is able to activate.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.800
It was found that extremely pleasurable music activates nuclear circumstance, which is

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.720
the star of our biological reward system.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.040
So maybe it's one of the explanations to a diminishing sense of pain that's kind of

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.880
distracted.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.360
I don't know if it's explanation for people who have better recovery from stroke when

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.760
they listen to music as compared to listening to books or white notes.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.360
Anybody wants to talk about?

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360
The pleasure.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.840
And do you think that they did find an effect?

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.680
You're talking about the Finnish study?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.000
It was studied by Zatora in 2001.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
This was the chilled one.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.520
There was also one that was passive listening.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.520
That was the passive listening.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:25.400
And basically ganglia modus system, so there's sound effects, all these different systems

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.560
in our body, and each one of them has a different effect with music.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.680
It's actually strange why.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:34.120
What is it in this language?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:40.760
The biological reward system is also activated by food, sex, drugs, money, and something

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.760
very tangible.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.880
What is it about music that it's suddenly enters the same company?

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:52.280
In the blood and blood and laboratory study, each they studied 15 musicians, I think it

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.680
was 15 professional musicians, and each one had a common with their piece of music that

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.800
gave them the chills and their very specific measure in the piece of the music so they

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.040
could do the imaging.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.360
What they used as a control was each other's piece of music.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:14.160
And so the person who responded to the Argentinian tango music didn't respond to the coal train

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.240
in the same way.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.640
So again, it shows us that our emotional response is to music, a really life based on

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.320
life experience.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.640
Not so much the rewards a system is developed based on our personal experience with the

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640
music.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.280
Or maybe it drives the emotional system first, and that's why we gravitate toward it.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.480
Aesthetic emotion.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.600
It's such a difficult thing to parse.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.000
So it's presence of beauty.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.320
It's cultural construct that you grew up.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.200
Your personal memories and your psychological makeup.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.680
It's all just confound.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
That's not universal.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.680
That's very subjective.

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:52.680
Yeah.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.680
Very individual.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.680
Very individual.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.360
But this also goes back to something that you were talking about before, which is the

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.440
kind of the predictive.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.520
I mean, what music does is it plays with, which is why we like repetition in music.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.640
The brain is very happy to be able to predict what comes up.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.800
I hear a one, four, five chord progression.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.360
I'm betting it's going back to the one, and when it does, it's like the brain goes,

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.880
ah, I knew it.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.720
But the brain also likes the surprise.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.160
Yes, it's right.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:23.160
Which is why.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:28.440
When people talk about the money note in a song, it's like usually when you hit the

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:35.400
note that you expect to hear in the melody, but the harmony underneath it has modulated.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.960
And suddenly it's like, wow, what was that?

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.600
So it's not like the cell phone interrupting the symphony, but it is, it's a very fine

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.000
balance between being able to predict and the element of surprise.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
That's absolutely right.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.360
I just want to also mention that there is some beautiful work in the developmental

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:03.080
literature suggesting that infants at various points and age have some optimal amount of

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.160
information that they like.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.760
So the signal is, and you can imagine doing something very, very simple, like showing

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:11.480
them sequences of familiar objects.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.040
And they get really bored if they get shown the same thing over and over again.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.600
And they also get bored if they're shown completely unpredictable sequences.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.360
But there is some optimal amount of kind of predictability and surprise, then they'll

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:26.160
pay attention for longer and longer.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:27.520
And then of course that also changes.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.920
The amount of information we can handle changes as we develop.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.560
But it's certainly the case that there may be something really fundamental about repetition

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.120
and music, and that's why maybe at the very young age we get so interested.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.040
I mean, you know, those of you who have kids know that kids like repetition, right?

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.360
They'll have the same book right over to them.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.800
Like so many times in their own, it's like there's clearly not much new information.

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.480
But they like the fact that they know what's going to happen in the story and they can

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.960
kind of participate in this.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.720
And so now the question of why we came up with a system like music that uses that repetition,

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.440
I mean that's a very interesting question that goes back to the evolutionary question.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.360
But for the evolution, I just want to mention one thing.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.080
So indeed there is a hypothesis that music and language somehow co-evolved through vocal

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.080
communication.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.600
But there's also a strong alternative which is actually now perhaps the dominant hypothesis

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.120
for the language evolution, which has nothing to do with vocal communication, but instead

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.480
has to do with gesture.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:25.560
And a lot of the observations basically come from the fact that in primates and vocal signals

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.680
are very, very constrained and very context dependent.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.560
So they'll have a very particular signal for this kind of predator, that kind of a predator.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:41.000
And a system like gesture is much more tied to the kind of social cognitive mechanisms

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.320
that are evolving over the course of the last few million years where something like trying

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.800
to get someone's attention by manipulating an object and trying to see if you get like

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.240
shared eye contact on something that I'm trying to do your attention or something like that.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:03.240
So a few theorists have now argued that actually language may have come about through the motor

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.880
system through gestural and potentially no body.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:14.480
But I think this is basically the erytzologist and his group ideas that it's gesture, it's

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.480
a moment of gesture.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.880
Well, it's a full gesture.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.360
A lot of people have made those arguments.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.320
If you read like if you actually read the way that Rizalati talks about it, it's very,

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.800
very vague and underspecified.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.800
It's true.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.800
It's a very vague way.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800
So if that's satisfying, I do not know.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:29.800
I do not know.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.800
I do not know.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.800
This is a beginning.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.800
This is a beginning.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.800
Yeah, like in everything else, it's a beginning.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.720
I am not sure if you want to begin with vague things always.

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.720
But anyway, it's debatable.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.360
But they do believe that music is basically an emotional component of vocal communication.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:53.600
Well, Stephen Finker famously just considered it an offshoot of eye product, a beautiful

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.000
one, but just an accidental eye product.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.760
Yeah, an auditory cheesecake.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:04.800
And then you have someone like Gary Livingston at Yale who posits that the two grew up on

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:11.280
parallel tracks from a similar kind of urge to express oneself.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:41.240
I would like to hear a response to a certain bias or a sum.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:54.000
I think we generally have, not only in this discussion.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.400
First is the assumption that music is about sound, but there are a lot of other aspects

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400
to it.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.880
I mean, there's a social aspect.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:14.840
I mean, it's been mentioned a visual aspect, which I think are, you know, they're asonic

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:20.760
elements, but I don't think they're less important than the sonic aspect.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:30.240
And the other one is the notion that music therapy is beneficial.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:36.600
Well, you know, strong medicines sometimes have undesirable side effects.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.640
And I'd like to hear if there is something like that.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:47.360
In other words, I think we need something like that to fill out a picture of what the boundaries

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.520
of this phenomenon are.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.840
Well, I could definitely speak to the negative effects of music.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:19:02.200
So when people talk about music can be therapeutically beneficial, some of the dangers because of

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.640
the things we spoke about are the negative effects of music.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.400
And people, I mean, people who have epileptic seizures, for example, can be prone to seizures

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.000
if a rhythmic pattern is too strong of the volume or the frequency of the sound is too

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
much.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.960
So, you know, the emotional memories associated with certain types of music, playing that

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.160
music for that person could be very traumatic.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.520
So similar to medicine, where you have trials and you see what works and doesn't work, you

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.920
have to be really careful to not just say music is very therapeutic for everybody, because

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.640
each person is going to have a different response that's all.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.080
So I'll speak to that piece and you guys could speak to the first part.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.440
I'd like to say something about what your first question about or your comment about

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.240
other benefits of music.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:54.920
One of the things that we use in our enhancement of melodic intonation therapy is the injection

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.600
or interjection, I should say, of musical thinking.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:06.520
And so one of the ways that we empower the patient to take on the therapy themselves is

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:10.360
by training them to create their own target.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.840
So people with severe nonfluidophasia can't get started when they want to say something.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:22.080
They know what they want to say, it's infuriatingly frustrating for them because they have exactly

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.440
what they want to say in mind and no way to get it out.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:30.520
So the way that the therapy actually works is that therapists would hum first what the

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.920
phrase is going to sound like and give the target phrase.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:39.720
And once they're trained to do this, they learn how to sing on the inside before they

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.440
open their mouth because the mouth takes them down a motor path that they can't get off,

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.360
they get stuck in this loop and they keep saying the same thing over and over and over

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.000
what they don't mean to say.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.440
So if they think first and hear it inside and then do this in a rehearsal as a musician

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.640
would if you're going to practice something on your own.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:07.400
Then they begin to learn how to not only make their own target but to begin to self-assess

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:09.600
and troubleshoot as they go.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.960
And if you stretch these sounds out and the beauty of the singing is the connected speech

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.800
because non-tluent aphasic can get out of burst and the burst and the burst and maybe

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.760
it's just the initial consonant and they keep on repeating that like a stutter.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:33.120
But if you breathe first and you make this breathing part of your inner target setting

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:38.680
and your inner rehearsal, you breathe and then you put it out in one piece, they don't

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.920
lose it in the middle.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:44.360
They're able to keep their whole thought together, they're able to keep that whole piece of

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.360
whatever.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.160
And it doesn't really matter what the music part sounds like.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.800
It's about that thinking and that when they walk out the door they're not stuck with a

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.760
set of 20 phrases to practice.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.840
They've got their own thoughts which they can then get out by using musical thinking

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.840
and a musical process without the music really being the important part.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.600
So that's just one example.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.360
I'm sure you have a ton of those.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.680
Connie said about the dangers of indiscriminate use of music and therapy.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:22.520
Let's say I'm in radiation oncology in the waiting room and I really like stairway to

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:23.520
heaven.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.120
I think that's a nice song.

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.760
We're knocking on heaven's door, something I really like to listen to.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.760
Right.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.120
You get a little bit.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.320
Another thing, neonates.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.960
It is very easy to overstimulate the neonate with prerecorded music that's just left on.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:50.080
Even somebody in the coma, too much arousal could be detrimental in the early stages.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.240
Somebody who's in the vegetative state, they could still have a level of arousal but too

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.840
much sensory stimulation can actually be adverse.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.880
So really being careful about what's...

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.840
Can I just close the whole up?

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.920
So there are real issues with the use of music.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.120
I'm just curious if there have been any attempts.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:12.000
So I'm actually very interested in the social component.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.840
And it seems like even in the kind of therapy that you guys do, it's like very...

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.440
Well, I don't want to say easy but it may be one of the easier things to try to pull

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.040
apart and see what's the presence of you sitting there playing a guitar versus you sitting

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:28.200
there and talking versus hearing a recording of you but maybe having a curtain, right?

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.600
So that they can't actually see the person.

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.800
And just kind of try to pull apart and figure out which bit of it is.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.400
Because I would really enjoy having you and playing guitar.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.280
Having you sit here and play guitar for me, that's lovely, right?

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.560
I mean, who wouldn't like that?

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.080
But the question is, what is it that's particularly helpful?

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.880
Is it the social bit?

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.440
Yeah, so interaction.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.280
Music therapy is at practice.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.520
Music psychotherapy, it's about relationship with patient.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.320
It's about the space that's created between two people.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:03.000
And music can be the motor or the context for that...for forwarding that relationship.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.600
You know, we did a study once...

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.480
I don't want to take away from your questions but we did a study once where we did try the

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.840
control for the social aspect.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:16.280
And so we were looking at people, homebound adults who had depression and who had medically

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.640
complex issues.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.080
And so we had the music therapists go and visit them and engage them in active music

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.080
making.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:29.680
But then we had a social worker, a recreation type person who would be the social visit

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:35.520
with that one-to-one contact with them and play games, maybe chess or cards or something

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.160
like that, right?

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.800
What was interesting is that the psychiatrist that was the psychologist who was doing the

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.240
testing was blinded to who was in which treatment.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:51.200
And there was one group that just had the traditional psychotherapy treatment or medication treatment

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.360
that they had.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:57.560
So the person who just had the traditional treatment, actually the depression went up,

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:04.360
increased the person, both the social one and the music therapy situation both had a

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.960
decrease.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.800
But the music therapy intervention was decreased by half.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.200
So it was the music too, nice.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.200
That's an excellent...

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.160
So I think that goes to your social aspect of music.

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:24.640
There's a communal aspect of a shared experience that is more than just the person, but it adds

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640
to the person.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.800
So there's something therapeutic about people moving and being together.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.440
But the music adds another level to that.

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:45.160
Actually, what I was thinking of was a particular piece of music, which is, I forget the title,

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.160
the John Cage.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.160
Oh, the silence is the other.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:50.160
It's that, right?

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.160
What 33?

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.160
The silent piece?

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.160
433?

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.160
Yes.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.160
What 33?

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:56.160
Right.

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:05.920
And I think that's a music without any kind of sound which is prescribed.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:14.920
And certainly it has very big social aspects that no recording can come even close to.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:21.080
Which brings us to the challenges of music experience because all those other nuances

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:26.920
of the experience itself adds to the perception of music.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:30.280
There is a recording of the first performance of 433.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.760
That's true.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.360
It took place in an open air shed in upstate New York.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.200
It is utterly beautiful.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:43.240
There's no quote unquote music, but it was gently raining.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.240
And the birds, there are no walls, so you hear the birds.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.640
I mean, it's a beautiful way to spend 4 minutes and 33 seconds.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.240
The piano was never touched.

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:57.160
The pianist turns the page at the end of the first movement, turns the page at the end

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.480
of the second movement, and the rest is the music of the world around.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.480
Yes.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.280
Okay, go ahead.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:09.880
First of all, this is fascinating.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.280
So thank you for this.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280
I wanted to ask.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.480
Well, first, I wanted to just talk about when you're talking about the evolution of music

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:17.480
and language.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.440
I've often heard it theorized that the baby's hearing the heartbeat for weeks at a time.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.800
And so the rhythm is just entrained.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.280
I don't know how you would ever actually prove that.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:39.240
Also, in the early days, the importance of timing and rhythm as far as hunting and surviving.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:44.600
My question is, sorry, let me just get my breath.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:50.400
My question is, we're talking about with music therapy often.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:56.760
I don't know what diseases, but when there's some sign of recognition to music, I'm just

01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:01.840
curious why there wouldn't be also maybe a hint of recognition from a relative's voice.

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:10.120
I'm curious, what is it that you're not my own language to help?

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.120
I think the comparison.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:18.400
One of the rationales for why music is more resilient than just simple voice is because

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.920
of the other dynamic elements involved in music.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:31.320
Then the voice, although it has tone, is very linear or not as dimensional as music.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.240
Whereas music has rhythm, harmony, speechless too.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:41.480
The emotional aspect, a lot of the recognition, you would think that somebody's voice would

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:47.720
have the same emotional response or arousal.

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:54.600
It seems that the complexity of music is, which is a lot more recruits so many more networks

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.480
in the brain than the actual sound of somebody's voice.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.120
Some smells have also this very powerful ability to bring this back.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:08.880
Dementia and some diseases like Parkinson's, the olfactory cortex, that sense of smell

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:15.480
is one of the first signs that there's a problem that that diminishes early on.

01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:19.360
Thank you.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.120
This has been fascinating.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:29.360
Now, you're talking primarily about the most complex organ and progress and understanding

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.560
it has been very, very slow.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.840
I've been watching some of it, but not all of it.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:43.600
Nancy Kenweiser was at Rockville yesterday and outlined some of the recent research.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:50.440
We've got new tools, MRI, PET scanning, transcranial stimulation.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.760
How do you see research in this area going forward?

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.520
Can I answer that?

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.800
I'll tell you.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:07.320
Last month, I was at NIH with 20 neuroscientists, music therapists, and 12 neuroscientists at

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:13.960
the invitation of Francis Collins because there's been great interest in how the brain

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:18.160
works and understanding complex systems.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:24.440
But trying to understand, is there a therapeutic aspect to music?

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:28.680
Can we study that in a very conservative way?

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:37.400
They've made the commitment to start funding music brain research.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.440
The initial partnership is with the Kennedy Center and NIH, and there's actually a big

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:49.040
conference on June 3, where they present some of the present research, but this is Francis

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.960
Collins says they're going to dedicate effort to this because it really speaks to the complexity

01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:00.360
of our brain and how systems integrate on very fundamental levels as well as very complex

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360
levels.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.240
So it's not so much studying music for the aesthetic aspect of music, but actually studying

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:08.560
it to really understand how complex systems operate.

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:15.560
That's the best news out of Washington.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:32.200
I was interested if there were any big cases from musicians or people who had interactions

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.800
with music that were driving the research forward.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.120
I had two possible.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:45.600
There was a jazz guitarist named Pat Martino who had amnesia, and then he, I believe he

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:49.600
taught himself to play guitar by only listening to his own records.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:56.040
And then there was Edwin Collins, who was a Scottish singer.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:02.800
I saw him, he had a massive aneurysm, and I saw him perform after, and he had to walk

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:10.880
with a cane to get to his place on the stage, and his speech was very difficult to understand

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:17.680
as he was introducing his songs until he started singing, and it was like the record.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:25.800
That really speaks to the resiliency of those overlapping mechanisms that remain despite

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:26.800
injury.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:32.520
So with Pat Martino, he had, my memory, needing him, he was at one of our conferences.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:37.960
He had a stroke, and actually had to play, learn to play the guitar again.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:43.600
But once he did, that mood and memory came back, and another person was Ruth Brown, the

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:49.080
R&B singer, who lost his speech, totally after stroke, and actually got his speech back by

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.320
listening to her own recordings and singing along.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:33:02.320
Well, I don't know if there are big cases, but we have a stroke choir at the Lewis

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.880
Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine that takes place every Monday afternoon at five

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:08.480
o'clock.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:16.040
And it is related to an IRB study, which we're conducting, and we do have some stroke patients

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:20.240
who are musicians who are in that.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:26.440
And what I can say, I don't have access to the data yet because the study's unfinished.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:36.480
But there is a very easily observable change in getting back some of the skills that they

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.080
had, as well as speech.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:46.480
Are they able to recover things that, through music, that maybe non-musicians might not be

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.480
able to recover?

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.480
I have no answer.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.280
These kinds of comparisons are really hard to make.

01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.800
And you'd want a group that's match for IQ and all sorts of other socioeconomic things.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.800
There's some interest right now.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:03.440
In fact, some of the sciences who presented a couple of weeks ago were talking about

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:06.400
the type of enhanced networks that get developed with music.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.360
I'm thinking of Nina Kraus and some of her work at Northwestern about, for example, a

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.160
good example is a person, no matter how many music lessons you had when you were a child,

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:22.200
when you're older, even if you haven't played the musical instrument, you can actually discern

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:27.200
sound to noise better than a person who was a non-musician, who had never had musical

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.200
training.

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.480
So the idea that you can process complex sound or separate meaningful sound in the noisy

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.320
environment is enhanced through purely having music lessons as a child.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.520
We had a patient who was a percussionist who had a stroke and they had a right-side paralysis

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.160
and a pericis.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.760
And the traditional rehab therapy is to really focus on the good side and really allow that

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.240
side to sort of take over function.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.880
But because he was a percussionist, he already had bilateral representation of the motor

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:57.880
system.

01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:05.000
So he already had another representation of his right hand to work on, even though he

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.680
had lost that motorability after the stroke.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:13.000
So what they started doing is having them do bilateral exercises where he actually gained

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.920
the right side back.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.920
Thank you.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.600
Hi, everyone.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.600
My name is Ann.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:25.120
I want to just thank you so much for being here.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.480
I have a background in jazz as a jazz musician.

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.720
And I also just recently finished my master's in speech pathology at the BU.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:40.440
And we got to, I got to be a co-founder of the Phasia community choir up there.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.840
I'm sorry, I'm so excited.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:44.840
I'm so excited.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:50.560
This whole talk and everything I've learned in the past three years has me excited to

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560
tears.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.440
And I just am so happy to now bring this back into my practice.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.440
And my question is very practical.

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:04.920
I'm living out in New Jersey now and getting ready to go into practice.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:11.280
And even though we all embrace these benefits and we also want to be very careful about

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.760
how we talk about the research and be very balanced.

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:21.600
And there's a lot of clinics and places, you know, even in this area in this day and age

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:26.120
that are still surprised to hear, oh my gosh, a stroke patient could sing and he couldn't

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.120
talk.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.760
And it's a very new concept.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.200
And I want to be able to talk about bringing my experience and my clinic practice into

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.600
these facilities, whether it's a sniff or a private clinic.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:47.400
And I'm having a hard time starting the conversation when people kind of have this idea that,

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.600
oh, isn't that nice?

01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.120
Some music therapy in the speech clinic room, isn't that nice?

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.920
It's a nice quality of life thing.

01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.480
But is it really clinically, like some of the other questions have been asked, clinically

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.480
valid?

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:07.200
And how to get that conversation going and maintain it and keep it going?

01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.640
I would love to hear your discussion about that.

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.000
That challenge has been going on for a very long time.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.760
I think the challenge, and we talk about this in the field of music therapy all the time,

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:23.960
is that music is so much a part of our experience, everybody's experience, that we sort of devalue

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.240
the therapeutic aspects of it.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.960
And so you think of music as an art form, you don't think of it as a treatment.

01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.480
And I think that's both the American Music Therapy Association and other organizations

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:43.680
have been doing a lot of advocacy at the state level and at the federal level to inform people

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.200
about the therapeutic, the real research.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.800
One of my institute, the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function, was founded back

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:58.480
in the 20-something years ago to really bridge the field of emerging neuroscience at that

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.600
time and clinical music therapy.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.000
So both could inform each other in advanced practice.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.160
I think doctors and people in the medical profession no longer just say that's really

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:15.160
nice and sweet because they understand that there's other mechanisms at work in recovery

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.040
and it's not just one treatment fits for all.

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.320
Because we're starting to understand the complexity of neurologic function that we can start

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:25.520
to appreciate what music does.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.720
And so I think people are more receptive.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:32.920
What's going to drive it, I think, is, I won't say money because that's not going to help

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.080
but somebody had made a comment, if you could make money off of this, there'd be a lot more

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:41.120
people behind it.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.120
And like the pharmaceuticals is something like that.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:50.520
So I think the other thing is that if consumers, if there was enough consumer experience that

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:58.440
they demanded it, the Centers for Alternative Medicine at NIH were formed because consumers

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.640
started asking for certain kinds of alternative medicines and the government was challenged

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:07.280
with the need to research it.

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.560
Nine billion dollars out of pocket in 2000.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.560
Right.

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:11.560
And that's what was happening.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.840
And what if as parents of kids with autism or people who've had strokes who are learning

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:22.160
to recover speech as they learn and hear about what music therapy can do, they're going to

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.720
start asking for it.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:27.960
And the more people are informed, it's like we have to do this major P or marketing campaign

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.200
and educate the general public.

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.560
But there's good research now.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.720
There's good scientific research because we can understand and see these brain make that

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.960
we couldn't see.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.960
And all of our doctors, Saks and I back in the 80s, early 80s, actually met with a group

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.560
of neuroscientists and said, can you help us study music in the brain?

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.680
And they said, no, you can't study music.

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680
Look how complex it is.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:50.680
It's so many different things.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.680
But now we are.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.240
Now we're able to piece a plot of different elements of it.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.040
One thing that, again, I don't have a sense of how big the field of music therapy is.

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:01.480
And I realized that there's many different kinds of disorders.

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:06.960
But one thing that I would find helpful is as a basic scientist, I'm sure patients would

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960
find that helpful.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.600
It's often to have a unified website that would have links to all of the good research.

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.200
Because there's such a wealth of research.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.240
And it's often really hard to evaluate the qualities of maybe some kind of studies that

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.200
at least have been maybe replicated once.

01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.800
There's actually some white papers.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.760
There's a couple of white papers on the American music therapy.

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.640
So musictherapy.org.

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:33.560
And if you go to conditions, there's actually pieces on PTSD and early childhood development

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.560
in the learning.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:36.040
You'd be nice to have it all in one place.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.680
Like climate change people now have really nice websites with a lot of needs.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.680
And to have it categorized.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:41.680
Exactly.

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:42.680
So that's a good idea.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:48.520
So some of the places where you can have people look are clinicaltrials.gov.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:55.360
So anything that's ongoing now or has been finished, that they can then look up the research,

01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.600
that's a good place for people to look.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.240
And the other thing is one of the things that I find or we have found over the years is

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.080
people are concerned.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.560
I'm not a singer, they'll say.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.560
I can't do that.

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.720
I'm not a singer.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.760
And the important thing to let people know is it's not about being a singer.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:18.040
It's about being a person who has this preserved area in their brain if it's a stroke person

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.360
or somebody that's had a traumatic brain injury.

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:23.200
They've got a part of their brain that works.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.680
And there's a very nice, there are a couple of very nice apps.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.360
I don't know if you know about these brain apps that you can show a 3D brain to people.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:34.200
You can turn it around and show them this is the part of your brain that's not working

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.480
the way it used to.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.680
We're going to train this part over here.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:42.040
And so they feel like I have this healthy thing that I can work with now.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:46.640
And you can assure people that this part of your brain is just fine.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.080
And that's the part we're going to use to help you get better.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.960
So I think to allay people's fears about the singing not matter, not mattering at all,

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.840
I've actually worked with several people who are tone deaf.

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.640
And it's not so much as I said before about the musical thinking that it is about the

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.840
way it sounds when it comes out.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.520
It's really not that important how it sounds.

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.720
It's about getting out your thought.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:18.920
Just a final question if I may regarding basically inversion to what extent we can turn our

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:25.520
attention to doctors as musicians themselves and what distinctions you might notice between

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:33.240
colleagues who approach the medical application of music from a training of musical, either

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:36.160
professionalism, musical theory, et cetera.

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:42.040
And then how would you characterize that kind of training as a fusion of music and medicine

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.880
or as a bridge between the two.

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.040
And in particular even though I realized the panel isn't approaching this from the perspective

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:55.680
of the musical industry itself, if you can offer any reflections on doctors as practicing

01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:00.960
musicians or doctors entering musical performance.

01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.960
Okay.

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:05.320
Take a question.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:13.800
Doctors as using music and medicine in a clinical context, all the doctors that I work

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.520
with see many patients every day.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:24.480
I don't see them being really enthusiastic about providing therapy with music or any

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.560
other sort.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.880
Music and medicine is a very interesting topic.

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:34.840
It is a growing field as well.

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.280
I'm trying to think of how many doctors I work with or musicians.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.640
Actually quite a few.

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:48.520
But they haven't ever expressed a need to participate in the music therapy sessions.

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:55.000
But they have been very enthusiastic about these music therapy with their patients.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.720
One of the things I think, and I don't know if this is also what you were asking, that

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:07.360
the creative approach to problem solving may be something that is more apt to happen with

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:14.160
a musically trained doctor than someone who is purely scientifically trained.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:19.200
And so I think in a lot of the medical schools now they're actually encouraging the physicians

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:24.520
as part of the medical school training to do the creative arts in some way, to really

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:29.520
get into those nonverbal type, also their own personal feelings in certain situations

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:34.080
so they can be more empathetic and open to the nuances of where the patient presents

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.840
them because nothing is ever really just clear clear, clear, black or white.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.920
So I think that way of creative thinking that's part of the music training is something that

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:45.640
they're trying, some medical schools around here actually try and impute.

01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.640
I think Wile Kornell.

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.040
Yeah, the ICON school has it.

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:49.040
And Wile Kornell.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:55.720
And the jazz pianist Fred Hirsch put out that record a couple of years ago about his experience

01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:03.000
of almost dying and the medical profession and this kind of coming together of musical

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.400
practice as part of the training of these doctors who were able to kind of help him,

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:15.040
you know, that's the substance of what his album of, I guess, three years ago was about.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:21.760
There's a very vibrant community of medical professionals in Boston that the law was

01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:26.200
something the orchestra actually, which is all medical professionals.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:33.480
And every concert they do is actually benefiting some area of research that needs to be done.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:37.920
So they're trying to raise awareness in that way and perhaps what you suggest will come

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920
next.

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:39.920
I don't know.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:40.920
Or maybe you know of something like that.

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:46.600
Even something like listening, you know, being able to listen to a patient and the nuances

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:53.200
of their verbal expression is something that a musician is more apt to be able to do.

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.600
So some doctors actually encourage to listen to music as a way of understanding the nuances

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.520
of speech when a patient comes to them.

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:02.520
Okay.

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.520
Thank you.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:04.520
Thank you.

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:05.520
Thank you.

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:06.520
Thank you.

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:07.520
Thank you.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:08.520
Thanks.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:38.480
Thank you.
