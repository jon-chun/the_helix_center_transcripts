00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Our roundtable today is composed of an intriguing mixture of musicians, producers, and theorists,

00:08.000 --> 00:17.000
all of whom from their unique perspectives have thought deeply about how we might understand the emotional impact of music.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Where do these emotional experiences arise?

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
And are these experiences unique to each listener?

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Or is there some universal quality to the way we all react to music?

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
In the Helix tradition, we encourage the participants to discuss first by themselves and then among themselves whatever they think is relevant to these issues.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And we'll see where the conversation takes us.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Let me introduce today's participants.

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
Let me start off with Greg Calby is a partner and senior managing engineer at Sterling Sound in New York,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
in New York City.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
For over 40 years, Mr. Calby has mastered more than 7,500 albums in various genres,

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
including the work of rock artists such as John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon, and David Byrne.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
In the jazz world, his credits include Miles Davis, David Sanborn, and Branford Marcellus.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
And in the current indie rock field, he's worked with such cutting-edge artists as Alabama Shakes and Passion Pit.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
Jesse Harris is an accomplished singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer of artists all over the world,

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
best known for having written and played guitar on Nora Jones' breakout hit Don't Know Why,

01:43.000 --> 01:52.000
for which he won the 2003 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. He has also had his songs recorded by numerous other artists,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
including Smokey Robinson, Willie Nelson, and Emi Lou Harris.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
As a solo artist, Mr. Harris has released over 10 albums, including his forthcoming release entitled Born Away.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Marina Corsakov Crane is a professional pianist and scholar in music cognition.

02:13.000 --> 02:21.000
Her research is focused on emotional responses to music and on perception of melodic transformation.

02:21.000 --> 02:32.000
Her recent work on music in the brain addresses musicianship-related brain plasticity from the point of view of a music cognivist

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
and practicing musician. She was trained initially as a pianist.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
Currently, Dr. Corsakov Crane collaborates with researchers on imaging studies in perception of motion-internal space.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.000
She is the author of two books, The Universe of Music and Music. She is the only one to talk with me.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
Dr. Gilbert Rose served for many years on the faculties of Yale University Medical School

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
and the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
He is the winner of the Sander-Lorand Essay Award of the Psychoanalytic Association of New York

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
and the Founders Teaching Prize of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
He is also, and currently a member of the Gardener Program for Psychoanalysis and the Humanities at Yale University.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
He is currently in private practice of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in Row Aiden, Connecticut.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
Dr. Rose is the author of several books, including Trauma and Mastery in Life and Art,

03:43.000 --> 03:53.000
Necessary Illusion, Art as Witness, and Between Couch and Piano, Psychoanalysis, Music, Art, Neuroscience.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
And the power of form.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
And the power of form, a psychoanalytic approach to aesthetic form.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
First book?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
First book.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
First book.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Finally, Alina Rubenstein is a psychoanalysts in private practice in New York City.

04:08.000 --> 04:17.000
She is on the faculty of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with the New York University Medical Center.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Dr. Rubenstein was raised in a family of musicians and has played the piano for all her life.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
She has served as a juror for the first four piano competitions for outstanding amateurs,

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
established in 1999 by the Van Kleibern Foundation in Fort Worth.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
An avid chamber of music participant, she performs in concert several times a year.

04:41.000 --> 04:49.000
Seven years ago, Dr. Rubenstein also began studying the cello, wishing to explore non-percussive techniques

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
of producing musical sounds.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
This is our panel.

04:52.000 --> 04:59.000
And we'll go around and each person will start and talk a little bit, and then we'll talk among ourselves, Dr. Rose.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Well, let me tell you how it all started.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
I was between 10 and 12, something like that.

05:12.000 --> 05:23.000
And browsing among my parents, 78s, I came across something which knocked me out.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
It was Jiekovsky's fifth and sixth symphonies.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
And I didn't know what hit me.

05:32.000 --> 05:41.000
So, I got in touch with my best friend Eddie, Eddie Danziger, who was all my traitors, damps, other stuff like that.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And I said, listen, you got to hear this.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
And I put on the fifth or the sixth.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
And he looked, he listened, and he looked very puzzled.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
I said, what do you think? What do you feel? He said, is it a steam engine?

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, from then I learned that music does not necessarily carry a message.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Well, the same message to everyone.

06:13.000 --> 06:25.000
Well, it was sometime after that, that when I got acquainted with more sophisticated things, let's say at age 14,

06:25.000 --> 06:36.000
I discovered that when my elder sister, who later became a disciple of Landowska, was playing the Beethoven sonatas,

06:36.000 --> 06:48.000
I discovered that the best possible place to listen to Irma playing the Beethoven sonatas was lying under the piano.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
The sound was fantastic.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
Well, it was a third discovery, and that was probably around the same time.

06:56.000 --> 07:08.000
I discovered that if when I listened to music, I would conduct at the same time with the record, it was so much more satisfying.

07:08.000 --> 07:19.000
And so I marched around the house, conducting the music along with whoever, and I found it very, very gratifying.

07:19.000 --> 07:28.000
Now, in a deeper sense, what I found was that it's all about motion.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
And later on I found out that motion and emotion are inseparable.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
So let's put me on to another thing.

07:41.000 --> 07:56.000
And what did it lead to? I have some notes here.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, that was...

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I'll skip what I have here and say something else.

08:09.000 --> 08:23.000
Later on I found some literature that music was capable of releasing jump-starting, in a better word,

08:23.000 --> 08:32.000
jump-starting people from devastating neurological conditions, temporarily, of course.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
There was something about music that went straight through.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And now I'm not going to read all of this, don't worry.

08:43.000 --> 09:03.000
I want to read something to you.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Anne was in a late stage of vascular dementia.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
At earlier point, she would succumb nightly to escalating panic and agitation, uncontrolled by drugs.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.000
Music, however, could restore a degree of calm.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Now she was no longer subject to panic.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
She was mostly withdrawn and indifferent to music, as well as the presence of intimates,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
whom she may or may not have still recognized.

09:35.000 --> 09:46.000
She really spoke. When she did utter a word or two, it was without any affect or any obvious referential content.

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
What about art? And whenever I have to say about music goes also for what I think about art,

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
I think they go through the same way.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
She had been an avid painter in a twice-run around the gallery.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
The painters had been among her closest friends.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.000
One day she was shown color illustrations of Monet and abstract paintings of Jim Eurenst, an old friend.

10:13.000 --> 10:21.000
She looked them all intently for many minutes and went unswerving attention,

10:21.000 --> 10:31.000
asked what she thought. She replied immediately and with the intensity that had once been so characteristic.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
This is really beautiful.

10:35.000 --> 10:45.000
Then, more astonishing still, it goes straight through.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
So, what goes straight through?

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Shall I tell you briefly or shall I tell you?

10:55.000 --> 11:10.000
What goes straight through is the implicit motion, which is what music and painting is all about, not actual motion, virtual motion.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
And the internal motion of affect.

11:15.000 --> 11:23.000
And I have theories which I won't go into about what is it about each of these in terms of tension and release.

11:23.000 --> 11:39.000
But I can say this, that when the external tension and release buried in the music or the art goes through to the internal tension and release of affect,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
there is an at-wanness.

11:43.000 --> 11:54.000
There is a unity. And this unity is at least for some of us, part of the experience of music.

11:54.000 --> 12:03.000
There is a oneness. In more technical language, there is an increased permeability of the ego boundaries of the person.

12:03.000 --> 12:15.000
So, there was. I think William James put it best when he said the arts, among other things, and we didn't say about the arts.

12:15.000 --> 12:31.000
He said it about varieties of religious experience. He said they alleviate the solitude of individuation.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
Not only, it's not limited to music or to art in an aesthetic moment.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
It's certainly characteristic of times of being in love.

12:44.000 --> 12:54.000
And as William James knew better than anybody, he was also characteristic of some varieties of religious experience.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
And at-wanness.

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
So, what kind of a contribution does this experience make, if any, beside the moment?

13:06.000 --> 13:22.000
I think it makes a contribution to one's affect regulation and also a sense of one's relationship between itself and world.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
And I think I'll shut up now.

13:29.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, his reaction to Tchaikovsky seems really pure.

13:36.000 --> 13:49.000
And I keep thinking about how today music is much more tied to popular culture

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
and has a lot to do with marketing.

13:55.000 --> 14:05.000
And so it's interesting to see how music is marketed and people respond to it based on how it's marketed to them.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
And it seems to me like a less pure connection to it.

14:12.000 --> 14:21.000
And I feel that music more than ever is marketed for the listener as opposed to being a pure expression.

14:21.000 --> 14:31.000
And I even think that popular music in the past seemed more pure, at least emotionally, than it does now.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
And I think that the end result is exactly what he said about it alleviates individuation

14:39.000 --> 14:47.000
because I think it's exciting for people to feel connected to a hit song.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
But sometimes I listen, I think, are they actually listening to the music?

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
But sometimes I listen to pop radio, not because I like it, because I want to see what's happening.

15:00.000 --> 15:10.000
And you notice a lot of songs that are about going to clubs and stuff like that.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
But I think that music makes people feel really excited.

15:16.000 --> 15:30.000
And for me personally, the way I listen to music is sometimes based on wanting to feel a certain way.

15:30.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah, I guess less alone in a moment, but also maybe happy or maybe not necessarily sad, but understood by another artist.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
I also think a lot about how I listen to music.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
I prefer to listen to vinyl records.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
For some reason, the sound connects to me more.

15:58.000 --> 16:07.000
And I don't know, it just feels warmer and more human.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
I've talked to Greg about this a lot.

16:12.000 --> 16:26.000
But in terms of my own writing, that's something that is more of like a habit, I guess.

16:26.000 --> 16:38.000
And I don't think so much about how it necessarily connects, but it's strange when some songs connect to people and others don't.

16:38.000 --> 16:48.000
And that's hard to identify.

16:48.000 --> 16:55.000
But I feel like I could just keep rambling and talking in different directions.

16:55.000 --> 17:09.000
Yes, I would like to make a small remark about your friend for whom...

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Is it your microphone?

17:12.000 --> 17:19.000
It's about your friend who did not recognize music in the fifth and sixth symphonies of Chikovsky.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
There is a very small percentage of listeners for whom music is not available.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
It's a very interesting condition. It's called Amusea.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
And people just don't recognize anything.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
They don't have...

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Maybe a little closer to...

17:42.000 --> 17:49.000
I mean, melodies because they are not able to recognize patterns of music.

17:49.000 --> 17:59.000
Because when we listen to music, we actually listen to musical sounds, which have very interesting relationships.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
They differ and they perceive tension. It was another very important word mentioned today.

18:05.000 --> 18:15.000
So when we listen to music, we listen to patterns of tones. It's like listening...

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
In distribution of different levels of energy and tonal felt.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
I don't want to talk too much about it. I want to go back to Amusea.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
So there is a small percentage of people. They are not able to recognize music.

18:31.000 --> 18:40.000
But everybody else is gifted from birth. We all are experts at birth.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Because our auditory system is ready before they are born.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
We already listen to music before they are born.

18:47.000 --> 18:56.000
And even two four months old babies recognize the basic, the most important melodic element of music.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
Consonant intervals and dissonant intervals.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
Moreover, they are very...

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
The way music...

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Convey information is very simple.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
People can say it's primitive, it's perceived tension.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
This is why music is available for everybody, even for people with very serious cognitive problems.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
We are all able to recognize music. It's incredibly generous art.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
By my vacation right now, I am applied philosopher.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
I am post-trained as a classical pianist in Russia.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
But then I became a cognitive scientist.

19:43.000 --> 19:50.000
It happened to study emotion. This is the last area I wanted to study.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
Because it's very difficult and it's very difficult to talk about emotion and music.

19:55.000 --> 20:06.000
But we still can measure something which would help us recognize some of the aspects of this magic which we call music.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
The experience of listening to Tchaikovsky for the first time.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
The first thing I thought about was when I was a kid, my dad was a real blue collar guy.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
He had a bread-rout delivery guy.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And if classical music ever came on his radio, he would always turn and say,

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
I hate that suicide music. He would always call classical music suicide music.

20:34.000 --> 20:44.000
So growing up, the experience I had besides the suicide music was the classical music that he used to play on the morning cartoons.

20:44.000 --> 20:54.000
But I don't know if any people who made those cartoons have produced them understand that that was extremely valuable to somebody who grew up in a house where there was no such thing as classical music.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
So the first time that I went to a classical concert was a Leonard Bernstein, a young people's concert.

20:59.000 --> 21:07.000
And it was an experience which affected me for the rest of my life because the beauty of it and the intensity of that point it was Carnegie Hall.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
But I'm not 100% sure I was somewhere at eight or nine years old.

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
But I remember the sound of the orchestra along with the fact that it was a music that it found very exotic to me.

21:17.000 --> 21:25.000
It really carried me into the field that I'm in right now and have been for 40 years, which is audio engineering.

21:25.000 --> 21:34.000
But as far as emotion goes funny, in the last few weeks I had an experience which really spoke to what we're talking about here.

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
I had the opportunity to see this new show on Broadway opening up called Motown. And it's just a history of Barry Gordy who founded Motown Records.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
And in the beginning of the show, the first scene is the temptations and the four tops.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
The guys playing those groups have kind of like a competition with each other.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
And it just literally plays these songs from really my teenage years.

21:57.000 --> 22:06.000
You know, people on this panel are all different ages, but this is a very musically such a formative time when your emotions and your connection to music happen.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
And I found myself three or four different times completely tearing up.

22:11.000 --> 22:18.000
I wasn't sobbing, but my eyes were watering. I was getting the chills and I was feeling something I just didn't understand.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
So after the show, my wife and I went out to dinner with another couple good friends of ours.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
And I said to the woman who's a, her name is Suzzy Road. She's a really great musician on her own right.

22:29.000 --> 22:35.000
And I said to everybody, I said, did anybody find themselves crying? And Suzzy said to me, yeah, a couple of times also.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
And we do not know what the trigger was. I mean, nostalgia is one thing.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.000
And I know that if someone grew up in a different time and never heard that music before and listened to it, I don't think they would be crying.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
And it also led me back to another situation that happened to me about 15 or 20 years ago in my studio.

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
A guy that I grew up with had really close friends with him in the eighth grade. He became a Franciscan monk.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
And still he's a Franciscan priest. And we hadn't seen each other for years.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
And we connected on the phone and he came to the studio and he brought a cassette with him in the cassette days.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
And was an artist, yes. Okay, great.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Why, I called him the mic, though.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
It felt so professional.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
So, it felt much better.

23:22.000 --> 23:30.000
So Kevin brings this cassette of Yani. And no offense to anyone here. Yani is what I would...

23:30.000 --> 23:36.000
When my way of thinking is kind of an insipid form of kind of new age-y kind of music.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
And he put this cassette in and the sound quality of the cassette was...

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
It sounded like he probably had dipped it in a cup of coffee before he came in and then put it in the machine.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
It was horrendous.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
And I was listening to this. I was looking at my speakers which was professional studios.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
And I'm just going, oh, this is unbelievably horrible. And I turned to Kevin.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
And he's got the conducting things in his hands, pencils.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
And he's doing this and he's crying. He is coming out of his eyes.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
And internally, I'm laughing. Because it's the worst thing I've ever heard. And to him, what he said to me was over.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
He just said, I can't thank you enough. That's the most beautiful I've ever heard that.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
Now, I'm not criticizing Kevin, but I'm just saying that this is the kind of thing when we talk about music and emotion.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
It speaks to so much of what music is about. The personal nature of it, the emotional nature of it.

24:26.000 --> 24:33.000
What we bring to this, you know, in my day-to-day work, I frequently get music sent to me from Asia.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
More and more recently, China, Korea, and Japan.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
And the other engineers, and I always kind of have an internal laugh we have with each other.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
But the Japanese rock is completely like another language.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
I mean, it's like, you don't understand the words, but you really don't understand what they're doing musically.

24:53.000 --> 25:02.000
So there's no emotion. So yesterday, just yesterday, in my studio, I had a Japanese jazz artist, a very, very talented woman plays marimba, like this giant marimba.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
And she saw one of these CDs that I had done that was, in my mind, was awful.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
And she looked at it, she went, oh, why is this great? This is great.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
And she really had to have this. And she's a very sophisticated musician.

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
So the relative nature of all this stuff and the emotional connection to me is really fascinating.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
And, you know, I think with the group that we have here, we really have all different generations.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
We have different, somewhere we bring into this. So I'm happy to be here talking about it and see what we come up with, you know?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Thank you.

25:29.000 --> 25:38.000
Well, I grew up in, I would say, bathed in classical music. My father was a concert pianist. So I...

25:38.000 --> 25:46.000
I also started out under the piano. An excellent place to start.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
And also trying to manipulate the pedals and competing with a younger brother for the pedals.

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
And don't remember, actually, when I started to play the piano, but it just seems like I always did.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
But that's, I think, probably a very common experience that you just feel like you all.

26:05.000 --> 26:12.000
You don't remember when you couldn't play. But it was never enforced. It was never forced on me.

26:12.000 --> 26:19.000
But I just loved it from day one. I played with four hands with my brother. Can you not hear me?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Not too well. Not too well?

26:22.000 --> 26:38.000
And, well, anyway, I was sort of considering, I wasn't really considering having a career as a pianist because I knew only too well the downside of it, which is, you know, traveling all the time.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
And some people love that, some people don't. It doesn't make for a very stable life, really.

26:44.000 --> 26:53.000
And the other part of it was my generation was the one, when I was a teenager Elvis Presley, erupted on the scene.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And so you can figure out where I fit into the scheme of things.

26:58.000 --> 27:07.000
And it was also a period of time, though, in certainly in classical music, women were very little represented at that time.

27:07.000 --> 27:21.000
And the thought of being, you know, the reviews would say things like, for a woman, you know, she played pretty, and you basically were sort of restricted to, you know, most women to Mozart and stuff like that.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
And, well, something just happened.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
To where Mozart.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
Mozart, right.

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
But I was, and after a few starts in other areas, I was briefly a graduate student in comparative literature.

27:40.000 --> 27:58.000
And I really wanted to go to medical school, but as I was saying before, it was also a period of time where not too many women thought, especially who came from families that didn't have, you know, doctors or scientists in the background, they didn't really think of that.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
But that's what I ended up doing.

28:02.000 --> 28:15.000
And I always sort of was gravitated towards psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, I think in part because I think I'm a reasonably good listener.

28:15.000 --> 28:27.000
And I think there was some, I can't think of the right word, correlation there between listening to music, you know, as I did.

28:27.000 --> 28:32.000
And listening to people various, you know, carefully.

28:32.000 --> 28:46.000
But I've become even more, I mean, the other part of it was that since my father was a musician, my grandfather, my brother, and my mother and sister were both dancers.

28:46.000 --> 28:51.000
So, I mean, we were really surrounded by music in motion.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
And the conducting went on a lot at home too.

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
But I've always been just so passionate about it and about hearing it, the emotions that it evokes in me.

29:05.000 --> 29:19.000
And I'm connecting to what you said, I think that those are very subjective and that the form, the formal aspects of music lend themselves because they can't be translated into words.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
I don't think this is working.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
Okay.

29:26.000 --> 29:34.000
It lends itself to projecting whatever emotion and or meaning if we can try to define that, that one wants to.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
If you want to feel a certain way, you may know that certain music will evoke that kind of feeling.

29:40.000 --> 29:49.000
You'll put it on and kind of enjoy having the feeling, including sad feelings, including, you know, some of the negative feelings.

29:49.000 --> 30:03.000
But I think the main thing that I really find my connection to music is in actually playing it, making the sounds myself.

30:03.000 --> 30:14.000
And I've always played the piano and as I think you said, I took up the cello about six years ago, which was a little bit risky given my advanced stage.

30:14.000 --> 30:19.000
But I thought maybe it would stave off dementia among others.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
But that wasn't really the reason.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Because it's not that easy.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
But I always love the sound of the cello specifically.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
And I'm always very interested in why people are attracted to certain kinds, certain particular sounds.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
And I think they are.

30:36.000 --> 30:44.000
And also, I wanted to be able to sustain a tone, which you can't do on the piano.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
And I could go on.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
And I had a religious, I'm not religious, but music is a religion for me.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
And playing the Bach Suites was another goal that made me take up the cello.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
And I could go on and on.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
But I won't at the moment.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Can I ask you a question?

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
So, I mean, obviously playing piano your whole life and now cello is a new thing.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
But is there a way to figure how you feel?

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
I mean, asking to shrink how you feel is funny.

31:15.000 --> 31:22.000
I mean, is there a different emotion that you get from yourself when you play cello?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Are you at that level where you can actually feel like you're pretty?

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
Well, one of the other things that you're reminding me of is the piano is a giant piece of machinery.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
And you're not going to be able to play with wood and metal.

31:35.000 --> 31:42.000
And when you play with other people, you're still not sort of in the music in the same way as if you play a string quartet or whatever.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
Because the thing that has to be away from everybody else.

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
And you're usually making the most noise and often in classical chamber music.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
You never get a break.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
The melody instrumentalists usually have to breathe or their arm gets tired.

32:00.000 --> 32:08.000
So, one turn our pages in between the, you know, the, you know, sixteenth rest that they give us.

32:08.000 --> 32:20.000
And I wanted to be able to play in like a quartet or in a group where I vibrate the strings along with the other people vibrating their strings literally.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
I mean, you want to be on the same wavelength to use all the slightly corny metaphors.

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
But the other thing about the cello, obviously, is you can wrap yourself around it. It's a very sensual instrument.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.000
It's not as big as the bass, which is a little too big, especially for somebody like me.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
But the cello is just perfect. It has that shape that allows you to embrace it.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
You feel it the whole instrument vibrating when you play it.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
And, you know, you can't be more in the music for me than that.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
I'm sure singers would say that they, because their instrument is actually their body, literally.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
But the cello is as close as I felt I could do.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Have you found other players?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
Oh, yeah.

32:58.000 --> 33:06.000
Now, now I have, it took me about two or three years to make a sound that I didn't want to run away from while I was making it, but I'm past that.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Yes.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
I want to infuse a little bit of science in this conversation.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
You mentioned dimension.

33:19.000 --> 33:36.000
I want to go first to children. The recent studies showed that already after six months of studying, children show advantage in memorization on tasks which are related to IQ.

33:36.000 --> 33:52.000
We also know today that people who studied music in their childhood, they showed certain kind of age defiance and their cognitive functions at all the age.

33:52.000 --> 34:02.000
And as a music educator, I would say everybody, don't put aside your desire to study music. It's never late.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.000
One of the best cases in my practice as a piano teacher was a 63-year-old beginner.

34:08.000 --> 34:16.000
I registered Newers who became a wonderful pianist just in couple years, but she was very disciplined.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
You were person.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Did you want to say something?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm sorry?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Then you want to say something?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, it wasn't direct.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I'll say something.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
But I'll raise it now anyway.

34:28.000 --> 34:39.000
To my colleague here especially, I read a PhD thesis recently for an institution.

34:39.000 --> 34:46.000
It was about, well, one specific thing about it.

34:46.000 --> 35:02.000
It talked at the end about musical listening and made the point that for a therapist to listen musically was a very big asset.

35:02.000 --> 35:12.000
And what the point that she made was that you're listening both globally to the overall and at the same time for details.

35:12.000 --> 35:19.000
And it struck me that this is, I think, that I recognize something in that.

35:19.000 --> 35:29.000
And I wanted to, from you and your experience as a therapist, analyst as well as a musician, this thought makes any sense to you.

35:29.000 --> 35:35.000
It makes sense, but I don't know that I would necessarily be aware of doing it at the time.

35:35.000 --> 35:48.000
And I suspect that most analysts listen, you know, and they hear repetitions, they hear themes, they hear variations on the themes, all of which are musical concepts.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
But I think I enjoy listening in general.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
So I think that's one of the attractions.

35:58.000 --> 36:10.000
But I also, I think I'm, I like to be aware of the nonverbal aspects of the treatment too, which I think music is more in some ways connected to.

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
And I think also connected to the earliest mother-child matrix.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
And I think you raised that point.

36:18.000 --> 36:24.000
And I feel like that's something that I'm more aware of attending to as an analyst.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
The silence is especially.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
Somebody said that the most important part about music are the rests.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
The space is between the notes. Who said that?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
The notes are on.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Only Mozart.

36:39.000 --> 36:46.000
But also the silence before and after, which I think are not really necessarily thought about.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
So you listen to music in order to restore the silence and listen to the silence.

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
I think that's a very, for me that's a very important idea.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
This is a conversation.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Can you hear me?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Yes.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
This is a conversation about emotion.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
And as a educator, I just cannot help myself, but try to understand where they begin.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
It's kind of ambitious task.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
But my doctor will study, actually, address this task.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
Music psychologists, when they talk about music, they say,

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
tonal space.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
So when we listen to music, we travel internal space.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
And you mentioned motion, most important thing.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
And actually my lectures were called,

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
motion internal space and emotion.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.000
It's produced by motion internal space.

37:52.000 --> 37:59.000
I want to just say just a few little things about the origin of tonal space.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
And for this I will need this piano and I'm sorry to bother you,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
but I don't need to touch the piano.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah.

38:08.000 --> 38:17.000
Okay.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
Oh, yeah.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
I'll just take the phone.

38:27.000 --> 38:34.000
It's in two.

38:34.000 --> 38:47.000
So when we listen to music, we listen musical sounds, which actually have a status in this tonal space.

38:47.000 --> 38:54.000
Imagine that in music, the relationship between sounds, like relationship within a society.

38:54.000 --> 39:03.000
When I play a simple scale, the tones of the scale they differ in their frequency

39:03.000 --> 39:11.000
and pitch, but most importantly, differ in their attraction to first note.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
This is very unstable.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
And this is very stable.

39:16.000 --> 39:27.000
And I want to play two very short samples to explain why music is something like tonal force field.

39:27.000 --> 39:35.000
It's going to be the beginning of a prelude from Will Tempered Clavier by Jürgen Sibachinbach.

39:35.000 --> 40:04.000
And it sounds very peaceful now with...

40:04.000 --> 40:13.000
So what happened that in the tonal space we suddenly found ourselves very far away from stability.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
And this is how we perceive music as a pattern of stability and instability.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
When it's unstable, it gives us feeling of tension.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
When it's still feeling of release.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
And this is what we listen to music.

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
This is why music talks to everybody because the morphological principle in music,

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
the way the message, the communication structure, is very simple.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's understood by everybody.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
It's either sound harmonious or not.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
This is what four months, months they do not like.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
They like this.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
They like this and people don't like this.

41:02.000 --> 41:10.000
So the music is made from tense and relaxed elements.

41:10.000 --> 41:21.000
But the magic begins when those sensations of tension and relaxation are sequenced in time.

41:21.000 --> 41:29.000
And the best explanation of this was done by Susan Langer, a wonderful American philosopher.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
She told that in music we have logical emotion.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Not just emotion, but logical emotion.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
It's not something we suddenly frightened of.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Or we are hungry.

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
No, in music what is given to us by music is a complex aesthetic emotion.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It's like living through life again.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
We live through life again.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
In time, this is the only little art which is so tightly connected to time.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It's humanized time.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
So when we listen to music, we listen to those sequences of

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
tension and releases, they work like triggers for our neurophysiological system.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
And somehow those triggers, they create emotion in us.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
Now think how we all react to the outside world.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
And not only will, let's say some little animal.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
If something frightening, it would be tension.

42:30.000 --> 42:36.000
If we have a nice dinner, a nice friend, a tuck in his friend,

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
they are relaxed.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
This is the simplest reaction of the living organism.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Tension and relaxation.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
And this is what music imitates.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Tension and relaxation.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
And those sequences of tension and relaxation, they create emotional state.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Very strange thing.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I think it's really magic.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
What about music that's all distance or all tension?

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
Because some people don't like to hear consonants.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
They like to hear noise.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I think that's all right.

43:11.000 --> 43:18.000
And it was actually a moment, kind of a gracism moment in 20th century

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
against the dictatorship of the analysis.

43:21.000 --> 43:30.000
But the first is, it kind of coincided with changes in societal structures.

43:30.000 --> 43:37.000
That would happen when Schoenberg, who was called a tanales to his great tradition,

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
introduced a new system which defined the role of the analogy, the tension and the release.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
The system was quite strict.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
But it's interesting that musicians listened to autonomous music.

43:51.000 --> 43:59.000
They still are trying to find some points to tie,

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
and find some system of reference because when we perceive this world,

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
we always perceive it in some system of reference.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
If it's a real world, it's a Cartesian coordinates.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
If it's music, it's a scale, just simple scale.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
But this analysis is a wonderful, expressive element.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
And if you look into, if you hear to music by Bach,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
he predicted a lot of things.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.000
He predicted autonomous music, polytronome music, and whole tone scale.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
You can find everything. But of course, then we had Liszt,

44:31.000 --> 44:39.000
who was a tremendous revolutionary Wagner, and then in 20th century Schoenberg and Bergh,

44:39.000 --> 44:46.000
and then kind of extreme, it was Carl Haus and Sinoquez,

44:46.000 --> 44:50.000
who used acoustic music, just random numbers.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
And he created some sounds, some masses of sounds, but not tonal sounds.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
So in music today, we basically talk about tonal music, about melodies and harmonies,

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
and this music lives in this simple, simple scale.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
I'm just wondering with Jesse and Greg, in terms of popular music,

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
in terms of, let's say, post-punk music, which seems to have no

45:19.000 --> 45:25.000
integrative, which has no restfulness to it, which has no scale to it, as I understand it,

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
how you would see this fitting in with the kind of classical music.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
As we were going through the different composers and the different elements in the classical form,

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
I was trying to kind of equate that with my world.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
And Jesse's world, and the people who are involved in popular music,

45:45.000 --> 45:50.000
I would say all the way from early 60s up to now, which is a huge buy-up work now,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
and actually being studied academically.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
And people bring so much emotion to what they expect from their music,

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
and as far as dissonance, I mean, there are people that go to rock shows

46:04.000 --> 46:09.000
specifically to feel aggressive, to feel more aggressive than they are,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
to find a safe place for their aggression.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
I've always been amazed by the people that come into the studio

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
when I'm working on a heavy metal album.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
You might have noticed this too from the people that, you know,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
these are the gentlest souls that I've met.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
For the most part, the gentlest people that I meet,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
the most aggressive people that I meet in my business

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
are the hyper-intellectual kind of new music people.

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
Well, the poets and the people who are searching to be unique are the hardest people.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
For me, those are the hardest people to deal with.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Those are the people with the edge. Those are the most insecure people.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
They're looking for a special place in the music.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
But the people who, like for example, are into heavy metal,

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
there's a sense of community. I was thinking about this before.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
There was a film that many of you I'm sure saw recently called Amour

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
about. It was a fantastic film.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
You remember the opening of the film from the stage out into the audience?

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
It's a classical piano. Did you see the film?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Fabulous. Fabulous film.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
But the beginning is a classical pianist gets on stage.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
You don't watch him. You watch the audience reaction.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
I swear it's about five minutes of just watching people in stillness.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
You're looking at this and you're wondering, what is everybody thinking?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
What is each of these individuals doing there?

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
When I go to a concert, and my wife and I go to maybe two or three

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
a year and done frequent concert, goers.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
To me, there's a sense of isolation.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
You're listening and you're emoting to the music internally.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
Rock music is not like that. Rock music is like a celebration of the artist

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
and in community with the people who are there, who've also decided to come

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
and enjoy it together. This type of music will fuse people together.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
This is across many genres, I think.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
It's an appreciation. It's a support for the artist as an individual,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
which I'm sure in a classical show if you really know the performers

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
and you know the cellists, for example, and you go and watch this fantastic

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
house and there's that feeling. But for the most part, I think people go

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
to internalize the feelings of the music.

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
This is not, Jesse, maybe you can speak to this as well.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
I find that the communal, especially in the 60s, there were groups in the 60s

48:19.000 --> 48:23.000
where if you went to see, for example, the incredible string band in 1969,

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
everybody in the show was on LSD.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
And you knew that.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
And you knew that they were and they knew you were.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
There's a community based around this. And this, to me, is the same thing.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
And exactly the same thing is if you go to the Abyssinian Baptist Church

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
on a Sunday and everybody's singing, it's a religious type experience.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
And I think that communion, exactly.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.000
And I see this when I go out, I see this, it shows.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
And to me, it's a very, very interesting thing.

48:56.000 --> 49:01.000
And because when you speak to someone else's music

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
or they speak to the music that you don't understand, you tend to kind of drift back.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
They mentioned downstairs, Justin and I were speaking and talking about a couple of artists

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
that maybe some of the folks never heard this.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Everybody kind of gets in their little corner.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Well, I don't know what they're talking about. I don't know what they're talking about.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
That's what's great about the classics is that we all have at least some knowledge of that,

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
whereas Passion Pit, most of the people in this room probably haven't heard.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
You know what I mean, though.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
I totally agree.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable when I go to concerts because it seems sort of like

49:30.000 --> 49:34.000
I don't know, like some sort of hero worship or something.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
And sometimes I feel the people think they have to act a certain way,

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
especially these days.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
And even the way that they cheer the music is a certain type of sound that they make.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
And it makes me uncomfortable.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
And sometimes I don't even think they're listening to the music.

49:51.000 --> 49:57.000
They're just going to live out the experience that they think they're supposed to, you know.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
They act the way they think they're supposed to act.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I'm being cynical, I think.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
But I do feel...

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
We've been around it a lot.

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
On the other hand, this is something that's come to mind for some reason,

50:10.000 --> 50:16.000
but I went to see Randy Newman perform in Central Park once, maybe ten years ago.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
And he just played the opening chords of, I think it's going to rain today on the piano.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
And the woman sitting next to me burst into tears.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
And literally just burst into tears and shrieked and put her face in her hands.

50:28.000 --> 50:36.000
So, I mean, popular music can have an incredible impact like that.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
I keep thinking about how it is today.

50:40.000 --> 50:46.000
And again, a friend of mine said to me once, it was John Zorn actually.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
He said, I think people, and he's someone who makes all kinds of music.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
And for him to say this is pretty interesting.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
But he said, I think people just listen to music that makes them feel cool.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
He said, they just want to hear, you know, they just want to feel cool.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
And so they're like, cool is, I don't know, maybe, maybe, I mean, this would be really reductionist,

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
but maybe you put on classical music because it makes you feel cultured, you know.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
Or you feel like, I'm being, I'm sorry, I know that there's more to it than that.

51:16.000 --> 51:25.000
But maybe you feel like you can create your own world when you put on that music and you listen to it or you play it.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
And you know, you can shut out the rest of the noise maybe, you know.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
And for people who like rock, they put on the band, they like, and they feel like, I'm cool too, you know.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I practice.

51:37.000 --> 51:43.000
Yeah, I practice, first of all, classical music grew up from popular music.

51:43.000 --> 51:56.000
You know, when Luther in Protestant Germany was working on creating, you know, vocabulary of hymns at the churches.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
Some of his songs he used had very questionable content, just obscene content.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
And he would say, we should save it from the clutches of devil.

52:06.000 --> 52:13.000
When you think about the best melodies like Schrubert, he wrote 600 songs.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
And the main formula that popular music uses, it's the same.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
It's the main formula of melodic motion.

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
And this is what the box, uh, uh, uh, period starts with.

52:26.000 --> 52:41.000
This is all. It's like the law of notion in Newtonian physics is three chords in classical music.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Three chords, everything as is derivative.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
So, uh, there is not huge difference.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
It's just some classical music, like, same altered.

52:51.000 --> 53:00.000
Orchistakovich, ochigoski, it's just somewhat more structured and carries a lot of information,

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
which is not perhaps easy.

53:05.000 --> 53:15.000
It's easy, but it's just different kind of information that, um, that, um, let's say heavy metal of, uh, popular music and carry.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
It's just different levels.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
But the matter is the same.

53:21.000 --> 53:26.000
Now, if you were talking before, you were mentioning the importance of tension.

53:26.000 --> 53:32.000
And right after that, you were speaking about the importance of release.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
But that's the whole story.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Tension and release.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Patterns of tension and release.

53:40.000 --> 53:48.000
Certain ones will correspond with patterns of tension and release in different emotions.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
And I think that's what goes straight through.

53:52.000 --> 53:58.000
The correspondence between patterns of tension and release in the music.

53:58.000 --> 54:03.000
And internally, with certain effects, makes a click.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
It goes straight through.

54:07.000 --> 54:15.000
I also think that popular music perhaps uses reasons more aggressively and more aggressively.

54:15.000 --> 54:24.000
And it actually just kind of minds on our physiology because we do have this regularity in our lives.

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
So it's rather on the side of our ethnicity, than on the side of militarism.

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
But I don't see any chosen between them, frankly.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
There's a record I was just listening to this morning.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
I just think people might find it interesting.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
It's popular music.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
It's a young artist named James Blake.

54:47.000 --> 54:53.000
And it's an interesting record because it has all the elements that you're talking about.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
There are these long moments of silence where you think the song is over.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
And then all of a sudden the song keeps going.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
And then it seems to stop again and then a beat comes in.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
Some of it is acoustic piano, some of it's electronic.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
I think it's worth checking out.

55:14.000 --> 55:24.000
I just wanted to say, get back to something you said before about you put music and other arts together.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
And I'm not sure if I totally agree with that.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
Of course I'm biased, I'm sure.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
I think music is different in the sense that first of all it's invisible really.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
When it's being played, where is it?

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
It's not like something you can touch or look at or anything like that.

55:45.000 --> 55:56.000
And it starts and ends in time and therefore uses uptime in a certain way, sort of mimics what happens to us over time too.

55:56.000 --> 56:04.000
So I really don't like to lump it in with the other arts, although I'm certainly not as knowledgeable about it.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
I'm talking about the aesthetic of aesthetics.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
The aesthetic of aesthetics.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
And the theory of aesthetics.

56:09.000 --> 56:19.000
And in my theory of aesthetics, patterns of tension and release exist in music in their own ways, in their own language.

56:19.000 --> 56:24.000
And as they exist in, let's say, painting.

56:24.000 --> 56:30.000
Matisse says, a line is not just a line.

56:30.000 --> 56:37.000
A line is a stroke against the indifference of the background.

56:37.000 --> 56:45.000
He said to his students, try to find out where that line is driving to go.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
He's talking about the dynamics of visual aesthetics.

56:50.000 --> 56:58.000
Just as you were talking about the dynamics of the piano, when you play the scale, you can't leave it at the seventh.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
It has to go to the eighth.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
It has to resolve.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
That's tension and release.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
Now it's in that sense that I'm putting the work together.

57:07.000 --> 57:13.000
I just have always felt that music is much more embodied in a certain way.

57:13.000 --> 57:24.000
It's just because it picks up on our body rhythms and because it's not visible, you know, and it vibrates in you.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
And I guess to me that makes it, I mean, and then how do we talk about what it means?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
There are no words.

57:32.000 --> 57:42.000
And even with painting, it seems to, or the plastic arts in general, it seems as if it might be easier to talk about them in words.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
But music is such a challenge.

57:44.000 --> 57:58.000
And this is an aside, but I have to say in spite of my great love for psychoanalysis, I never have really forgiven Freud for being a Viennese Jew who had really little interest in music.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
I'm sure there was an issue there.

58:03.000 --> 58:09.000
And he also got rid of his older sister's piano because it was annoying him.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
So I just wanted to get that on the table.

58:12.000 --> 58:23.000
Well, he also confessed that he could not bear to stand any odd unless he knew what the meaning of it was.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
And that's beside the point.

58:26.000 --> 58:32.000
The meaning of it is the reaction you have spontaneously when you first hear it.

58:32.000 --> 58:40.000
And then all the other meanings that have come in the course of time and the stages of life go through different meanings.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
They're attributed.

58:41.000 --> 58:54.000
I'm talking about this spontaneous reaction, which I think has to do with patterns of tension and release in one language of music and in another language in visual art, but still tension and release.

58:54.000 --> 59:02.000
I have very important things to add because we talk about pleasure of music.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
So I have to talk about neurophysiology of perception of music.

59:05.000 --> 59:13.000
It activates biological reward center, which is also involved in our pleasure of food and sex.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
And another thing about the...

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Does all music do that to certain...

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Pleasureable music.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
But that's somewhat subjective.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
No, no, no, this is what they found. It could be a music designer, actually.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
It still activates biological reward center, pleasure center.

59:30.000 --> 59:38.000
And just a very minor addition to conversation about these communions when music is very loud.

59:38.000 --> 59:47.000
It could actually be dangerous for our auditory system when I see cars with small children and there's very loud music.

59:47.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It also hurts me because I know that the poor child and his parents could suffer a loss of hearing in our very delicate organ of courty in our cochlea.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
They have outer inner cells and outer cells like Celia.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
They work as amplifiers.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And if they're destroyed and they can't be destroyed, if there is a consistently loud sound, they cannot be restored.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This is why people can start losing their hearing, their theories.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
If they work in a very loud band.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Well, we could have an entire seminar about hearing loss and loud.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I mean, loud is part of the world right now.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I mean, I have the audiologist that I go to says when he started, he's in his 60s now.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
He says when he started all his patients, he was in his 30s, most of them were in their 60s,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
he says he routinely gets people in their 30s now, have severe hearing loss.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:50.000
People are using the in ear headphones and running and spending hours and hours with that pressure on their ears.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Cars, I mean, I'm sure everybody in this room has left at least one restaurant.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I've left maybe 10 restaurants a dish in the last two years because you couldn't hear the people on the other side of the table.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I mean, that's another, you know, that's another whole thing.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But, you know, it really makes you wonder, like, why is this?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Why do people like loud?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
There's some stimulation from loud.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Otherwise, people would shy away from it, but so many people, I'm not one of them, but so many people need loud.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They need the distraction of loud. They need the physicality.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I mean, the guy who comes next to you in the SUV where you hear everything and your car is moving like this and his car is shaking like this,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
he's getting something from that. He likes moving. He likes his ass moving in that seat.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And there's something really important about the physical nature of music for people, but, you know, the body is not really adapted to this.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I don't think it was always like that. I think that's what it's about.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
The technology has developed to the point where you can drive around and you can have, you know, 250 dB in your car.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And the restaurants now have, you know, the ability to have speakers everywhere coming down from the top and the sides.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
You know, in the 50s and 60s, when we grew up, we didn't have that.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So I feel sorry for the kids.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
What it indicates with a kind of music which is both loud and where tension predominates over relaxation.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I'm talking about kind of music that you would know, which is very different than Schoenberg, you know,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and what is it about the times that we live in, the period that we live in, where this seems to be how people are recognizing themselves in painful music almost.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
And a kind of addiction to tension.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Well, what Greg does dictates a lot of how music is heard, you know, in the mediums that we have today,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
because when people go to have their albums mastered, what Greg does is the final stage of that,

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and he can change the way the music sounds, depending on what people want,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
but most people go to Greg because they like his aesthetic, but at that final stage, you can make music more aggressive.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You can make it louder or you can make it softer, you can make it brighter, or you can have more bass,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and that has so much influence on your perception of the music.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And I've had certain albums of mine that I had to have remastered completely because the first take that the mastering engineer, not Greg, by the way,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:26.000
that the mastering engineer had did was too aggressive, and he just figured, well, I wanted to make your music like other people's,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
and bring out that sound and bring the volume up.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
When you bring the volume up, you bring up an aggressive feeling.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000
If you let the volume go down, you know, stay in a little bit of a lower point, then you can have music that breathes more.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But most of the records that are made these days, I think they go for the highest level that they can get.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
They go for sound, they kind of push his forward, every element kind of becomes equal,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
so that the feeling is kind of like listening and being like pushed into a wall,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
where, I mean, Jesse creates music different than this, and the opportunity that I had to work with him a few times,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000
and he'll be part of create music that has, when you say dynamics, it means you can feel the variation in the amplitude of the different instruments.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So you have much more of a rhythmic, you have much more of this rather than this, and people, musicians, I think a lot of musicians have been around music so much,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
and I think that they almost like, it's like I have one sugar, I have two sugars in my coffee, I have six sugars, I have six sugars,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
and I'll have a little bit of a five hour energy, and it's almost like an addiction for excitement, but you kind of lose the perspective.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
So, you know, I deal with people in a way that I have to understand what is going to, I have to do something that they're going to approve.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
My work is for the artist to get something that he wants, and a lot of these artists need that feeling of excitement,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and they also need the feeling that when they play something compared to someone else's music that it has as much intensity.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So, in that way, that intensity to that person could read forwardness, and I've worked with a lot of musicians lately,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
who are almost deaf in their 40s. I mean, it's really unbelievable. I'll do things, and I go like, I can't hear what you're doing.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It's like I've been on stage two long, or, you know, it's, the thing that strikes me about this conversation that we're having is how, you know,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
all our different experiences depend on the types of music that we listen to or involved in,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000
but you know, you keep pointing up the universal nature of the experience, and I think that's a good combination of what is it about the music,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and different kinds of music, and then I'm sure everybody in this room at times today has kind of like zoned out,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
and then other people are like, oh yeah, I understand that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's a very, very personal thing, our feelings about our music.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Well, I think one thing a psychoanalyst, you may not agree about the need for intensity and volume is in order not to listen to what's inside.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Inside your own head. Yes.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
To get away, escape.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Exactly.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Mm-hmm.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I agree.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
We've decided.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
To listen.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I have a number of hats.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Consider it settled.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Well, music is an escape into another world.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And, you know, when I was a kid, my father's Sinatra records, that was a visit to, you know,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
52nd Street in the 1940s. I had never been to 52nd Street. I wasn't born until 1949.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I never went to jazz clubs, but, you know, to read, to hear Sinatra's world, and to hear the horns,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
and everybody just creates a visual, you know, like an imagination.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
True.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And these are little climates, little rooms that we walk into with the different music,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
and it's, Jesse is fascinating because you've been doing a lot of international recording,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.000
and you've been in Brazilian, and you write in different genres. Maybe you can discuss a little bit of how you, you know, you kind of write folk genres

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and, you know, in more rhythmic Latin America and South American.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, I mean, what I was thinking of actually was, because we've been talking so much either about classical music or popular music,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:18.000
but just about, I don't know, maybe more indigenous music or folk music and have had functions,

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
and also tonally have that functions because a lot of that music has nothing to do with the scale that we've been talking about at all.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And yet, it can reach a level of sophistication equal, if not more, to the Western scale.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And those tensions and releases are completely different.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And so that sort of calls on the question that basic feeling of what, you know, the human, the universal human response to sound,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000
because actually in other places it's not the same.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But it seems to me that it's culturally determined all over the world.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It did.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It did.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It was a study recently with people listening to music from different cultures.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Exactly what you just have.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And they found that there are, there are non-anounce people respond to it, just tiny differences.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah, the cultural differences again, but still the most important things are captured.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So something about music, it's really universal language, somehow it reaches everybody.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Even if it's kind of a very distant culture, it still arrives to us.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.600
But I think what you're suggesting is that the patterns of tension and release are very

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.640
different and there are all kinds of cultural things.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.200
But the basics that must be there in every culture, that is a way of kind of integration

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.800
which human beings can't live without.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800
Absolutely.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800
Very different.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:02.320
Because we listen to, we're very used to a pretty even meter.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.960
But if you listen to music from other parts of the world you can't even tell where it

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.320
begins and where it ends.

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.280
It doesn't seem to have a meter, some of it.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.720
And furthermore it seems at times to be speeding up and slowing down at the same time.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.080
And people can, they do this just naturally, that's how they play and that's how they

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.720
hear things.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:32.120
But yeah, I mean, sure the response to music, whether no matter what kind of music is universal.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.400
Yes, people are moved by it.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.080
In fact, I would even say perhaps they're more moved by some indigenous cultures because

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.240
it is in fact religious.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.240
It's ritualistic.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:57.880
I think you have to be exposed from a very young age to whatever kind of music, to really

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.680
appreciate it and have emotions in response to it.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:09.520
I mean, I think if you haven't grown up hearing classical music, with people who love it,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.080
in that setting, why would you?

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080
Maybe even more.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.880
Or any other kind of music.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.360
More mysterious in that because I keep thinking of what you were saying before about you and

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.440
your father.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.240
He couldn't listen to something and couldn't hear it at all.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.440
You listened to something and it moved you very, very much.

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:32.080
And it's a kind of mystery as to what it is that even with you that allowed you to hear

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.400
something and know that it spoke to you and that those rhythms were responding to some

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.920
difference probably between people, between effective organizations that people have.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.240
What that has to do with education and class is very complicated.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240
It is complex.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.960
I mean, I remember in the 60s when you meet somebody, and I was in my 20s, and you meet

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.120
somebody 60 years old.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.120
They're like, I love the Beatles, they would say, I said, wow, how does this person who

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.320
is 60 years old like the Beatles, when this is like in the 60s?

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.840
You very rarely meet someone.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.640
And then they would say, I love that song, Michelle, or one of the real melodic ones.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.640
But there's a cultural barrier to cross.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.280
And I'd be curious in this room how many people have listened to hip hop, then all of a sudden

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280
it's like, you know what I have to do?

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280
They want hip hop song.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.280
I really like that one.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:19.440
You know, I mean, how many people are open to that?

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.000
Or how many people just as soon as they hear the genre, they hear the style just, whoop,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.520
it's not mine, it's not mine.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520
Just close right up.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.040
And you know, no matter what the lyrics are, no matter how socially relevant they are,

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.080
melodically just like, that's not my music, I'm not going there.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.400
There's a certain music that we can't hear.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.880
We literally can't hear.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
Yeah.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:43.640
So I wanted to take some, if there are questions that people would like to ask, the participants,

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:52.840
please go over to the mic and you could just say who you are.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:59.840
If you want to name, is that it?

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840
Sure.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840
That's Roger's.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:10.320
I appreciated hearing that Freud had no experience of music.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.400
I think it's an experience.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.240
Well, he rejected it.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.360
And I find that it's a mystery, is anyone writing about it?

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.360
I think that's phenomenal.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:26.640
Do you know if anyone is writing about it?

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.840
I think it's been, I mean, I must have read it so.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:34.360
Do I have something Google for that something?

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:44.840
Well, what we're talking about was people being locked in to look with, with genres that

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:49.280
they wouldn't listen to, wouldn't listen to us thinking of the movie Mr. Holmes Opus,

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.880
where he played a classical theme.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:58.320
It was the mid-Yewen G, but they knew it as a toy, as a Motown song lovers could cheer

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.320
it up.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.360
And sometimes it can, and sometimes it's like, it's like that, sometimes you can just

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:06.960
take one song sometime to one little piece that's just a little bit different when somebody

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.600
might start to embrace it when they didn't embrace before because it just touches them.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:19.240
And I know that also, well, I mean, a lot of British rock and 60s did borrow.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:25.520
They were magical classical music from American blues.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.360
It was like a hybrid, this is the thing going on.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:38.160
It's just like this playing, this is a thing, music is taking grove over time.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.080
And I guess this really is that whether there's some extent that any particular genre is

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.360
being monolithic and it's not really not, it's always been some variation within any type

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360
of music.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.560
And there could be one particular song that somebody heard that from either a group,

01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:01.800
and they might want to give them, they would consider giving a lot of their kind of music,

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.080
another listen, just give it another chance.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.640
The modern hip hop music uses samples from all different sources, from classical sources,

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.640
jazz sources.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:17.480
You hear it all because the technology now allows you to kind of construct, the music

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.920
is not performed as much as constructed.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.720
So now it's being constructed from all different...

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.640
Yeah, it's the kind of... in a way, it's kind of a sad thing when we're talking about

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.640
tation and release, how the only variation in volume is that it just keeps increasing,

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:32.440
but there's no decreases, no in and out.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.760
It just increases louder and louder and louder.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:38.640
And that's the tension part, but where's the release part coming in?

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.160
Like, something like that.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.360
I mean, how do you get beyond it?

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.520
When does the release come in when you're hearing throbbing new in clubs, like, that's

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:53.480
right, don't go to the clubs because only I can handle all the throbbing, pulsating,

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:55.240
I think, to throw me off.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.640
Take out the chromium for about four measures.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:02.160
Thank you.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:11.960
I've never been raised on classical music, just like there was never a book in my house,

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:17.400
but anyway, I was raised, if anything, on popular music.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.480
So my question is this.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.120
Don't you think it's easier to like popular music than classical music?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.960
I'd like, especially direct this to you because you are just opposite of my background, and

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:38.840
because the words give you direction, and I think would help also in some of the things

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.440
you've been talking about.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:48.040
The words themselves forget the emotion of the words, which I think are terrific often.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:55.840
But don't you think it's easier to like popular music because it comes with words?

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:02.880
I think most of the music in the world, I think, does come with words, actually, and

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:12.520
I think that may be true, but I've always particularly been fascinated by non-music

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:18.520
that doesn't have words just because it's so mystifying what it is.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:27.280
It's so eloquent, and yet with no words and how do we understand the impact on us?

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:37.880
I mean, to my knowledge of speaking about Freud again, the only two references I recall

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:44.840
in his work about two music were both operas because one was an often-ba-one and another

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.800
was done Giovanni by Mozart because there was a plot and words and everything else that

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.680
he could talk about.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.080
I'm Jim Rubens.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.400
I'm a member of a group that works with people with brain damage.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:08.320
We work psychotherapeutically and psychoanalytically, and we have been in touch with the man who

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.400
is both a psychotherapist and suffers from the phasor.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.400
He had a stroke.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.360
His name is Harvey Alter, and he runs support groups for phasics.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:27.680
I've heard him speak, he mastered much of his phasia by singing to himself, and he could

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.120
retrieve the word with the help of the music.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:37.240
I had a little bit, there are groups right now in melodic therapy.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.760
They actually work with people with damage to their speech center.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:48.000
First they start with just a couple notes around and teach them to say their names, then simple

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.320
phrases, and gradually they restore speech and what's interesting, they restore speech

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.480
center in opposite hemisphere, which was not damaged.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:02.640
I'm Henry Earl.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.640
Thank you for a very interesting discussion.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:09.320
Rubensstein, Corsakov.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.480
What about genetics?

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:17.680
What about studies in people who are humans who are either pre-verbal or post-verbal?

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:25.720
You may have noticed it, but from Kyoto, a group of researchers recently reported three

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:32.280
subjects in which they studied sleep and what they regard as dreaming.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:39.400
In the first stage of sleep, they would awaken these subjects and compare the functional

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:46.560
MRI to the objects that they'd dreamt about, that they recalled.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:53.040
They got to the point where they could find a 60% correspondence between the functional

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.720
MRI images and the objects that these subjects recalled.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:04.640
Now it's three subjects and it's early days, but I suspect there are genetic factors in

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
this.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:15.920
One possibility is that Vienna was burned out after Beethoven and Mozart.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.440
That was their left for poor Freud.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:28.560
The other possibility is that there are strong genetic variations in the response to music.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.960
I just wondered whether there have been some studies or there are being some studies under

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:39.640
way to study this, especially in very young and very old.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:45.680
I'm not going to give you a direct answer, but kind of indirect.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.600
First of all, we know that Bach family was so huge and they were so successful that very

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:54.000
broad Bach became a synonym for musician during his time.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.400
And on QXR, 11 days on stop.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:06.680
Yes, another thing, some 15 years ago, there was a great discussion if there is differences

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:12.080
in brain structures and musicians as compared to non-musicians are related to genetic component.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:18.680
However, during the last few years, when there were around several longitudinal studies with

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:25.320
children, it showed that the brain changes are related to music experience.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:32.360
They are related to greater thickness of corpus callosumonterepart, which means greater

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:40.560
bilaterality, which perhaps means better cognitive functions at old age, their compensation.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.160
Other changes, for example, in acute ci-

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:52.720
chills that connects auditory areas with modern areas and so on.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:59.880
So when- what I want to emphasize, please start making music.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:06.360
Every day, literally every day, new studies arrive, which say it's very beneficial.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:12.280
Just the data that was published this year, the people who studied music, they are better

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:18.000
on motor tasks, not only like a memory task, but on motor tasks, compared with people who

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
never studied music.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.440
Would that be true if someone took a drawing or painting at an older age?

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.440
No, music.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:26.440
Just a question.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.560
And my explanation to it is that we are seeing such an integration of different modalities.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:41.280
We have vision, hearing, motor, material, everything.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.040
Thank you for coming today.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:49.360
Not in your field, so the terms I use may be the wrong ones, but perhaps you can help.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.800
My name is Joseph Cadu.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:59.240
I read a review of a recent book by Oliver Sacks that had to do with hallucinations.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:06.440
And the point was made that with advances in recent brain imagery, they found that people

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.800
having hallucinations, that the part of the brain that was activated, was quite different

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:16.400
than the part of the brain that's activated during dreams.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:22.160
And the part of the brain that's activated during dreams is that part which has memories

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.160
its function.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.960
And the part that's motivated for hallucinations is that part that not being in your field,

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.920
a call, pre-perceptual, or before there's the naming of something, but distinguishes

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.160
us from other species, our capacity to name things.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.400
But the moment we do, we eliminate all the possibilities for what it could be otherwise.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.360
And there's a distancing.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.960
And so here's my question.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:53.040
And also as a musician, I mean just someone who's played music, I found that once I mastered

01:22:53.040 --> 01:23:00.040
the notation of something, I can go back to that pre-notation state of a mode of, or

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:08.560
what I'm doing in improvisation, that there's a return to something more basic, not something

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.640
more advanced.

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.360
So here's my question.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:18.000
Is there anything in brain imaging or neuroscience that suggests that musicians, that the part

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.280
of the brain that is employed for a musician playing is different for a musician listening

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.440
or for a regular person listening?

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:36.080
They are not as kind of, you know, you're talking about dreams and hallucinations, what

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.440
I'm going to talk is much more mundane.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:47.680
For example, in musicians, the auditory areas, like recognition of sounds, they do little

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.000
bit different to the non-musicians.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.880
And also their perception of music is more left, side-activated because it's more analytical

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880
in musicians.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.440
They're more related to musical structures.

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:08.480
But what is interesting, that responses per se, they're about the same.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:15.440
Yes, the differences in white and gray matter, musicians are related.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:22.880
But responses, emotional responses are not differentiated in musicians and non-musicians.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:28.680
A couple of little anecdotes and then a question.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.440
I used to hate hip-hop music and then I started taking hip-hop dance classes and now I really

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.440
like hip-hop music.

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.360
I mean, not quite seriously.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:39.960
I wasn't able to access any of the emotion of it or any of the music of it until I tried

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:44.560
to do it and then I could understand the vocabulary and the feeling that they were using.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:50.600
And similarly, I went recently to an Icelandic music performance where somebody was really,

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.760
the performance was this on the computer and there was this kind of wall of sound that

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.600
was produced that was the concert that we were at.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.280
And so there was very little emotion involved in that.

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.880
And so I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit on emotion and its relationship

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:08.240
with music, both in terms of how you take things in and out of the music to create those

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:12.640
feelings but also in terms of the neuroscience systems, in terms of overlap of perceptual

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.080
modalities.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:22.120
I can't speak to neuroscience because I don't know much about it but I do know that in my

01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:32.720
work I do find that my body is always moving in the work.

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:40.240
People comment sometime and my foot is either tapping or I'm just kind of reacting to it.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:45.960
I can totally understand that the reaction to the hip hop because you're really connecting

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.160
with it at that point.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.760
It's obvious that the music is a physical music.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:58.200
I haven't been to some of these big gigantic raves that you see the people are having now

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.000
but sometimes you have thousands and tens of thousands of kids and the music is just a

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.200
pulse of physical movement.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.480
And again you don't see much movement when you go to Carnegie Hall and you go to a classical

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.280
concert but there's a different thing going on there.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:22.760
I personally in my work, and I only do the end product of the work.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.080
I don't create the work.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.160
Jesse is a record producer.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.080
He creates the work from and also a songwriter so he comes up with the idea for the song and

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:33.800
then creates an environment for the song to exist.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:39.120
And then in my work I kind of take that and I try to enhance whatever emotion that I'm

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.600
feeling and over doing it for 40 years I kind of can connect with the other creative person

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600
who's come up with something.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.120
I can enhance what he's trying to do.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:54.040
But I think physical is a big part of what you come up with when you produce a record.

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:00.680
I think the classical audiences have been sort of tamed over the century because they

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.080
didn't used to be so passive and I certainly am not.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.080
I always sit in the back row because I can't sit still.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:16.520
I didn't actually kicked out once.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.480
I wasn't making any sound but I was.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.160
What were you doing when you got kicked out?

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.160
What exactly were you doing when you got kicked out?

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:26.160
Well I was just asked to.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.320
I was just rushed and asked to leave if I couldn't contain myself.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.880
It's a little less.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.880
I feel exactly.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.320
I feel exactly the same way.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.600
I think it's barbaric that you have to sit at the concert and not move.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.600
It's ridiculous.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:49.840
And I have a private theory that one function of the conductor, aside from his relationship

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:58.440
to his orchestra, is that he is the symbol for all the motions that you want to make.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:06.400
And your clap is much for having allowed him by proxy to express for you.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.000
I cannot say anything about from the point of view, new to science, but I want to say

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:19.440
something from point of view of social culture that society culture, music does express gesture.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.040
And if time just change.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:29.360
So when you think about the Mozart, it's very easy to imagine ladies at Crinaleen.

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.960
It's very different today.

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:42.840
I think it's wonderful that you've found a hookup.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.800
My name is Herb Klitzner.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:49.640
I found probably the most satisfaction in listening over the last 30 years has been to

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.200
what's brought them called alternative music.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.000
And within that you have ambient music.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.280
And that is peaceful.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.600
And it doesn't go very far.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:04.800
And yet it's very rich and it's shifting and changing.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.720
And I just thought it should be mentioned here and I just wanted any reaction to either

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:16.640
that or alternative music more broadly as trends that have been in the society that

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.080
are meeting points that anyone can listen to and yet have substance.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:24.600
So that's for the most part is your ambient music is without lyrics.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.640
This is or maybe Gregorian chant kind of music or the.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.280
And then without lyrics.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.080
Brian, you know, kind of things to follow there.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.680
Well, again, there's so many individuals.

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.680
I mean, that's an excellent example for a music which is very important.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.800
It brings another whole set of emotions and this is very meditative.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:46.800
I mean, that's meditation.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.440
I mean, I think we've all had the experience of going to a massage or whatever and somebody

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.400
puts something on and is like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.600
And you go, well, no, that's not going to work for me because I know, you know, and could

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.600
you put some of that?

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.360
So, you know, that brings you emotionally when you listen to that kind of music.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.320
Where do you get with that emotionally when you listen to your ambient music?

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.320
And it opens me up and it relaxes me.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:17.800
And then I mean, in making music mixes which have done, have been broadcast on a stony

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:26.880
radio, I alternate in a larger scale tension and release using, let's say, an ambient piece

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.400
and then something that's very different.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.160
And I get a reaction from listeners that way that keeps things fresh and moving in their

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.480
alert.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.960
And so everything I do is eclectic with four or five genres, you know, within an hour and

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.120
a half music mix.

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:44.480
So listening can be rich.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.320
Richer than it really is on radio ordinarily.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.720
So you have a show you have a...

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.960
I did 10 years ago.

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:57.760
It was periodic, special occasions, but about 12 of them, about 2001 to 2003.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:03.160
And I was challenged and very constructive by taking the 9-11 experience, which happened

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.360
in the middle of it.

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.680
And so I was known already to the audience.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:12.280
And finding this kind of thing that would, from Estonian culture and from American culture,

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:19.800
would represent tensions and releases that you're in a safe place, ultimately.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:23.520
And the program was repeated after a couple of weeks from the response.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.520
So...

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:25.520
That's great.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:26.520
Yeah.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.520
Thank you.

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.520
What kind of music was it referred to with the Estonian music?

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.000
Well, there's music in Estonia.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.200
It's classical.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:40.200
It's a vocal by Valleo Tarmis, especially in other composers.

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:43.120
He had a piece called Curse Upon Iron.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:44.120
And I played that...

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.960
There was a destruction that takes place in that.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.080
And that represented me, the Tower Falling, which I witnessed myself from some blocks

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.080
away.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:56.240
And I helped work on the foundations for the center I had helped to design.

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.560
It made a computer model of a 1966 at work at the Port Authority.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:04.560
And then it was a life cycle of a building that I was in saying now it was coming down.

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:09.880
Actually, the one thing that remained that was not damaged was that foundation wall.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:14.760
But it was waiting for a new building to fill it and connect.

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.920
So I did a program on that.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.920
Sure.

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.920
What's up?

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.120
I'm Alexi Calatrak, a summit analyst.

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:29.120
I think everybody's doing a great job doing something that Elvis Costello said was like

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.280
writing, talking about music is like dancing about architecture.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.360
It's very difficult to do.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.600
But I have a developmental question about music, both for the analysts, the musicians, and

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.080
the cognitive scientists.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:51.640
I think we've all alluded to and seen how musical taste changes over time.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:57.760
The song that moved us when we were five, a different song would do that at 15.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:04.680
And if I go to the opera and I look around at the median age, I know that all those people

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.520
there were not at the opera when they were 30.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:11.400
So it tastes changed over time.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:17.080
I'm curious, in other fields, in psychoanalysis, we sort of privileged the first five years

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:23.800
of life as determining so much that happens afterwards, in language so much we believe

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.480
that happens, needs to happen in the first years of life.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:36.720
Is there a science of music development which would take into account both the cognitive

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:44.400
changes and receptivity at different ages that we have, also take into account the aspect

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.520
of community and mass experience, concerts and so on.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.320
And other things like when we're older, I used to listen to the clashes first album

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.920
ad nauseam loud and I can't do that anymore.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.080
And I listened to other things now that I never would have listened to because they were too

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.480
wimpy when I was 20.

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:13.800
So what are the kinds of things, is it possible to put together some developmental idea of

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.800
how we experience music?

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:23.800
One of the roles I was to take it.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:31.720
Okay, you know, I can talk from a perspective of a piano teacher.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:36.240
So you have children, they are coming to study piano.

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.640
And some of them are so incredibly perceptive.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:45.920
A child at seven at eight seems to understand everything about music.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.320
It's universal language.

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:53.440
The universal, melodic universal are very simple and they are given to us by nature.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.880
But they understand the emotional content in an incredible form, in a great way.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:08.600
I find it very difficult to discuss how it's related to age and to development of taste.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:14.560
I only can tell you that we are all very sensitive to music.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:21.520
For example, in my study I found that people, non-usicians, and I did the study in the heart

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.520
of Texas.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:27.440
And it was multi-ethnic group, people from around the world.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.640
And they recognized differences between romantic and the first unique school.

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.680
When I saw the results, I could not believe my eyes.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:40.480
I had melodic, similar, short musical phrases.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.240
I selected them from musical compositions, played them, and they listened.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.920
I had very different tasks for them.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:53.760
But one of the byproducts of this study was the discovery that people, basically, know

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:54.760
training in music.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.480
They are very sensitive to the finest details of music.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:06.000
They recognized, like for example, they put Schubert with romantic and with classics.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.960
And this is the esoteric knowledge, which is, for example, it's known by people studying

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:19.200
piano at Moscow Conservatory that you can take Schubert as a classical composer or a romantic

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:23.720
composer, depending on the structure of your performance.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:30.120
But it's not common knowledge, so when I saw the loading plot with these results, it was

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120
striking.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:34.280
We all give it from music.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:35.280
Just listen.

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.280
Just listen.

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.280
Just enjoy.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:44.160
I think, though, the thing that you're speaking about specifically of getting older and having

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:52.280
different tastes in music, it seems more like that your personal needs for music change

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.120
more than your taste changes.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.720
Because I know for myself that the records that I, usually the records that I didn't

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.000
like as a kid I still don't like, because I go back sometimes.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.320
I think, excuse me, was I wrong about that record?

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.040
Because people really still talk about this one record.

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.400
And I know when I was 16 I didn't like it and I returned it or I sold it or whatever.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.600
And I'll go back and listen again and think, nope, I didn't like that.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.280
I still didn't like it.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.160
Sometimes I go back and I realize I was wrong about things.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:30.520
But I think it's more that, as you said specifically, instead of wanting to go to say a clash concert,

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.800
you would want to go here a symphony.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.320
I think that's more cultural and more about just where you are in your life.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:44.880
It's more just to simplify more of a pleasant evening to go and go to a beautiful concert

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:50.520
homeless and just some beautiful music and have dinner rather than go to a crowded club

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:56.320
and get knocked around by a club and have your ears blown out.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.480
But in terms of the actual music, I wonder how much actually it changes.

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:05.960
I know that people who are young, when they hear things for the first time that they were

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.600
never exposed to, someone who may, like Beyonce, but never heard, read the Franklin, suddenly

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.840
hears her read the Franklin's, wow, that's amazing.

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:21.160
I think people can like music at any age, it's just more about what their personal needs

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:24.320
are maybe or what they want from it.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.960
And what they're exposed to.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:33.200
Hi, I'm Rina Kuzerski.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.200
I'm a music supervisor for documentaries.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.560
And what I've been hearing today is two parts.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.680
It's mostly Western music.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.640
It's mostly classical or popular.

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:49.960
A few people have spoken about indigenous music and I think it's important to stress

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:58.480
that in much of indigenous music, both dance and the sound of music go together.

01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:06.160
And that tension and release that you spoke about earlier today really has to do with

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.800
the tension and release of physical embodiment and physical action.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:18.960
And when we sit in a concert hall, some people may sit in the back and get rhythmically excited,

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:25.760
but most of us are not allowed to dance or don't, wouldn't even think of it in Carnegie

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.160
Hall.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:34.240
But going to a jazz concert or a rock concert somehow permits you to release that and get

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:37.520
out in the aisle and dance around.

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:46.080
And I think we need to reflect a little bit about how important it is necessary for bodily,

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.880
physically to feel the excitement about music.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:58.840
Hi, very interesting conversation.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.840
My name is Raul Rafael.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.400
I'm an artist, visual artist and also musician.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.680
And music has a very deep scientific basis.

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:15.720
Sematix, which is the study of the patterns that are made through music frequencies, has

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:20.520
shown that sound has an organizing power.

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.480
And also there's a very deep metaphysical aspect to music.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:27.440
We see that in religions throughout the world, throughout history.

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:34.480
Now Dr. Rose, you touched upon, you said the music alleviates the solitude of individuation,

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:41.960
which I think goes to the very core of what communication coming together as one that music

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.280
allows.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:50.480
And I think that has to do a lot with the, I think that Ms. Kren has mentioned the neurophysiological

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.360
nature of music.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:59.080
But also to you mentioned the fact that music creates emotion and emotion in total space,

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:05.400
which is I think at the heart of communication and of the believing of this alienation, this

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:09.400
wanting to come as one, as actually we're doing right now.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:15.280
I think that human beings want to come together, communicate, commune.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.560
And so could you talk a little bit more about this and possibly this connection between

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.520
creating emotion and emotion in total space and the alleviation of the, what did you

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:30.760
say, the alleviation of the solitude of individuation?

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:31.920
Yeah.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:37.440
I was quoting William James, so I wish I had said it, but he said, I'm old but not that

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.680
old.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:45.120
I want to say only, I thought I wanted to say one thing about it.

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.400
No, it just escaped me.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:54.760
I'm having a senior moment.

01:41:54.760 --> 01:42:01.960
Yes.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:07.280
One thing I could say is that as an analyst, one of the first things an analyst would think

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:17.560
about this is that this at oneness that's created by music, self and other merge, probably

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:25.280
in some very, very dim way, recalls the very earliest moments of life, the very earliest

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:31.960
years of life, which were wordless because language does not yet come.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:40.600
And this would be the symbiosis of the mother nowadays could be a child relationship.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:47.200
So on some very, very deep level, now one difference between present analysis and the

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:57.000
analysis that I was brought up on is that we would find far more significance in the present

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:04.400
and recent and cultural contributions rather than me they go back to what do you remember

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.760
about being in your mother's arms.

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:09.320
But that doesn't mean that isn't important.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:17.240
That's the earliest basis of wordless understanding and security and the loss of the sense of

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:23.320
self because you are safe in this what we call holding environment where you're being

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.560
held.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.720
I would like to come close to answer your question.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:56.160
I think that this power of sound, power of frequency and the in sound that in a sense

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:02.200
is not a matter of the formation of matter.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:11.120
In some early poetry I read someplace that the love song in some culture which I've forgotten

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:19.920
about, the words, the highest form of love you could express would be to say to your

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:26.520
partner, oh I, there is no difference between self and other.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:34.360
Oh I, it's like pretty narcissistic, but it's the fusion, I'm talking about the fusion,

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.360
the oneness.

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:43.800
Hi, my name is Amalia and I have a question about laughter and recorded music.

01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:50.640
I was a kid always amused by singers who would just burst out to laughter and as I've gotten

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.400
older I realized it wasn't always that funny but more ironic or commentary I'm thinking

01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:02.320
of Bill Withers, Hellep and Harlem and he ends the song, ha ha ha, Harlem, you know,

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:03.880
Hellep and Harlem.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:06.840
So commentary about Harlem and thinking about that.

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:11.600
I haven't fully come up with a conclusion about this laughter and that's why I'm here

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.760
to get some thought about what kind of emotion might be, well there's all kind of theories

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.840
about why we laugh in general but I'm wondering about unrequarded music and some of your thoughts

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:21.840
about that.

01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:28.840
Well I don't know, I just think of this at least, Regina, she's a Brazilian singer, there's

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:34.160
a song where she bursts into laughter in the middle of a line and there's Bob Dylan's

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:40.080
songs, early recordings where he starts laughing and he's responding to his own lyrics laughing

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.080
at them.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:47.480
I mean to me it just always reflects a very natural moment in the music from artists who

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:53.520
are so good that they're so inside the moment of the song and inside the meaning of the

01:45:53.520 --> 01:46:02.720
song that it's almost as if they're not singing it themselves and they have almost an objective

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:10.360
sort of reaction to the music but otherwise I never really thought about it that much.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.600
But I have noticed it and I always like it when I hear it.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:19.960
And the only thing I can say is that the few times I've seen live performances where somebody

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:24.760
has a laugh, that laugh better be good because if it's not good it just destroys the whole

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:25.760
song.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.000
It's got to really be sincere.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.040
So it's a hard thing, that's a very difficult, you know, only a really, I'm sure Bill Weathers

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.200
could do it but it's not too many Bill Weathers around.

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:41.480
I'd like to thank the whole panel.

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480
Thank you.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.480
Thank you.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:47:13.440
Thank you.
