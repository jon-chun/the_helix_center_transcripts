00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
I wanted to know what was an address in the movie was what is the relationship between

00:06.000 --> 00:17.560
the Higgs and the unification of the nuclear weak force and the electromagnetic force?

00:17.560 --> 00:23.560
The standard model incorporates the unification of the two.

00:23.560 --> 00:30.960
The Higgs is part of that, so at the very basis of the standard model, we need to have

00:30.960 --> 00:33.120
the Higgs to have it make sense.

00:33.120 --> 00:39.400
So it's not the thing that is unifying it, but the fact is that the standard model really

00:39.400 --> 00:43.240
only makes sense with the Higgs in it.

00:43.240 --> 00:49.440
Mathematically, even phenomenologically in terms of these particles having mass.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.400
Without the Higgs, all the particles would be massless.

00:53.400 --> 01:02.200
We know that in fact it was actually the problem of the mass, of having the mass of the W boson,

01:02.200 --> 01:10.280
which is the mediator of the weak force, that really drove the necessity of a Higgs.

01:10.280 --> 01:16.080
And getting that mass was the big step that actually Stephen Weinberg made.

01:16.080 --> 01:21.480
So all the attention goes to Peter Higgs, who mathematically came up with this idea.

01:21.480 --> 01:26.840
But it was actually other people like Weinberg who realized it could be incorporated into

01:26.840 --> 01:33.840
this structure, the standard model that we have, and it could give the W boson mass.

01:33.840 --> 01:41.200
But allow the W boson initially to be seen as sort of a symmetric partner to other bosons

01:41.200 --> 01:43.400
in the electromagnetic force.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.400
Does that make sense?

01:45.400 --> 01:52.400
I might actually add that you might be at the town of director, so Elle was quite about

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
the science.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.400
And part of the story of this film is about the team in a certain unusual level of backgrounds

01:59.400 --> 02:04.400
that he brought to him.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.240
I studied knowledge of particle physics 30 years ago.

02:10.240 --> 02:17.680
And amazingly this was the issues that were still actually being worked on now.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.920
What's the state of particle physicists now?

02:19.920 --> 02:22.320
Are they excited, depressed, baffled?

02:22.320 --> 02:26.560
Where's the field going with this?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.320
Yes.

02:28.320 --> 02:29.920
I would say all of the above.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.240
I mean, you know what's interesting?

02:32.240 --> 02:35.920
There is a really, I think here again we're now seeing a really big distinction between

02:35.920 --> 02:38.280
the theorists and the experimentalists.

02:38.280 --> 02:43.000
The environmentalists are excited for the most part.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.960
They're busy getting ready to start up again.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.400
This is almost history for them now.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.800
And they've been doing upgrades.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.360
They have started it up.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.800
Mike Weman, who is our character at the LHC, the Brit.

02:59.800 --> 03:03.880
I mean, he's really at the center now of getting the machine ready to go.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.480
And you see him in the news all the time.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.480
He's telling what I say.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.480
And they're about to go.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.240
Meanwhile, they totally ripped out a lot of atlas and they've been replacing that.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.600
So they're very excited about what they're going to find.

03:14.600 --> 03:20.360
The theorists are worried, honestly, because in some sense nothing has changed.

03:20.360 --> 03:24.240
I mean, there's this great accomplishment that completed the standard model.

03:24.240 --> 03:29.840
I mean, having the Higgs, which is great for the people that predicted the standard model.

03:29.840 --> 03:35.000
For the people that are mostly featured in our film, they're still really waiting to

03:35.000 --> 03:36.320
see what's going to be there.

03:36.320 --> 03:43.120
So I think there's nervousness.

03:43.120 --> 03:48.360
How important is the difference between the CMS member and the atlas number?

03:48.360 --> 03:51.240
It's not really considered significantly different, actually.

03:51.240 --> 04:00.760
So it's considered that they've confirmed it, you know, together.

04:00.760 --> 04:11.520
Could you elaborate a little more, if you could, about why the relatively high value

04:11.520 --> 04:21.720
that was confirmed for the Higgs mass would preclude supersymmetry or the supersymmetric

04:21.720 --> 04:23.720
particles?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.760
It doesn't entirely preclude them.

04:26.760 --> 04:34.400
You know, to a certain extent, we dramatized it a little more than it is in terms of being

04:34.400 --> 04:36.880
a complete bifurcation.

04:36.880 --> 04:42.280
And you know, it's like, you know, you get the impression, we don't say this, but I know

04:42.280 --> 04:46.520
that we sort of give the impression that, you know, it has to be this or this.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.520
It's really a continuum.

04:48.520 --> 04:53.720
And there are similarly theories that, in a sense, are a continuum.

04:53.720 --> 04:59.640
And there are theories that can accommodate a multiverse and supersymmetric particles.

04:59.640 --> 05:07.800
What is true is that in order to be supersymmetric, though, it doesn't fall comfortably into

05:07.800 --> 05:13.360
the simplest supersymmetric models.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.600
So you know, all these models, they have lots of different variations.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.000
You can vary things.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.080
You can, you know, stick in additional, you know, terms and things like that.

05:23.080 --> 05:29.560
The, you know, most common supersymmetric models do require a lower mass.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.280
But there are, as I say, mixed things.

05:32.280 --> 05:39.200
David, Sava, and Nima have all worked on things, you know, called split supersymmetry, which

05:39.200 --> 05:46.600
allow the possibility that some things might be only explainable with multiverse, but there

05:46.600 --> 05:48.080
could be supersymmetric particles.

05:48.080 --> 05:53.320
Well, then let me rephrase my question.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.000
Why is the current theory of the multiverse and supersymmetry?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Why are they mutually exclusive?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.400
I'm not clear on that.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.400
They're not.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.200
So that's actually what I'm saying is that they are not exclusive.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.240
There are theories that could accommodate them.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.520
So you know, if you think in terms of the multiverse, you know, the big thing about the multiverse

06:12.520 --> 06:17.560
saying that there are certain numbers in our theory that we will not be able to explain

06:17.560 --> 06:24.160
because they are random in the multiverse, what could be is that there are multiverses

06:24.160 --> 06:27.640
and some of those numbers are only explainable this way.

06:27.640 --> 06:32.600
But some of the others are not going to need that, that they might be explainable by supersymmetric

06:32.600 --> 06:34.720
partners.

06:34.720 --> 06:43.560
What was, what is there about the Higgs?

06:43.560 --> 06:50.000
What was there about the Higgs that made it as elusive as it was as opposed to the other

06:50.000 --> 06:52.800
particles?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.440
One of the things was the weight, the mass.

06:55.440 --> 07:03.800
So you know, being able to have an accelerator that could generate energy or mass enough

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
to be able to see it.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.240
I mean, so in a sense, that's the most obvious thing that was there.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.760
Beyond that, it's also, it decays very quickly.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.760
There's so many other things it can decay to.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.440
They didn't know exactly where they were looking for it.

07:18.440 --> 07:24.440
But principally they needed to get to the energy of the LHC to be able to see it.

07:24.440 --> 07:32.520
I just want to comment that these questions are, they're pretty great in terms of the

07:32.520 --> 07:40.680
science and one of the goals of the film more broadly was to make audiences, broad

07:40.680 --> 07:47.640
audiences feel that they were insiders into the adventure, the pursuit.

07:47.640 --> 07:55.200
And you know, it was the sense, the Higgs, the God Particle had to be found.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.440
And yet the physicists had moved on to asking some of these questions.

07:59.440 --> 08:07.120
And one of the real goals, problems, and I think the back and forth during the, during

08:07.120 --> 08:10.120
the making of the film was how to do that.

08:10.120 --> 08:17.280
And finally, the kind of comic, the 24-7 news cycle, you know, represents that other audience.

08:17.280 --> 08:22.120
And you know, the goal was to kind of have all of you really feel on the inside as part

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
of it.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.120
So.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.360
Well, you succeeded brilliantly in that.

08:25.360 --> 08:34.600
And I'd like to bring you in as director and producers to talk a little bit about what

08:34.600 --> 08:41.120
did you find to be the greatest challenges in creating such a seamlessly exciting and

08:41.120 --> 08:43.120
engaging film.

08:43.120 --> 08:49.640
Well, one thing that wasn't a challenge was finding physicists who could explain what

08:49.640 --> 08:52.640
they were working on to ordinary people.

08:52.640 --> 08:58.800
It was the most incredible thing that there were so many scientists who could have been

08:58.800 --> 09:03.640
on this screen because they loved explaining what they were doing.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.920
It was absolutely amazing.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.320
So I would say the big challenge, we have a lot of physicists on the cutting room floor

09:11.320 --> 09:15.640
now because we just couldn't squeeze them in.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.720
But that was not a challenge.

09:17.720 --> 09:24.760
I think the biggest challenge was creating the dramatic arc that would keep everyone sitting

09:24.760 --> 09:30.840
in their seats wanting to know the ending of a scientific question along with the people

09:30.840 --> 09:32.640
in the film.

09:32.640 --> 09:39.840
That is what filmmaking can do at its best, but that is very, very hard to get to.

09:39.840 --> 09:46.480
I would just add to that, what Andrew said, the parallel or the counterpart of this, the

09:46.480 --> 09:52.360
hardest part I think really in the end was how do we incorporate the science and not

09:52.360 --> 09:53.960
lose the audience.

09:53.960 --> 10:00.400
And that we knew we had this great dramatic story, we had great characters and a profusion

10:00.400 --> 10:03.760
of characters that was not the issue as Andrew said.

10:03.760 --> 10:09.960
The problem was how do we explain the things that people need to know to understand why

10:09.960 --> 10:12.360
they should be excited and where do we do it.

10:12.360 --> 10:16.560
And the way we did it was basically we initially constructed the film without the science.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.600
And then we put it in at the end as needed.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.080
And so the mantra was just enough just in time.

10:24.080 --> 10:30.400
And I think another critical element of that was we essentially came up with a lexicon

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
for this film.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.760
And at a certain point we just said, these are the terms we are going to explain and

10:35.760 --> 10:37.760
these are ones we're not.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.960
And in the end we required a lot of rigorousness to just decide.

10:41.960 --> 10:48.040
And even one example being the multiverse, multiverse physicists use many terms for that

10:48.040 --> 10:51.920
anthropics, multiverse, naturalness, environmental.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.600
And we decided it's going to be the multiverse in this film.

10:55.600 --> 11:01.360
And I literally went back and had people rerecord lines if they didn't use that word.

11:01.360 --> 11:10.240
I just want to add that it was part of that challenge was, I don't think there was any

11:10.240 --> 11:12.080
one way that we did that.

11:12.080 --> 11:17.800
I think what Mark just said is it was critical and deciding what concepts to explain, when

11:17.800 --> 11:21.880
to put them in, the kinds of graphics and so forth.

11:21.880 --> 11:28.520
But it was also other aspects of audience engagement that I think are particularly relevant for

11:28.520 --> 11:30.440
this audience.

11:30.440 --> 11:37.880
What does a character, what qualities of character are needed to foster engagement,

11:37.880 --> 11:44.000
identification, engagement of curiosity and the feeling that one really thinks that what

11:44.000 --> 11:49.120
feels that one is kind of understanding it enough to feel engaged and on the edge of

11:49.120 --> 11:50.960
your seat.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.640
And part of it is certainly the kinds of characters that they were, not only were they really

11:55.640 --> 12:01.960
great science explicators, as Andrea says, but very, very authentically who they are

12:01.960 --> 12:08.760
and very much I think just it sounds like a cliche, but it's really true, really human.

12:08.760 --> 12:16.640
You know, really engaged in a huge pursuit and passionate about it, also having human-scale

12:16.640 --> 12:22.440
ambitions, also being funny and also, you know, so that was really important.

12:22.440 --> 12:28.680
And another was, as we all began through David and through Mark to understand and the two

12:28.680 --> 12:33.840
of us non-scientists, some of the larger stakes, the emotional implications of those

12:33.840 --> 12:41.960
stakes, the sense that this could, even though the helium leak that caused this huge hiatus,

12:41.960 --> 12:49.640
was a technical, you know, a mistake in the infrastructure, but it did reflect a larger

12:49.640 --> 12:54.800
concern that we had come to understand in the field the sense of what if nothing is

12:54.800 --> 13:02.360
found or what if the Higgs is found and nothing else and a sense that this could be the end

13:02.360 --> 13:09.000
of a branch of science and what, because they were so passionate, you know, what that means

13:09.000 --> 13:13.720
for an individual scientist, not only in terms of one's own life's work and legacy, but in

13:13.720 --> 13:20.480
terms of, in fact, they're all in it for a larger reason and that this could be a smack

13:20.480 --> 13:26.920
dead end, which of course was a very compelling imaginative concept as well.

13:26.920 --> 13:34.880
Hi, yeah, along those lines, one of the devices I really enjoyed was the confessional that

13:34.880 --> 13:35.880
you had.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.800
So I wanted to hear more about the part where people started to record themselves on webcam,

13:39.800 --> 13:41.520
right, and you had them.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.320
I wanted to hear more about that process, how did you focus on the one, I forget the

13:45.320 --> 13:50.240
experimental girl who really you showed a lot of hers, and was there a difference between

13:50.240 --> 13:52.880
her as an experimental physicist versus a theoretical physicist?

13:52.880 --> 13:54.960
I thought it was really cool and wanted to hear more.

13:54.960 --> 14:03.440
We actually stole that idea because a lot of art is imitation except better.

14:03.440 --> 14:09.800
We stole the idea from a film called Baghdad High in which kids in Baghdad were given

14:09.800 --> 14:16.200
cameras to record themselves because Westerners couldn't really go there to record what they

14:16.200 --> 14:18.160
wanted to record.

14:18.160 --> 14:22.680
And it seemed like a way, in the beginning it was very tough because we didn't know if

14:22.680 --> 14:26.080
anyone would speak honestly on camera.

14:26.080 --> 14:30.240
And they're all kind of, well, should she wear makeup and she doesn't look very good,

14:30.240 --> 14:35.800
and is she going to later say, this is Monica, I don't want to see myself looking like that.

14:35.800 --> 14:42.040
It is just amazing that the scientists really got into recording themselves at critical

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
moments.

14:43.040 --> 14:48.120
I mean, we have some moments on camera where you really see people depressed and scared

14:48.120 --> 14:57.720
and David recorded himself many, many times including during his tenure decision process

14:57.720 --> 15:04.920
and all kinds of, we actually have a wedding that isn't, that on the cutting room floor.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.040
I mean, so the scientists were really into it.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.040
Two weddings.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
Two weddings.

15:10.040 --> 15:18.080
So, I mean, we were invasive in ways that we wanted to be invasive and we were lucky

15:18.080 --> 15:22.720
that the scientists themselves took on so much of that burden because that's often why

15:22.720 --> 15:27.360
documentaries are not personal as people just don't let you in.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.640
And we had scientists who were willing to let us in.

15:29.640 --> 15:30.640
It was amazing.

15:30.640 --> 15:37.600
I would say just in terms of differences between theorists and experimentalists, yes, experimentalists

15:37.600 --> 15:40.720
did it and the theorists thought about it.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.160
Did I keep a problem on camera when they were talking?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.160
Absolutely, Monica.

15:45.160 --> 15:50.040
You know, she just did it, you know, theorists, I mean, it took a lot of work to get them

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
to do anything.

15:51.040 --> 15:58.520
Usually, with SAVAS, I'd have to have his student to actually set up the camera.

15:58.520 --> 16:05.960
I thought what you did so incredibly well is the background of the images and the implication

16:05.960 --> 16:10.520
that human imagination has been working on this from the beginning.

16:10.520 --> 16:16.960
The mandala shapes that you used and there's all these alchemical images of the world that

16:16.960 --> 16:20.240
are so much like the images that you used.

16:20.240 --> 16:26.280
But the question is, it wasn't God particle a term that was used in a derogatory way by

16:26.280 --> 16:30.000
someone who was mocking the Higgs boson.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.200
I mean, it wasn't the physicists who were looking for it.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.080
It was somebody who was commenting on it.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.920
It was a physicist, actually.

16:36.920 --> 16:43.000
A wonderful story is that, beyond Letterman, who is an experimentalist, he wrote a book

16:43.000 --> 16:49.960
and he had proposed the title, The God Particle.

16:49.960 --> 16:55.480
He actually wanted to call it The God Damn Particle.

16:55.480 --> 17:00.480
The publishers said that that was not acceptable.

17:00.480 --> 17:06.360
Physicists don't like the term, as we've said, because of the associations.

17:06.360 --> 17:14.560
We tried to give that impression as well from a filmmaking perspective and publicists side.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.800
It's great.

17:15.800 --> 17:29.240
Were there any regrets expressed by Texas or otherwise for not moving forth with this?

17:29.240 --> 17:35.280
I mean, this obviously seems to me the internet was associated with the creation and there

17:35.280 --> 17:43.320
was certainly a lot of economic activity that had been lost to Texas, for instance.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.920
We actually shot quite a bit more in Laxahatchee.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.360
We had actually, it's also on the cutting room floor, we had a lot of things down there.

17:50.360 --> 17:57.040
I went down there with David and actually filmed him seeing it for the first time.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.640
The images you see are real, actually.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.760
It's very sad.

18:01.760 --> 18:07.640
When I was doing the location scouting, I was just driving around and right near where

18:07.640 --> 18:10.840
the collider was, there was this tiny little town.

18:10.840 --> 18:15.760
It's just the quintessential little one street dusty town.

18:15.760 --> 18:21.360
We went in the cafe, I went in the cafe before we started shooting for lunch.

18:21.360 --> 18:27.880
I started talking to the owner and I said what I was doing and he walks over and on this

18:27.880 --> 18:34.800
top shelf, he pulls down this baseball cap and dusts it off and it says, Waxahatchee future

18:34.800 --> 18:37.240
home of the SSC.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.560
And there was a real poignancy to it.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.720
They thought this was going to be it.

18:41.720 --> 18:46.320
This would have been the center of the world, basically.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.240
People had moved down there.

18:48.240 --> 18:54.200
I know physicists who moved down to Waxahatchee who had been living there and they had quit

18:54.200 --> 18:56.120
their other jobs or they had gone down there.

18:56.120 --> 19:01.440
They had moved, they had set up their families there.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.480
When it was canceled, it was a huge blow.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.920
A number of them left physics.

19:05.920 --> 19:11.240
It was actually one of the first emphasis to go to Wall Street.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.560
I know a couple in particular that did at that point.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.960
So it was a huge blow.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.800
We showed the film, it's shown in Texas, I was at the USA Film Festival down there in

19:22.800 --> 19:26.080
Dallas.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.560
And we're kicking themselves.

19:28.560 --> 19:36.480
One thing that's very interesting is that the country that's building the collider that's

19:36.480 --> 19:42.920
going to be three times as big as this one is probably China.

19:42.920 --> 19:48.600
The idea that you have these experiments and that attracts the best minds from all over

19:48.600 --> 19:55.400
the world to work in your country is something that, we would like to see that come back

19:55.400 --> 19:56.400
to America.

19:56.400 --> 20:04.120
That was a little underlying theme in our goals in terms of making this film.

20:04.120 --> 20:11.480
That it could be a real national, the idea that we would get a country sort of craving

20:11.480 --> 20:15.200
for more science education was certainly something we thought about.

20:15.200 --> 20:34.880
I don't know about that.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.760
I know that there's talk of different ways of doing it.

20:37.760 --> 20:41.880
The fundamental question is, do you make a linear collider, just slam things into each

20:41.880 --> 20:46.960
other or into a target or do you have the circular one?

20:46.960 --> 20:52.560
And the technology is, it's all about, the biggest challenge technologically is keeping

20:52.560 --> 20:56.840
these things going in a circle.

20:56.840 --> 21:01.960
Things want to go in straight lines and it takes more and more energy to keep them going.

21:01.960 --> 21:14.080
It's a balance in terms of the larger you are, the larger the radius of curvature, the

21:14.080 --> 21:15.440
less energy you need.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.600
On the other hand, it's bigger and it takes a lot more space.

21:19.600 --> 21:26.120
They always have a trade-off between those two elements.

21:26.120 --> 21:36.800
In terms of the Watsuhatchee footage, it was something of a debate within our team.

21:36.800 --> 21:46.760
Clearly that decision was, in terms of science education advocacy, the film could have emphasized

21:46.760 --> 21:48.600
that a lot more.

21:48.600 --> 22:00.080
It's certainly as a nation we are very aware of the topical relevance of that.

22:00.080 --> 22:05.040
I think the way that it ended up being there was just the right one in terms of the vision

22:05.040 --> 22:07.800
of the film makers.

22:07.800 --> 22:15.800
Of course, one of the hopes is that excitement about scientific discovery and the education

22:15.800 --> 22:20.480
that is needed, the resources that are needed to accomplish that at every level is really

22:20.480 --> 22:21.640
important.

22:21.640 --> 22:27.640
It was not the vision of the film makers to be advocacy film per se and that this could

22:27.640 --> 22:32.920
be a jumping off point and we certainly are hopeful and laying some of the groundwork

22:32.920 --> 22:33.920
for that.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.680
That is one of those decisions and it was interesting that important.

22:39.680 --> 22:55.360
I went two weeks ago to the Brookhaven National Labs to the NSLS-2, the inauguration of the

22:55.360 --> 23:04.120
10,000 times brighter light that Brookhaven has now, which costs $912 million of taxpayer

23:04.120 --> 23:08.360
dollars and is free available to various countries and so forth.

23:08.360 --> 23:14.440
I read the comments to the article that I wrote subsequently and many of the people

23:14.440 --> 23:20.840
who commented were furious that it wasn't built by a private industry rather than by

23:20.840 --> 23:22.400
government money.

23:22.400 --> 23:27.800
I found that crazy because I think these kinds of things can't really be done comfortably

23:27.800 --> 23:28.800
by private industry.

23:28.800 --> 23:36.440
The same is certainly not really comfortably done by individual businesses in a coalition.

23:36.440 --> 23:40.200
I was wondering if that was exceptional.

23:40.200 --> 23:47.440
That the comments that I got that this was unholy or somehow improper was typical of

23:47.440 --> 23:54.000
what kind of reaction people might have had, not this audience obviously, to the film and

23:54.000 --> 24:01.720
the money that was spent for the film and showing what you showed.

24:01.720 --> 24:02.960
We haven't had that reaction.

24:02.960 --> 24:09.560
I think it's interesting, one of the things about this is, and about the SSC, is I think

24:09.560 --> 24:20.040
that this also is a good example or it really points to the future that experiments of this

24:20.040 --> 24:25.160
order are not going to be able to be done for the most part by a single country.

24:25.160 --> 24:31.120
A lot of people would say that one of the problems with the SSC was that it was so US

24:31.120 --> 24:35.960
controlled and so US centric and there were other people in the physics community that

24:35.960 --> 24:36.960
objected.

24:36.960 --> 24:41.920
And within the US, there's a lot of debate about whether the physicists themselves jeopardized

24:41.920 --> 24:45.960
it because of all their debates about where it should be.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.480
In Chicago or from the lab they wanted it there.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.680
There was a big push to have it in California out at Stanford.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
And there was Texas.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.520
Why did Texas win?

24:56.520 --> 25:01.240
The physics community come together and support it and in the way it should have.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.560
There's a lot of debate about that.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.800
And it was very much run by the US.

25:06.800 --> 25:13.560
And I think there are a lot of people that feel that in the end it had to be an international

25:13.560 --> 25:17.800
collaboration and anything in the future is going to be because they are so expensive.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.800
It's going to require that.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.360
And I actually think that's a great thing.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.320
I think it should not be a nationalistic thing.

25:23.320 --> 25:29.440
And I think that in some sense is the point of the film is that it shows that that's why

25:29.440 --> 25:30.920
CERN was created.

25:30.920 --> 25:36.080
CERN was created in the 50s in the aftermath of the war expressly for the peaceful pursuit

25:36.080 --> 25:43.360
of science, no military research and all these countries who had been formerly, very formerly,

25:43.360 --> 25:47.760
very recently formerly fighting in some cases are united.

25:47.760 --> 25:55.240
And so I think it's very appropriately a government funded international collaboration.

25:55.240 --> 26:04.920
Regarding the SSC, some of us have heard that the reason it was canceled is that President

26:04.920 --> 26:12.360
Clinton at the time made an offer to the governor of Texas and Richards that they could either

26:12.360 --> 26:22.040
expand NASA, the space program, or continue with the SSC and Governor Richards decided

26:22.040 --> 26:27.080
that NASA is more appealing to public sentiment.

26:27.080 --> 26:33.920
They could put on a bigger splash with NASA, which is more easily understood than particle

26:33.920 --> 26:35.080
physics.

26:35.080 --> 26:41.720
Did you, in your research, did you find out, is this a true story or is this just rumored

26:41.720 --> 26:44.520
that it was a political decision that was made?

26:44.520 --> 26:51.600
And in fact, Stephen Weinberg, who's at the University of Texas, said that he kicked himself

26:51.600 --> 26:57.600
for not getting more involved in fighting for the SSC.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.720
I've heard this.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.080
I did not find out anything more about it.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.400
I mean, you know, Clinton's role in it has been debated.

27:05.400 --> 27:10.680
In the end, he did come out for it, but he did not express the strongest support.

27:10.680 --> 27:15.560
People do criticize him for not having expressed the strongest support initially, whether he

27:15.560 --> 27:17.400
had some deal with Anne Richards.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.560
I don't know that.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.160
It was certainly political.

27:22.160 --> 27:29.600
I think that most physicists now blame themselves that at a fundamental level, they did not

27:29.600 --> 27:34.480
communicate to the public why this was important, as opposed to something like the space station

27:34.480 --> 27:36.760
or something like that.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.520
But I do feel like we've seen a reflection of that.

27:40.520 --> 27:46.600
Even at CERN, they are incredibly supportive of all sorts of outreach and media and things

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
like this.

27:47.600 --> 27:53.160
So, you know, and that's something that was motivating all of us as well.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.920
Other question?

27:55.920 --> 27:59.920
I'd like to actually ask a naive question on my part, perhaps.

27:59.920 --> 28:08.000
Is there a possibility that with higher energy colliders that other candidates for the Higgs

28:08.000 --> 28:09.760
could be discovered?

28:09.760 --> 28:12.000
In other words, this thing is sitting right in the middle.

28:12.000 --> 28:23.720
Is it possible that if a particle at 115 or at 140, MEV turns up that this would challenge

28:23.720 --> 28:27.720
the conclusion that this particle is the horizon?

28:27.720 --> 28:29.960
It wouldn't erase this one.

28:29.960 --> 28:37.520
So, you know, as the Higgs, you know, I think there are theories that have other more than

28:37.520 --> 28:41.320
one Higgs and even in supersymmetry.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.760
So there could be other particles.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.360
You know what physicists really, you know, they hedge their bets a little.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.480
They say it's a Higgs-like particle.

28:48.480 --> 28:53.280
And what that means and is true and that we know is why it's unique is it has certain

28:53.280 --> 28:55.520
internal properties that a Higgs has.

28:55.520 --> 28:59.320
Particularly, it's a scalar, what's called a scalar vector boson.

28:59.320 --> 29:06.240
And that has to do with internal spin symmetry and other internal characteristics, which we

29:06.240 --> 29:07.600
had never seen before.

29:07.600 --> 29:13.440
So we know this is a particle that has properties we have never seen before and are consistent

29:13.440 --> 29:14.920
with the Higgs.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.000
Could there be others?

29:16.000 --> 29:18.640
Yes, there could.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.480
I don't think anybody thinks there'll be at lower masses.

29:21.480 --> 29:26.360
I think that, you know, they really feel they've sort of explored that, but could it be at

29:26.360 --> 29:27.360
higher?

29:27.360 --> 29:28.360
Yeah.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.800
I mean, they would love to find something and they would love to find something that doesn't

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
fit.

29:32.800 --> 29:38.960
I mean, that would be the greatest discovery of all.

29:38.960 --> 29:43.640
This is also a totally naive question, but what does it mean to see the Higgs boson?

29:43.640 --> 29:45.640
Because we don't see them seeing.

29:45.640 --> 29:46.800
That's a very good question.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.600
That's not a naive question.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.920
Yes, you actually never really do see the Higgs.

29:51.920 --> 30:00.320
I mean, as with most of these things, the Higgs itself lasts so short amount of time,

30:00.320 --> 30:03.200
but immediately decays into certain things.

30:03.200 --> 30:12.480
And so, I mean, if you take a very simple macroscopic thing, you know, neutrons are

30:12.480 --> 30:14.200
not infinitely stable.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.440
They actually decay into a proton, electron, and a tree.

30:17.440 --> 30:24.200
And the theory tells you what could be the different processes that a Higgs could decay

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
into.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
There's different pathways.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.480
There's different channels, they call them.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.520
It could decay into a certain number of photons.

30:30.520 --> 30:35.960
It could decay into a certain number of electrons or other types of leptons.

30:35.960 --> 30:43.600
And so, what you're really looking for are the signatures of a process that could be

30:43.600 --> 30:46.680
the Higgs that don't match anything else.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.960
But that's a really incredibly difficult thing to see because there's trillions of collisions

30:50.960 --> 30:54.040
happening and all these other things are decaying as well.

30:54.040 --> 31:00.560
And so, this is what, essentially, this is what experimentalists do in analysis is.

31:00.560 --> 31:06.480
They try to look at all the different pathways and correlate the ones that, you know, would

31:06.480 --> 31:10.720
match because they match the energy of what was coming in and they matched these other

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
internal properties.

31:11.720 --> 31:17.240
Okay, no, these are all things that we know, but these two things coming out here, they

31:17.240 --> 31:22.200
don't really match with anything else, but they're consistent with what our theory says

31:22.200 --> 31:25.760
the Higgs could decay in this way to be.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.000
That's what they're looking for.

31:28.000 --> 31:33.360
Okay, so you've kind of touched upon this a little bit, but I was wondering if you could

31:33.360 --> 31:37.440
go a little bit more in depth in the feedback and the reception you've been receiving with

31:37.440 --> 31:42.080
the film, has there been any more discussions being sparked in the physics community about

31:42.080 --> 31:45.160
outreach or science advocacy in education?

31:45.160 --> 31:49.000
I'm curious in that aspect.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.480
The physics community has totally embraced it, which is absolutely really, really satisfying.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.800
I mean, you know, obviously David, of course, in some sense, had the biggest stake of all

31:59.800 --> 32:08.040
because he still has to face all of his colleagues and, you know, they really, you know, I think

32:08.040 --> 32:13.160
trusted us in a sense to tell the story, but we were worried, for sure, you know, would

32:13.160 --> 32:15.800
they really be comfortable with it?

32:15.800 --> 32:18.360
And they have totally embraced it.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.760
I mean, for them, it's become their anthem in some sense.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.400
In fact, it's CERN now.

32:22.400 --> 32:27.880
They've told us CERN has a little souvenir store outside of their thing, and they want

32:27.880 --> 32:31.800
to make particle fever like they're definitive DVD at CERN.

32:31.800 --> 32:39.840
And in a deeper way, the symbol of the standard model, the circular image with the Higgs

32:39.840 --> 32:44.600
at the center, this didn't exist in the physics community.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.760
Walter Murch came up with us, our editor.

32:47.760 --> 32:53.240
And you know, their representations were like these odd charts and the Higgs was sticking

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
off here.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.160
They did not really get the parallels in the symmetry.

32:56.160 --> 33:00.360
And Walter became obsessed with something that was symmetric and that placed the Higgs

33:00.360 --> 33:05.200
right in the center, which is where it should be for our film, but also for this standard

33:05.200 --> 33:06.440
model.

33:06.440 --> 33:10.240
And it has been completely embraced by the physics community.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.480
And they now want to make it like their symbol.

33:12.480 --> 33:18.000
And so NEMA was wearing a t-shirt with it at some physics conference, and everybody went

33:18.000 --> 33:22.520
wild, and they were blogging about it, and they want to put it on their mugs and things

33:22.520 --> 33:23.520
like that.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.520
But that's pretty much being embraced by the physics community, I'd say.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.520
You can all lie down two lines.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.520
On the website, that's right.

33:30.520 --> 33:36.520
But I just wanted to add to that.

33:36.520 --> 33:39.960
Certainly the film has gotten great reviews.

33:39.960 --> 33:44.880
And if you look at Metacritic, if you've timed, Zellite times and all of that, I mean, I think

33:44.880 --> 33:51.840
that it really did succeed at what was the goal to cross over from being a science doc

33:51.840 --> 33:56.400
to being a doc that was really received broadly.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.720
That said, it wasn't easy.

33:58.720 --> 34:04.920
And the process of the making of it, the decision making in terms of getting it out there, we

34:04.920 --> 34:06.200
have had our lumps and bumps.

34:06.200 --> 34:13.240
I mean, in many ways, it sort of paralleled the topic of the film itself in terms of successes

34:13.240 --> 34:15.240
and failures.

34:15.240 --> 34:23.560
But it's certainly the fact of the nature of it probably limited to some degree how many

34:23.560 --> 34:27.680
people in the academy saw it, for instance, in that kind of thing.

34:27.680 --> 34:30.840
But it certainly has had and continues to have.

34:30.840 --> 34:36.600
We're very proud that it is, I think, the second highest grossing doc of 2014.

34:36.600 --> 34:41.680
And it was really distributed in a not in a traditional way because we couldn't get the

34:41.680 --> 34:44.560
attention of agents.

34:44.560 --> 34:51.800
So that's, and we certainly are intending, the educational distribution is beginning,

34:51.800 --> 34:58.360
and we certainly are intending to make the distribution and also the outreach impact,

34:58.360 --> 35:04.680
which can go in many, many directions as strong as it possibly can be.

35:04.680 --> 35:14.520
The film has a science curriculum that was created for it so that teachers can use it

35:14.520 --> 35:17.520
in the classroom.

35:17.520 --> 35:24.960
And right from the beginning, we thought about how the film would have an impact, specifically

35:24.960 --> 35:30.920
would have an impact on the teaching of science because we thought the story was so inspirational

35:30.920 --> 35:36.560
to young people because young people could perhaps picture themselves if they weren't

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
there.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.040
I think I always thought science was just being a theorist and you had to be Einstein

35:42.040 --> 35:44.000
or physics was.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.680
And when you see Monica talking about her heart, her heart, and her boots and how she's

35:48.680 --> 35:54.640
doing wiring, putting little wires together, I think that certainly for me broadened my

35:54.640 --> 35:59.480
sense of, and also that it was so collaborative, which was something I never really thought

35:59.480 --> 36:00.480
about.

36:00.480 --> 36:04.200
So we thought the film would be very inspirational to young people.

36:04.200 --> 36:09.640
And David was involved in something called QuarkNet, which actually trains high school

36:09.640 --> 36:17.360
teachers to get their kids to analyze actual data sheets.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.640
And there are, I don't remember, 4,000 how many QuarkNet teachers were there?

36:21.640 --> 36:23.000
There were a lot.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.680
And so we already were thinking right from the beginning, could high school students

36:27.680 --> 36:35.080
see this, could college students see it, could it play in science type societies like the

36:35.080 --> 36:40.640
Society of Mechanical Engineering or whatever, these are all over the country.

36:40.640 --> 36:48.720
And we gave a presentation at a major conference for science museums and technology centers.

36:48.720 --> 36:53.640
And that was right even before, I mean we barely had a trailer at that point, but we

36:53.640 --> 36:56.520
really care about the film getting out there.

36:56.520 --> 37:03.080
So if any of you have or attached to organizations that might want to show this for any reason,

37:03.080 --> 37:08.600
yes, we really care about that kind of alternative distribution.

37:08.600 --> 37:12.720
I'm a totally person and my mind is just going all over the place.

37:12.720 --> 37:18.080
And I have a twofold question that I could ask sit here and ask you like 100 questions.

37:18.080 --> 37:22.560
But when did you come up with the idea of doing this film, how long did it take you

37:22.560 --> 37:24.480
to do this film?

37:24.480 --> 37:31.680
And the other question is when they actually had the collisions, you know, at the first

37:31.680 --> 37:38.080
time around when the helium leaked, there was this areas that they didn't consider,

37:38.080 --> 37:45.240
right, of the consequences of other things that had to do that were part of the environment

37:45.240 --> 37:50.160
that would create the collision, would allow the collision to happen.

37:50.160 --> 37:55.280
But when the actual collisions did in fact take place, what were the consequences?

37:55.280 --> 38:00.600
I mean the explosions that they just contained, was there a fear that there could be like

38:00.600 --> 38:07.320
a really big like accident or, yeah, it's like what was the, you know, because the media

38:07.320 --> 38:10.600
plays it up, it's like the black hole and we're going to disappear.

38:10.600 --> 38:16.640
But was there actually a fear of, oh God, did we not consider something and this could

38:16.640 --> 38:22.440
go really, really wrong and how, I mean, what were the implications of that?

38:22.440 --> 38:27.080
Okay, I'll start, I think at the beginning, which is the beginning, how the film started.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.280
The film started in the mind of David Kaplan.

38:30.280 --> 38:37.240
A theorist who had a theory that a film about this thing turning on could be dramatic and

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
exciting and interesting.

38:38.240 --> 38:43.560
And you know, David says, you know, probably as early as 2006, he was, you know, always

38:43.560 --> 38:47.000
telling his family and friends as things going to turn on and it's going to be amazing,

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
amazing, amazing.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.760
And somebody said, you know, okay, stop talking about it, you know, you should do something

38:50.760 --> 38:54.360
and you know, he thought about writing, but that wasn't really right.

38:54.360 --> 38:59.080
And then he thought about trying to film something and he actually, I think, did try

38:59.080 --> 39:03.880
to film something and he famously filmed something with a Shelley Clash Owl, a famous

39:03.880 --> 39:06.200
physicist and had no sound.

39:06.200 --> 39:08.320
And I heard about him.

39:08.320 --> 39:14.040
I was in the narrative fiction world and was actually trying to get a script made.

39:14.040 --> 39:20.640
And you know, I was always interested in somehow doing something in film that related to science.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.560
I thought it was going to come from the fictional world.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.320
I thought I would write something about science.

39:25.320 --> 39:29.400
And I heard about this guy trying to make a documentary about this and the people who

39:29.400 --> 39:32.440
told me about it said, okay, he has no film experience.

39:32.440 --> 39:33.440
It's an experiment.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.440
They don't know if it's going to work.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.440
They don't know if they'll find anything.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.920
We're not going to get involved.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.880
And I said, that sounds great.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.040
And I met David in 2007.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.160
So I heard about it.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
He was in CERN.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.880
I tracked him down.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.400
And we talked about it.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.920
For me, I was very clear from the beginning.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.080
I did not want to make a typical science documentary.

39:54.080 --> 40:00.920
I wanted to use the narrative skills that I had in filmmaking, make a character based,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.720
try to make a dramatic film.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.640
And that's what David wanted as well.

40:04.640 --> 40:08.400
So I started really working on it full time in 2008.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.360
We started trying to get together.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.440
Andrew and Carla came on.

40:12.440 --> 40:17.360
We started to try to get some money together.

40:17.360 --> 40:25.840
The first shoot was in 2008 in September for first beam.

40:25.840 --> 40:36.720
We finished literally running to the airport with the film in 2013, in June of 2013.

40:36.720 --> 40:44.920
In terms of the explosion, yes, there was a lot of sensationalists talk about could

40:44.920 --> 40:48.320
it create a mini black hole that would destroy the universe?

40:48.320 --> 40:51.880
No physicist was ever worried about this.

40:51.880 --> 40:56.240
The person who was the biggest promoter of this was a high school science teacher in

40:56.240 --> 41:02.040
Hawaii who had read part of a paper that said that it could create little black holes but

41:02.040 --> 41:05.760
did not read the rest of the paper, which said that if it created these black holes,

41:05.760 --> 41:07.520
they would evaporate.

41:07.520 --> 41:12.600
Nonetheless, it got so much attention that CERN felt they had to address it.

41:12.600 --> 41:17.960
And they actually had two very respected theorists go through all the calculations to show that

41:17.960 --> 41:20.840
it was not going to be an issue.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.960
In terms of the accident, when the accident happened, they were not doing collisions.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.560
They were still first beams.

41:26.560 --> 41:29.720
They were just getting beams in one direction and the other.

41:29.720 --> 41:35.920
And in fact, the accident happened when they were just testing raising the energy of one

41:35.920 --> 41:37.320
of the beams.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.560
And they were trying to raise the energy and they needed to increase the energy and the

41:41.560 --> 41:45.720
magnets to be able to keep them in line.

41:45.720 --> 41:52.480
And what they believe now is that there was just as they increased the current in these

41:52.480 --> 42:01.200
magnets, one of the welds broke and it sparked and it caught the helium which is used to

42:01.200 --> 42:02.200
cool it.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.840
You know, it ignited that and it exploded.

42:04.840 --> 42:09.800
There were it had nothing to do with collisions, particles or anything like that at all.

42:09.800 --> 42:14.720
It was a very simple bed weld that did that.

42:14.720 --> 42:21.560
The collisions themselves take place in the center of the detectors and there's no worry

42:21.560 --> 42:25.040
that they're going to, they want them to explode in a sense.

42:25.040 --> 42:26.720
You know, that's the whole point.

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
There's no concern.

42:27.720 --> 42:31.400
And from the physics community, there was never any concern that they were going to

42:31.400 --> 42:34.800
do anything that could create a problem.

42:34.800 --> 42:43.600
I also just added in terms of some of the happy accidents or making your lock or jumping

42:43.600 --> 42:47.800
from failure to failure which I think, you know, all of them are different ways of saying

42:47.800 --> 42:53.560
it's only a letter to expressions, you know, that if you're in it for the long run and

42:53.560 --> 42:58.160
you believe in it, that you just keep going and good things happen in some way, I think

42:58.160 --> 43:04.760
that there are great backstories that, you know, partly speak to what documentaries

43:04.760 --> 43:13.360
are making like this is about and to this particular subject and the people who do it.

43:13.360 --> 43:19.760
One of them is that we really, we started to raise money for it just as the financial

43:19.760 --> 43:21.840
world was melting down.

43:21.840 --> 43:31.800
And it turned out that we reached out in different ways and it was actually people in the finance

43:31.800 --> 43:41.420
world who were trained physicists or mathematicians and who still had some love of it and we

43:41.420 --> 43:46.840
sent out a bunch of cold letters and, you know, one or two people actually opened them, you

43:46.840 --> 43:52.200
know, and remembered back to, you know, and got excited and that started a ball rolling

43:52.200 --> 43:56.200
that really enabled us to do the initial shooting.

43:56.200 --> 44:01.280
And once we got a certain ball rolling, it was easier to raise money both in terms of

44:01.280 --> 44:07.600
investment and in terms of philanthropic and foundation dollars.

44:07.600 --> 44:16.040
Another, this film could have gone in so many directions and that period during the hiatus

44:16.040 --> 44:21.320
when the machine had had the accident and was being repaired, which was over 18 months,

44:21.320 --> 44:27.320
there was a great, there was certainly some depression and some sense of what does this

44:27.320 --> 44:30.160
mean and we're ever going to get it up again and all those issues.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.640
But there's also a great deal of natural abolions and curiosity and kind of a, you know, sort

44:35.640 --> 44:40.360
of energizer bunny, you know, we would like, you know, David would say, David and Mark,

44:40.360 --> 44:42.840
you know, there's something we really should film.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.080
This may be a way to get it at a new way to analyze the data.

44:46.080 --> 44:51.840
It's going on at NYU where there's a dark matter experiment.

44:51.840 --> 44:57.640
The results of the American are going to be described at a conference in Santa Barbara

44:57.640 --> 45:03.360
and we have some great footage which eventually is going to be put to use but really does reflect

45:03.360 --> 45:08.480
a very natural buoyancy on the part of the scientists, the theorists.

45:08.480 --> 45:13.600
Then there's the elephant in the room in which we have spoken about Mark did but which is

45:13.600 --> 45:21.640
that at a certain point we really could, the science was becoming too difficult for the

45:21.640 --> 45:29.760
first editor to really address in a way that the film we were kind of stalled and through,

45:29.760 --> 45:35.640
well, really through Mark's long-term friendship with the brilliant feature editor Walter

45:35.640 --> 45:42.960
March, he came in and really started to cut the film in a very different way in a more

45:42.960 --> 45:48.320
kind of action film way and then we had, we never anticipated, we'd have the million

45:48.320 --> 45:56.000
dollar ending within the course of our shooting and so there is all of those things together

45:56.000 --> 46:02.200
with the characters and the sense of the story and the way we shot I think all combined

46:02.200 --> 46:09.800
to have made it something that is of such broad interest to non-science audiences.

46:09.800 --> 46:19.840
Do you have any of the cutting room for stuff? On DVD do you have any of the outtakes?

46:19.840 --> 46:25.280
Well, we actually don't really have a DVD yet but in principle it will, yes, I mean it

46:25.280 --> 46:32.720
is online so there's, I mean I, it's difficult to estimate exactly how much footage I have

46:32.720 --> 46:39.200
but I mean it's in the neighborhood of 300, 400 hours of material and you know it's 99

46:39.200 --> 46:46.480
minutes so there is a lot that's out of it. Some very complete fairly well edited sequences,

46:46.480 --> 46:51.680
one of them has definitely been cut and is available online, I mean actually on our website

46:51.680 --> 46:57.880
right now you can order sort of an enhanced download that includes that and a couple of

46:57.880 --> 47:04.040
other things and we're hoping that there will be some additional things as well. Some of

47:04.040 --> 47:11.840
them really were fairly, you know, pretty progressed fairly far in terms of the cutting

47:11.840 --> 47:25.280
and we do hope that we'll be able to use them. Particlefever.com, www.particlefever.com.

47:25.280 --> 47:30.520
Could you say more about how you convinced Sharon to let you in? I mean why did they

47:30.520 --> 47:36.480
allow you to come in to do this whole project? You know it's interesting, it was not that

47:36.480 --> 47:41.360
difficult, people have asked me that and I actually know some people that said that they

47:41.360 --> 47:50.240
had difficulty. In general they're pretty open, I think we had a special access partly

47:50.240 --> 47:56.040
because of our physics backgrounds, that they were very open in that regard and the interesting

47:56.040 --> 48:04.080
thing was people would typically come over and their news crews that would come over

48:04.080 --> 48:08.320
and they shoot for a day or two and they shoot certain people and they disappear. The fact

48:08.320 --> 48:14.760
that I kept going back became the key and that I made certain key alliances right from

48:14.760 --> 48:20.400
the very first time I was there and so typically when you go to CERN, if you go as a media

48:20.400 --> 48:30.000
for media purposes, they assign you a sort of coordinator who's there and after the first

48:30.000 --> 48:36.480
time I was there they stopped coming with me because they basically knew who I was going

48:36.480 --> 48:42.600
to see. I was seeing very responsible people and at that point all I had to do was say

48:42.600 --> 48:47.080
I'm coming at this point and they'd say okay we'll leave you a pass and then I just would

48:47.080 --> 48:54.640
go wherever I wanted. And so again I think it was a function of the fact that I had key

48:54.640 --> 48:59.480
people involved that they knew were responsible and then I kept coming back again and again

48:59.480 --> 49:02.920
and again and in fact I came back so much that at a certain point I think people thought

49:02.920 --> 49:07.280
I worked there actually. They didn't realize that I didn't actually live there all the

49:07.280 --> 49:16.280
time but I was really so integrated that nobody even paid any attention when I was there and

49:16.280 --> 49:22.200
that really ended up being what counted. And for our physicists I think that also when

49:22.200 --> 49:30.120
talk to them why they opened up to us so much was they also saw the persistence there. They

49:30.120 --> 49:34.680
knew that I was going to be back again and so if they didn't say it then I'm going to

49:34.680 --> 49:39.520
get them to say it another time so they might as well just do it and they ended up really

49:39.520 --> 49:47.400
being an incredible ally to the whole thing. Not only the physicists but CERN itself has

49:47.400 --> 49:54.400
an extensive media department and they do all these official things they film everything

49:54.400 --> 49:59.720
and they got very excited by the fact that I was making a feature film. I mean I actually

49:59.720 --> 50:03.600
don't know which was more important whether I had a physics background or whether I had

50:03.600 --> 50:09.480
worked on the talented Mr. Ripley which they all seemed to love. And the fact that they

50:09.480 --> 50:17.920
had this film part to me was something they hadn't really dealt with before and so they

50:17.920 --> 50:25.480
were very open to that and they would collaborate. And so the media department they loved the

50:25.480 --> 50:29.240
idea that somebody was making a real feature film and they became in a sense a second and

50:29.240 --> 50:35.760
third unit for me. We ourselves were usually just very small crew but I could have them

50:35.760 --> 50:40.080
cover other things for me and they all put it together.

50:40.080 --> 50:48.760
There's a bigger question involved I think which is that we always pitch the film as

50:48.760 --> 50:56.400
what if there have been cameras inside Los Alamos. And I think we all wanted to know

50:56.400 --> 51:02.520
as filmmakers but we thought that the public would want to hear what were the inside discussions

51:02.520 --> 51:08.400
were there moral questions the question of how many scientists believe in God or do they

51:08.400 --> 51:12.840
not believe in God or what do they believe in and what do they think they're doing what

51:12.840 --> 51:19.440
is the beauty in it for them. That was something that I think we were very aware of going in

51:19.440 --> 51:25.360
and I think that the scientists both in the university settings and its CERN itself also

51:25.360 --> 51:33.080
they wanted mark there. They wanted people to hear them talking about some of those bigger

51:33.080 --> 51:39.280
questions that they know they share with everybody else.

51:39.280 --> 51:43.680
Do you have an upcoming project or a future project that you're working on or you're

51:43.680 --> 51:48.080
primarily working on marketing and distributing this film?

51:48.080 --> 51:55.120
I actually am working on another project and it's fiction but it's actually interesting

51:55.120 --> 52:01.880
because as Andrew says we talked about it being Los Alamos for me people have said what do

52:01.880 --> 52:05.640
you want to do. If somebody said if I had all the money in the world what would I do as

52:05.640 --> 52:09.520
my next documentary and I said well it's not about our money I'd like to go back into

52:09.520 --> 52:14.120
time and I'd like to go back to when Watson and Crick discovered DNA and I think that's

52:14.120 --> 52:17.720
another place where it would have been great to have cameras and it turns out that there's

52:17.720 --> 52:22.440
a book that I'm really interested in called the Goldbug Variations if anybody's heard

52:22.440 --> 52:32.600
about it by Richard Powers. It is about molecular biology and music and so this art science

52:32.600 --> 52:39.920
overlap is very dear to me and it turns out that the rights became available and so that's

52:39.920 --> 52:42.560
going to be my next project I hope.

52:42.560 --> 52:48.880
Carla and I have four documentaries that will come out this year including there's one on

52:48.880 --> 52:56.880
Tuesday night at the at Lincoln Center it's called the Zionist idea and this shows our

52:56.880 --> 53:05.840
crazy curiosity goes in so many directions. It's a look at the evolving definition of

53:05.840 --> 53:12.360
Jewish statehood from the 19th century through to the present. We're also doing a film on

53:12.360 --> 53:18.600
mental health services in the military called Thank You for Your Service which unusually

53:18.600 --> 53:26.520
takes the in part takes the point of view of the psychiatrists and psychiatrists and

53:26.520 --> 53:31.840
psychologists who actually work within the military and they went up to the highest levels

53:31.840 --> 53:37.280
including a female general who was head of all mental health services there. We have

53:37.280 --> 53:42.880
a film about a historic film about Gertrude Bell that will probably come out in the fall

53:42.880 --> 53:50.040
who is an explorer British explorer and diplomat who drew the original borders of Iraq and

53:50.040 --> 53:57.840
we're also working on a film about wind power offshore wind power and the struggle to make

53:57.840 --> 54:04.240
it happen in the state of New Jersey. A real advocacy film for a change.

54:04.240 --> 54:10.840
Please join me in thanking Andrew, Carla and Mark not only for their generous time today

54:10.840 --> 54:18.560
but for creating a really brilliantly inspiring film that I think from our perspective of

54:18.560 --> 54:37.280
the helix center is sort of the quintessence of fusing art and science.
