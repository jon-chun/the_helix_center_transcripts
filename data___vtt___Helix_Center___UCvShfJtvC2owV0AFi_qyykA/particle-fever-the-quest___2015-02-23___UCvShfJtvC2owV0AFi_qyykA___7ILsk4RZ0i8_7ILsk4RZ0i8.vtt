00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
Now I'd like to introduce today's participants.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.280
And as I say your name, if you could just raise your hand

00:06.280 --> 00:08.400
so the audience can identify you.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.720
Sarah Dammers, the Horace D. Taft Associate Professor

00:11.720 --> 00:14.600
of Physics at Yale University, is a particle physicist

00:14.600 --> 00:17.840
who studies the fundamental particles and forces of nature.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.960
Her recent work has focused on the characterization

00:19.960 --> 00:21.800
of the Higgs boson and the measurement

00:21.800 --> 00:24.800
of tau polarization with the Atlas collaboration,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.560
as many of you saw in the film.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.440
It turns large Hadron Collider.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.840
She received her bachelor's degree from Harvard University

00:31.840 --> 00:34.240
and her PhD from the University of Rochester.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.640
She was a postdoctoral researcher

00:35.640 --> 00:39.080
with Stanford's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory

00:39.080 --> 00:42.200
before joining Yale's faculty in 2009.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.360
While at Yale she has received an early career award grant

00:45.360 --> 00:46.760
from the Department of Energy

00:46.760 --> 00:49.080
and the Yale Provost Teaching Award.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.560
She also collaborates with professional dancer, writer,

00:51.560 --> 00:56.000
and director of the Yale Dance Studies curriculum, Emily Coates.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
She encodes, co-teach, a physics of dance class together

00:59.000 --> 01:01.680
at Yale and are writing a course book under contract

01:01.680 --> 01:03.440
with Yale University Press.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.640
They've created an art science film called The Three Views

01:06.640 --> 01:08.840
of the Higgs and Dance.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.320
Mark Levinson, before embarking on his film career,

01:12.320 --> 01:14.640
earned a doctoral degree in theoretical particle physics

01:14.640 --> 01:16.960
from the University of California at Berkeley.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.840
In the film world he became a specialist in ADR, working

01:19.840 --> 01:22.200
with actors and directors in post production

01:22.200 --> 01:24.600
to write and record additional dialogue.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.440
He has worked closely with such directors as Anthony Mengella,

01:27.440 --> 01:30.480
an English patient, talented Mr. Ripley, Cold Mountain,

01:30.480 --> 01:33.960
Francis Ford Coppola, the Rainmaker, Milosz Foreman,

01:33.960 --> 01:38.080
Goya's Ghost, Sean Penn, The Pledge, and David Fincher,

01:38.080 --> 01:40.280
on Seven and the Social Network.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.440
He is the writer, producer, director of the narrative

01:42.440 --> 01:45.400
feature film Prisoner of Time, which examined the lives

01:45.400 --> 01:47.040
of former Russian dissident artists

01:47.040 --> 01:49.960
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and had an acclaimed

01:49.960 --> 01:52.760
premier at the Moscow International Film Festival.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.800
And as many of you saw, he directed the award winning

01:55.800 --> 01:58.800
documentary feature Particle Fever.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.840
Alberto Mengella is Canadian writer, translator, editor,

02:02.840 --> 02:05.680
and critic born in Buenos Aires in 1948.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.720
He has published several novels, including News

02:07.720 --> 02:10.760
from a Foreign Country Came and All Men are Liars,

02:10.760 --> 02:13.560
and nonfiction, including A History of Reading,

02:13.560 --> 02:18.840
The Library at Night, and together with Gianni Guadalupe,

02:18.840 --> 02:21.200
the Dictionary of Imaginary Places.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.360
He has received numerous international awards,

02:23.360 --> 02:25.400
among others the commander of the Order of Arts

02:25.400 --> 02:29.320
and Letters from France, and is Dr. Honors Kazza of the Universities

02:29.320 --> 02:32.880
of Leige in Belgium, and Angler Ruskin Cambridge

02:32.880 --> 02:34.200
in the United Kingdom.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.080
His new book Curiosity, as I mentioned earlier,

02:37.080 --> 02:39.320
will be published in March.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.800
Gene Strauss is the author of Morgan, American Financier,

02:43.800 --> 02:47.400
which was published in 1999, and again republished in 2014,

02:47.400 --> 02:50.840
and Alice James, a biography first published in 1980,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.600
and again in 2011, which won the Bankrupt Prize

02:53.600 --> 02:55.760
in American History and Diplomacy.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.080
Her essays and reviews have appeared in publications,

02:58.080 --> 03:00.520
including The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books,

03:00.520 --> 03:03.080
The New York Times, Vogue, and Slate,

03:03.080 --> 03:05.400
a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences

03:05.400 --> 03:07.480
and the American Philosophical Society.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.360
She has received fellowships from the MacArthur

03:09.360 --> 03:11.400
and Guggenheim Foundations, served

03:11.400 --> 03:14.040
as president of the Society of American Historians,

03:14.040 --> 03:16.760
and worked as a consultant, as oral historian,

03:16.760 --> 03:18.840
to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.880
She is currently director of the Dorothy and Lewis B.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.920
Coleman Center for Scholars and Writers

03:22.920 --> 03:25.000
at the New York Public Library.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.400
Now we'll begin.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.840
Maybe that film was absolutely fantastic,

03:37.840 --> 03:43.200
and there's a moment when they've done it, at least,

03:43.200 --> 03:44.560
we think they've done it.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.480
They've found the Higgs boson.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.120
And Savas, if anybody hasn't seen it,

03:49.120 --> 03:51.320
maybe you can explain more exactly what it is.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.600
But he says this little speech that made me cry,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.440
probably you as well from watching it,

03:56.440 --> 03:59.520
about how astonishing it is.

03:59.520 --> 04:03.520
That humanity, that people with our little brains

04:03.520 --> 04:05.800
can figure out things like this,

04:05.800 --> 04:08.640
that we want to understand the world

04:08.640 --> 04:12.400
and the universe we live in, and we can.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.560
At least so you probably remember that scene better

04:14.560 --> 04:16.320
than I've just described it.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.200
You know, Savas was such a gift to us.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.800
I mean, it's just like everything he said

04:20.800 --> 04:22.880
was like a Greek philosopher.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.600
I mean, and yeah, that line, I mean, you know,

04:27.600 --> 04:29.400
really in some sense it also reflects

04:29.400 --> 04:33.480
what really attracted me to physics initially.

04:33.480 --> 04:38.480
I mean, this fact that there seems to be,

04:38.480 --> 04:40.560
first of all, that there's any laws of nature at all.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.760
I mean, there's any laws of nature at all,

04:42.760 --> 04:45.520
that they're describable by mathematics.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.560
Mathematics is a language that we've invented

04:47.560 --> 04:51.640
and we understand this is the biggest mystery of all.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.160
I mean, that there didn't have to be order

04:55.160 --> 04:56.680
that we could comprehend.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.320
And the fact that we come up with this,

04:59.320 --> 05:02.000
you know, humans have come up with this invention,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
this mathematical thing that actually describes

05:07.240 --> 05:11.520
physical nature and the LHC, an extreme example

05:11.520 --> 05:14.760
of very abstract theories and then this huge machine

05:14.760 --> 05:19.200
that Sarah works on comes up with a bump

05:19.200 --> 05:20.280
that corresponds to it.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.440
I think it really is the thing that is the most magnificent

05:23.440 --> 05:27.440
thing and representative of an absolute peak

05:27.440 --> 05:30.840
in human achievement.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.960
I found it fascinating.

05:34.160 --> 05:38.160
The scientist is trying to find a vocabulary

05:38.160 --> 05:42.680
to speak about this and the vocabulary coming

05:42.680 --> 05:45.760
from philosophy, from literature.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.560
I found it very moving that scientists speak

05:48.560 --> 05:52.480
of a beautiful formula, a beautiful discovery.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.120
What does that mean to a scientist?

05:55.120 --> 05:57.920
I think that from my perspective,

05:57.920 --> 05:59.800
the scientists are human beings

05:59.800 --> 06:02.680
and so we think in these terms, right?

06:02.680 --> 06:06.520
It's interesting that there's been a divide

06:06.520 --> 06:09.600
between what people think of as the scientific brain

06:09.600 --> 06:12.360
that's operating and the artistic brain that's operating.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.400
I mean, I think it's natural to use that kind of language

06:16.400 --> 06:18.280
to describe something that you're excited about.

06:18.280 --> 06:21.120
It's wonderful to see it, to see it spoken,

06:21.120 --> 06:22.520
to hear it spoken.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.520
I think that the excitement or the miraculous discovery

06:28.480 --> 06:31.080
of the Higgs, it's the amazing fact

06:31.080 --> 06:33.120
that we can make that kind of progress

06:33.120 --> 06:38.120
is just firmly planted in the context of the lack

06:38.800 --> 06:41.120
of understanding in general that we have, right?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.400
That keeps that discovery at perspective.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.160
So as a practicing scientist,

06:45.160 --> 06:49.720
thinking about the Higgs and that achievement,

06:49.720 --> 06:52.560
as thrilling as it is and as much of a peak as it is,

06:52.560 --> 06:57.560
it's in this incredible valley with the 97%,

06:58.120 --> 07:00.960
94% of the universe that we don't understand,

07:00.960 --> 07:02.760
these huge mysteries, right?

07:02.760 --> 07:06.600
So it is very exciting and fascinating for me

07:06.600 --> 07:09.080
to think about that progress,

07:09.080 --> 07:12.760
but it's in that context of just a tremendous amount

07:12.760 --> 07:13.800
that we don't understand.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.240
It's not clear if we have a framework

07:16.240 --> 07:19.840
that will let us make further progress in the same way.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.680
For the next step.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.520
Yeah, and it's true.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.040
And I think that was one of the things that gave us

07:24.040 --> 07:26.520
some confidence that hopefully there would be people

07:26.520 --> 07:30.040
interested because we could touch these big issues.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.920
And these are issues that anybody can understand

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
and anybody can appreciate.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
You know, the details,

07:34.920 --> 07:36.480
and look, we made the decision very early on,

07:36.480 --> 07:38.160
this is not gonna be the film that explains

07:38.160 --> 07:39.640
all the detailed physics,

07:39.640 --> 07:42.440
but in some sense, we're gonna go for the big things.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.920
And the big issues,

07:43.920 --> 07:46.240
which are things that anybody has,

07:46.240 --> 07:49.440
you know, that we hoped anybody of any intellectual curiosity

07:49.440 --> 07:51.880
would be interested in, curiosity.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.400
I mean, I think it's amazing,

07:53.400 --> 07:54.240
you've written this book,

07:54.240 --> 07:38.160
because I think that's another one of S

07:56.240 --> 07:57.280
Grecise's great lines.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.080
When he's saying, you know, why do we do this?

07:59.080 --> 08:00.800
You know, and he thinks about these things

08:00.800 --> 08:02.480
for no reason, for no reason.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.600
I mean, and you know, he ties it in with this issue of,

08:05.600 --> 08:08.000
you know, there's no evolutionary value,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.480
and but what is the basis of it?

08:10.480 --> 08:15.080
Is a curiosity, and once you have it, you can't forget it.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.400
I mean, you must explore a lot more in your book.

08:18.400 --> 08:24.400
Well, I try to look at the questions that we ask.

08:24.520 --> 08:29.320
I think that the questions are so much more interesting

08:29.320 --> 08:32.640
than any answers that we can give,

08:32.640 --> 08:37.840
and what interested me in the film was that even

08:37.840 --> 08:42.400
with the discovery of the Higgs particle,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.160
you don't have an answer.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.120
You simply have more questions.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.760
You have another set of questions.

08:48.760 --> 08:54.320
And I'm always interested in the fact that we come

08:54.320 --> 08:57.480
from whatever vocabularies we have,

08:57.480 --> 09:01.360
and we apply the vocabulary to the world that we're seeing,

09:01.360 --> 09:05.880
because we have to remember that the universe

09:05.880 --> 09:11.160
is totally uncaring, the universe is not conscious of its laws,

09:11.160 --> 09:15.000
or what we do with them, or where we are.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
So these are questions that we bring to our state of being

09:22.000 --> 09:25.320
and to the universe around us.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.760
Even these words are invented by us.

09:28.760 --> 09:34.560
So we invent the story, and then we ask, how does this happen?

09:34.560 --> 09:37.600
What is the initial impulse to understand something

09:37.600 --> 09:39.080
or to work it out?

09:39.080 --> 09:41.920
That's the deep question, in a sense.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.640
And similarly related to the art issue,

09:46.640 --> 09:51.680
what is it that prompted the first person to draw

09:51.680 --> 09:53.760
a representation of the world on a cave?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.600
I mean, animals don't do that.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.640
I mean, that they would think that we could abstract,

09:59.640 --> 10:02.640
it's an abstract symbolic representation of the world

10:02.640 --> 10:05.000
around them.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.840
Was it motivated for informational purposes?

10:07.840 --> 10:11.600
Was it just, is it something intrinsic in us

10:11.600 --> 10:14.560
that we just want to represent something?

10:14.560 --> 10:17.520
And I do think that there's a very direct line

10:17.520 --> 10:20.560
to what MIMA is doing on the board,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.200
and we'll achieve very much.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.680
There's a beautiful count.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.160
Yeah.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.520
I was going to say the same thing.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.560
It's just a position of the glorious cave drawings,

10:28.560 --> 10:31.720
and MIMA writing his formulas on the board.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.360
And it made me think, this is what I see.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.680
That the caveman was saying, this is what I see,

10:37.680 --> 10:42.280
and MIMA is saying, this is what I see in such different realms

10:42.280 --> 10:43.760
and eons.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.600
But why do you think somebody first did it?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.040
They're winning.

10:49.040 --> 10:55.720
Biologists say that we came up with imagination

10:55.720 --> 10:59.160
as a mechanism for survival, so that we

10:59.160 --> 11:04.720
are the only species that can have an experience without actually

11:04.720 --> 11:06.400
having the experience.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.440
We can invent the story of what would happen

11:09.440 --> 11:15.680
if you put your hand in the mouth of a lion before doing that.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.040
And imagination leads immediately to questioning.

11:20.040 --> 11:24.320
When you look at something and you think

11:24.320 --> 11:28.000
that there's a story there, you want to know who did it.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.440
You want to know where it's going.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.880
You want to know what happened once upon a time

11:34.880 --> 11:37.640
and how will it end.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.200
I think we also, as individuals, have

11:40.200 --> 11:42.240
experience with this without having to be

11:42.240 --> 11:45.560
at the forefront of it, meaning when I was learning physics,

11:45.560 --> 11:47.880
I got to discover Newton's laws.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.640
Every step, when I understood something

11:50.640 --> 11:55.160
and saw, wait, this is applying to something real around me.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.560
I didn't have to be the first one to come up with that

11:57.560 --> 11:59.440
to understand that experience.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.080
And I think that all of the learning

12:01.080 --> 12:05.040
that we do when we're young in science or not in science,

12:05.040 --> 12:07.080
that teaches us what discovery is.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.440
Every individual gets to discover so many things

12:09.440 --> 12:11.120
about the world.

12:11.120 --> 12:16.560
The nice thing about, well, in the scientific discovery,

12:16.560 --> 12:19.720
what you get to keep doing is asking questions along that line,

12:19.720 --> 12:20.600
along a path.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.480
But you have a tremendous amount of experience

12:22.480 --> 12:24.360
discovering all the physics that's

12:24.360 --> 12:26.600
been discovered before you, everything you have time to

12:26.600 --> 12:28.560
discover that you can manage to grasp, right?

12:28.560 --> 12:31.520
I got the metaphor of running, by the way,

12:31.520 --> 12:36.120
the fact that you can't concentrate on getting somewhere.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.760
You need to keep asking the questions along the road.

12:39.760 --> 12:45.320
And that's what makes the activity interesting.

12:45.320 --> 12:46.400
Actually, it's also interesting.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.960
I mean, we don't join in the film.

12:47.960 --> 12:53.560
But Monica, Fabiola, and Martin all run.

12:53.560 --> 12:58.880
And Fabiola, Martin, Monica, and Nemo all play the piano.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.240
And I'm not going to extrapolate to everybody.

13:01.240 --> 13:06.120
But it is interesting that they have the running

13:06.120 --> 13:11.240
is this persistence, endurance, processing sort of thing.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.160
And then they interest in music, this other slide.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.080
It's going to be for each other.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.080
So we take these words and say all activities.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.080
For no reason.

13:18.080 --> 13:18.560
Yeah.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.560
Yes.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.160
It makes me think a little bit about young children

13:22.160 --> 13:24.880
and watching them explore the world with curiosity.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.200
Every single moment is a discovery for a young child.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.080
And certain adults keep that quality.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.000
And want to keep.

13:33.000 --> 13:33.840
Do you learn it?

13:33.840 --> 13:34.920
We relearn it.

13:34.920 --> 13:35.480
Wait a second.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.000
I get to ask why?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.760
I get to keep asking why?

13:38.760 --> 13:41.560
And having my kids are four and six right now,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.240
I remember the stage when they went through and realizing,

13:44.240 --> 13:47.480
wow, we learned being able to do that because I forgot it.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.640
I forgot that I had permission to ask how does that work?

13:50.640 --> 13:52.800
And to keep asking that next question.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.840
And not for what financial purpose.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.360
I guess.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.920
That was a great moment.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.720
Great moment.

13:57.720 --> 13:58.960
So I'm going to ask David.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.460
Yeah.

13:59.460 --> 13:59.960
Yeah.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.560
So everybody here has seen the film.

14:01.560 --> 14:02.560
Yeah.

14:02.560 --> 14:06.120
Actually, with a curiosity thing, one of my favorite moments

14:06.120 --> 14:08.960
actually, there was one Martin's doing the experiment

14:08.960 --> 14:09.600
with the kids.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.440
And he says, see this?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.080
And he says, yeah, but the card got wet.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.080
Yeah.

14:13.080 --> 14:18.840
You know, that's not exactly focusing on exactly the same thing.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.240
It's a good question.

14:20.240 --> 14:20.740
Yeah.

14:20.740 --> 14:21.240
Yeah.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.000
That leads to something else.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Right.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
But it's interesting.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.280
You were saying, too, I mean, in some sense,

14:28.280 --> 14:32.720
is it evolutionary adaptations?

14:32.720 --> 14:34.760
Maybe initially, it was predictive,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.880
that there was an adaptation that you could predict.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.640
That we first got this capability saying,

14:39.640 --> 14:43.200
if I go there and there's a lion there, I'm going to be eaten.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.640
And maybe it was a very practical thing initially

14:46.640 --> 14:49.400
to have this predictive imagination.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.560
And maybe the next step was an imagination

14:52.560 --> 14:54.400
that didn't necessarily have survival on it.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.000
Or maybe there wasn't a difference,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.760
because these are categories that we

15:00.760 --> 15:04.640
keep establishing in terms of practicality.

15:04.640 --> 15:08.200
You were saying this absurd difference

15:08.200 --> 15:13.000
between the mind of a scientist and the mind of an artist.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.880
Well, for a very long time, there was no difference

15:16.880 --> 15:19.440
in the Renaissance and the Middle Ages.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.080
An alchemist was what?

15:21.080 --> 15:22.760
An artist or a scientist?

15:22.760 --> 15:23.760
The an artist.

15:23.760 --> 15:29.680
Leonardo Dante, who was quoted and who, in fact, fits

15:29.680 --> 15:35.720
so perfectly with his idea at the end of his vision,

15:35.720 --> 15:38.760
when finally he sees the great vision,

15:38.760 --> 15:43.280
he compares it to the universe of scattered pages

15:43.280 --> 15:50.040
that somehow come bound in a volume at last for him to see.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.160
This is what I felt with the film,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.720
that the volume was being bound at last.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.880
We haven't read it.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.920
We don't know what it means.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.840
But somehow it's coming together.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.920
It's such a beautiful model.

16:05.920 --> 16:11.080
Well, I do think that this notion of the artist's brain

16:11.080 --> 16:13.640
and the science brain being separate is something

16:13.640 --> 16:15.720
that's just not true.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.600
I mean, there are examples of extremities in both cases.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.040
But I think one of the rewarding things

16:23.040 --> 16:25.840
we're taking a film around has been having people come up

16:25.840 --> 16:28.560
to me afterwards who are not physicists,

16:28.560 --> 16:30.080
which are first of all other scientists,

16:30.080 --> 16:34.120
but also in the arts and feeling akin to it.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.840
And actually having scientists tell me

16:36.840 --> 16:39.520
that they feel like they're artists.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.120
They feel like they're very creative artists.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
It is.

16:42.120 --> 16:47.360
You know, it's practically, it's difficult.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.040
And you fail and come up with lots of bad ideas,

16:50.040 --> 16:52.120
but artists do that all the time as well.

16:52.120 --> 16:57.680
Lovely idea that came up, the idea of failure as essential.

16:57.680 --> 17:02.160
Stevenson had this wonderful line about our purpose in life.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.800
It's not to succeed, but to continue

17:04.800 --> 17:08.120
to fail in the best of spirits.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.400
He would be very friendly with solace.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.160
I think one of the differences that I've seen working

17:15.160 --> 17:19.680
with artists and learning more about the products

17:19.680 --> 17:24.000
and the definition of research within art is the process.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.520
Right?

17:24.520 --> 17:25.960
That's what's different for us.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.200
We have a different process.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.080
And it's something that you learn how to do.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.280
You have to learn how to do.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.800
And when I talk to other physicists,

17:32.800 --> 17:34.600
we have a language that's shared.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.240
We tend to approach problems in similar ways.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.440
And what's interesting, I think, if you're working

17:41.440 --> 17:44.160
in these different realms, pushing toward research,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.160
discovering something, is to have access

17:46.160 --> 17:47.680
to other kinds of processes.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.320
It's interesting that the scientists also have a piece

17:50.320 --> 17:52.560
of that artistic process, right?

17:52.560 --> 17:55.760
We're allowed to try to learn different kinds of processes.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.640
I think it's helpful when you have that in your toolbox,

17:58.640 --> 18:01.480
not just one way of approaching a problem.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.920
Do you see parallels?

18:02.920 --> 18:05.560
No, go ahead.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.760
When you're working on dance, do you see parallels?

18:08.760 --> 18:10.160
I mean, it's a different language,

18:10.160 --> 18:13.240
but do you think about the connections?

18:13.240 --> 18:13.560
Right.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.600
So I'm not actually the one working on dance.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.920
I'm working with a dancer.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.920
And so I think we try to have our two disciplines interacting

18:20.920 --> 18:21.720
with each other.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.720
So we're going after that, I think.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.400
We're actively trying to see how is your process, what's mine?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.920
And yeah, that's our goal in some ways

18:29.920 --> 18:30.760
of that collaboration.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.280
Absolutely.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.160
I think this was sort of fascinating

18:33.160 --> 18:34.400
when I saw that you were doing this,

18:34.400 --> 18:39.920
because there's a troop, Liz Lerman, as a dancer.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.960
She has a troop down in Baltimore.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.160
And she went to CERN.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.120
And she wanted to try to do something there.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.720
And she just, you know, is just this feeling as an artist.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.760
And I think we're seeing a lot of this.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.920
There's a cross fertilization, but there seems

18:57.920 --> 18:59.760
to be many more artists that are really getting

18:59.760 --> 19:00.720
fascinated with science.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.040
And so she went there.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.520
And they went down to the cavern.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.120
And they did this thing.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
And, you know, she had these dancers,

19:07.120 --> 19:09.000
these men wearing dresses.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.840
And you see the, they filmed it.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.320
And you see these engineers there with hard hats

19:14.320 --> 19:15.560
just sort of looking.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.960
And I don't know which is more bizarre, you know,

19:17.960 --> 19:20.920
the construction, like the Atlas cavern,

19:20.920 --> 19:25.000
or these men and dresses dancing around down there.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.720
And she wanted to just do a piece about it.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.600
And we actually filmed a performance that she did

19:30.600 --> 19:31.760
and didn't make it in the film.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.080
But it's so, it was fascinating when I read

19:34.080 --> 19:36.720
that you are now also involved working with a dancer.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.960
And what was, how did that happen?

19:38.960 --> 19:40.120
What was the motivation for you?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.840
Well, one thing I should say is that we've had Liz

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
come to our class.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.480
So that those of us who work in these kinds of juxtapositions

19:46.480 --> 19:48.880
tend to find each other.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.240
So the collaboration between physics and dance

19:53.240 --> 19:56.880
that we have at Yale was really started in a top down way.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.280
It wasn't organic story.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.720
It was a curriculum development piece.

20:00.720 --> 20:06.480
And I was imagining physics, like taking dance

20:06.480 --> 20:08.680
to a work of art and breaking it down

20:08.680 --> 20:10.160
from the physics perspective, right?

20:10.160 --> 20:12.120
Making that mathematical model of everything

20:12.120 --> 20:13.520
that's happening in physics.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.920
And the dancer who I happened to work with

20:15.920 --> 20:19.520
was very sophisticated with a mission of her own

20:19.520 --> 20:22.840
who was doing movement research and was not interested

20:22.840 --> 20:27.600
in that kind of art at the service of science collaboration,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.400
which became obvious very early.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.320
And so the two of us decided, let's

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
take our two disciplines on equal footing

20:33.320 --> 20:34.680
and see where this takes us.

20:34.680 --> 20:39.600
Let's let dance, help us understand and communicate science.

20:39.600 --> 20:43.480
And let's let science help us understand and communicate dance.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.400
Let's go in both directions, take turns leading.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.240
And then sometimes we're not going

20:47.240 --> 20:49.320
to be speaking the same language.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.600
And those times we'll just put the two next to each other

20:51.600 --> 20:53.400
and see what happens.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.720
I think the place that we've pushed it

20:56.720 --> 20:59.800
is this idea of embodied cognition,

20:59.800 --> 21:01.240
and not really pushed it in that direction,

21:01.240 --> 21:02.040
but thinking about it.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.360
From my perspective as a practicing scientist,

21:04.360 --> 21:07.560
what is it that how does this feed back into my research?

21:07.560 --> 21:10.040
And it's been a recognition of the reality,

21:10.040 --> 21:11.480
that the ways we operate in the world,

21:11.480 --> 21:13.960
including our very bodies, have an impact

21:13.960 --> 21:15.920
on the way we're approaching the world.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.120
These, the creativity that you have,

21:18.120 --> 21:20.200
the kinds of questions that you can ask.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.800
The questions you're capable of asking,

21:21.800 --> 21:24.960
the analogies that you have access to,

21:24.960 --> 21:29.400
are all limited or informed by your experience in the world,

21:29.400 --> 21:31.560
which wow, you're right, that has something to do

21:31.560 --> 21:33.360
with your body, it never occurred to me

21:33.360 --> 21:35.320
before interacting with the dancer.

21:35.320 --> 21:39.040
I was sentenced as well, because I'm always wondering,

21:39.040 --> 21:42.480
when you talk about that model of the universe,

21:42.480 --> 21:45.400
where we are in this tiny lost corner

21:45.400 --> 21:50.400
and the possibility of these other worlds around us,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.800
expanding, what don't we see?

21:54.800 --> 21:58.320
And already there, I'm limiting the question

21:58.320 --> 22:02.880
by the fact that I know that humans see.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.960
But what are the senses that would allow us

22:06.960 --> 22:11.960
to understand, grasp, perceive, discover?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.840
I don't know what verb to use, the rest of the universe.

22:17.720 --> 22:21.160
Yeah, well, I think you are up the boundaries of things

22:21.160 --> 22:23.760
that we can comprehend.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.760
And that is an interesting concept.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.320
I mean, the idea of the multiverse,

22:29.920 --> 22:32.120
I mean, in one sense, it's easy to say the words,

22:32.120 --> 22:33.400
oh, it's other universes,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.400
but actually rigorously, mathematically,

22:36.400 --> 22:38.240
I mean, it's hard to actually imagine

22:38.240 --> 22:41.560
how we would actually detect it.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.080
I mean, I think that's really the issue.

22:44.080 --> 22:48.080
People often ask, do I prefer the multiverse

22:48.080 --> 22:50.760
or supersymmetry or what do physicists prefer?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.040
And I always say, I think it's legitimate,

22:53.040 --> 22:56.160
is they actually don't care as long as they know

22:56.160 --> 22:57.520
which one it is.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.640
I mean, because supersymmetry

22:59.640 --> 23:01.840
has all these beautiful things about it.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.160
I mean, it's really, it's such an absolute accomplishment

23:05.160 --> 23:07.760
and it would solve certain issues, possibly,

23:07.760 --> 23:10.520
possibly explaining dark matter and various other issues.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.320
And so that would be great.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.880
But, I mean, if we could prove that there's other universes,

23:17.880 --> 23:20.120
I mean, that would be even more profound,

23:20.120 --> 23:23.080
but the problem is we just don't know how to do it.

23:23.080 --> 23:27.360
And so we've invented an idea

23:27.360 --> 23:30.560
that we might not be able to prove,

23:30.560 --> 23:34.240
which is a very difficult position to be in.

23:34.240 --> 23:36.400
Because not only perhaps prove,

23:36.400 --> 23:40.920
but also we wouldn't have the vocabulary to name it.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.960
I love an anecdote about Christopher Columbus

23:44.960 --> 23:49.040
coming to America and he writes this in his journal

23:49.040 --> 23:52.680
that he approaches the coast of Venezuela

23:52.680 --> 23:56.080
and he sees three manatees swimming

23:56.080 --> 24:00.280
and he says, yesterday I saw three mermaids,

24:00.280 --> 24:02.960
but they're not as beautiful as they say they are.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.960
LAUGHTER

24:04.960 --> 24:09.960
We bring the vocabulary of what we think we're going to see,

24:09.960 --> 24:15.240
but if we see something that we have no way of recognizing

24:15.240 --> 24:16.440
how do we name it?

24:16.440 --> 24:20.960
I wanted to see what you think about this,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.280
because I understand what you said about art and science

24:25.280 --> 24:31.960
and so on, but are there, A, individual differences

24:31.960 --> 24:35.680
in the level of passion and energy

24:35.680 --> 24:40.080
that goes behind the kind of endeavor

24:40.080 --> 24:42.360
that we saw in the movie,

24:42.360 --> 24:46.400
and which I feel coming from you,

24:46.400 --> 24:49.560
because when you talked about what you were doing,

24:49.560 --> 24:52.400
there is so much energy already behind it

24:52.400 --> 24:56.320
that I assume you have a lot of passion for what you do.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.320
So not everybody has it.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.400
So that's number one.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.800
And number two, is it possible that certain researchers

25:05.800 --> 25:13.320
or endeavors are more fueled by curiosity

25:13.320 --> 25:17.600
and this desire for the quest than others?

25:17.600 --> 25:22.680
And is it possible that physics is one of them?

25:22.680 --> 25:23.160
Wow.

25:23.160 --> 25:27.320
So I think back to the idea of process,

25:27.320 --> 25:31.520
I think in any work that you're doing,

25:31.520 --> 25:35.280
there's going to be incredible drudgery.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.520
There's going to be times when you're measuring

25:37.520 --> 25:39.360
the lengths of springs.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.360
I recently have been cutting and pasting a lot of names

25:43.360 --> 25:47.160
of atlas data set IDs that we used

25:47.160 --> 25:49.640
for one of the Higgs characterization papers

25:49.640 --> 25:51.280
into a spreadsheet.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.120
So I think that there certainly are different levels

25:54.120 --> 25:56.920
of tenacity that people have.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.920
Something that I try to do that is much easier

25:59.920 --> 26:03.240
as an educator and a researcher to do for me

26:03.240 --> 26:05.800
is maintain the sense of the big picture

26:05.800 --> 26:10.360
so that when I'm cutting and pasting or whatever

26:10.360 --> 26:14.480
the drudgery is in my process or the things I have to get through,

26:14.480 --> 26:18.240
I know I appreciate the little steps,

26:18.240 --> 26:20.800
the completed spreadsheet that tells the complete picture

26:20.800 --> 26:23.320
of how we simulated that sample and made that plot.

26:23.320 --> 26:27.000
It's the little victories that I celebrate along the way,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.960
but also try to maintain the big picture of what the science is

26:30.960 --> 26:34.400
trying to achieve and what we're doing together.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.320
So I think that some people, the people who I've seen

26:38.320 --> 26:42.320
who have left the fields of physics,

26:42.320 --> 26:45.120
I don't know that it's a different level of passion.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.440
It's not even a different level of capability,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.160
but it's important to have the ability

26:50.160 --> 26:53.400
to make it through the drudgery of your practice.

26:53.400 --> 26:56.640
And when I think of the parallel with the artist,

26:56.640 --> 27:01.640
so Emily, the practice of dance, the rigor of that,

27:02.040 --> 27:05.000
or basketball player, dribbling the basketball,

27:05.000 --> 27:06.360
you've got to dribble the basketball,

27:06.360 --> 27:08.680
you've got to do the layups over and over and over again

27:08.680 --> 27:11.520
and keep in mind the big picture of the game

27:11.520 --> 27:12.840
that you're going to play, right?

27:12.840 --> 27:15.280
You've got to, and then keep fighting past

27:15.280 --> 27:18.240
when you lose the game or when we make the plot

27:18.240 --> 27:20.160
and things don't look the way we think that they do,

27:20.160 --> 27:21.640
things that we don't understand them.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.120
So yeah, I think to be successful.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.960
I was looking for something.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.480
It seems to me there is an element of searching

27:30.480 --> 27:33.720
for something, finding answers to something

27:33.720 --> 27:36.200
that is particular to certain fields.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.360
Yeah, I think you're right.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.560
I think you're right.

27:39.680 --> 27:43.840
For me, the idea of being associated with a quest

27:43.840 --> 27:46.720
that I see as such a fundamental part

27:46.720 --> 27:50.640
of who human beings are, something that's been going on.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.400
How many years, thousands and thousands and thousands

27:53.400 --> 27:56.360
of years trying to understand the universe,

27:56.360 --> 28:00.680
even being a little part of that for me is real privilege

28:00.680 --> 28:03.600
and I think keeps me very excited.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.440
I don't know.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.920
I mean, it is true, especially in big science.

28:06.920 --> 28:10.160
I mean, there are different levels of engagement

28:10.160 --> 28:13.880
and there are people that are very happy

28:13.880 --> 28:15.560
to be just doing their little job

28:15.560 --> 28:18.840
and they're not really thinking about the big questions.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.640
It may have been their initial motivation

28:20.640 --> 28:22.640
but the practicality is different

28:22.640 --> 28:26.720
and it's hard to be at the frontier of things

28:26.720 --> 28:31.720
and I think that you tend to think

28:32.720 --> 28:35.640
that somebody who's an artist might be demonstrating

28:35.640 --> 28:39.320
the passion more but you have to compare it

28:39.320 --> 28:42.080
to the people in the sciences that are doing the same thing.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.080
I think one of the big differences in the science

28:44.080 --> 28:47.240
is there's sort of a measurable sense of progress

28:47.240 --> 28:48.760
that when you're doing your spreadsheet,

28:48.760 --> 28:52.160
you know when you've completed it, you've got it

28:52.160 --> 28:54.560
and it's done whereas I think in the arts,

28:54.560 --> 28:57.440
it's actually, you're never really sure if you're done.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.600
You're never really done.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.400
I think you're never really done.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.640
No, the whole idea of discovery with the Higgs boson

29:03.640 --> 29:06.640
is it's a limit we set five sigma, right?

29:06.640 --> 29:09.120
I mean, there's not that kind of certainty

29:09.120 --> 29:10.480
in the sciences, I don't think.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.280
I don't know when I'm done with my plot.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.120
I believe that I understand the data.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.200
I've convinced enough of my colleagues

29:16.200 --> 29:18.680
so they'll let me move forward with it

29:18.680 --> 29:21.200
and we'll put our names on it in a paper

29:21.200 --> 29:23.520
but no, we never know when we're done.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.600
No, no, no, I didn't mean in a big sense.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.840
I certainly agree with that but along the way,

29:28.840 --> 29:31.840
there are tasks that can be completed

29:31.840 --> 29:34.320
that you can say, you know, whereas, you know,

29:34.320 --> 29:35.560
writing, what about it, you know,

29:35.560 --> 29:37.560
do you ever really think that you're right?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.160
That you, you know, oh, I've got this chapter,

29:40.160 --> 29:42.360
I'm done with it, I don't have to go back to it.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.200
Never do it.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.080
This also reminds me,

29:45.080 --> 29:47.520
and you're commenting about Columbus,

29:47.520 --> 29:52.520
Rangabel with Daniel Boorstein in his 1975 wreath lectures,

29:54.560 --> 29:58.320
made a distinction between discoverers and explorers.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.880
Columbus was a discoverer because he was looking

30:01.880 --> 30:04.000
for what he thought he knew, you know,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.240
something about Asia that he was looking for a path.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.680
But Bournsney's distinction was about exploration,

30:11.680 --> 30:14.720
not having a defined goal per se.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.160
I mean, I'm also wondering how you think about that

30:18.160 --> 30:20.560
in your individual work, is that a useful distinction?

30:20.560 --> 30:23.760
Or how do you process your curiosity

30:23.760 --> 30:26.840
in terms of discovery versus exploration?

30:26.840 --> 30:31.840
Yeah, I mean, writing is similar and different

30:32.080 --> 30:33.320
in some ways to all of this,

30:33.320 --> 30:37.440
but to have an enormous research project,

30:37.440 --> 30:40.920
which you probably think you know about at the beginning,

30:40.920 --> 30:44.280
and then when you're tunneled into years and years

30:44.280 --> 30:49.280
of reading and observing and learning,

30:50.240 --> 30:52.320
you find it's taking you in directions

30:52.320 --> 30:54.280
you weren't expecting at all.

30:54.280 --> 30:59.280
Well, you have your wonderful biography of Alice James.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.760
You mentioned somewhere that Alice James talks

31:02.760 --> 31:06.200
about the everyday tasks,

31:06.200 --> 31:11.200
and in what bigger picture does that fit?

31:11.200 --> 31:14.520
I don't know that I'm quoting this correctly,

31:14.520 --> 31:17.480
but to speak of what she does every day,

31:17.480 --> 31:21.960
and then asking the question of that you were asking,

31:25.680 --> 31:30.680
in what big book do these individual chapters fit?

31:31.800 --> 31:34.240
That connects to something that Mark said earlier too

31:34.240 --> 31:35.760
about making this film,

31:35.760 --> 31:38.160
finding people through whom to tell the story.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.680
I think biography is finding narrative ways

31:41.680 --> 31:45.080
into history that are very appealing,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.560
both as a writer to be able to understand history that way,

31:47.560 --> 31:49.160
and one hopes as a reader.

31:50.480 --> 31:53.400
So yes, there is a particular life

31:53.400 --> 31:55.960
with its particular circumstances,

31:55.960 --> 31:58.200
and you absolutely stay with those,

31:58.200 --> 32:00.400
but you also have to give it a context.

32:00.400 --> 32:04.720
So here is the younger sister of William and Henry James

32:04.720 --> 32:07.760
who was very articulate, very bright,

32:07.760 --> 32:11.880
but she wasn't a genius on the order of her brothers.

32:11.880 --> 32:15.160
What could she carve out for herself as a life,

32:15.160 --> 32:17.200
as a way to be, to speak?

32:17.200 --> 32:20.400
She did actually keep a diary toward the end of her life

32:20.400 --> 32:23.440
and found her own voice in a way,

32:23.440 --> 32:26.800
and was a very difficult life,

32:26.800 --> 32:28.920
and it was only the last few years of her life,

32:28.920 --> 32:33.920
but she did make a place for herself in that pantheon,

32:34.120 --> 32:37.200
but in there was published, nobody knew about it.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.080
So in an odd way, this is a funny thing to say,

32:40.080 --> 32:41.560
but I think you'll see what I mean.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.880
In writing a book about her, I gave her a bigger voice.

32:44.880 --> 32:45.880
Yes, absolutely.

32:45.880 --> 32:50.000
Absolutely, and you followed that part of exploration

32:50.000 --> 32:53.160
rather than discovery, because you didn't know

32:53.160 --> 32:56.800
where you were going, and I think it's always

32:56.800 --> 33:01.800
the most interesting, I go back to the metaphor of the runner.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.160
I find that very, very useful,

33:05.160 --> 33:09.720
because running to get somewhere

33:09.720 --> 33:12.360
is far less interesting than running.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.800
Well, that's actually another quote of Salas's,

33:15.800 --> 33:19.320
which we didn't include, I thought it was in it, but it's out,

33:19.320 --> 33:21.560
which he very explicitly says,

33:21.560 --> 33:24.360
that you have to enjoy the journey, it's like the Odyssey.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.560
You have to enjoy the journey, and as he said,

33:27.560 --> 33:30.560
when he got home, it actually wasn't all that great.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
Yeah, absolutely.

33:31.560 --> 33:36.560
That's a little more about curiosity, your book curiosity.

33:37.800 --> 33:42.800
Well, I started with the idea of which you asked,

33:44.040 --> 33:45.760
which is why are we curious?

33:45.760 --> 33:48.800
Why do we want to ask questions?

33:48.800 --> 33:53.800
And what are the questions that pushed our thought forward

33:56.800 --> 34:00.200
when we started thinking about who we are

34:00.200 --> 34:05.040
and what this place is that we call the world,

34:05.040 --> 34:08.520
or the universe, and then onwards.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.880
And to see how many times those questions

34:13.960 --> 34:17.320
are against our impulse of labeling,

34:17.320 --> 34:22.320
so that we seem to exist between these two contradictory

34:23.880 --> 34:28.880
impulses of building labels that comfort us,

34:28.880 --> 34:33.880
and having languages that are catechisms and dogmatic,

34:36.520 --> 34:38.080
and then on the other side,

34:38.080 --> 34:40.760
asking questions that destroy those labels

34:40.760 --> 34:42.600
and those catechisms.

34:43.920 --> 34:48.920
And I go into the discussion of what is a permissible curiosity

34:50.480 --> 34:54.640
and what is not, and I use Dante.

34:54.640 --> 34:58.560
I thought it was wonderful when she puts Dante there.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.560
Yes.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.080
We made this film with you in mind.

35:02.080 --> 35:04.360
Thank you.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.440
Because you can hang almost everything,

35:09.440 --> 35:11.360
these questions are in the Comedia,

35:11.360 --> 35:14.680
and they are very useful to illustrate them.

35:14.680 --> 35:19.680
So yes, but going back to the question and the film,

35:19.680 --> 35:24.680
I felt such joy and elation when this higs purf to us.

35:25.960 --> 35:30.960
And again, not discovered, but that we have the courage

35:30.960 --> 35:34.960
of saying we, now you have the courage of saying,

35:34.960 --> 35:38.400
this is there, and so there is something.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.360
Now let's start to revise everything,

35:41.360 --> 35:51.360
throw everything out of the window and start again.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.880
It's extraordinary, and I think that there are so many moments

35:54.880 --> 35:58.080
where we have done that, where we discover that the earth

35:58.080 --> 36:01.720
is round, where we discover gravity.

36:01.720 --> 36:08.720
And those are moments that exist also in painting and dance,

36:08.720 --> 36:13.720
in literature, we certainly say this begins something else.

36:16.520 --> 36:20.520
Although I think actually that brings up really what is it,

36:20.520 --> 36:24.000
sort of a critical difference with art and sciences.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.160
And in some sense, there's consensus in science

36:26.160 --> 36:28.360
when you have proved something.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.720
There's very little consensus.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.000
I mean, there can be an art.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
It's easier to refute somebody saying,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.680
oh, this is great, this is not great.

36:40.680 --> 36:46.680
I mean, you're much more subject to subjective interpretation.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.440
I can't argue against that.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.440
Yeah.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.880
Yeah, I mean, there are a few fools who will say

36:52.880 --> 36:56.120
that King Lear is not a good play.

36:57.640 --> 37:01.560
But by and large, there are some things that we,

37:02.680 --> 37:06.640
as humans, agree upon, we don't agree

37:06.640 --> 37:10.400
why they are great or why they move us.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.680
But I think that by and large.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.320
But what about like modern art?

37:17.560 --> 37:18.720
Give it time.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.800
Give it time.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.800
Give it time.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.000
It was modern art.

37:22.000 --> 37:22.840
Yeah.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.520
But I think one of the differences is that at its best,

37:25.520 --> 37:29.480
or at his or her best as scientist is just waiting,

37:29.480 --> 37:33.880
it has a theory, but the work is to understand

37:33.880 --> 37:35.080
if the theory is correct.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.960
The work is not to convince the worlds of the theory

37:37.960 --> 37:40.560
or to build up everything around the theory

37:40.560 --> 37:42.800
to make sure that this idea is the one

37:42.800 --> 37:44.240
that everybody agrees with.

37:44.240 --> 37:47.000
The work is to try to say, is this the right theory

37:47.000 --> 37:48.920
or is this the not right theory?

37:48.920 --> 37:51.760
And so what that means is when somebody refutes,

37:51.760 --> 37:54.280
it's progress.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.120
Yes.

37:55.120 --> 37:59.360
And as opposed to condemnation of you, right?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.280
Having a theory that's then refuted,

38:01.280 --> 38:04.680
well, that's really helpful that you propose this theory.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.440
And the fact that it's not true,

38:06.440 --> 38:07.800
we've made progress through that.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.400
There's no shame, right?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.920
There might be frustration or some disappointment,

38:11.920 --> 38:12.840
but it's progress.

38:12.840 --> 38:16.520
And so I think it's a different.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.800
Yeah, but I agree.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.240
Just so following up on yours, do you think that eventually

38:22.240 --> 38:24.000
Nima's going to like that sculpture?

38:24.000 --> 38:27.080
LAUGHTER

38:27.080 --> 38:31.480
I got pretty good at that.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.760
But I liked it, certainly.

38:34.760 --> 38:41.000
So maybe that's a refutation of his not lighting it.

38:41.000 --> 38:52.440
But style as theory and science takes time to ground itself.

38:52.440 --> 38:58.360
And when you build something, if everybody agrees upon that

38:58.360 --> 39:04.040
at the moment, you know that it's conventional and probably

39:04.040 --> 39:06.320
not of much use.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.760
Yes.

39:08.760 --> 39:15.400
When you have something that needs to be learned

39:15.400 --> 39:18.880
with a different vocabulary, then maybe you

39:18.880 --> 39:21.640
have something that is interesting.

39:21.640 --> 39:26.560
But the artist as a scientist has constantly

39:26.560 --> 39:31.520
to teach us how to look and how to think.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.640
When you said there is curiosity and you kind of left

39:35.640 --> 39:39.120
prohibited curiosity, you used what you have in mind.

39:39.120 --> 39:47.600
Well, from the very beginning of our consciousness

39:47.600 --> 39:55.240
of curiosity, we have discussed what

39:55.240 --> 39:58.040
we should be allowed to be curious about.

39:58.040 --> 40:02.360
So in the Judeo-Christian tradition, for instance,

40:02.360 --> 40:06.800
we were not allowed to eat the fruit of one tree.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.600
All the rest was fine.

40:08.600 --> 40:14.080
But why that particular fruit and why that particular tree?

40:14.080 --> 40:21.720
And this starts a line of thought that is also

40:21.720 --> 40:29.000
found in Greek philosophy and also found in Indian philosophy

40:29.000 --> 40:33.360
that there are certain enterprises that should not

40:33.360 --> 40:39.840
be attempted because they might destroy our comfortable view

40:39.840 --> 40:42.320
of the universe.

40:42.320 --> 40:47.840
Ulysses in Dante is not allowed to go beyond the limits

40:47.840 --> 40:49.040
of the known world.

40:49.040 --> 40:56.480
When he goes there, he falls into a kind of wave

40:56.480 --> 40:57.480
that swallows him.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.880
And that is his last journey.

40:59.880 --> 41:06.000
Because if he gets to that point, which is Mount Purgatory,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.160
our view of the world is destroyed,

41:08.160 --> 41:11.160
the dogma no longer holds.

41:11.160 --> 41:17.360
And so that is considered bad curiosity.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.840
But we have that in science now.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.840
I mean, the whole discussion about in biology,

41:24.840 --> 41:32.240
or how you should be allowed to tamper with genes, for instance,

41:32.240 --> 41:38.160
up to where you can investigate science.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.000
Well, I mean, now Oppenheimer's famous quote

41:41.000 --> 41:45.320
after the detonation of Bonne was, you know,

41:45.320 --> 41:47.800
in the sense that we had to do this.

41:47.800 --> 41:52.360
It was such a beautiful idea, even though, in some sense,

41:52.360 --> 41:53.920
even credited afterwards.

41:53.920 --> 41:58.800
But that it was where our curiosity led.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.280
And then we had to deal with the consequences.

42:01.280 --> 42:01.800
Right.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.600
And so it seems to me an individual fact,

42:04.600 --> 42:11.680
because Sarah said she rediscovered the ability to ask why.

42:11.680 --> 42:14.880
So there was a period where she had lost that ability.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.000
She had it.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.120
She lost it, then she rediscovered it.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.520
And when you talk about your book,

42:21.520 --> 42:24.400
it is clear that you had a lot of questions to ask.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.920
If you didn't have questions to ask,

42:25.920 --> 42:28.280
you wouldn't have been able to write your book.

42:28.280 --> 42:33.240
So there is something that motivates that,

42:33.240 --> 42:37.120
or there is a pressure that some people seem

42:37.120 --> 42:40.240
to have more than others, that keeps wanting you

42:40.240 --> 42:47.800
to keep asking questions as far as the quest for the he expose on.

42:47.800 --> 42:51.560
There is an argument that was made in the movie and so on.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.000
Why are we doing this?

42:53.000 --> 42:54.800
In other words, there is no benefit.

42:54.800 --> 42:58.160
There is, supposedly, we find it then what?

42:58.160 --> 43:01.400
Well, you can't ask that question

43:01.400 --> 43:03.520
when that is your curiosity.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.680
That's what you want to do.

43:05.680 --> 43:09.120
And so I was wondering if you people, all four of you,

43:09.120 --> 43:14.800
who seem to be determined and have that pressure

43:14.800 --> 43:19.880
and you keep going, what is it that is moving you like this?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.040
At the top one.

43:24.040 --> 43:31.040
Well, partly, the confidence that if you keep asking questions,

43:31.040 --> 43:34.120
you will come to a more interesting place.

43:34.120 --> 43:37.720
Because I think that many people are prevented

43:37.720 --> 43:41.440
from asking questions by the idea that if you start

43:41.440 --> 43:44.560
asking questions, you disturb the status quo

43:44.560 --> 43:50.240
and you won't have that comfortable life.

43:50.240 --> 43:57.480
And that applies in politics, in literature, in science.

43:57.480 --> 44:02.320
If you don't ask questions, then everything seems fine.

44:02.320 --> 44:04.760
There's a couple of necessary conditions, I think.

44:04.760 --> 44:07.920
And one of them is the acceptance that failure is

44:07.920 --> 44:09.280
of potential.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.160
So I think that that throughout my life

44:12.160 --> 44:15.080
has been, it showed itself in different ways.

44:15.080 --> 44:19.640
In school, I knew, boy, I'm going to go for it with physics.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.600
There were times when I was very underprepared

44:21.600 --> 44:25.840
because of not having the same kinds of classes going in

44:25.840 --> 44:28.000
that other people did.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.960
But I knew, hey, if this doesn't work, that's OK.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.240
I'll do something else.

44:32.240 --> 44:33.400
My family will love me.

44:33.400 --> 44:34.800
I can fail here.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.520
And that's what gave me the ability to keep going.

44:37.520 --> 44:38.920
And I think I still feel that.

44:38.920 --> 44:42.840
I still feel that if a line of research

44:42.840 --> 44:45.680
that I'm really excited about, that people say is risky.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.000
I work with a topic, the tau lepton.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.320
It's difficult to work with.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.320
And a lot of people say, boy, that's just, why are you

44:52.320 --> 44:53.400
doing that slog?

44:53.400 --> 44:55.400
Because you might not get to that final result.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.160
I feel like that's OK.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.240
It's OK if that doesn't work.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.760
There will be something else.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.160
I'll do something else.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.200
So I think that's one of the necessary conditions

45:05.200 --> 45:08.240
in terms of the pressure.

45:08.240 --> 45:11.880
There was a moment when Nimes says, 15 years.

45:11.880 --> 45:14.080
I've been doing this for 15 years.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.480
And it might not work.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.000
And there goes 15 years.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.520
It was not OK for his perspective.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.040
It's not OK.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.400
That's right.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.960
And just a quick anecdote.

45:22.960 --> 45:25.440
I wrote another book about JP Morgan.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.920
And I didn't know anything about finance.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.600
I just stepped off a cliff.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.840
And I thought, oh, I'll learn it.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.160
Year nine, I was waiting about 4 o'clock in the morning

45:35.160 --> 45:37.800
thinking, I can't do this.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.640
And I can't pay back my book advance.

45:39.640 --> 45:43.240
And so something kept me going.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.680
And I found a way.

45:44.680 --> 45:50.120
But you're on a tightrope all by yourself in some ways.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.040
You don't feel.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.880
Not on the Atlas experiment.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.240
I'm there with 3,000 of my best friends.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.280
And I've made commitments.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.680
I need to wake up at the 4 o'clock meeting time, which I

46:00.680 --> 46:03.400
also have to do because I'm giving a presentation.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.200
Or I'm going to be listening to somebody else's presentation.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.840
So I don't feel alone in it.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.120
I mean, there are times when you're

46:11.120 --> 46:13.080
doing your own calibrating of the springs.

46:13.080 --> 46:17.680
Like I said, the piece of it that is the drudgery piece of it

46:17.680 --> 46:20.080
may be where you can feel very alone.

46:20.080 --> 46:24.920
But no, there are thousands of us who have to work together.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.640
It would be nice to be more alone sometimes in it

46:27.640 --> 46:30.960
and have more control over the decisions.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.520
What are you doing here to topics, though?

46:33.520 --> 46:35.840
And that isn't interesting to me.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.560
That's what I'm curious about.

46:37.560 --> 46:39.520
And then I'm going to ask you why you left physics, OK?

46:42.480 --> 46:44.840
They're long stories, and I'll try to do them very quickly.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.200
Alice James was sort of a fluke.

46:47.200 --> 46:51.360
I was, when I was in college as an English major,

46:51.360 --> 46:54.120
you weren't allowed to think about the life of a writer.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.440
It was just the text.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.000
And then I got out of college and started

46:57.000 --> 46:57.840
reading biographies.

46:57.840 --> 47:00.920
And I thought that was pretty fascinating and great ways

47:00.920 --> 47:02.520
to learn about history and literature.

47:02.520 --> 47:06.880
And I was looking for a subject and Nancy Milford's book

47:06.880 --> 47:09.040
on Zelda Fitzgerald had come out.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.080
And it just seemed like the wives and the daughters

47:11.080 --> 47:14.240
and the sisters of famous men were kind of a good avenue.

47:14.240 --> 47:17.200
I was quite young, so I wasn't going to tackle anything

47:17.200 --> 47:18.760
I thought, very big.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.560
And I came across a reference to Alice James.

47:21.560 --> 47:24.160
I loved Henry James and William as well,

47:24.160 --> 47:25.880
but mainly Henry in college.

47:25.880 --> 47:30.520
And the reference was from a book about Gerald and Sarah

47:30.520 --> 47:33.040
Murphy, who were friends of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald,

47:33.040 --> 47:35.840
who'd come back from Paris to Cambridge, Massachusetts,

47:35.840 --> 47:38.600
and stopped in on Alice James and her circle.

47:38.600 --> 47:40.640
And I thought, oh, she had a circle.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.880
Maybe she was interesting.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.080
So I quit my job.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.520
I got a tiny advance.

47:44.520 --> 47:45.920
I applied for fellowships.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.880
And then eventually I went back and read that first reference

47:49.880 --> 47:53.680
again, and it took place in 1923, by which time my Alice

47:53.680 --> 47:55.720
had been dead for 30 years.

47:55.720 --> 47:59.440
It was William's wife, who was also named Alice, who

47:59.440 --> 48:01.280
had a circle in Cambridge.

48:01.280 --> 48:08.080
So it was like that she found me, but not quite on purpose.

48:08.080 --> 48:08.760
And then I did.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.120
A productive failure.

48:10.120 --> 48:12.640
Yes, exactly.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.520
And then it took me five years to write that book.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.600
And then I was a book critic at Newsy for about four years.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.320
And I was looking for another subject.

48:19.320 --> 48:22.200
And I really didn't want to do the same kind of story.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.600
People kept coming to me with the daughters and the wives

48:24.600 --> 48:26.160
and the sisters of famous men.

48:26.160 --> 48:28.440
And I didn't want to do a literary story.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.840
I wanted to do a bad guy, actually.

48:30.840 --> 48:35.640
That sort of witch-cassity in the Sundance kid, really seriously.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.840
And a friend at dinner one night said, Robert Barons.

48:37.840 --> 48:40.040
And I thought, oh, that sounds good.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.840
It wasn't really my period of the late 19th century.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.480
I started to read about them.

48:44.480 --> 48:45.880
Morgan seemed the most interesting,

48:45.880 --> 48:47.480
but that he'd been written about so much

48:47.480 --> 48:48.920
I'd have to find someone else.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.240
And my editor pushed me back towards Morgan

48:51.240 --> 48:54.840
and eventually did step off that clip.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.640
I found that the Morgan Library in New York

48:56.640 --> 49:01.240
had a vault of uncatalogged letters, diaries, papers, art history,

49:01.240 --> 49:03.920
art dealers, records, business records.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.680
And I thought, you know, this amazing, big part

49:06.680 --> 49:08.760
of the 19th century in America.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.720
And it hasn't.

49:09.720 --> 49:11.560
He hadn't been done in any depth.

49:11.560 --> 49:13.480
He was such a political figure.

49:13.480 --> 49:17.040
The left crucified him as a terrible robber.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.000
Robert Barons, the right, sanctified him

49:19.000 --> 49:20.160
as a hero of industrial capital.

49:20.160 --> 49:24.720
So I thought, I'll find these in this real documentation

49:24.720 --> 49:25.800
and tell the story.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.720
But I went in with every left liberal female intellectual

49:28.720 --> 49:30.320
preconception you could have.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.960
And it took me a long time to let go of all of that

49:32.960 --> 49:35.960
and to sort of see him whole.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.240
And he didn't find a formula to become rich.

49:38.240 --> 49:38.920
I did not.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.120
All my friends want that.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.360
I want me to know one minute.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.360
But I ended up not thinking he was a robber baron.

49:44.360 --> 49:45.960
Even though that's what I went looking for.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.960
OK.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.160
That was a long answer.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.960
So why did you do physics?

49:50.960 --> 49:51.960
Why did I need physics?

49:56.360 --> 50:00.920
I think it's interesting to reconstruct that time, which

50:00.920 --> 50:04.160
is I really hadn't been thinking about it for a long time.

50:04.160 --> 50:07.080
And I really, you know, it was like 30 years ago.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.840
And I was really in the film world.

50:08.840 --> 50:11.720
And this whole project didn't resuscitate

50:11.720 --> 50:13.920
a lot of these feelings.

50:13.920 --> 50:17.080
One of the fact was it was a bad time for particle theory.

50:17.080 --> 50:18.680
I mean, I was a particle theorist.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.000
It was not a good time.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.960
It was not clear.

50:21.960 --> 50:25.240
They were sort of lost in a lot of details.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.600
There was not a clear accelerator

50:27.600 --> 50:31.440
that was going to provide answers.

50:31.440 --> 50:35.120
Very specifically, I was working in a direction

50:35.120 --> 50:38.480
with somebody that was a little utray.

50:38.480 --> 50:43.240
And it was not the accepted sort of field theory

50:43.240 --> 50:44.480
approach that people were using.

50:44.480 --> 50:46.280
So there weren't a lot of places to go.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.440
I knew I'd have to do a postdoc and several other

50:48.440 --> 50:49.600
places.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.720
So the prospects were not great there.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.080
But I would say more than that, it

50:55.080 --> 50:58.800
was that I discovered something else that was a passion,

50:58.800 --> 51:00.480
that was I was interested in.

51:00.480 --> 51:04.200
And I discovered a film as something

51:04.200 --> 51:07.880
that suddenly I had liked as a kid.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.560
But it was just entertainment.

51:09.560 --> 51:12.720
And I never conceived that people made films.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.240
They just somehow appeared.

51:15.240 --> 51:19.160
And I discovered in particular Eastern European films.

51:19.160 --> 51:22.280
And I suddenly saw something that to me

51:22.280 --> 51:26.840
was a challenging, worthwhile thing to do.

51:26.840 --> 51:29.320
I think I did feel like I wanted

51:29.320 --> 51:31.120
to be doing something that was challenging,

51:31.120 --> 51:33.720
that was interesting, that would give me

51:33.720 --> 51:35.480
a sense of accomplishment.

51:35.480 --> 51:39.560
I mean, I was at some level just attracted to things

51:39.560 --> 51:42.680
that were a challenge, and that I could see films that were

51:42.680 --> 51:45.720
done that really made me think.

51:45.720 --> 51:48.840
I thought that would be interesting too.

51:48.840 --> 51:52.280
And I liked the idea of it being a broader palette.

51:52.280 --> 51:55.720
I met my wife, who was not a scientist.

51:55.720 --> 52:00.960
And I felt my life was very compartmentalized.

52:00.960 --> 52:05.560
And I think it was just that I sort of discovered the arts

52:05.560 --> 52:10.200
and decided, oh, I should explore that a little bit.

52:10.200 --> 52:14.440
And ended up just going and going and going.

52:14.440 --> 52:19.600
And we really didn't do documentaries,

52:19.600 --> 52:21.640
and didn't do anything related to science.

52:21.640 --> 52:26.720
I guess I really wanted to explore the human condition.

52:26.720 --> 52:30.240
I moved from this sort of physical world to the world.

52:30.240 --> 52:33.360
And I always thought that I wanted

52:33.360 --> 52:36.600
to do something that still would explore the science world.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.880
Because as I say, it's not that I became disenchanted

52:38.880 --> 52:39.880
within it.

52:39.880 --> 52:46.000
I still had that feeling of wonder, of what that was,

52:46.000 --> 52:47.320
I mean, what these scientists did.

52:47.320 --> 52:51.840
But I thought I would go back and somehow deal with that

52:51.840 --> 52:53.600
in a fictional world.

52:53.600 --> 52:57.720
And then a particle favor came up.

52:57.720 --> 53:01.560
Is that what drew you to dance as well?

53:01.560 --> 53:05.520
This rediscovery of wonder?

53:05.520 --> 53:06.680
That's an interesting question.

53:06.680 --> 53:13.240
So I think that I kept working in my collaboration with Emily.

53:13.240 --> 53:15.360
So we teach this class together, which

53:15.360 --> 53:18.360
was part of my job, which I love.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.560
I think it's a fantastic one.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.480
I think I was chosen that to be your job, no?

53:22.480 --> 53:24.480
Well, no, I had to teach something.

53:24.480 --> 53:29.480
And yeah, I guess, right, it's part of the Yale curriculum

53:29.480 --> 53:29.800
now.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.680
So somebody was going to teach a class.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.800
I was teaching physics classes.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.160
I could have just been teaching physics classes.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.280
How can you say that?

53:36.280 --> 53:37.320
I can't do that.

53:37.320 --> 53:37.880
Right.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.120
This is a physics class.

53:39.120 --> 53:44.520
I think that I am not a dancer myself.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.920
And I took ballet for a couple of years when I was 12 and 13.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.920
I really loved it.

53:49.920 --> 53:54.280
We do the dance class and physics class in a dance studio.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.160
And I have to say that about 80% of the time,

53:57.160 --> 53:59.240
I'm very deeply uncomfortable.

53:59.240 --> 54:02.440
Because there's a lot of movement that's in the class.

54:02.440 --> 54:07.240
And I'm also challenged constantly by my collaborator,

54:07.240 --> 54:12.520
Emily Coates, who feels that cultural forces and cultural

54:12.520 --> 54:16.960
pressures have a big impact on our scientific laws

54:16.960 --> 54:19.640
and the state of our knowing knowledge and science

54:19.640 --> 54:22.880
right now, which I've always been pushing back on.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.960
I'm not enlightened in some ways.

54:24.960 --> 54:28.360
I didn't take the studies when I was going through college.

54:28.360 --> 54:33.520
So I think it's a very productive level of being

54:33.520 --> 54:36.920
pushed, uncomfortable in every dimension.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.680
And there are times when that's not a good thing.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.560
But I think intellectually for me,

54:42.560 --> 54:45.640
if I have the opportunity to be pushed and to be uncomfortable,

54:45.640 --> 54:47.600
I try to go with it.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.920
That's because of your curios.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.920
Maybe because I'm curious.

54:50.920 --> 54:54.720
And not worried about failure on some level.

54:54.720 --> 55:01.040
Yeah, but it maintains its uncomfortableness.

55:01.040 --> 55:03.080
Do you mean you didn't take the cultural studies,

55:03.080 --> 55:06.360
sort of everything's determined by your society?

55:06.360 --> 55:10.800
So that perspective, so I started out

55:10.800 --> 55:14.800
as very much a humanities person through high school.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.200
I was going to go to law school.

55:16.200 --> 55:18.560
And I wanted to be a constitutional lawyer,

55:18.560 --> 55:21.640
a public defender, something that was at the framework

55:21.640 --> 55:23.440
of our society in this country.

55:23.440 --> 55:25.560
I thought that that's going to be what I do.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.040
And then I started taking physics.

55:27.040 --> 55:30.520
And I realized that my whole picture that I've built up

55:30.520 --> 55:33.560
of the world was completely wrong, totally wrong.

55:33.560 --> 55:37.160
How could I be so absolutely wrong about the laws of nature?

55:37.160 --> 55:39.360
Nothing worked the way I thought that it did.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.920
And it took a long time to swing my brain around

55:42.920 --> 55:46.160
and try to think, and even in terms that would let me access

55:46.160 --> 55:47.440
the world in that way.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.880
And it was just addictive, that challenge.

55:49.880 --> 55:51.600
I think it was so difficult.

55:51.600 --> 55:55.320
So then I became a scientist and a real scientist

55:55.320 --> 55:56.880
in looking for objectivity.

55:56.880 --> 55:59.760
And it's the steps and this process.

55:59.760 --> 56:03.480
And then I think, of course, I wasn't in a total vacuum.

56:03.480 --> 56:07.280
But then to have somebody very seriously in my professional life

56:07.280 --> 56:09.960
say, well, maybe take a different angle on this,

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
readjust this.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.200
Maybe you're missing a part of the process.

56:13.200 --> 56:15.360
Maybe you're not taking these things into account

56:15.360 --> 56:16.600
with your process.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.600
I think that was another revolutionary moment for me

56:20.600 --> 56:22.120
that probably all of you in this room

56:22.120 --> 56:24.240
have had that maybe the process of science

56:24.240 --> 56:26.920
is influenced by society and who's

56:26.920 --> 56:28.520
been allowed to participate in science,

56:28.520 --> 56:31.720
that that was a revolutionary moment for me to realize.

56:31.720 --> 56:35.440
And so there are many reasons why I continue that conversation.

56:35.440 --> 56:41.200
Maybe there is a difference between the work

56:41.200 --> 56:46.720
that the creative imagination of a writer functions, the way

56:46.720 --> 56:50.880
that it functions, and the way of the imagination

56:50.880 --> 56:52.120
of a scientist functions.

56:52.120 --> 56:55.000
Because I got the impression from the film

56:55.000 --> 56:58.680
and from some scientists that I know

56:58.680 --> 57:01.640
that it is very much a collaborative effort,

57:01.640 --> 57:06.760
but not as much as that teamwork, but simply

57:06.760 --> 57:12.840
that a theory is constructed by many minds at the same time

57:12.840 --> 57:17.560
that you don't just come up with a model of the universe

57:17.560 --> 57:21.960
and put it out there that you imagine maybe this, maybe that,

57:21.960 --> 57:24.720
and you can build it.

57:24.720 --> 57:29.800
A novel instead, unless it's written by several people,

57:29.800 --> 57:33.680
is constructed from the first to the last chapter.

57:33.680 --> 57:37.280
And then you come and you want to publish it

57:37.280 --> 57:40.760
in some medley editor pulls it apart,

57:40.760 --> 57:43.680
but that's another story.

57:43.680 --> 57:46.240
So I think that it's different.

57:46.240 --> 57:51.480
I mean, I wouldn't, I think, be able to construct a book

57:51.480 --> 57:53.400
as a collaboration.

57:53.400 --> 57:56.400
I think that the parallel might be,

57:56.400 --> 57:58.560
in terms of what I've learned about science,

57:58.560 --> 58:02.120
that the idea of the history of an idea

58:02.120 --> 58:04.160
is very difficult to trace.

58:04.160 --> 58:05.920
How did you construct that chapter?

58:05.920 --> 58:08.760
What, from your experience or from your conversation

58:08.760 --> 58:11.440
with someone, was actually pulling into that.

58:11.440 --> 58:14.800
And I think the same is true about scientific ideas.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.400
We do have people, and I'm not one of them,

58:17.400 --> 58:19.800
that the theorists, I'm an experimentalist,

58:19.800 --> 58:23.600
but we do have the theorists like Mima, like David,

58:23.600 --> 58:27.840
people who are pushing in those directions.

58:27.840 --> 58:31.800
And we tend to think of those people as making big leaps,

58:31.800 --> 58:35.160
but the reality is, and they are making big leaps,

58:35.160 --> 58:37.360
but they're also informed by the conversations

58:37.360 --> 58:39.720
that they're having and the collaborations that they're having.

58:39.720 --> 58:45.040
So I think that, for instance, when Hicks was mentioned,

58:45.040 --> 58:48.000
immediately, a number of other names

58:48.000 --> 58:51.840
appeared that said these other people

58:51.840 --> 58:56.760
were looking at the same problem.

58:56.760 --> 58:58.840
Not in communication with each other very much

58:58.840 --> 58:59.680
at that point.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.920
Well, there were three groups, really.

59:01.920 --> 59:06.120
And so there were a couple that were working together.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.200
And Hicks was sort of on his own.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.000
But then there were others that were working together.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.080
But it was an idea that was burbling up.

59:13.080 --> 59:16.920
And it was, I mean, this idea of the single genius theory

59:16.920 --> 59:22.800
is something that I think a lot of people dispute.

59:22.800 --> 59:27.880
I mean, how many really nobody operates in a vacuum?

59:27.880 --> 59:29.640
There have been a couple of big leaps,

59:29.640 --> 59:33.240
and people always bring up Einstein for a couple of things.

59:33.240 --> 59:37.960
But even he, for some of his things in special relativity,

59:37.960 --> 59:40.400
he was working with other ideas as well.

59:40.400 --> 59:42.120
I mean, he did make big leaps.

59:42.120 --> 59:47.400
But I think in particular, the whole idea of the Higgs

59:47.400 --> 59:52.000
that we say now, as I said in the Q&A afterwards,

59:52.000 --> 59:57.120
Higgs was working on a purely mathematical problem, really.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.960
And in fact, the story is that in his initial presentation

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.120
of the paper, he didn't even write

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.640
that there was a particle associated.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:09.000
It's supposedly the reviewer said you might want to mention

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.440
that there's an associated particle.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:15.440
And it still wasn't incorporated into the standard model.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.840
That was still done by others by Glass, Schow, and Weinberg,

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.920
who then realized that this actually

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.600
had a place that it could be the explanation for how

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:31.400
the echometh bosons got mass.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.320
And so it was definitely an incremental thing.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.960
I think, and I think there is a difference

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.840
with the theorists in experimentalists.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.320
But I think the interesting thing is that theorists are

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.760
the ones that you really do have more this idea that it's

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.720
like the single genius coming up with something.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.040
And what you see is it's very collaborative.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.360
There's a lot of talking.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.280
Eventually, they have to go and sit down.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.160
I mean, and I've talked to Sava and Nina

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.280
about this both quite a bit.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:00.520
And they both say the collaboration, it's very important.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.920
But eventually, they have to go and I have to sit down

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.640
and just think and try to make that step.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.480
It's all the physicists that you were in contact with.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.200
And you saw, and I guess you said a good bunch of them

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.000
are not even in the movie.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.200
Did some of them impress you as being more genius, passionate,

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.320
have this push?

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.280
Or did they all seem of the same intensity?

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.600
No, there's different.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.000
I mean, you know, I mean, Nima's obviously incredibly

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.360
intense, and Sava's is more relaxed.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.040
But I don't think that there's a difference in their passion

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.960
and their intensity.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:45.600
I mean, Nima very much was also influenced by Sava's.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.640
He considers, in fact, the interesting thing

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.000
is he says that he, Sava's is the person who gave him

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.160
the courage to start to go off in different directions.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.920
And interestingly, the multiverse initially, you know,

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.680
physicists hated the multiverse initially.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.560
All physicists pretty much.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.280
And Sava's actually was one of the first to say,

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.200
maybe we should think about it.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:17.120
And I think he was doing a visiting term at Harvard

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.760
where Nima was.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.960
And he said, you know, maybe we should look at this multiverse.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.480
And Nima says, I said, are you nuts?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.000
This is a total waste of time.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.240
Why would I ever think about the multiverse?

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.480
And Sava said, yeah, you might want to look at this.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.560
And eventually, Nima came around.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.880
So I don't think outwardly, you know,

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.520
it's maybe a reflection inwardly.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:43.120
I think both of them are, you know, extremely passionate.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.360
There are different points in their lives though, you know?

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.520
And this is something that, you know,

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.760
it also gets to your, you know, when you said, well,

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.480
Nima's were lamenting 15 years.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.800
Sava's is 30 years is the issue of mortality.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.800
And, you know, for scientists, I mean,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.640
it's for both scientists, for all creative people.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:04.080
I think science, it's even harder somewhat

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.200
in terms of especially for theorists.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.200
And Nima said that he had the young genius theory initially.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.960
He said, you know, and his idea was he would, you know,

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.280
they would discover the Higgs.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.560
He'd do all these things.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.240
And by 30, he would have that done and he'd move on, you know?

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.640
And of course, you know.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.200
Yeah, now he's not.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.360
And he, you know, I asked him near the end.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.440
So what do you think about this now?

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.480
And he sort of laughed and he said, yeah, it's interesting.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.160
I'm sort of revising my ideas now.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.640
He says, I think, and he said, you know, and he laughed.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.200
You know, he realized that this was a little bit self-serving.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.520
But he said, no, he says what he thinks is that,

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.200
he said the problem is that when people get older,

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.920
they become bourgeois was his term.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.560
And what he meant was that, you know, they get married,

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.000
they have kids, they have other things in their life.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.040
And that what he thought was the critical thing was not youth,

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.080
but the lack of distraction and the ability

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.160
to absolutely, you know, be a jerk if you needed be

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.240
to focus on what you were doing.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.280
That's why Sherlock Holmes doesn't get married.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.640
That's why Sherlock Holmes doesn't get married.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.480
So that was what he was thinking with the solution.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.920
And I think that issue of mortality is an interesting point.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.160
And I think, you know, look, honestly,

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.960
I think Neema does really, you know,

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.520
Neema's in an interesting position.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.000
I mean, he is, you know, he was regarded as the, you know,

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.320
hot genius.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.960
And, but nothing that he has done has actually been proven.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.400
I mean, it's so he's recognized for what he's done

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.160
and the brilliance and his passion and his insight.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.480
But we don't know if anything is right, you know.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.080
Solace has actually had more things done, but, you know,

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.440
nothing completely proven either.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.080
And, you know, I think they're very interesting

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.000
to look at the two of them right now.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.520
But this idea of proof is very interesting

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.840
because I'm obviously not a scientist.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.360
But I understood that, for instance, Euclid was proven.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.600
And then, certainly, you had the non-Euclidean geometries

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.160
and, suddenly, two parallel lines did meet.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.000
And so, does that happen constantly?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I mean, I think what happens, so my view of this is we have

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.920
the theory that works in a certain regime.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.000
Maybe it works only at low energy.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It works at slow speeds.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.480
It works at large distance scales.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.880
And then, when we get the ability to move

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.360
beyond those limitations, we realize, aha,

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.560
that actually Newton's laws are a nice example, right?

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.400
The macroscopic world around us.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.320
Force equals mass times acceleration.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.240
I push on something with a certain force.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.520
I'm going to get a certain acceleration for a given mass.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.640
And then, you're confronted with a speed limit to the universe,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.080
the speed of light.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.640
So there's a problem there.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.520
I must not be able to get a certain acceleration

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.320
for a given mass with a given force

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.840
when you get past that point.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.000
But it doesn't mean that Newton's laws were invalid

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.160
or are invalid in a context.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.200
So I think that's what most often happens,

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.880
is that we realize that there is context

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.000
beyond our initial understanding.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.840
Or things that we didn't think matter do.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.640
You think that's the only matter.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.400
And it's about universes beyond our universe.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.480
What can we do?

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.000
Yes.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:30.480
Yes.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.200
It's also interesting when you're talking about mortality

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.440
as playing a role.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.200
And it's almost in some ways it's reflected

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.320
by the attachments that one makes to this world.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:52.360
And quest literature is so focused on the Urquest

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.120
Gilgamesh, the very question of mortality

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.760
is at the center.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.960
And so much of quest literature is

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:04.000
about a going away and ultimately returning.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.480
Right?

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:04.880
Yes, yes.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.600
Yes, yes.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.600
I mean, the Wizard of Oz.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.280
The Last Lines in the Wizard of Oz is, you know,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.280
Aunt Emma, there's no place like home.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.560
But it's almost it.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.120
Because the Wizard is a failure.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.480
But there's almost a suspension of mortality

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.640
in the journey that's taken.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.960
But there's always the return.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:27.080
And I wonder about that as a feature

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.600
that when one is pursuing the quest,

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.680
one has to set aside that aspect of experience.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.120
I have a question.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:36.560
Oh, sorry.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.920
Did you want to answer that?

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.360
No.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.280
To go to art for a second.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.320
Because you've written novels as well as nonfiction.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.880
And I would, I mean, in working on nonfiction,

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.840
there is a sense that you have evidence

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.080
that you're trying things out all the time,

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.320
that you're finding what seems true in quotes or something.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.520
But what seems accurate.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.120
And I would imagine there's a process like that for fiction.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.480
Oh, I've got that.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.920
What feels absolutely right to you.

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.640
Would you talk a little bit about that?

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:11.520
Well, in both cases, you have to construct a theory

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.480
of the universe, a model, whether it's

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.600
based on the fact that Morgan ate porridge for breakfast

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.360
or wore brown shoes.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.560
Or your invented character did these things.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.920
And what you find out, as you were saying in the film,

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.240
is that as soon as you establish one fact,

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.720
a multitude of facts follows that if it's brown shoes

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.680
and not black, then there are consequences for this

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.960
in every direction.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.360
I find it much more difficult to write fiction

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:53.880
than nonfiction.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.920
Because in nonfiction, so much of the work has been done.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.360
And you don't need to have the memory

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.920
that you have to have for fiction.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.400
When was he born?

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.920
And how many children did he have?

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.600
And you have to jot these things down

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.400
and invent these archives.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.360
But yes, essentially, they're the same process.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:22.080
Yes, and I mean, just from my novelist's friends,

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.480
there's a sense of true north in some way.

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:28.680
When you have it, you know you have it.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:31.560
And when you don't have it, you know you don't have it.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.080
That's right.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.480
But it's not until you finish the book.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.000
I know, right.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.080
But you know, it's actually interesting.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.560
Because right now, I am working on a script.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.000
So it's a fiction script.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.320
And it feels exactly like it did what

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.200
I was in the edit room at the end of particle favor.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.720
And I think the process is very similar.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.400
And with film, the interesting thing with film

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.120
is you go through these different phases.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.400
And the script stage is like theory.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.160
You're coming up with a theory of the world, basically.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.080
And then you go to experiment, which

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.120
is like going into film production.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.560
And suddenly, you need lots of money and equipment

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.520
and lots of people.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.120
And it's completely crazy.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.800
And you're just getting data.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.040
And especially in film, but I think in physics,

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.240
too, to a certain extent, you just

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.520
like hope that it's working and making sense.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.160
And then you come back to the edit room,

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.040
which is like going back to the theorists.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.120
And it's like, OK, here's the data.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.880
This is what the real world is like.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.320
And you revise your theories.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.600
Or you revise your, you know, the script is now lost.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.280
And you have the film that you have.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.400
And so, you know, the long period in the edit room

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.560
was taking all this data.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.480
And what is our story?

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.560
And what is, but we were approaching it.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.080
It was like writing fiction.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.040
And that's what people always say.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.120
Anyways, documentaries, it's the editing.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.480
We're writing.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.920
And now I'm working on a script that's a fiction script.

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.760
But it's the same process for me.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.040
I have, I mean, even using some of my organizational software,

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.280
you know, that I was using in the edit room,

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.840
keeping track now of people and stories.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.160
And there is a life to it.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.520
But it's, for me, it's a very similar process.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.880
There's a trying to imagine various outcomes

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.440
and what are the ones that work and what

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.840
is the thing that is consistent and the characters

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.280
have become their own people.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.760
And oh, you start talking like, oh, this person wouldn't do this.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.840
You know, exactly.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.320
And it's so completely parallel.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.360
I mean, I'm just, it's the same.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.480
You offered of the questions useful, I think,

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.080
for these creative processes.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:50.880
Because all the stage of accumulating material

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.400
and then putting it together is that quest.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.520
But it's only on that return journey

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.720
that you realize what you have, whether it's

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.720
a golden fleece or empty hands.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.240
OK.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.400
People want to line up with the microphone

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.600
and please identify yourself and keep your comments

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.600
in the form of a question.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.360
Hi, my name is Olga Oste.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:32.120
I'm on the things.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.120
OK.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.120
Fused.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:45.120
I probably, probably the difference

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:50.640
between scientist and artist, scientist,

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.120
the science experiment has to be probable and has to be

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.000
repeatable.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.440
And artists usually tries to do something

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.600
absolutely original and nobody can repeat it.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:11.680
And also, I bet I said that probably few fools

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.560
consider that King Lear is actually bad play.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:23.200
I'm not sure about fools, but Leo, Tal's story, famous writer.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.800
Yes, he did not like Shakespeare.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.720
He considered him primitive.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.680
And you know that he wrote this, and won peace, and anacrine.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.120
So probably I don't know if he was fool,

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:43.760
but he was absolutely, of course, very arrogant person.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.960
But still he was like, oh, no, nobody would pay.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.480
OK.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.520
And my question is to Sara, actually.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.920
After you finished your film, I read

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:06.640
that actually exact number, exact mass of Higgs Boson

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:13.320
is 126 plus minus 0.4.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:20.760
And there are actually theories that didn't

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.520
connect to supersymmetry or multivorts that predicted

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:31.040
exactly these number.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:37.480
But still, my question is, should I get a question?

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.920
What do you think is ideal of multivorts more

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.160
dead or more alive after all these discoveries?

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.880
OK, so that's a great question.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.280
So the mass of the Higgs within the standard model

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.840
was actually a predicted number.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.360
Based on all the other information

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.960
that we had, the mass of the top quirk, the mass of the W,

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.360
all the measurements that we had and our understanding

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:05.280
of how this theory fits together.

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:08.200
If you have a Higgs Boson within the standard model

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.840
that functions as evidence for the Higgs field, which

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.320
gives us mass, it should be a certain number.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.880
We had a prediction.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.360
And we didn't find the Higgs at exactly that prediction

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.120
before the LHC started.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.080
But the idea is, if it's a standard model Higgs Boson,

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.600
it's got to be close to that.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.560
It has to be around 118.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.240
A number that's not that far from where we'd actually

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.520
explored.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.840
So the further up away from that prediction

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.600
within the standard model, the more exciting it is

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.320
from the perspective of maybe there's

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.040
something else that we have access to through this particle

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.600
beyond the standard model.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.880
So that was kind of the excitement there.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.440
If it isn't really far away from the prediction of 118,

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.200
so that it must be something else.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.080
So there's that thing that's happening.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:59.520
How close is this to what we expect from the standard model?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.120
And you could argue about 125.

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.720
It turns out to be close enough to the prediction

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.920
that it's perfectly consistent with the standard model.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.560
So there you have that.

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.200
And then you look at other ideas.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.360
Well, maybe we don't say definitely not standard model.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.960
But even within that close enough to be standard model,

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.880
it could actually be something else.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.520
It could be supersymmetry.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.920
It could be the multiverse.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.760
It could be this.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.160
And you look at all of these different spaces

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.680
in terms of these different theories

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.480
and try to understand what do they

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.600
predict for this particle's mass.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.960
What do we learn from that?

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.600
And I think the issue with the Higgs at this mass

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.640
is that it makes some of our favorite theories

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.240
a little bit uncomfortable.

01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:46.260
For supersymmetry, I would say a mass of that Higgs boson

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:49.560
means that some of the best motivation for supersymmetry,

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.760
you lose at that mass.

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.240
So supersymmetry could definitely be reality.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.920
But it wouldn't solve all of the problems

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.240
that we hope that supersymmetry would come along and solve.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.160
In terms of the multiverse, I don't

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.000
think it gives us information in that it doesn't rule it out

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.680
as a possible idea.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.040
I'm sorry, I'm not adding any content beyond the film.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.960
I think it captures pretty well where things stand.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.600
The funny thing about the Higgs, or one of the funny things

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.520
about the Higgs is that so many of us

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.720
were hoping that it wouldn't be there.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.360
What it does, and I used to say that,

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.600
I hope we don't find the Higgs.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.040
And now having been even some small part of the discovery,

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.160
I think it's an absurd thing to say, because it was thrilling.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.720
It's amazing that that prediction actually was true.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.120
But the Higgs boson ties up the standard model

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.000
really neatly in some ways and doesn't get us beyond.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.160
And we know that there's so many things

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.000
about the universe that we don't understand.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.120
It would have been wonderful if the answer

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.560
to the generation of mass actually

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.720
took us in some step further beyond the standard model.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.200
But I think right now it's inconclusive.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.560
It's consistent with the standard model Higgs.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.760
It doesn't rule out supersymmetry,

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.040
though it's making it a little bit less attractive.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.800
And it leaves us with the idea of the multiverse hanging.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.880
And every theorist out there, including probably David Kaplan,

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.240
who said, oh, all of my theories are ruled out,

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.520
went back and thought about how do I adjust that

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.880
so that it actually still works?

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.600
I'm sorry, I don't have a better answer.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:26.120
It's very inconclusive.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.320
I really don't understand this topic too much.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.560
I'm definitely going to research it now that I've seen this movie.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.200
But my understanding is that the Higgs boson

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:40.960
generates the Higgs field, which gives particles mass.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.280
Is that correct?

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.080
So if you're on a lake in a boat,

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.480
think of the lake as the Higgs fields.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.560
If I add energy to the lake, if I splash the lake,

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.920
and this is not my analogy, I should say, my killedrith,

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:58.600
thank you wherever you are, if I splash the lake,

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.760
that's an excitation, I've added energy to the lake,

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.400
there's a wave that goes out.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.520
The wave is the Higgs boson.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.960
The evidence for the Higgs fields existing

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.400
is the fact that when you add energy to it,

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.360
you actually have a particle that's created.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.160
So the Higgs boson tells us that there's this field

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:17.600
everywhere in the universe.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.560
And it's the Higgs field everywhere in the universe

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:24.640
that gives us a way to have mass for particles.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.080
OK, that.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:29.000
And so the other thing I wanted to ask

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:34.560
was, would it be possible to explain to layman

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.480
the more of the mechanism in terms of which the Higgs field

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.160
makes particles have mass?

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.360
Look at the little film that she did.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.160
Right, so we did.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.960
Yeah, I think so.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.000
Here's how I think about it.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.920
You have to first understand what the definition of mass

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.640
is, because how do we think of mass?

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.080
We think of mass as the more mass I have that's

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.720
kind of like the more stuff, right?

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.640
So if we're going to think about mass

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.920
from a perspective of the Higgs boson and particles,

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.960
let's shift our thinking a little bit.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.000
OK?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.880
A massless particle.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.120
So a particle out there with no mass, like the photon.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.080
So the photons coming to my eyes.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.640
They're light particles.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.960
Now I can't see you anymore.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.880
A massless particle travels at the speed of light.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.200
It has no choice.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
A particle that has no mass, fundamental particle,

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.520
travels at the speed of light.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.840
OK?

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:33.760
Particles that do have mass can't travel at the speed of light.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.840
They can't get up there.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.160
As much force as you put on them, they can't get up there.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.120
So the question of mass is slowing things down.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.800
How is it that we slow things down?

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.240
What is the mechanism that means that some things

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.880
can't move at the speed of light,

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.720
that all the massless particles move at?

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.440
It's kind of similar to the idea of mass as stuff, right?

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.640
The more mass you have, the harder you are to get going.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.400
Maybe you'd say, I don't know if it works perfectly.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.600
So the idea of the Higgs field being the mechanism for that

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.120
is that this Higgs field, some particles

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.680
it can't slow down at all.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.640
It doesn't have any interactions with them.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.120
OK?

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.480
Those are the massless particles.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.880
So the photon travels through the Higgs field.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.080
The field is there.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.320
But it doesn't have any interaction with it.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:19.400
Other particles that do have mass, they see the field.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.640
They're slowed down by it.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.960
It's like they're traveling through molasses.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.360
And the more they see the field, the more they interact

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.720
with the field, the more slowed down they are,

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.000
the more massive they are.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.520
So I would say that's the mechanism for how it works.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.520
I think you leave many of us wishing you'd been our first

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:33.520
picture.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.020
Yes.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.520
And I'm just thinking.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.680
Yes, we are.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.720
There you go.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:39.520
Can we only end telling the truth?

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.440
We're all great, great, great, great, great, great.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.960
Hey, I had a question for Mark.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.560
And you were talking about how the creative process

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.520
for creating, I think, films, parallels

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.760
the process of, I guess, progress in theoretical physics.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.280
And I was wondering about, in terms of your background,

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.280
have you found that your background informs

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:06.440
your artistic sensibilities in different ways

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.320
than the people that you're sort of working with?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.240
Like, do you find, not just in terms

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.440
of domain-specific knowledge that was probably useful

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:16.760
for particle fever, but more nebulously in the process,

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.600
do you find that you see things differently or think

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.400
about things differently, I guess?

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.360
I don't think in an obvious way.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.080
But I mean, I certainly can't deny my background.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.040
I think there are certain ways that I think.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.440
But I think there's a certain logic

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.640
that I apply to things.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:40.200
I don't feel I look at things as a scientist.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:45.600
People always say that, oh, I don't know what that means.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.520
It's the way I think.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:52.640
As I say, I feel the process of writing and writing

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:56.280
something fiction is exactly the same as when I'm sitting

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.600
in an editor room.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:02.600
And I assume I'm using certain processes of logic

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:07.320
that are also what I used when I was doing theoretical physics.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.960
And so I will make that comparison.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.080
When I was in graduate school, when

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.440
I was doing theoretical particle physics,

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.440
it was a very similar process.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.680
Somebody asked me after the Q&A, how

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.440
did I make that transition?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.480
Practically, it didn't feel all that different.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.320
Yes, I think I have a certain logical way

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.560
that I approach things.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.800
But when I was doing theoretical physics,

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:36.400
I was sitting in a room by myself with a pencil and paper,

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.600
coming up with a theory of the universe,

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.120
not getting paid very much as a grad student.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:42.720
And then I started writing a script,

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.880
and I just changed rooms.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.400
I can't help, but I was still sitting there

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.800
with a pencil and paper thinking about the way more

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.200
humans interacted.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.320
But with a certain logic that you apply to it,

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.320
and to me, it felt very similar.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.360
So I don't know.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.560
I think the creative process is the creative process.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.040
And you have certain ways.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:16.760
I mean, I do know that I can see that I approach certain things,

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.520
and there's a certain logic.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.000
But that's a fundamental thing that

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.040
doesn't have to do with science either.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:22.840
I don't think.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.880
I think that any artist is applying a certain logical process

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.760
and working out the consequences that's similar.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.760
I don't know if there's a meta-level at which the brain is

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.000
working that jumbles things together.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.520
I wouldn't know.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.000
I just think the way I think.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.960
But I think, for me, the process is extremely similar.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I have questions.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I can't see you.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
You have to go.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.440
While you're going there, I'll tell a quick Einstein joke,

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.000
OK?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.320
That supposedly a reporter came to interview him.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.680
I have no idea what this is true.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.400
I read it somewhere.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.680
It's probably not true.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.240
And said, Professor, where do you get your ideas?

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.080
And Einstein said, what do you mean?

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.360
And he said, well, do you get them

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.640
when you're taking a walk or in the bath

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.720
or playing your violin?

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:13.160
And Einstein thought for a moment and said, actually,

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.680
I've only had one or two.

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:19.400
OK.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.440
So my question, it actually sort of arose

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.160
when you were discussing Savos.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.840
And I remember from the movie, he said

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.880
that he told us anecdote of how paradise to him was frightening

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:34.840
and he started to cry.

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:38.200
And it just made me start to think about fear

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.320
and fear as how it plays in the role of a quest.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.280
Or it's role in a quest.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.400
So I guess I was just wondering how for you, for you guys,

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.800
what was your experience with fear?

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.240
Does it have a role in what you do?

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.440
Does it drive you to, as Savos would do,

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.760
go find what exists out there?

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:04.600
I mean, there is a certain fear.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.680
I mean, certainly there were points in particle fever

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.600
where I had a fear that this was not going to add up

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.120
to anything.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.560
I mean, I always thought that it would at some way.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.280
But the fear of creating something

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.920
that nobody responds to, that people don't understand.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.160
I mean, it was a long process.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.440
We tested the film at various along the way.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.880
And I mean, it's an interesting thing with a process where

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.520
you're working intensely and you think, oh, yeah, OK, I've

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.440
got it.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.920
And you show it to people and they don't get it at all.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.520
And you think, wow, OK, now I have to go back.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.480
And there's a certain fear that for me, it drives me on.

01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:55.000
I mean, I would say that.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.760
I don't, I think fear makes me work harder.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.880
It doesn't make me run.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:07.480
So I guess that's my own personal reaction so far, anyway.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.440
Yeah, well, failure is an option.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:09.920
Yes.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.800
It's a feared option.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.680
So I think that's definitely true.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.120
And with every book you write, it doesn't really matter

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.480
that you've written another book.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.120
The new one could be a disaster.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.640
I mean, it's got its own constraints and requirements.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.960
And you don't know you can do it.

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.360
So you have to compliment fear?

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.840
So it's just so fascinating to me as it's

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.360
sort of coming out with your dialogue.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.960
So fear can you thrive to you.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.480
But it's also you need to learn to be successful and quest

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.760
to sort of conquer fear at the same time.

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:49.560
For me, there is an interesting fear that happens rarely

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.320
where I think if this works out, it

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.440
changes what I wanted to do.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.360
It changes the way I was thinking about the subject.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:07.120
And that's a big fear because it forces you

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.600
to start all over again.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.960
But when it happens, you know that you're

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.480
onto something interesting.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:17.320
I think it may also be a question for me

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.240
of how deeply you are into it.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.000
So the longer the further I went, the more at stake

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:31.280
I felt about not failing and pushing and pushing and pushing.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.080
I mean, I don't know.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:39.320
At an earlier stage, there might be a wisdom

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.320
in an earlier stage sometimes of a banning.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.920
And you do that in a minor way all the time.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.040
I mean, in a minor way, you try an approach

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.800
and you have to make a quick assessment.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.040
No, that's not going to pay off.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.760
And I have to go in a different direction.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.360
But you learned from that.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.360
You learned from that.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:56.200
That's the way Sarah was saying.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.200
That's true.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.680
Actually, you know, it reminded me.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.320
I forgot it.

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.880
When you said it, a quick thing, it was Whitehead who said

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.880
that in philosophy, when you come up

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:09.040
against a contradiction, that's the end.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.000
And in science, it's the beginning.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.160
And I thought that was a very interesting point, which

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.240
relates to what you said, too.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:19.280
And to pick up your image of the quest, which I find very

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.800
interesting and useful, any quest that's

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:30.360
engaged without fear is not worth engaging.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.000
It's also a minor degree.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.560
You have a certain amount of fear.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.040
It can motivate you if it gets to be too much fear.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.960
You know, that's what I mean.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.200
One of my favorite quotes is what Einstein wrote back when

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.800
he was asked to describe his process.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:49.920
And he said, first, everything came in the form of images.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.320
And then he felt the deep emotional desire to communicate.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:58.760
And that's what led him to create formulas.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.960
I think that's so beautiful because it's an imagination,

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:05.240
emotion, and the desire for communication, which has to

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.960
be part of science.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:12.360
And so that's a little bit of a background to the question

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:15.840
which may otherwise sound a little bit out in left field.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:20.400
But I'm really struck at now how neuroscience departments are

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.880
hiring physicists, and that there's some way in which

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.240
neuroscience is bringing the psyche together, which is the

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:34.600
source of imagery and emotion with the sciences.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:40.520
So I wondered, I think Yale has started on that as well, yes?

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:43.480
So I'm not in the neuroscience department at Yale.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.320
So yeah, I can't speak for them.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:49.840
I think that I can try to answer it in some way and then see

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.360
how other people feel.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.720
I think that one of the miraculous things about Einstein

01:30:55.720 --> 01:31:00.800
and his theories was he was working with physics that we

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.800
can't directly relate to, meaning, speed of light,

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.720
special relativity in particular, speed of light,

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.920
length contraction, time dilation, these things that we

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.680
don't actually experience.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:18.600
And he set up very straightforward thought experiments.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:22.640
He put you on a train and had you turn on a flashlight.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.520
And he had two brothers or two astronauts and one of them

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.520
travel and the other one stay at home.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:33.840
He set up images in some ways, stories, places that let you

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.440
access that contradiction with something that you did

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440
understand.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.120
And I think that that is incredibly powerful.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.200
It's something we're floundering with with the Higgs,

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.240
for example, to have this be something that we all can

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.480
grapple with in ways that we can understand.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:53.920
I think that the ability that we have to imagine or to have

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.920
actual images associated with what we're trying to understand,

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.600
with the frameworks that we have, is really tied into how

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.920
much progress we can make in terms of our scientific theories.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.440
So those two things, that's the only access I have to

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.840
trying to answer your question.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.440
I don't know.

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:15.560
In the March round table, Rob read the background of the

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.000
people.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.720
So we have neuroscientists, but one of the people of that

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.440
round table on the subject of consciousness is a physicist.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.960
So there is no question.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.200
And one of the people who's been at the round tables here a

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:33.680
couple of times, Andrea California, who's a top-notch

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.600
microbiologist who is close to discovering significant

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.680
things about cancer.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.720
And he always says, he always thought he would go to

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:46.320
physics, discover something, go to microbiology, discover

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.520
cure of cancer, and then discover the cure of Alzheimer's.

01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:53.000
He's about to move to the Alzheimer's territory.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.880
And he was a physicist.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.560
So I think physics gives us tools to tackle complicated

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.320
problems and to model complicated systems.

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.200
And a lot of the, yeah, so I think there's a natural way

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.120
that the different branches in science can interact with

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.160
each other.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.080
More and more.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.760
I'd like to touch on something that Mark brought up about

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.840
the scientist as genius.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.520
And it seems like the Saren project with 3,000

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:28.080
scientists, many of the major leaps, at least in the past

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:32.160
in science like with Einstein, he was a lowly patent clerk in

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.160
Beren when he did his four major papers on the photoelectric

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.360
fact and his first theory is a relativity.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:41.920
And I was thinking about Copernicus, who was a church

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:45.320
canon when he developed his helocentric theories, even

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.040
though there had been prior helocentric theories going back

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.720
to ancient Greece.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.600
But in some cases, the mere fact that you have collaborative

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:59.160
effort, in Germany, they said that Einstein was a Jew and

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:03.000
therefore his science was Jewish science, which was less

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.120
accurate.

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.600
And they burned his books.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.120
So the mere fact of having collaboration, in some cases,

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.120
waters down science.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.040
So that's why you have, in many cases, the great leaps in

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:15.760
science, at least in the past.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.480
You also had gentleman scientists, Le Boisier and others,

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.320
who would be in their little laboratory.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.560
But they wouldn't necessarily have to listen to 20 other

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:25.160
guys.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.040
And I was thinking again about Einstein, where 20 years at

01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.600
Princeton working on his field theory, he accomplished not a

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.560
lot.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:37.560
Whereas in one year as a Beren patent clerk, he wrote four

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:40.200
earth-shattering theories.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.040
So is it better, and again, going back to this genius theory

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.160
of scientists, that isn't it better to be the little guy in

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.200
the corner that everybody says you're wrong than being

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.680
with the 3,000 people who say, this is what the consensus is.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:59.200
And just like with the Ptolemaic theory of the universe

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.960
versus the Copernican theory, if you're going to go with the

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:04.160
consensus, you're going to go with Ptolemaic.

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.000
But if you're Copernicus, you're going to say, wait a

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:06.520
second.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:10.560
I think that the sun is the center, not the earth.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.480
I would push back.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.120
Well, I think we need to get at the reason that there are

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.320
thousands of us who are gathered at CERN working on this

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.120
together.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:26.440
We are at the point where we are colliding protons at 99.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:32.840
99999999% of the speed of light.

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.720
People have described that enterprise.

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:36.200
I don't remember if this was in the film or not.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.040
But people have described the enterprises, the

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.640
cathedrals of our time.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.960
The amount of resources that you need to muster, the ideas

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:47.840
that go behind it, the building of the structure, the lone

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.320
person working in the corner is not going to make a large

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.880
Hadron Collider.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.120
This is a $7 billion machine.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:01.600
So I think that a lot of the collaboration, it's part of

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.200
what makes it so fascinating.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.160
As a species, if we're going to take the next step in this

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.760
exploration, we need to pool our resources, financial,

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.880
intellectual, passion.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.120
We need to all bring that to bear to answer some of these

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.080
questions.

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.640
Now, what we're doing at CERN is testing theories.

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.120
And coming up with ideas for sure.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:31.240
But a lot of the intellectual work that we're doing is

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:34.200
trying to figure out how with this physical experimental

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:37.800
apparatus, we can access something like supersymmetry

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.280
or the multiverse or go after some of those ideas.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.520
So there certainly is still room for people in different

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.240
pockets around the world to be thinking on their own.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:55.440
But the enterprise at CERN is justified and required and

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.760
yeah, an incredible challenge.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:02.040
And I would say, with respect to Einstein, I don't think

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.440
that most people think that if Einstein was tackling

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.080
Grand Unified Theory when he was 20, he would have solved

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.080
it.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.160
I think it's also very much a matter of the time and the

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160
problems.

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.160
And this is another thing that Sava says that I think is

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.360
really, really very trenchant at the beginning where he says,

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.920
what distinguishes a great scientist?

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:29.240
You have to know what's the right question to ask.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.040
And it has to be the right time for there to be a solution

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.600
that you can understand.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.320
And that time when Einstein was coming up with a

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.080
photollectric effect and relativity, it was the right time.

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:45.520
And he made advances.

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.760
But it was about asking the right questions as almost the

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.200
first question.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.760
I mean, the first issue.

01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:56.880
He knew the question asked and it was the right time and

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.120
there was the right things happening.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.880
It was the time to solve it.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.720
And that's what Sava says.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:04.480
Really, the time to solve it was then.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.040
And I don't know that it would have been different later.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.160
I mean, because there are many brilliant people that have

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:16.120
come since Einstein and have tackled these problems and the

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.720
time hasn't come to get it yet.

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.720
So.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720
OK.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720
Any other questions?

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720
Yes.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:29.160
Among the points of intersection art and science.

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.160
I'm a painter and was male in graduate school.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.160
Was there representation?

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.400
Well, landscape painter, which always kind of irritated me

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.040
because I always just considered a painting.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.200
So down the road, having done a lot of paintings, so you can

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.080
be painting like the energy and inherent nature, whatever

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:49.160
that meant, or seemed to mean.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.560
And then reading about or hearing that, well, scientists

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:59.760
consider the nature of things as chaotic, swarming,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:05.080
intersecting energies or patterns, chaotic patterns.

01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:08.360
Somehow, it's come out in the work in a weird kind of way.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:11.080
I just was curious what physicists would have to say

01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:13.840
about that.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.760
I don't think I'm illustrating science, but some of these

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.360
coming out of the work.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.760
Pollock said, when somebody said, why don't you pay nature?

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.920
He said, I am nature.

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:26.120
The materials nature, the materials energy.

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.960
I'm energy.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.680
Makes sense?

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.000
That's interesting.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.320
So I have a colleague who, well, so one of the theories

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.800
that's really challenging to interact with

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.760
is quantum mechanics, I think, where

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.560
you have probabilities that are governing what will happen

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.240
or what will be measured, as opposed

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:53.360
to push a box and see how far it will slide before it stops.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.920
So I have a colleague who says that he thinks in terms

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.400
of quantum mechanics.

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.000
And he said this to me multiple times.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.160
And I always ask him, I say, I don't

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.040
believe that you think in terms of quantum mechanics,

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.080
because you couldn't drive a car if you think

01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.320
in terms of quantum mechanics.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.160
It's just not possible.

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.160
So maybe what you're asking, or maybe what you're saying,

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:20.520
is that you're removed from a framework of the macroscopic

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.960
or of how we tend to look at the landscape

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.000
and seeing something else there.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.040
And I think that people have used that kind of art

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.640
to try to access ideas within physics of quantum mechanics.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.840
It's almost like I get the civic time

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:40.880
that inverters and power planets have to go about the energy.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.760
But it's interesting, because also,

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:48.320
when you're saying that your collaborator accuses you

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.880
of having a scientific cultural bias,

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.080
that you're being affected by cultural bias in science,

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:57.000
I actually see it going much more the other direction.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.480
That I do see people, I mean, it's

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:01.600
fascinating even from a language,

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.400
a linguistic perspective.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:05.960
Quantum is used in so many instances.

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.640
It has nothing to do with science.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.720
There are so many instances of this

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:15.280
where popular culture has taken over these words.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:17.080
And I think one of the really interesting things

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:20.560
that I thought about a lot during making a film,

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.080
and general is that in both science and art,

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.120
in the beginning of the 20th century,

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.440
what happened is very significant,

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:32.040
that in both cases they went to abstraction.

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:35.320
And so before that, painting was very literal

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.800
and science was very literal.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.320
Anybody of sort of normal intelligence,

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.040
you can understand laws of physics and painting.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:45.520
And suddenly in both the arts and the science,

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:49.040
we went to abstraction and it required specialists.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.560
And that seems to have a dialectical language.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.640
I don't need to electrolyze it.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.520
Just do it.

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:58.360
It's about a flow of work.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.160
But just whether it's good painting or a bad painting,

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.600
I think you can see it.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.720
I think that there's been throughout history,

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.800
back and forth between science and art.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.960
And there's a very interesting book Leonard Schlaine wrote

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:12.560
called Physics and Art.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.280
And he looks at the parallels in which,

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.640
in often in many instances, art led science

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:22.520
in terms of making and breakthrough,

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:26.760
in terms of perspective, in terms of light,

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.120
in terms of many things.

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.600
So I would say what you're feeling

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.600
is the end of a long process that's been ongoing.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.440
He used to be going.

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.040
It's fascinating what this all about,

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.280
what the time the editor is.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.280
Yeah.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:46.720
OK.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:48.440
I'd like to thank all of you.

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440
Thank you.

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.440
Thank you.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:43:20.400
Thank you.
