00:00.000 --> 00:15.600
Well, good afternoon, everyone.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.360
This is the Gillics Center roundtable.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.160
The date today is February 26, 2022.

00:22.160 --> 00:27.640
And I'm pleased to present to you our esteemed panel for today.

00:27.640 --> 00:30.280
I'll make a few brief comments first.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.680
I'm Jerry Herowitz.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.440
I'm the associate director at Gillics Center.

00:34.440 --> 00:41.280
And we're continuing this Zoom and YouTube format for the meantime.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.480
And we're not sure about our next.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.920
I think we're going to be in Zoom next time also.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.280
And that date for our next talk is March 12.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.720
Yes, sorry.

00:50.720 --> 00:55.280
I think September, October would be when we would be live.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.160
Very important.

00:57.160 --> 00:57.840
Good.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.840
So March 12 will be our next roundtable.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.640
And the topic there will be psychedelics.

01:03.640 --> 01:05.720
It might not matter to you whether it's March 12,

01:05.720 --> 01:06.920
if you're taking psychedelics.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.600
But anyway, that's the date of it.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.120
And it should be really interesting, really interesting talk.

01:13.120 --> 01:18.520
And we are targeting April 30 as the date for our last talk

01:18.520 --> 01:22.440
of the spring season, which will be on metaphysics.

01:22.440 --> 01:28.920
Today, we are pleased to be presenting a panel with the main theme

01:28.920 --> 01:33.840
of economics in the present and the near future.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.840
But we have some non-economists and economists.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.320
And I'd like to take a moment now and describe to you

01:40.320 --> 01:42.800
some of their bios.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.320

02:34.640 --> 02:37.360
That's Nicholas Economides.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.080
Jennifer Jack Wet is an associate professor

02:40.080 --> 02:41.840
in the Department of Environmental Studies

03:00.200 --> 03:03.080
Her research focuses on animals in the environment,

03:03.080 --> 03:07.480
magnetology, and attribution and responsibility

03:07.480 --> 03:09.280
in the Anthropocene.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.920
She also is the author of Shane Necessary

03:13.920 --> 03:18.400
about the evolution, function, and future of the use

03:18.400 --> 03:21.960
of social disapproval in a globalized digitized world

03:21.960 --> 03:26.000
and of the playbook, how to deny science, sell lies,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.520
and make a killing in the corporate world,

03:28.520 --> 03:32.520
another book which is forthcoming in June of this year,

03:32.520 --> 03:34.880
a work of a bistolary nonfiction

03:34.880 --> 03:37.600
that makes the business case for scientific denial.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.920
She is the recipient of the 2015 Alfred P. Sloan Research

03:40.920 --> 03:46.320

03:55.760 --> 04:00.240
oh it has a PhD from Geochemistry from Brown University.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.480
In 1999, he published Life, Temperature, and the Earth

04:06.480 --> 04:10.000
in addition to many papers in capitalism, nature, socialism,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.440
and other journals.

04:11.440 --> 04:15.200
His most recent books are The Earth is Not for Sale

and his older son Peter and the global,

04:17.960 --> 04:20.000
with his older son Peter, excuse me,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.880
and the global solar commons from 2021.

04:23.880 --> 04:26.160
David serves on the advisory board

04:26.160 --> 04:30.840
of capitalism, nature, socialism, and the editorial board

04:30.840 --> 04:32.400
of science and society.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.880
He's an active member of the DC Statehood Green Party

04:35.880 --> 04:40.280
of the United States.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.880
Robert H. Frank is the H.J. Lewis Professor of Management

04:44.880 --> 04:47.200
and Professor of Economics Emeritus

04:47.200 --> 04:50.320
at Cornell's Johnson School of Management.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.040
His economic view column, that's the name of it,

04:54.040 --> 04:58.160
has appeared in the New York Times since 2005.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.560
He received his BS in mathematics from Georgia Tech,

05:01.560 --> 05:03.320
then taught math and science for two years

05:03.320 --> 05:07.120
of the Peace Corps volunteers in rural Nepal.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.840
He holds an MA in statistics and a PhD in economics,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.560
both from the University of California,

05:23.560 --> 05:27.320
with Ben Bernanke, luxury fever, what price

05:27.320 --> 05:29.240
tomorrow high ground, and several others.

05:29.240 --> 05:36.640
The New York Times, oh, and it was, forgive me, yeah.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.720
The winner take all society, which was co-authored

05:38.720 --> 05:41.400
with Philip Hook, received the Critics' Choice Award

05:41.400 --> 05:44.560
and was named notable Book of the Year by the New York Times

05:44.560 --> 05:46.280
and was included in business week list

05:46.280 --> 05:50.720
of the 10 best books of 1995.

05:50.720 --> 05:57.720
And Richard Powers is an environmental

05:57.720 --> 06:00.720
and ecological economist who studied the interplay

06:00.720 --> 06:04.080
between economic analysis and the ecological, moral,

06:04.080 --> 06:07.960
and social dimensions of environmental governance.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.520
His topical interests focus on the evaluation and management

06:11.520 --> 06:14.400
of ecosystem services, theories of discounting

06:14.400 --> 06:18.520
and intergenerational justice, climate stabilization policy,

06:18.520 --> 06:21.720
the ethical foundation of voluntary pro-environmental

06:21.720 --> 06:24.720
behaviors, and the relationship between economic growth,

06:24.720 --> 06:27.160
environmental quality, and human well-being

06:27.160 --> 06:29.960
is mediated by endogenous social norms.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.560
Professor Howard graduated Sumit Komal from the Biology

06:33.560 --> 06:36.440
and Society Program at Cornell University

06:36.440 --> 06:39.520
and holds an MS in land resources from the University

06:39.520 --> 06:41.080
of Wisconsin-Madison.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.680
He received his PhD from the Energy and Resource Group

06:43.680 --> 06:46.800
of the University of California at Berkeley in 1990,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.200
where he collaborated with Richard B. Norgaard

06:49.200 --> 06:51.360
on the economics of natural resources

06:51.360 --> 06:53.920
and sustainable development.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.920
So that's as short as I can make it,

06:57.920 --> 06:59.760
introduction to our esteemed panel.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.040
I wanted to just start off by quoting Charles Hindelberger,

07:06.240 --> 07:10.200
the economics historian who mentioned just very tersely

07:10.200 --> 07:15.200
that how history is particular in economics as general.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.680
And I mentioned to some of our panelists

07:17.680 --> 07:21.120
in advance of our talk how much I found it interesting

07:21.120 --> 07:24.080
that economics is being pressed into dealing with a lot

07:24.080 --> 07:26.520
of rapid change and instability in the world,

07:26.520 --> 07:28.240
which we're facing now, which includes, of course,

07:28.240 --> 07:32.880
climate change, mass migrations, supply chain disruptions,

07:32.880 --> 07:34.080
et cetera, et cetera.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.440
Now we know, of course, of this dreadful tragedy

07:36.440 --> 07:39.360
going on in the Ukraine, which is going to almost

07:39.360 --> 07:42.560
certainly impact all of these different domains.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.240
So I want to open the floor to whoever wants to take

07:46.240 --> 07:49.240
a quick stab at introducing the conversation

07:49.240 --> 07:52.560
and getting a rolling, and then we'll just take it from there.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.200
Well, if I may, I think that the present reality

08:04.880 --> 08:09.000
after the invasion of Ukraine reminds us

08:09.000 --> 08:12.560
that we should be humbler in more humble

08:12.560 --> 08:15.720
in terms of making predictions.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.760
I mean, we are talking about the long run.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.080
I thought that's what was our topic today.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.280
And unfortunately, even in the short run,

08:24.280 --> 08:28.240
we see instability we didn't anticipate.

08:28.240 --> 08:32.400
So from my point of view, that means that it's crucial

08:32.400 --> 08:37.400
to think of what really works in human behavior

08:38.080 --> 08:41.480
but economists think really works.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.840
And think of that, which is going to remain there

08:45.840 --> 08:50.840
no matter what happens in world politics and world affairs.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.880
And I would underline the issue of incentives,

08:55.880 --> 08:58.040
that incentives work.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.660
People being paid more are going to work harder.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.200
The lower taxation on investment can make a huge difference

09:08.200 --> 09:12.080
to drive economic growth.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.080
And the crucial aspect of education,

09:16.080 --> 09:21.080
that education, persistent excellence in education

09:22.200 --> 09:26.160
has driven innovation in the United States

09:26.160 --> 09:28.040
and other countries of the world

09:28.040 --> 09:29.880
where education was underlined.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.560
And as an academic, I have to express my concerns

09:33.560 --> 09:38.560
for the cheapening of education, making exams easier,

09:38.560 --> 09:43.560
making, allowing people to perform well

09:44.160 --> 09:45.920
when they're not performing well,

09:45.920 --> 09:48.800
showing them as if they're performing well.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.280
So these are kind of the long run issues

09:52.280 --> 09:57.280
that come up to mind as we think of what might survive

09:57.840 --> 10:02.040
the upheaval that we're seeing in the world these days.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.800
So let me start from there

10:03.800 --> 10:08.800
and let other people have a chance to say more.

10:09.000 --> 10:09.840
Thank you.

10:13.040 --> 10:18.040
I don't wanna preempt the woman on the panel.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.280
And generally in Zooms, I respect that.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.400
I don't know if I'm the oldest one here, probably not.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.560
But nevertheless, I'll say a few things

10:29.560 --> 10:31.880
to try to provoke the conversation

10:31.880 --> 10:35.880
because I think I'm probably the most left-wing person

10:35.880 --> 10:37.360
on the panel.

10:37.360 --> 10:40.120
And so I'll try to live up to that.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
My motto is be as radical as reality itself

10:46.240 --> 10:49.840
and taking radical as a good thing,

10:49.840 --> 10:52.080
being going to the root.

10:52.080 --> 10:57.080
So I come, let me read a quick quotation

10:57.080 --> 11:01.720
from my latest book, The Global Solar Commons.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.720
This is from the editorial board of the Financial Times,

11:07.360 --> 11:09.800
right at the beginning of the pandemic.

11:10.640 --> 11:15.240
And it said, radical reforms are required to forge

11:15.240 --> 11:18.800
a society that will work for all.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.400
Governments will have to accept the more active role

11:24.400 --> 11:28.360
in the economy, they must see public services

11:28.360 --> 11:32.040
as investments rather than liabilities

11:32.040 --> 11:36.680
and look for ways to make labor markets less insecure.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.240
Read distribution will again be on the agenda.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.240
Policies until recently considered eccentric

11:47.840 --> 11:52.840
such as wealth taxes will have to be in the mix.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.960
So again, I come from a physical natural science background.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.440
That's my expertise, I'm not an economist,

12:01.440 --> 12:05.480
but I am most concerned on how the physical economy

12:06.920 --> 12:10.760
will need to be developed that is compatible

12:10.760 --> 12:13.800
with preventing catastrophic climate change

12:13.800 --> 12:16.160
and protecting biodiversity.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.880
And that again has really deep implications

12:19.880 --> 12:24.520
through the political economy, which as an ego socialist,

12:24.520 --> 12:28.520
I find fossil capitalism to be obsolete

12:28.520 --> 12:33.720
and a profound barrier to preventing catastrophic climate change.

12:33.720 --> 12:38.720
So I'll conclude by saying again as for provocation

12:39.040 --> 12:44.040
that a militarized fossil capital that we now see in play

12:44.480 --> 12:48.040
with this war that's going on

12:48.040 --> 12:53.040
is the main obstacle to forging a world

12:54.080 --> 12:56.720
where you have cooperation necessary

12:56.720 --> 12:59.200
to prevent climate catastrophe.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.240
So I hope that's not superbocative.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.600
I hope it's more provocative.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.960
Thank you.

13:05.960 --> 13:08.400
That's perfectly provocative.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.720
Anyone want to take a response to that?

13:12.600 --> 13:15.200
I was going to say that I think you're trying to combine

13:15.200 --> 13:17.640
some of these first two comments.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.880
I'm on the one side talking about being as radical

13:21.880 --> 13:24.600
as the world is on the other side,

13:24.600 --> 13:28.200
sort of reinforcing our interest

13:28.200 --> 13:30.680
in competence, education and competence.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.960
Who's interesting to note the performance of the CDC

13:35.960 --> 13:38.080
in the face of the pandemic.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.400
And of course it did have also economic implications

13:40.400 --> 13:43.320
that were quite strong and not something the CDC

13:43.320 --> 13:47.000
probably normally welcomes as a challenge.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.760
But here you have an institution that was really felt

13:50.760 --> 13:53.120
to be rather competent.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.720
And by some folks reckoning it struggled a lot anyway.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.840
And I think in part struggled because of their rapidity

13:59.840 --> 14:03.160
of onset of the particular stresses we were facing.

14:03.160 --> 14:06.960
So I wonder if people want to comment on that at all.

14:11.400 --> 14:15.440
May I comment on the previous speakers' ideas?

14:15.440 --> 14:18.640
I think that it's very, very important

14:18.640 --> 14:23.640
to keep in place incentives for investment and growth.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.880
And I think that people who want the distribution

14:28.880 --> 14:31.280
have to take that into consideration.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.960
The idea that suddenly there is this gold mine there

14:34.960 --> 14:38.560
in which we can all tap and distribute to the poor

14:38.560 --> 14:42.920
without taking to account what effect this will have

14:42.920 --> 14:46.160
on investment and growth is just foolish.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.920
I'm sorry, it could be a great radical idea

14:48.920 --> 14:50.640
but it's just foolish.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.640
I mean, we need to be able to invest in growth.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.720
And that works through incentives.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.720
And incentives of the government provides tax incentives

15:03.800 --> 15:05.280
for growth.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.600
So we shouldn't really eliminate them.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.480
And that's serious.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.320
I mean, it's not trivial to just put it under the carpet.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.440
No matter what kind of other objectives we have,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.840
we have to make sure that this happens.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.840
And in particular, the United States is facing

15:22.840 --> 15:27.480
a huge challenge, not from Russia, but from China

15:27.480 --> 15:29.640
on this issue.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.720
China is about to overtake the United States economically

15:33.720 --> 15:35.240
in a few years.

15:35.240 --> 15:40.240
If we focus on redistribution without thinking

15:40.240 --> 15:44.760
of investment and growth, this will happen very quickly,

15:44.760 --> 15:48.240
the overtaking of the United States by China.

15:48.240 --> 15:53.240
And being second or being third is really not good.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.200
People haven't lived it in our lifetime.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.160
The United States was always first

15:59.160 --> 16:02.320
and therefore the issue didn't really come up.

16:02.320 --> 16:07.320
But if we are second or third in the next five or 10 years,

16:07.320 --> 16:09.280
that will hurt us.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.000
And that's very, very important.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
So without putting down in any way David's radicals ideas,

16:17.320 --> 16:19.400
I think it's very important,

16:19.400 --> 16:24.400
I think it's very important to keep the investment incentives

16:24.760 --> 16:27.440
and the excellence in education,

16:27.440 --> 16:31.240
investment in special, I mean, investment in education,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.240
especially for the top institutions,

16:33.240 --> 16:35.120
the top academic institutions,

16:35.120 --> 16:38.200
because this has driven innovation

16:38.200 --> 16:41.760
with all kinds of positive effects, externalities

16:41.760 --> 16:43.480
in the United States.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.560
Let me briefly respond,

16:47.560 --> 16:51.080
and then I'll be quiet for quite a while, if you don't mind.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.480
I agree with you, Nicholas.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.560
We do need incentives.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.680
Right now the incentives,

16:59.360 --> 17:03.360
the IMF estimates that the subsidies

17:03.360 --> 17:06.560
for fossil fuel direct and indirect

17:06.560 --> 17:10.440
total nearly $6 trillion a year,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.520
that's certainly an incentive,

17:12.520 --> 17:16.200
powerful incentive for the continuation

17:16.200 --> 17:21.120
of the burning of fossil fuel globally.

17:21.120 --> 17:25.920
And so those incentives should be shifted to green capital.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.120
Absolutely, we need green growth,

17:29.120 --> 17:34.120
not to say that green capital doesn't have its own problems,

17:34.120 --> 17:39.120
but certainly in terms of curbing fossil fuel consumption

17:40.280 --> 17:43.760
as fast as possible, which is necessary

17:43.760 --> 17:48.760
for any chance of meeting one and a half degree warming limit,

17:49.160 --> 17:54.160
we need to promote green capital,

17:54.720 --> 17:59.720
defeat fossil capital and form a global alliance

17:59.720 --> 18:00.920
with green capital.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.760
So I agree with you, there are incentives

18:03.760 --> 18:05.600
that are necessary.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.080
We probably agree more than you think,

18:09.080 --> 18:11.120
and I'll be quiet now.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.760
I'll jump in, I'll say that from this angle,

18:14.760 --> 18:16.800
I see a set of intersecting,

18:16.800 --> 18:19.320
interlocking global crises,

18:19.320 --> 18:22.760
that all are linked to the history of the last 30 years

18:22.760 --> 18:25.120
in globalization 1.0.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.520
And we deregulated financial markets.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.240
We decided not to move away from oil and gas

18:31.240 --> 18:34.760
in the United States, at least we decided that in Europe,

18:34.760 --> 18:38.920
the approach to Russia was about market liberalization,

18:38.920 --> 18:42.760
the idea that interdependence would turn Russia

18:42.760 --> 18:44.920
into a liberal democracy.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.000
And just on that last, and then Germany in particular,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.480
in Europe became very dependent on natural gas

18:50.480 --> 18:52.560
for reasons that are complex.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.080
But in some ways, you could ask whether that focus

18:57.080 --> 18:59.560
on market liberalization,

18:59.560 --> 19:01.720
does that humor aimed back in ways

19:01.720 --> 19:05.760
that have contributed to the current crisis in Ukraine?

19:05.760 --> 19:07.120
I'm not sure that that's right,

19:07.120 --> 19:08.680
but that's a question that's on my mind

19:08.680 --> 19:09.840
that I'll put that there.

19:11.680 --> 19:15.020
Can I add a little bit on incentives as well?

19:16.200 --> 19:19.160
Of course, incentives are important.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.680
The reason we're in, the mess we're in right now

19:21.680 --> 19:23.920
is precisely because we've been sending people

19:23.920 --> 19:25.360
the wrong incentives.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.400
You discharge CO2 into the air,

19:29.400 --> 19:32.280
that has costs on everybody.

19:32.280 --> 19:36.000
Nobody pays an extra fee for the right to do that.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.520
We could do it without charge now.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.800
We never should have allowed that incentive

19:41.800 --> 19:44.040
to remain in place.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.400
We need to make massive public investment now

19:47.400 --> 19:50.000
in order to achieve climate stability.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.680
And there's very little time left

19:52.680 --> 19:56.680
to meet the objective of avoiding temperature increases

19:56.680 --> 19:58.880
greater than 1.5 degrees Celsius,

19:58.880 --> 20:02.880
which read David Wallace Wells' book.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.680
If you haven't, there are grim fates in store

20:05.680 --> 20:09.040
for us in every country,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.480
if we let temperature rise more than that.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.280
So we've got to act quickly.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.680
And I think the investments we need to make,

20:16.680 --> 20:18.880
many can come in the private sector.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.920
We can guide them as we have in the past

20:22.920 --> 20:27.920
with subsidies for renewable energy investments and the like.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.920
There is now a very exciting new technology

20:33.880 --> 20:38.880
developed by ClimbWorks in Switzerland

20:39.240 --> 20:41.000
to suck carbon out of the air

20:41.000 --> 20:43.680
and turn it into a carbon-based slurry

20:43.680 --> 20:45.160
that you pump deep underground.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.240
And it's very expensive now,

20:47.240 --> 20:51.360
but we're on a track to have the cost of that come down

20:51.360 --> 20:54.320
rapidly enough to where it too could make a difference.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.880
But all this is going to require an enormous amount of money.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.880
We've got an enormous amount of money.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.440
That's not the problem.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.040
The problem is to persuade people to part

21:07.040 --> 21:09.960
with what they're using the money for now

21:09.960 --> 21:12.720
and to use it instead for these other things,

21:12.720 --> 21:14.600
that if we don't use it for them,

21:14.600 --> 21:16.600
there's not going to be a future for us.

21:16.600 --> 21:20.160
And so I think that means if you want to be practical,

21:20.160 --> 21:22.800
looking to the top of the income pyramid,

21:22.800 --> 21:25.840
there's enormous resources there.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.480
We've been hearing about wealth taxes

21:28.480 --> 21:31.640
and how small the bite they need to take

21:31.640 --> 21:35.120
in order to generate enormous pools of resources

21:35.120 --> 21:39.800
to invest in these public projects that need to happen.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.560
I'm not worried about people lacking incentives

21:43.560 --> 21:47.760
to grow wealthy if they have to pay a little bit more in tax.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.080
There's a huge literature on the determinants

21:51.080 --> 21:52.480
of human flourishing.

21:52.480 --> 21:54.760
It's contentious.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.120
People argue about many of the findings in it.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.240
The one thing they don't argue about,

21:59.240 --> 22:03.400
the one really secure finding that's held up in every study

22:03.400 --> 22:05.360
is that beyond a certain point,

22:05.360 --> 22:07.240
and it's one we've long since passed,

22:07.240 --> 22:09.800
and most countries in the West have too,

22:09.800 --> 22:13.280
further increases in consumption

22:13.280 --> 22:17.280
serve only to raise the bar that we think of as adequate.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.800
So if all the mansions get 10% bigger,

22:20.800 --> 22:24.000
the people living in them aren't any happier,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.760
any healthier than they were before.

22:26.760 --> 22:31.760
If the cars get bigger, people aren't only not happier.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.600
They're at more risk of death and injury.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.880
We burn up more fossil fuels.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.320
All of these things could be changed

22:39.320 --> 22:41.640
if we changed people's incentives,

22:41.640 --> 22:44.720
and we've got simple tax levers that can do that.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.280
So yes, incentives are important,

22:47.280 --> 22:51.880
and we've been steering people with the wrong incentives.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.520
Thus far, that's why we're in the best that we're in.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.320
I guess I should jump in to just ask,

23:01.320 --> 23:04.960
you know, a kind of meta question about economics

23:04.960 --> 23:06.080
or the field of economics,

23:06.080 --> 23:08.160
which is something I grapple with,

23:08.160 --> 23:10.680
is how much is the field of economics itself

23:10.680 --> 23:15.480
responsible for those misaligned incentives?

23:15.480 --> 23:19.320
And so I'm one of the people here who did major in economics

23:19.320 --> 23:22.000
as an undergrad, then a master's in economics,

23:22.000 --> 23:26.000
and realized I did not want to get a PhD in economics.

23:26.880 --> 23:31.120
I know Rich, you and Bob have survived the field,

23:31.120 --> 23:33.240
and I'm sort of curious, you know,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.680
when Nicholas says like, what really works?

23:35.680 --> 23:40.280
How much should we look to economists for what really works?

23:40.280 --> 23:42.520
I feel like we've been gravely misled

23:42.520 --> 23:46.280
by some of the assumptions and ideologies of the field.

23:46.280 --> 23:50.160
And also some serious levers for human behavior

23:50.160 --> 23:53.480
have been overlooked, including reputation, of course,

23:53.480 --> 23:56.320
and reputation being the primary mechanism

23:56.320 --> 23:58.760
to enforce the Paris Agreement.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.800
And it's something economists don't,

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
I think, address very well.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.160
And I've been very disturbed more recently

24:06.160 --> 24:07.760
by the fact that, you know,

24:07.760 --> 24:10.880
the student divestment movement around fossil fuels,

24:10.880 --> 24:14.080
the pushback within academia has come primarily

24:14.080 --> 24:16.640
from economics professors.

24:16.640 --> 24:20.520
And this strikes me again as an area of tension

24:20.520 --> 24:22.640
where we have this kind of hubris

24:22.640 --> 24:27.640
about what really works in an era of mass unpredictability

24:29.440 --> 24:31.720
and a kind of lack of humility, I would say,

24:31.720 --> 24:34.800
on the part of economists in general,

24:34.800 --> 24:38.720
not, of course, specifically to anyone in this roundtable,

24:38.720 --> 24:42.840
but about, you know, asking what really works.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.080
When psychologists start winning the Nobel Prize in economics,

24:46.080 --> 24:47.800
you should start doubting, you know,

24:47.800 --> 24:50.380
the tenets of your discipline.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.480
Well, I think that's the thing.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.720
I mean, if we're going to be serious about it,

24:55.720 --> 24:58.600
you cannot attack a field of study.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.040
I mean, seriously, I mean, that would be just dumb.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.640
I mean, there is diversity among people.

25:04.640 --> 25:08.880
People have right used the same quantitative tools

25:08.880 --> 25:10.320
with different assumptions

25:10.320 --> 25:11.960
and they're all different conclusions.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.520
Not the way I see economics.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.600
Like people would do that in physics

25:17.600 --> 25:19.920
or in psychology or in other fields.

25:19.920 --> 25:24.160
It's a science, you know, not everybody agrees.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.600
But I think practically everybody agrees

25:28.600 --> 25:30.960
that incentives work.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.920
And I think that Robert's ideas

25:33.920 --> 25:36.600
about how to change incentives are, in my opinion,

25:36.600 --> 25:37.880
very important.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.440
And society as a whole has to think seriously

25:41.440 --> 25:44.040
what possibilities there are there.

25:44.040 --> 25:49.040
I think there is a conflict between trying to take away

25:51.720 --> 25:54.160
the wealth of whoever is the wealth individual,

25:54.160 --> 25:57.080
or whatever that is,

25:57.080 --> 26:00.600
and trying to create the right incentives

26:00.600 --> 26:04.120
even for the objectives that you were talking about

26:04.120 --> 26:06.120
of green growth, for example.

26:06.120 --> 26:09.120
I mean, there could be a lot of different ways

26:09.120 --> 26:12.280
to achieve that green growth without screwing up

26:12.280 --> 26:15.040
the incentives of the society for investment.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.120
Because after all, you know,

26:17.120 --> 26:19.160
when we're talking about wealth individuals

26:19.160 --> 26:21.960
with multi-billion dollar wealth,

26:21.960 --> 26:24.800
when we take away, let's say a billion dollars

26:24.800 --> 26:26.760
or 10 billion dollars from them,

26:26.760 --> 26:28.720
we're not changing consumption

26:28.720 --> 26:32.120
because these people cannot possibly consume

26:32.120 --> 26:33.440
that amount of money.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.720
We're taking it away from investment.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.720
So that would have to be, you know, truthful about it.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.320
We're taking it away from investment.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.080
So the real question is,

26:43.080 --> 26:46.680
is the government good in doing investments?

26:46.680 --> 26:49.120
And everybody knows that it's not true.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.480
It's not true.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.160
The government, if you give it 10 billion dollars,

26:53.160 --> 26:56.000
it's going to be wasted to a very large extent.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.800
And we all agree on that.

26:58.800 --> 27:03.360
So we have to think of ways in which the incentives

27:03.360 --> 27:07.760
are set up so that the private sector produces

27:07.760 --> 27:11.640
what we want, the green growth that we all agree we want.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.440
So we need to think of that.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.880
And this is a serious issue.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.360
I mean, it's not trivial.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.240
And we need to work on it.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.680
I mean, how can I put it?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.760
I mean, just general declarations,

27:22.760 --> 27:26.480
let's take the portal that Bezos has.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.080
I mean, that doesn't, we'll not get us anywhere.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.440
We need to think of incentives

27:31.440 --> 27:35.680
for the private sector to invest in this areas

27:35.680 --> 27:37.240
that we're interested to invest.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.480
Thank you.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.880
And luxury fever, in 1990, I came out

27:42.880 --> 27:45.840
and you had the graduated conception tax.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.640
And that's a really good idea, because we live in a society

27:48.640 --> 27:50.880
that is Galbraith said back in the 50s,

27:50.880 --> 27:53.400
is characterized by what?

27:53.400 --> 27:56.320
Private splendor and public squalor.

27:56.320 --> 28:01.080
And we're arguably, because of status externalities

28:01.080 --> 28:05.680
and positional goods, we've constructed a society

28:05.680 --> 28:08.600
where we have excessive levels of private consumption

28:08.600 --> 28:11.280
and we under invest in public goods

28:11.280 --> 28:12.960
and in public infrastructure.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.960
And I think I agree with Robert Frank

28:14.960 --> 28:17.440
that most of, or many of the investments that now

28:17.440 --> 28:21.640
are most important, the public sector has to be in the lead

28:21.640 --> 28:24.600
on that and it has to be done at a global level.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.880
And so what works, I think, is something

28:26.880 --> 28:29.960
that looks more like social democracy

28:29.960 --> 28:34.880
than like laissez-fieck fear of capitalism.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.440
Now, maybe we need to look back at what works

28:37.440 --> 28:41.240
in the New Deal era in the 50s and 60s.

28:41.240 --> 28:44.240
There are some problems there, but maybe we need to go back

28:44.240 --> 28:46.680
towards a better balance between the public

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
and private sector.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.160
And it should be incentive-based

28:49.160 --> 28:51.400
and it should be investment-focused.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.320
Nick, you said we all agree that when government

28:56.320 --> 28:58.320
invests they do a bad job of it,

28:58.320 --> 29:00.160
I don't think we all agree about that,

29:00.160 --> 29:02.600
at least I don't agree with it.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.680
They do a bad job in some cases,

29:04.680 --> 29:08.040
but in other cases there are investments

29:08.040 --> 29:11.240
that the private sector simply doesn't have any incentive

29:11.240 --> 29:14.640
to make so that even if the government did a poor job

29:14.640 --> 29:17.480
with them it would be better than not seeing them happen

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
at all, but there are plenty of examples

29:19.480 --> 29:22.160
where the government's done a splendidly good job

29:22.160 --> 29:23.360
with public investment.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.520
I mean, there are massive public works,

29:26.520 --> 29:28.840
product programs all over the world

29:28.840 --> 29:31.320
that do an enormous amount of good for the citizens

29:31.320 --> 29:32.800
of their countries.

29:32.800 --> 29:36.120
Why do we insist that the government's not pretty good

29:36.120 --> 29:37.360
at things like that?

29:39.920 --> 29:44.600
If I may, I mean, I would say the reason why the government

29:44.600 --> 29:47.800
might not be as good as you think on that

29:47.800 --> 29:51.800
is because the government is run by politicians

29:51.800 --> 29:54.240
and politicians need to be reelected.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.400
So on top of their minds is how they're going to please

29:57.400 --> 29:59.760
the public and to get the real act.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.760
And one way to please the public is to take this money

30:02.760 --> 30:06.560
that they have under their control and double it down,

30:06.560 --> 30:09.720
give it to the public rather than invest it,

30:09.720 --> 30:12.520
even though you're absolutely right, Robert,

30:12.520 --> 30:16.920
that investing it in some public goods

30:16.920 --> 30:20.480
is in fact an excellent idea.

30:20.480 --> 30:25.160
There are of course aspects of the economy

30:25.160 --> 30:28.360
where the incentives for the private sector are not big enough.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.320
I mean, that's for sure.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.440
But the problem is that there is a conflict

30:33.440 --> 30:38.560
at the government level because we are human beings.

30:38.560 --> 30:41.560
We're run by politicians whose top priority

30:41.560 --> 30:44.600
is to get reelected and there's no doubt about that.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.560
The top priority is not to make the United States great.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.160
The top priority is to get reelected.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.520
And to do that, they're going to distribute the money

30:53.520 --> 30:55.600
to the voters.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.320
And that's in that problem is going to be there,

30:59.320 --> 31:01.520
no matter what government we have,

31:01.520 --> 31:03.720
as long as we have an elected government,

31:03.720 --> 31:05.000
it's going to be there.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.360
And therefore we need to take it into account and say,

31:08.360 --> 31:13.360
well, do we really want to give huge amounts of money

31:14.720 --> 31:17.000
from the private sector to the public sector?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.280
Or we know it has less productivity.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.120
Are we, do we need to do that?

31:21.120 --> 31:22.960
Except for a very essential stuff,

31:22.960 --> 31:25.400
like national defense, for example,

31:25.400 --> 31:29.200
in which we don't want to give it to the private sector.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.680
So it's important to think about it

31:32.680 --> 31:36.280
and not jump to conclusions and say,

31:36.280 --> 31:37.200
oh yeah, great.

31:37.200 --> 31:40.240
I mean, that just because the government

31:40.240 --> 31:42.920
is doing some good job in some investments,

31:42.920 --> 31:45.240
let's give them a huge project,

31:45.240 --> 31:47.840
which is the green project to them.

31:47.840 --> 31:51.280
But rather try to find ways to do it in the private sector.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.240
I just like to.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.880
I would challenge that, Nicholas,

31:55.880 --> 31:59.400
because that analysis,

31:59.400 --> 32:02.680
because how do politicians get elected?

32:04.440 --> 32:08.000
Undiably, we now have less of a democracy

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
and more of a plutocracy.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.280
And knowing the amount of money

32:15.280 --> 32:18.760
from the big corporate sector

32:18.760 --> 32:22.200
that goes into campaign funds.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.040
So that has distorted our democracy.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.160
And many people have pointed that out.

32:28.160 --> 32:32.880
So therefore, the politicians that are elected

32:32.880 --> 32:34.840
tend to serve the interests

32:34.840 --> 32:37.960
of their big campaign contributors.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.160
This is not rocket science.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.360
I would add in terms of what I would call

32:44.360 --> 32:48.480
trickle down economics or neoliberal economics,

32:48.480 --> 32:52.040
which basically that's what I'm hearing from you.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.360
With all respect, I am.

32:54.360 --> 32:59.360
And let me give a case study from my community in D.C.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.880
We have an elected city, a local government.

33:04.880 --> 33:08.880
Of course, we don't have statehood.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.640
We're fighting for it.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.800
And actually, the big prime instrument

33:13.800 --> 33:16.880
of fossil capital, Senator Manchin,

33:16.880 --> 33:20.120
is blocking that among a few others

33:20.120 --> 33:22.840
to actually have self-determination.

33:22.840 --> 33:27.160
But our own economic policies and social policies

33:27.160 --> 33:32.200
in our D.C. have been dominated by trickle down economics.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.800
And what has this resulted in?

33:34.800 --> 33:39.280
D.C. now has the biggest life expectancy gap

33:39.280 --> 33:42.800
in the country compared to 50 states

33:42.800 --> 33:45.680
between black and white residents.

33:45.680 --> 33:49.920
It actually has grown in the last 20 years.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.600
It's shockingly high.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.400
And this is a reflection of where the priorities

33:56.400 --> 34:01.400
of public spending and the fact that our politicians

34:02.160 --> 34:05.240
that are in power in our local government

34:05.240 --> 34:09.680
are basically beholden to the big developer class,

34:09.680 --> 34:11.680
which has gentrified D.C.,

34:11.680 --> 34:16.680
which has forced residents out, long-term residents.

34:16.680 --> 34:21.680
And so I'm going by our own experience in our local government,

34:21.800 --> 34:26.800
our local community in terms of the impacts of these policies.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.920
And we also have seen in the pandemic

34:30.920 --> 34:35.840
how the billionaire class has grown even richer

34:36.760 --> 34:40.400
and income inequality has grown.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.720
And finally, what does that mean to health?

34:43.720 --> 34:48.720
If we look at the life expectancy of in the United States,

34:50.120 --> 34:54.720
compared to its cohort of wealthy countries,

34:54.720 --> 34:57.560
we're ranked about 40 in the world.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.560
A matter of fact, Cuba and the US

34:59.560 --> 35:02.160
have about the same life expectancy now.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.200
I wonder if I, I think, I'm sorry, David,

35:06.200 --> 35:10.160
so Jennifer, you also had something to add at that point.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.560
I'm gonna mute.

35:12.560 --> 35:17.560
I would just say that, of course, you can attack an entire field.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.520
I mean, we have many times in the past,

35:19.520 --> 35:21.760
we attacked the field of eugenics right now,

35:21.760 --> 35:24.000
critical race theory is under attack.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.600
You can most certainly attack a whole field.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.320
And I think it's worth questioning,

35:31.320 --> 35:33.200
especially with the premise of this roundtable

35:33.200 --> 35:37.680
was about the sort of role of the dismal science of economics,

35:37.680 --> 35:40.160
which is not, of course, in fact, a science.

35:40.160 --> 35:44.320
Economics uses scientific tools, it uses empiricism.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.560
But if you know anything about the epistemology of science,

35:47.560 --> 35:51.080
terms like good and necessary growth

35:51.080 --> 35:55.120
or trickle down economics, these are all normative assumptions.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.360
They're all values that we bring,

35:57.360 --> 35:58.920
rich I see you nodding, I'm sure,

35:58.920 --> 36:02.840
ecological economics has these kind of arguments all the time

36:02.840 --> 36:07.360
about the values that are baked into the research.

36:07.360 --> 36:10.920
And so I think what I'm interested in

36:10.920 --> 36:14.760
is the way in which, especially members of this panel

36:14.760 --> 36:17.400
have grappled with some of those assumptions

36:17.400 --> 36:21.480
in the field of economics and are trying to modernize

36:21.480 --> 36:25.400
or make them relevant to the 21st century,

36:25.400 --> 36:30.400
make them less glaringly insufficient

36:30.600 --> 36:33.880
as they were, I think, in the 20th.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.960
I mean, that's a good question.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.840
I mean, I also say that the government,

36:38.840 --> 36:40.960
democracy isn't working well in America.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.560
What is working well is the ability of corporations

36:43.560 --> 36:48.120
to get all a distance left that who pursue corporate interests.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.280
And so we've been through 30 or 40 years of that.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.200
We have an economy now that is built around rent capture

36:54.200 --> 36:55.400
and rent seeking.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.080
And a lot of what we call investment

36:57.080 --> 37:00.280
is about the financialization of the economy.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.040
But as our economy has become more financialized,

37:03.040 --> 37:05.960
then innovation has gone down, not up.

37:05.960 --> 37:09.680
And what we've seen then is a capture of wealth by capital

37:09.680 --> 37:13.280
that the extensive labor or workers use that drum,

37:13.280 --> 37:14.880
because capital isn't an entity,

37:14.880 --> 37:17.480
capital is a factor of production.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.840
But what we have seen is an economy

37:19.840 --> 37:22.320
because of the financialization and the emphasis

37:22.320 --> 37:24.240
on rent seeking and rent capture.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.600
We have an economy that is less fair,

37:26.600 --> 37:28.760
it's less productive, we're not able to solve

37:28.760 --> 37:32.240
some of the crucial problems that I mentioned earlier

37:32.240 --> 37:34.440
with globalization 1.0.

37:34.440 --> 37:35.280
So.

37:36.200 --> 37:41.040
That's in a way giving support to Nick's arguments

37:41.040 --> 37:44.600
about not wanting to give the government more resources

37:44.600 --> 37:47.840
because they're in the pocket of corporate interests.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.160
Of course, they're not gonna spend the resources

37:50.160 --> 37:51.760
we give them in the public interest.

37:51.760 --> 37:54.640
I think it's important, that is a problem.

37:54.640 --> 37:59.640
I totally am quick to acknowledge if that's a serious problem.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.440
But it's not an insurmountable problem.

38:02.440 --> 38:06.080
As we know from the surveys done every year

38:06.080 --> 38:09.040
by an organization headquartered in Berlin,

38:09.040 --> 38:11.880
it's called Transparency International.

38:11.880 --> 38:15.840
They interview people in countries all around the world.

38:15.840 --> 38:20.320
The kinds of questions they ask are of the sort.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.760
How do you feel about your government?

38:22.760 --> 38:25.920
Do you feel you get good value for your tax payments?

38:25.920 --> 38:28.880
Do you feel the people in charge of your government

38:28.880 --> 38:32.440
are honest and general free of corruption?

38:32.440 --> 38:37.360
There are seven or eight or nine or 10,

38:37.360 --> 38:39.760
depending on how you count countries that end up

38:39.760 --> 38:43.840
at the top of that survey each and every year.

38:43.840 --> 38:47.200
The Scandinavian countries are there, New Zealand is there,

38:47.200 --> 38:50.480
Singapore interestingly is there.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.400
These citizens feel like, yes, our government's really

38:53.400 --> 38:57.400
delivering good value for the money we pay in a taxes.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.720
The United States doesn't do very well in that survey.

39:00.720 --> 39:05.720
And I think really if we maintain a narrative

39:07.320 --> 39:10.840
where government is evil and government is wasteful,

39:10.840 --> 39:14.080
it becomes harder to attract talented people to serve

39:14.080 --> 39:14.920
in government.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.600
Why would you want to be a bureaucrat if everybody

39:17.600 --> 39:20.160
thinks you're just wasting their money?

39:20.160 --> 39:23.160
You've got to work hard to build a good government.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.040
We had a woman elected here in Ithaca

39:26.040 --> 39:28.400
to be the Tompkins County Clerk.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.920
She happens to be in charge of the Department

39:30.920 --> 39:34.480
of Motor Vehicles, the favorite whipping boy

39:34.480 --> 39:36.280
of all government agencies.

39:36.280 --> 39:40.200
So you don't want the whole government to be run

39:40.200 --> 39:42.360
like the DMV, don't send them any money.

39:42.360 --> 39:46.760
She said, no, we're gonna turn this agency around.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.120
She had the staff trained.

39:49.120 --> 39:55.120
She got a mission for all the DMB

39:55.120 --> 39:57.920
line, the payment system that they used.

39:57.920 --> 40:01.480
And now it's a pleasure to go to the DMV here.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.880
I sold a car recently to a guy in Rochester.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.480
He said, I'd come and pick it up there,

40:07.480 --> 40:09.320
but I don't have plates to drive.

40:09.320 --> 40:12.480
I said, come register it at an RDMB.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.880
Said, no, it's gonna be an awful experience.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.080
No, he did it.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.760
And he walked away, dumbfounded.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.640
You just couldn't believe what an easy and helpful experience

40:20.640 --> 40:21.480
he just had.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.200
So you want a good government.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.880
You have every reason to want one you got to work in.

40:27.880 --> 40:32.200
I mentioned earlier the CDC in this context,

40:32.200 --> 40:35.560
because I thought it was an interesting case study

40:35.560 --> 40:40.200
for an institution that had a high reputation to start with.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.920
And ran it to some troubles.

40:41.920 --> 40:45.320
I mean, it still gets, I think, fairly good grades,

40:45.320 --> 40:47.600
but it's been eroded to some degree.

40:47.600 --> 40:52.000
And the question is, obviously, competence is one important,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.840
maybe the most important factor in maintaining

40:55.840 --> 40:58.800
public faith in an institution,

40:58.800 --> 41:00.600
but there may be other issues to it play.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.600
And I wonder about incentivizing somehow

41:03.600 --> 41:06.760
the restitution of our belief in the system.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.760
Because I think if you look at those other countries

41:08.760 --> 41:11.960
where people do think their government does good work,

41:11.960 --> 41:13.520
part of it is because their neighbors

41:13.520 --> 41:15.400
think their government does good work.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.080
And of course, the government made you good work,

41:17.080 --> 41:19.920
but the question is, there's sort of a ground swell

41:19.920 --> 41:20.800
of public opinion.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.920
How do we foster that?

41:21.920 --> 41:24.840
Because that's part of what makes our government work,

41:24.840 --> 41:26.440
I think you go agree?

41:28.840 --> 41:32.200
The CDC went downhill because it was in the service

41:32.200 --> 41:35.000
of Trump's agenda during his term.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.360
I mean, he had people in charge there

41:37.360 --> 41:39.280
who were doing his bidding,

41:39.280 --> 41:42.560
not the submission of the public health agency.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.640
That's improved markedly in the meantime,

41:44.640 --> 41:49.640
but still you can see they don't have a good sense

41:49.960 --> 41:52.520
of what's required of them as an agency.

41:52.520 --> 41:57.520
They recently postponed the approval of vaccines,

41:57.640 --> 42:01.440
COVID vaccines for kids under five demanding months

42:01.440 --> 42:02.480
of additional study.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.800
There were absolutely no red flags in the field

42:05.800 --> 42:07.920
showing that the vaccines were dangerous.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.320
There had been some indications

42:10.320 --> 42:14.440
that there was a very low incidence of myocarditis

42:14.440 --> 42:17.880
and teenage males from the vaccine.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.560
They weren't even sure that that was true,

42:19.560 --> 42:24.240
but in no instance, was anybody hospitalized on that account?

42:24.240 --> 42:25.880
Nobody died of it certainly.

42:25.880 --> 42:30.240
And they made kids under five ineligible for the vaccines

42:30.240 --> 42:33.240
for more than a half a year longer than necessary,

42:33.240 --> 42:38.240
just out of some odd desire not to be criticized

42:38.960 --> 42:42.360
if anything possibly could have gone wrong.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.240
Well, we know things are gonna go wrong

42:44.240 --> 42:45.160
if you don't approve it,

42:45.160 --> 42:47.840
because kids were getting the virus and dying from it.

42:48.960 --> 42:53.680
Wait, after SARS in 2004, I think it was,

42:53.680 --> 42:55.320
the global health community pointed out

42:55.320 --> 42:56.800
that it wasn't the question of weather,

42:56.800 --> 42:58.920
but now there would be a major pandemic.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.960
I recall Drow Harlem, Brooklyn giving a talk at Dartmouth,

43:02.960 --> 43:06.360
they think maybe in 2009 when she was running

43:06.360 --> 43:08.040
the World Health Organization.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.680
And she made the case that the global community

43:10.680 --> 43:14.120
was woefully underprepared for what needed to be done

43:14.120 --> 43:17.760
to prevent an event like we were now living through it.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.080
I mean, she turned out to be right about that.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.640
I mean, if you read the scientific journals,

43:21.640 --> 43:24.680
then people end up in genealogy in public health

43:24.680 --> 43:27.080
have been making that argument for a long time.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.400
There's been some successes

43:28.400 --> 43:32.040
like controlling Ebola and Africa.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.800
You know, in part, it's also about the nexus

43:33.800 --> 43:36.120
between the environment and people's livelihoods.

43:36.120 --> 43:39.440
And pandemic risks have a lot to do with the,

43:39.440 --> 43:44.440
with how agriculture and resource extraction is carried out

43:45.800 --> 43:49.840
in biodiversity hot spots where people report

43:49.840 --> 43:53.360
and don't necessarily have fliable livelihood opportunities.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.560
And solving a problem like that,

43:55.560 --> 43:59.520
heading off the next pandemic requires global institutions

43:59.520 --> 44:02.800
that point in the direction of sustainable development

44:02.800 --> 44:06.240
instead of more wars and more financial market crashes.

44:06.240 --> 44:11.240
I would add to that, I just looked up the death rates

44:12.400 --> 44:17.480
by country of COVID at the Johns Hopkins website today.

44:18.960 --> 44:22.800
The death rate that is by population.

44:24.280 --> 44:29.280
The US, the ratio of the US to Cuba death rate is four times.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.080
And why is that?

44:33.080 --> 44:38.080
Cuba has a robust public health system.

44:39.120 --> 44:43.000
International observers have recognized that.

44:44.800 --> 44:48.120
Obviously, the United States doesn't.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.760
And the defunding of our public health

44:50.760 --> 44:52.560
has certainly contributed to this

44:52.560 --> 44:55.440
along with what has already been pointed out.

44:55.440 --> 44:56.960
What Robert pointed out,

44:56.960 --> 45:01.960
the insidious influence of the anti-vax,

45:01.960 --> 45:06.960
anti-mandate propaganda that comes mainly from the far right.

45:08.560 --> 45:10.800
Not only in the United States, but globally.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.800
And by the way, there's a convergence

45:13.800 --> 45:16.380
with climate denialism as well.

45:17.440 --> 45:22.000
Andreas Mom and his associates wrote a very good book

45:22.000 --> 45:23.960
documenting this called,

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
White Skin Black Fuel that I recommend, Verso Press.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
And so by the way, the ratio for the US to China death rate

45:36.200 --> 45:39.080
by population 800.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.840
The death rate in the United States is 800 times

45:43.840 --> 45:45.400
the death rate of China.

45:46.680 --> 45:51.680
So I would just conclude, Cuba did this,

45:51.920 --> 45:55.360
even though Biden during the campaign said

45:55.360 --> 45:59.320
he would want to normalize relations with Cuba

45:59.320 --> 46:03.440
like Obama did, but he did the opposite.

46:03.440 --> 46:07.840
He basically imposed new sanctions against Cuba.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.640
And in spite of that, Cuba has vaccinated virtually

46:11.640 --> 46:15.000
all its population and has been sharing it

46:15.000 --> 46:18.080
with people all over the world.

46:18.080 --> 46:23.080
So let's respect public health and investment

46:23.080 --> 46:28.080
and public health as several of you pointed out.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.440
You're muted, Nicholas.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.600
Yeah, and are we ready to accept the social regime

46:36.760 --> 46:38.840
in China and Cuba?

46:40.360 --> 46:44.000
Are we ready to live under the conditions

46:44.000 --> 46:48.600
that the Chinese government imposes on its population?

46:48.600 --> 46:49.680
Are you ready?

46:49.680 --> 46:51.680
I'm asking yourself openly.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.600
I mean, you call me names, neo-liberal, this and that,

46:54.600 --> 46:56.120
but what about freedom?

46:56.120 --> 46:57.520
Isn't freedom important to you?

46:57.520 --> 46:58.800
I think it is.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.240
It's very important to you, I'm sure.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.520
It's important to everybody in the panel.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.440
So we should really take that more seriously

47:05.440 --> 47:07.680
before looking at the justice statistics,

47:07.680 --> 47:09.360
at least that's my point of view.

47:09.360 --> 47:13.200
But I wanted to come back though to the issue of inequality

47:13.200 --> 47:15.600
because I think that's a very important issue

47:16.600 --> 47:19.160
that was brought up by Jennifer.

47:19.160 --> 47:23.040
The issue of inequality and especially,

47:23.040 --> 47:24.960
well, some maybe somebody else said that too,

47:24.960 --> 47:28.440
that the rich got richer during the pandemic.

47:28.440 --> 47:32.440
I actually think inequality is a result

47:32.440 --> 47:35.560
of the fourth industrial revolution

47:35.560 --> 47:40.600
that we have been living in for a long time, actually.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.840
And now we see the big fruits of it

47:42.840 --> 47:46.280
because that industrial revolution meant

47:46.280 --> 47:50.800
that we use more machines, we use more software,

47:50.800 --> 47:55.000
we use more robots, and because they have become

47:55.000 --> 47:56.640
more productive over time.

47:57.880 --> 48:02.880
And the way that things work in a corporation

48:02.880 --> 48:06.840
or in any business, this productivity is attributed

48:06.840 --> 48:10.320
to capital and not to labor.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.800
And it's therefore paid to capital.

48:12.800 --> 48:16.280
And therefore, it shows up in profits.

48:16.280 --> 48:21.280
So if a labor is changed and replaced by a machine,

48:23.480 --> 48:26.920
then the amount of that goes to labor decreases

48:26.920 --> 48:31.040
and the amount that goes to capital and profits increases.

48:31.040 --> 48:36.040
So that almost automatically creates inequality.

48:36.520 --> 48:38.760
It's inequality at the corporate level,

48:38.760 --> 48:40.640
at the level of the business.

48:40.640 --> 48:44.880
But if you think that the owners of the capital

48:44.880 --> 48:47.640
are not the workers, then automatically it creates

48:47.640 --> 48:51.640
an inequality between the owners of the capital

48:51.640 --> 48:52.920
and the workers.

48:52.920 --> 48:55.400
And that's something that is there.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.320
I mean, we should really see for sure that way.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.600
And at least in my opinion, the way to fix it

49:01.600 --> 49:06.240
is to make sure that the workers have a part of the business,

49:06.240 --> 49:09.960
they have shares, they have a way to get

49:09.960 --> 49:13.400
to have an avenue of access to the profits

49:13.400 --> 49:14.680
of the corporation.

49:14.680 --> 49:18.000
It won't fix inequality across the board,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.800
but it will fix this particular inequality

49:20.800 --> 49:24.760
to some extent that comes from the foreign industrial revolution.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.120
It comes from the importance of the product,

49:27.120 --> 49:31.240
the increase in the productivity of machines and software.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.080
And I think that we should take it,

49:33.080 --> 49:34.320
at least from my point of view,

49:34.320 --> 49:40.040
we should think of ways for this to actually happen,

49:40.040 --> 49:45.160
which we might be able to implement at the corporate level

49:45.160 --> 49:50.600
and fix a significant part of the business.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.320
I think one of the objections that you hear most often

49:54.320 --> 49:57.280
when there's any proposal to do anything

49:57.280 --> 49:59.560
to reduce inequality is that you don't

49:59.560 --> 50:02.200
want to kill the geese who lay the golden eggs.

50:02.200 --> 50:06.840
It's the people at the top who are doing the real work

50:06.840 --> 50:07.720
in the economy.

50:07.720 --> 50:11.160
And if we were to tax them more heavily,

50:11.160 --> 50:14.520
they would either not try as hard as they're trying now

50:14.520 --> 50:18.000
or if we're in a local jurisdiction and we tried that,

50:18.000 --> 50:20.640
then they would move somewhere else.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.920
That's been actually put to the test many times.

50:23.920 --> 50:29.080
I think in the most vivid recent experiment in California,

50:29.080 --> 50:33.320
the legislature there raised the top marginal tax rate

50:33.320 --> 50:37.400
from 9% to 13.5%.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.080
That's a 50% increase.

50:39.080 --> 50:43.000
It came in two births, not far apart.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.920
And the predictions were dire.

50:44.920 --> 50:50.320
The predictions were uniform that the movers and the shakers,

50:50.320 --> 50:54.560
the people that made California, the wealthiest state

50:54.560 --> 50:57.360
in the country were going to move to Oregon,

50:57.360 --> 50:59.040
they were going to move to Nevada,

50:59.040 --> 51:01.880
they were going to flee the state and droves.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.120
It's been studied now.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.480
Stanford published a very detailed study

51:06.480 --> 51:08.640
in the wake of those increases.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.560
They tracked every percentile in the income distribution

51:12.560 --> 51:17.200
among California residents, the 99th percentile.

51:17.200 --> 51:22.360
The people who are wealthier than 99% of the state's residents

51:22.360 --> 51:26.480
left the state at the lowest rate by far of any other spot

51:26.480 --> 51:28.120
on the income level.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.960
So people have lives.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.600
They're thriving in their local areas.

51:33.600 --> 51:38.600
The states and budget surplus now, the state university

51:38.600 --> 51:42.120
system, which you know Nick was the best of the world

51:42.120 --> 51:44.480
from your own experience there.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.640
It was in crisis.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.000
It's no longer in crisis.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.960
It's not being much better funded.

51:48.960 --> 51:52.960
The roads are a better repaired now.

51:52.960 --> 51:57.240
Things are still struggling in some ways in California,

51:57.240 --> 52:00.320
but I think the revenue from those hikes

52:00.320 --> 52:03.200
has enabled people to leave better lives on balance.

52:03.200 --> 52:07.400
They may, as you say, they weren't going to spend it all anyway.

52:07.400 --> 52:09.800
And there's been a lot of public investment

52:09.800 --> 52:10.920
with the funds that will raise.

52:10.920 --> 52:16.120
So all in all, a good trade, it seems to me.

52:16.120 --> 52:19.440
Yeah, I just wanted to, I mean, I see what you're saying,

52:19.440 --> 52:24.080
Robert, but my proposal wasn't to tax the rich.

52:24.080 --> 52:29.200
My proposal is to find ways in which the workers would

52:29.200 --> 52:31.000
get a part of the company.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.480
They would get shares.

52:32.480 --> 52:35.280
And that's how they would participate in the wealth

52:35.280 --> 52:36.840
that was being created.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.320
So that's quite different.

52:38.320 --> 52:42.080
It's not really changing the taxation system at all.

52:42.080 --> 52:48.920
It's just a way to provide wealth to the workers

52:48.920 --> 52:51.280
through ownership, parcel ownership.

52:51.280 --> 52:55.240
So let me suggest that we urge capital owners

52:55.240 --> 52:59.000
to give some of their ownership to the workers.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.600
And then imagine that they say, no, we'd rather not do that.

53:02.600 --> 53:04.960
And then we counter with the proposal,

53:04.960 --> 53:08.600
well, we're going to tax you and buy shares that will deposit

53:08.600 --> 53:10.200
an account for them.

53:10.200 --> 53:13.040
Well, one way to do it, tax the rich.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.720
One way to do it would be to provide incentives to the rich.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.960
I see this negative point of view here.

53:17.960 --> 53:18.880
Let's tax them.

53:18.880 --> 53:20.160
Let's beat them up.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.320
Why that?

53:21.320 --> 53:23.680
What happened to positive incentives?

53:23.680 --> 53:25.120
Is that how we run?

53:25.120 --> 53:28.880
Our corporations, is this how we run our universities?

53:28.880 --> 53:30.360
By beating people up?

53:30.360 --> 53:32.400
I mean, what do you create them in set?

53:32.400 --> 53:34.040
Give them incentives.

53:34.040 --> 53:37.880
OK, so I said I said what their incentives have been.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.560
I have a show that I'm fortunate I can't share it

53:40.560 --> 53:42.680
right on the screen.

53:42.680 --> 53:48.040
The data from 1948 to 2018 productivity

53:48.040 --> 53:58.080
has increased to a 253% hourly compensation for workers

53:58.080 --> 54:02.520
increased 115%.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.000
Where did that gap go?

54:04.000 --> 54:07.840
It went to corporations in the top 1%.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.600
OK, so that's it.

54:09.600 --> 54:14.760
The other thing I find very funny is you, Nicholas,

54:14.760 --> 54:17.240
rightly started off with the crisis of education

54:17.240 --> 54:20.160
and the idea that we didn't want to give students things

54:20.160 --> 54:21.720
they didn't earn.

54:21.720 --> 54:25.240
And as you know, incentives and disincentives

54:25.240 --> 54:27.800
are two sides of the same coin.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.680
And this is one thing I've really discovered

54:29.680 --> 54:31.200
in the work on shame and honor.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.840
And to tack on to Bob's point about California,

54:34.840 --> 54:38.560
California also has an issue with delinquent taxpayers.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.760
And it turns out, of course, that the rich, when they're not

54:41.760 --> 54:45.600
paying their income taxes, have a greater effect

54:45.600 --> 54:47.960
on the tax deficit than the poor.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.000
That's the nature of taxes.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.640
And rather than introduce a policy

54:52.640 --> 54:55.240
where they decided to expose everyone who

54:55.240 --> 55:00.440
hadn't paid their taxes, which felt potentially, well,

55:00.440 --> 55:04.160
I guess unjust and also maybe wouldn't use attention

55:04.160 --> 55:06.760
in the best way, they introduced a policy

55:06.760 --> 55:11.760
where they only threatened to shame the top 500 tax

55:11.760 --> 55:13.600
delinquents in the state.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.160
They initially thought they might make the money back

55:16.160 --> 55:16.880
on the policy.

55:16.880 --> 55:20.640
It costs about $180,000 a year to employ people

55:20.640 --> 55:24.560
to manage these lists and to send out the letters

55:24.560 --> 55:27.360
and to potentially publish the names online.

55:27.360 --> 55:30.920
And they've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars

55:30.920 --> 55:35.920
in back taxes through a threat of a disincentive, which

55:35.920 --> 55:38.520
is to just expose your name.

55:38.520 --> 55:43.720
It's just reputation, and it costs very little.

55:43.720 --> 55:46.680
And you ask, well, why disincentives?

55:46.680 --> 55:48.160
What happened to the incentive?

55:48.160 --> 55:51.600
Well, what we're going to honor people who pay their taxes?

55:51.600 --> 55:54.600
It all depends on the norm, right?

55:54.600 --> 55:58.360
We're going to honor people who write the best album of the year

55:58.360 --> 56:00.520
or make the best movie of the year.

56:00.520 --> 56:05.520
But when you're dealing with delinquent taxpayers,

56:05.520 --> 56:08.760
disincentives are really the only option in the system.

56:08.760 --> 56:14.280
There is not an incentive mirror in that kind of social problem.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.320
The thing is that no one's given Nicholas an opportunity

56:16.320 --> 56:20.200
to express how there might be a positive incentive.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.240
In this scenario of providing equity to workers,

56:23.240 --> 56:27.160
I just wonder what you thought about that.

56:27.160 --> 56:27.880
Sure.

56:27.880 --> 56:32.320
I mean, the standard, the way in which the government provides

56:32.320 --> 56:35.640
incentives is through taxation.

56:35.640 --> 56:39.520
So if you did, for example, it went to Amazon and said,

56:39.520 --> 56:41.640
well, we'll tax you a bit less.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.240
Or for this particular shares that you're

56:44.240 --> 56:48.280
going to transfer to workers or potentially transfer to workers,

56:48.280 --> 56:53.400
offer them to workers besides their regular compensation.

56:53.400 --> 56:54.800
That could work, right?

56:54.800 --> 56:58.880
I mean, that could create an incentive for any corporation

56:58.880 --> 57:03.120
to say, now from now on, from 2022,

57:03.120 --> 57:07.120
we're going to hire people and not just pay them $20 an hour,

57:07.120 --> 57:10.120
but we're going to also give them some percentage

57:10.120 --> 57:13.040
of the corporation so that we'll have in the future

57:13.040 --> 57:14.800
some percentage of the profits.

57:14.800 --> 57:17.560
You can even give it in a different way

57:17.560 --> 57:19.360
in which you can loan them the shares

57:19.360 --> 57:21.160
so they can get some percentage of the profits.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.080
There are ways to do these things,

57:23.080 --> 57:25.280
but they're not clobbering the rich.

57:25.280 --> 57:31.160
This is a way to figure out a way so that self-driven interest

57:31.160 --> 57:33.520
of these guys who manage these companies

57:33.520 --> 57:38.480
would create a more just society in the future

57:38.480 --> 57:41.320
and through using positive incentives.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.520
I think that's important.

57:42.520 --> 57:46.160
I think that's a way in my experience in life, maybe not

57:46.160 --> 57:47.800
yours, but in my experience in life,

57:47.800 --> 57:52.040
people respond much more positively, much more easily

57:52.040 --> 57:53.960
and positive to positive incentives

57:53.960 --> 57:56.800
than negative incentives.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.040
Let me just jump in one more time.

57:58.040 --> 58:00.560
I wondered though, Nicholas, if you think

58:00.560 --> 58:04.640
that clobbering the rich isn't a good idea

58:04.640 --> 58:07.720
because it's too severe of punishment

58:07.720 --> 58:10.080
or it's too negative for them to tolerate

58:10.080 --> 58:14.880
or whether it just provides the public

58:14.880 --> 58:20.160
with a negative view of capital.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.080
Well, I mean, I won't go into the sociology kind of issue.

58:23.080 --> 58:30.320
So why this thing might be bad for psychologically or socially?

58:30.320 --> 58:34.720
But I want to say it from only purely economic point of view,

58:34.720 --> 58:38.080
if you take $20 billion away from Bezos,

58:38.080 --> 58:41.800
you are not taking it away from his consumption, right?

58:41.800 --> 58:44.960
You're not restricting them from buying a great house

58:44.960 --> 58:48.080
or a great yacht or whatever.

58:48.080 --> 58:51.760
You are taking it away from investment, OK?

58:51.760 --> 58:53.480
That money was going to investment,

58:53.480 --> 58:56.120
and now it's going to the government.

58:56.120 --> 58:59.280
And we will see if the government actually invested

58:59.280 --> 59:03.280
or let's say invest 30% of it and give the way

59:03.280 --> 59:06.640
to the voters, the remaining part.

59:06.640 --> 59:10.640
So that's important because that says

59:10.640 --> 59:16.520
that we are changing the investment

59:16.520 --> 59:18.880
to consumption ratio in the country.

59:18.880 --> 59:20.840
And we need investment.

59:20.840 --> 59:25.120
That's why I said you should be careful about taking away

59:25.120 --> 59:28.880
this money because the way politicians have presented it,

59:28.880 --> 59:31.440
it's as if it's just free.

59:31.440 --> 59:34.040
There is no bad consequences of it.

59:34.040 --> 59:37.440
How can it be bad to take $20 billion from Bezos?

59:37.440 --> 59:40.000
And I have nothing to do with Bezos and Amazon, by the way.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.920
Just I'm not an anyway concerned.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.800
But how can it be bad?

59:44.800 --> 59:46.600
People don't even think about it,

59:46.600 --> 59:49.960
but it has significant negative consequences,

59:49.960 --> 59:51.320
at least in my opinion.

59:51.320 --> 59:54.400
So we can think of other ways in which we can,

59:54.400 --> 59:57.880
if we need money to finance ourselves,

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.480
I mean, when we can create more investment,

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.880
we can think about it.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.360
In my opinion, it would make more sense

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.280
to give money to the private sector

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.920
to do investments rather than the public sector

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.680
because traditionally the public sector

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.120
doesn't reduce as good results as the private sector.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.720
And I think that is, in general,

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.680
we've understood in the United States.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.640
I mean, we don't try, we don't see the United States

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.920
try to make its own fighter planes.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.080
They don't, they just try to give the contracts

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.480
to the private sector and in many, many, many other dimensions.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.800
So, I don't know, in other countries,

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.120
it's possible in Cuba, things happen differently.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.880
It's possible in China, things happen differently.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.040
It's possible in Russia, things happen differently,

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.480
but not in the United States.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.240
So, given the environment we live in,

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.080
we should think of ways to tweak it in the right direction

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.200
rather than in the wrong direction.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.840
I mean, my students are usually shocked

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.760
when I tell them that in the 1970s,

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.560
the top marginal tax rate was 70%.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.560
And somehow that didn't prevent the economy

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.640
from being productive and inefficient.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.400
And it didn't forestall abroad.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.000
And I looked at Build Back Better,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.440
which is now stalled in the Senate.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.040
And Build Back Better isn't about massive tax increases.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.440
It's about spending what?

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.680
Maybe one or two percent of national income

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.160
to address some critical problems relating to education

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.400
and social justice and also decarbonization.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.360
And markets aren't going to get that those jobs done

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.760
are working on their own.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.640
Market failures have caused those problems.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.960
And a male distribution of wealth

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.880
has contributed to those problems, including.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.120
So I look at public schools and I'm very concerned

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.480
about the inequality that we see in education

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.000
between people in privileged communities

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.160
like the town that I live in and I'm an amateur.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.000
And then I look at poor black and brown communities

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.560
because they don't have good schools

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.440
and they don't have good public services.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.320
And we need to invest in those people,

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.880
not just for the sake of us communities,

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.840
not just for the sake of social justice,

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.040
but also because that's human capital

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.160
and that's where our nation's future lies.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.240
Richard, you could mention also that in Build Back Better,

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.160
the final version that was blocked by two senators.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.880
It also, what they gutted out provision to tax rich

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.600
because of a few Wall Street inclined Democrats

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.560
that got that removed.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.800
And not only, remember under Eisenhower,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.280
the top marginal rate was over 90%.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.200
That's true.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.040
Yeah.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.440
And matter of fact, the latest issue of the nation

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.680
has a proposal to bring that marginal rate back.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.680
Nevertheless, even with that marginal rate,

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.640
and I've looked into tax issues in DC,

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.760
but even with that marginal, high marginal rate,

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.520
the effective tax rate that they're very wealthy

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.360
were paying was like 40%,

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.440
because of loopholes and so on.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.320
We need to address that.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.840
But my question to Nicholas is,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.840
why should we trust the billionaires

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.240
that own these companies to make the right decisions

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.840
about investment?

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.560
Where should it go?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.000
Why shouldn't that decision be socially determined

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.800
rather than by billionaires?

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.800
And I would take a lesson from the movie, Don't Look Up.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.040
Okay, to me, as a climate scientist,

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.040
that message was that obviously it was about

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.600
the threat of climate catastrophe,

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.120
not really about a asteroid.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.400
And secondly, the message was,

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:06.400
if we trust the billionaire solution will be doomed.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.600
That was, if you watch the movie,

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.240
that's what it ended up.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.440
And I think that was a very good prescription

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:18.000
about what we should do,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.920
actually, because I believe the world is overpopulated.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.720
Even one billionaire has won too many.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:31.720
I wondered, because just before Nicholas takes a shot at that,

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.720
I mean, the term neoliberal was used earlier.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.520
And I wondered if anyone wants to offer

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.720
a kind of a definition of what that means.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.320
And maybe, yeah.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.560
But what we tell our students is that it needs

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:50.800
a transition from more public provisioning

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.200
and a public having a mixed economy

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.120
with the government and markets.

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.760
And it means the focus on market liberalization

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:03.360
and then a transfer also political power from the people,

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.480
from the public, to an entanglement

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.240
between corporate interests and the political interests.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.440
Now, that's contentious.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.240
I teach in a department where I'm an economist,

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.480
but my colleagues are human geographers.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:27.480
I think what I just said is roughly what they would say.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.840
If you want me to reply,

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.640
I mean, I don't want to reply about the names.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.200
I mean, people call names curses all the time.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.000
I'm not going to get pigeonholed to a particular name.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.840
I'm telling you the positions.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.720
I'm telling you, I'm trying to argue seriously

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.920
about what I think needs to be done.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.640
If you want to argue seriously too,

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.920
you can find a way to talk about the reasons

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.920
why this is not right or this is right.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.080
It's just saying, oh, we have too many billionaires,

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:56.360
let's execute them and so on.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:58.200
I mean, that's a childist.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.040
Come on.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:03.600
I mean, seriously, I think that there is a serious issue,

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.880
very serious, and we have opened at least three or four

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.640
that we need to argue on to talk about them.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.720
I mean, and I don't think that characterizations

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.800
make any difference, in my opinion.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.360
I mean, I don't want to talk about it.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.400
I think it would be useful though,

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.600
to not view proposals to raise the progressivity of the taxes

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:31.120
somehow a moral indictment of the rich or a statement

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.960
that we're out to get them.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.800
My effective tax rate, I've learned from my accountant,

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.600
is over 30%.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.000
Jeff Bezos pays next to nothing in tax.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.280
I think when he thinks about investment,

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.320
if he were taxed more heavily, the way we teach investment

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.480
is that if the rate of return on an investment is 6%,

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.600
and you can borrow money at 5%, then you ought to do it.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.520
You invest if the rate of return is greater

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.000
than your cost of capital.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.280
We don't, in any part of that module, teach them,

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.720
look at your wealth balance and decide whether to invest.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.840
Maybe that would influence your attitude toward risk.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.560
But I can't imagine that's going to be a factor for Bezos.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.240
So taxing his wealth will not change the projects

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.960
he finds it profitable to invest in.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.360
That's not one of the things that's on the table.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.320
Maybe if he had a little less wealth,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.560
he wouldn't be as quick to spend money on a rocket ship

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.720
to take a thrill ride into space.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.440
That's possible.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.560
It's easier for me to imagine that response

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.200
than that he would back away from an otherwise profitable

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.440
investment.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.080
But let's go back to the issue.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.000
What am I saying?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.400
Why am I saying it he will invest less?

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:53.880
Because the government will take away this money, OK, for sure.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.080
And that's the money that are being presently invested

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.320
in whatever way.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.960
I mean, I'm not even going to argue

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.200
that there are all that there is he's investing them

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200
in the right way.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.960
But he's invested somewhere.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.240
Maybe he's invested in whatever activities Amazon does.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.400
So this money is invested.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.480
Now the government is going to take it.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.320
But the government has mixed incentives.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.960
I said it before.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:21.280
The government has run by politicians

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.440
who want to be reelected.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:28.080
And that creates an incentive not to invest whatever 20 billion

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.960
they got from Bezos.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.760
But to use a significant part of it

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.320
in giving it to the voters, giving it

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.160
to the people who are going to get you reelected.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.480
Or in your theories, some of you said,

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.200
or giving it to the corporations that will get you reelected.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.280
You said this, not me, OK?

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.280
But either way, the incentives are not OK anymore.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.720
The money is taken away from the US economy

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.520
and is given to consumption.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.440
Or some significant part of it given to consumption.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.160
And that's about that.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.800
Now I said that with Build Back Better,

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.000
a lot of the investment is in kids.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.160
And it's here, the end gets in schools.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.280
And those are investments in human capital

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:14.720
and human capital is a productive asset that we need more on.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.440
And those are investments that have high returns.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:21.320
I mean, we know that they have really high returns.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.120
The other thing that to bring it back to climate change,

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.520
I think, is to think a little bit about the investments that

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.600
have been made over the last three or four decades

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.160
in renewable energy.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.920
And one thing that is upsetting to me

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.560
is that the people analyzing what

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.040
this effect has had on the economy and certainly

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.120
on the energy system and on the climate system

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.440
are sociologists, not economists.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.520
They don't seem to compel to dig into these data.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.760
But the data show, of course, that it is not

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.680
a one-to-one substitution that, in fact, there

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.360
is more fossil fuel being used.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.280
This is, in some ways, complementary and not

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.280
a substitute to the existing fossil fuel use, which

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.920
suggests that the economic theory that, oh, you build it,

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.200
they will come, it will substitute whether or not it's,

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.040
and we see this across so many other products too,

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.320
in aquaculture or something else I study,

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.480
it's been complementary to capture fisheries.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.640
It has not been a substitution for it, renewable energy

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.840
and fossil fuels.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.520
And it's sort of endless, the way in which, again,

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.640
the foundational economic theory has been undermined

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.360
by the empirics.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.600
But it speaks, again, to this idea of incentives

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.280
versus disincentives and the point I brought up very early

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.800
in the conversation about divestment,

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:50.520
that investment sometimes has to be coupled with divestment

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:55.800
and divestment being a voyage as well to a kind

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.680
of stigmatization of fossil fuels, not just an economic lever

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.640
and understanding there's a reputation even to the product

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.800
itself.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.680
And it's something, again, that I feel economists do not

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:09.640
want to engage on.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.360
They want to talk about the market.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.720
They don't want to talk about the reputation even

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.040
of the product, even though they're

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.240
perfectly willing to talk about the reputation of brands,

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.080
as you know, Bob.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.520
We're going to soon, I'm sorry, open up.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.800
And I'm not cutting the conversation off yet,

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.320
but I wanted to ask in any kind of negotiation

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.160
when there's different viewpoints and parties,

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.960
there's this first effort to say, well,

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.360
what do we share in common?

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.880
Like, what can we all agree would be reasonable?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.720
And I have to think that he's given the way

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.680
the conversation is going on.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.520
The question might be posed.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.120
What are the things that, via incentives,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.680
the government, which will come from the government,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.400
the government should be involved in trying

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.800
to affect the economy?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.920
What are legitimate goals that the government can get

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.680
involved with?

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.880
Within incentives, whether or not

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.080
their taxes or the subsidies or whatever they may be.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.440
Following up on what Jerry said, I

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:08.920
think it will be good because move also a little bit

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.920
and look at the future, what you see happening,

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.560
and what you think is possible to happen as we look

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.960
at the future in the next 10, 20 years in terms

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.480
of climate change and so on.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.520
Let me add a couple of cents on that one,

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:31.680
because I think we need to not only promote a Green New Deal

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.160
in the US, but a global Green New Deal.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.920
And there have been many proposals out there.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.480
I think Bernie Sanders' Green New Deal

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:49.520
was probably the best that's been put out in the mainstream

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.120
and because it also includes a cut in the military budget.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.160
A rather modest cut in the military budget.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.120
But that was a robust Green New Deal

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.640
that would really have an impact on what

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:10.920
Jennifer's referring to to curb fossil fuel consumption

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.080
while renewable energy is being built.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.800
Robust Green, of course, the global south

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.680
needs the most investment there in terms

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:25.600
of renewable energy, which is definitely related

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.040
to the energy, the fact that most of humanity suffers

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:37.400
from energy poverty, because most people in the world

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.520
don't have enough energy consumption in their nation

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.160
to live to the highest life expectancy.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.440
You can find out more in our book, The Earth is Not the Sale

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.600
on that issue.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.120
But the global Green New Deal for it to be a success

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.880
will require demilitarization of the global economy

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.720
because that's another area where we have a huge waste

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.320
of $2 trillion a year in expenditures.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.840
So in addition to the $5.6 trillion

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:17.400
going to fossil fuel subsidies, direct and indirect,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.120
we have that too.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:24.160
And so that would be what I see as the hope

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:29.600
for any chance of needing the one and a half degree warming

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.240
limit of the IPCC and creating a better life

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.920
for everyone in the world at the same time.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.200
So that will be my final intervention.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:50.440
Can I say something about a point that Jacqueline made?

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.880
I think some economists are sympathetic

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.880
to what you do.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.800
Certainly the message of much of what

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.280
you've written about, I take to be this, which

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.520
is that public policy levers that we have,

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:09.000
the traditional ones that we've been talking about

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.880
for the two centuries that there's even

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.720
been a field called economics, are actually much, much more

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.920
powerful than we even imagined them to be.

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.920
And I think the example that really

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.520
drive that point home for me was the taxes we started

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:28.920
imposing on smoking.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.600
We didn't do that really at any significant degree

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.720
until we saw studies coming out of Japan

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.200
showing that secondhand smoke exposure caused illnesses

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.400
in others.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.920
Those lakes are actually fairly weak.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.560
You don't harm others very much with your secondhand smoke.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.920
But that was the excuse we felt we needed

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.240
to start discouraging people from smoking.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:57.840
We didn't want to say we want to protect you from yourself.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.280
We want to say it's legitimate to tax you

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.880
because you're harming others.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.560
It turns out that the real harm you caused others when you

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.480
smoke is not from your secondhand smoke.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:13.760
It's by making others in your circle more likely to smoke.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.560
We take our cues to a much greater degree

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:21.760
than I think most of us realize by what people around us do.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.640
I started smoking when I was 14 because most of my friends

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.160
smoked.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.680
I'm grateful to have quit a few years later.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.200
Most people don't manage to quit.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.640
They're stuck for the rest of their lives.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.400
And a friend who had been a smoker and also a heroin user

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.000
told me that it was much harder for him to quit smoking

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.640
than it was for him to quit heroin.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.200
So perhaps the most addictive substance we know of.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.120
And the reason the taxes worked, they

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.960
didn't work very well at first.

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.200
If you're a smoker, you're going to keep on smoking.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.360
You'll just buy less of something else

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.120
when they tax your cigarettes.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.520
The reason it worked is that some people quit

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.440
and others didn't start.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.600
Maybe the ones with the least money in the first place

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.480
didn't start.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:13.560
That meant each and every peer group had fewer smokers in it.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.880
That meant everyone else in those groups

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.800
were less likely to start or remain smoking.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.280
And over time, there's just no other way

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.960
to account for how we went from a smoking rate

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.120
among adults of over half to what it is today, 13%.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.760
Nobody says, oh, that's horrible.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760
We shouldn't have done that.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.960
Everybody says, thank goodness we took that step.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.840
And there are steps like that to be

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.080
taken in domain after domain.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.840
Many of them in the climate.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:46.400
We could change energy use patterns in a dramatic way

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.600
just by some gentle shifting of incentives

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.800
and let people influence one another

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.920
to carry the ball the rest of the way home.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.640
Jennifer, Richard, Nick, any other thoughts?

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.280
Well, you asked if there are things we agree on.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.960
I agree strongly on incentives.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.760
I think it's important, though, it's

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.520
a form that says achieve beliefs in markets, markets

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:14.800
with rules.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.840
And I think what I would say is that many of the problems

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:22.160
that we have to do with having written rules that were

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.240
pursued by red seekers that have facilitated red capture

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.080
at the expense of investment in innovation.

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.680
So I'm not anti-billionaire.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.040
I'm not anti-market.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.840
I think we need to work on making markets work more efficiently

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.880
and making our economy more innovative again.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.720
And that means balancing in some of the most

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.640
important investments really has to be done by public sector

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.880
because they're public goods.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.360
Yeah, I would say that it will be very useful

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.640
to create positive incentives to reduce consumption.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.600
So in different types of consumption of energy

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.840
at home, consumption of energy in the cars, and so on.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.200
And additionally, at least in my opinion,

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.120
it's important for whatever major investment

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.960
it's going to happen in production

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:34.840
to also give incentives to individuals and companies

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.440
to go in that direction.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.560
I don't think I can agree with the idea

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.560
that the major investment should happen,

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.600
but the government, as I said before,

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:48.880
the government has terrible results in terms of productivity

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.080
compared to the public sector.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.080
And we shouldn't really go with major investments

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.280
in that direction if we can actually

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:03.280
do them in the private sector by tweaking the incentives.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.120
So at least that's my approach.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.040
I'm not saying that there are areas

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:16.240
in which the public, the government shouldn't be involved.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:20.760
I'm saying that the lion shares of the investment

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.080
should be geared towards the private sector doing them.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.360
And we can fix the right incentives,

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:30.600
and I don't think we have disagreements among ourselves

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:32.680
that there is a way to fix incentives

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.280
so that money pours in the direction we want them to pour.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.320
Yeah, I agree with that, in part,

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.360
and I'll just say schools are an investment.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.200
I think hospitals and public health care is an investment.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.120
And we spend 17% of US national income on the health care

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.040
sector, and that's about twice as much as other industrialized

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.080
countries, and we have worse life expectancy.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.760
And that's an example where we're spending more than we should

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.560
be to get an outcome that we don't like very much.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.920
And that's the product of a whole bunch with misaligned incentives

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.000
that were structured to facilitate red capture.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.720
Glad I put this part on getting red capture and monopoly

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:17.280
power out of the economy.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.760
I think that's it.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:22.520
And that would help with the political problems that we have.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.400
And I think another thing that would help

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.480
is really to challenge what economists tell us

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.720
are the variables that we have to pay attention to.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.200
We have to pay attention to parts per million.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.960
We have to pay attention to the extinction rates of species.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.640
We have to pay attention to flourishing, as Bob said.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.960
These are not captured by productivity or GDP or return

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.960
on investment or any of these variables

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.400
that economists want to constantly bring us back

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.560
to as the fundamentals to the economy.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.480
And that is why I think it's hard to be someone like Rich,

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.520
where you are an economist with broad sweeping values

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.440
because you're kind of stuck.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.040
And that's why I left economics to go

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.040
to a Department of Environmental Studies,

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.040
where I felt like I could set the terms of the kind of future

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.880
I wanted without being hemmed into the ideology, which

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:25.480
is not a science of the foundations of economics.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.960
I'll say that I'm a professor of Environmental Studies.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.280
My work is at the interfaces between economics, governance,

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:37.040
political ecology, environmental sciences.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.840
So I'm sitting in a very interdisciplinary space

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.600
to try to figure out how this discipline of economics

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.040
can we need to get that part of that right?

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.280
Hold on, everybody.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.280
Hold on, Nicholas, please, hold on.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.280
Yeah, go ahead.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:53.880
It's pretty fine.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.520
I think that on this issue of what

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.120
economy space attention to, I mean,

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.800
I think that there is, economics has a pretty wide set of tools.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.200
And if there was a way, and if there is a way

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.880
to take it to account a lot of stuff

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.400
that Jennifer says, some young assistant professor

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.000
would write a great paper and get it published

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.640
and get tenure based on that.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:22.680
So I don't think that it's you should preclude the idea

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.360
that in the whole field as wide as this, as economics is,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.560
with the collection of tools and then using some assumptions

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:36.720
and getting certain conclusions, that somehow the majority

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.080
of economists who presses the rest of the economy

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.240
so they cannot really write something

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.120
really interesting in that dimension.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.000
I mean, I cannot believe that.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.920
I mean, I've seen people in my lifetime

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.960
in the economics world write some very radical stuff

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.520
and get tenure based on that.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.400
So I wouldn't agree that we are, you know,

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.040
that not so open as it's being presented.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.120
All right, so I want to add that.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.920
I'm not talking about getting tenure.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.800
I'm talking about controlling the public conversation.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.920
I'm talking about being in the White House.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:15.200
I'm talking about having power.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:19.160
And those people can get tenure, but they have not been

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.120
the right hand man for the president.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.680
Look, I mean, economists don't run the world.

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.000
That's for sure.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.320
I mean, like Harry Truman said,

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:28.760
the economists come to me and say,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.960
on the one hand this and on the other hand this,

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.640
that's why I hate economists.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:35.960
The politicians run the world, not us, okay?

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.440
So if you want to make political change,

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.920
you can make political change,

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.440
but it's not up to the economists

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.880
to make the political change.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.720
I think it's up to you and me as citizens to make the political.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.320
All right, so now I do want to step in here finally.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:51.160
This is wonderful.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.280
I think actually this conversation.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.680
We have some questions I know from our viewing audience

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.680
and Alex will sign in here and give us some of those questions

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.080
and you can all take a shot at responding to.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.120
Yeah, so I guess everyone watching on Zoom and on YouTube,

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.440
please write your questions and their respective spots

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.640
and I'll get to them.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.320
So let's click, okay.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.240
Let's see.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.480
I'll start with,

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.640
Reisa Mandel wrote this really early on.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:24.240
And so they wrote, I guess, thank you for the question, Reisa.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.240
They wrote, does innovation have to implicate growth,

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.040
which they believe is a fetish and driver

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.840
of ecological degradation?

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.160
I'll take your questions.

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.720
Go ahead.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.480
I just wanted to clarify the questions.

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480
Innovation.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.920
I guess that this innovation have to implicate growth,

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:51.920
I guess, like, do they have to imply growth?

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.680
Or evolve it or yeah.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:56.000
You have very innovative energy policies

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.680
that decarbonize the economy.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.240
But I will say one thing is that,

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:02.080
having been trained as an energy economist,

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.560
we knew in the early 1980s or early 1990s,

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.000
we could decarbonize the economy

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.760
by paying about one or two percent of GDP

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.120
for some decades and that they wouldn't have

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.400
very much impact on the rate of growth.

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.520
And so this idea that growth and environmental

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.680
conservation are incompatible,

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.800
I don't think that works empirically.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.720
And there are people that do think that works empirically.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.040
But in one or two percent of GDP,

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.280
you don't pay that unless you're gonna get a return

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.840
on that investment in climate capital.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:37.360
So that's not, those resources are real,

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.240
but I don't think there's a tradeoff really

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.960
between growth and the environment,

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.320
like they go hand in hand.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.600
And actually, the same one more thing.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.120
The US spends about 3% of national income

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.120
on environmental compliance,

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.000
mostly because of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.960
And the benefits to society are much greater than 3%.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.560
Yeah, I'd go one step further, Richard.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.960
There are a lot of people in the environmental movement

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.520
who say we've got to somehow accept the idea

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.000
that growth is a bad thing

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.360
and that we've got to be prepared to live without growth.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.360
I think that's wrong-headed because it's growth

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.280
in certain kinds of things that are harmful.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.760
There are lots of things that we can have more of

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.000
with not only no harm to anyone else,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.360
but with benefits, yeah, if we plant ornamental trees

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:31.240
around our house, that doesn't harm the environment.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.760
It gives pleasure to the neighbors walking by.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.440
I mean, my wife takes piano lessons.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:38.800
There's no environmental harm from that.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.800
There's all sorts of things that we spend our income on

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.360
that don't cause any harm to anyone else

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.800
and often create external benefits for other people.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.880
And what we know, and there's good work on this,

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.280
is that when we don't grow, when the economy grows slowly,

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.640
we're much less likely to make important public investments.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.040
We're much less likely to take steps

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:07.400
to increase social justice of various kinds.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.080
We start raining in and becoming much more stingy

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.040
in the public sphere when there's a low growth rate.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.320
So I think growth is a positive-

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.920
Going to your point, Rit, to a point, Rob,

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.920
that the GDP or GNP has been critiqued by degrowthers.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:33.800
And I share it on the chat my critique of great degrowth

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.800
because it doesn't, this GDP as many have already written about,

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.120
for the common good, daily and calm,

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.120
that you need to look at what the components of growth are,

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.680
as you just pointed out.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.000
So there's bad growth and good growth.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.120
I would submit that the growth

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:02.200
of the military industrial complex in the fence,

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.840
but is bad growth.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:09.000
The growth of renewable energy and affordable housing

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.400
and ecological agriculture would be good growth.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.560
So we need to deconstruct what the growth is.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.560
And therefore, I am, I recognize the contribution

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.560
of the degrowth discourse that has positive implications,

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.680
but many of them fail to do this deconstruction

01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.880
of what growth is.

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:45.880
And so that's my two cents.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.280
Next question.

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.040
Okay.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.680
Risa, I think wanted to hear Nicholas's viewpoint,

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.560
given I guess the perceived perspective

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.040
that he's a neoliberal, so apologies.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.160
But if he wants anything to add to that,

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.680
just in case, if not, we could go on to the next question.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.600
If there wasn't anything that wasn't said

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.280
that he wants to add, if not, it's okay,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.280
going to the next question.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.160
I was just noting what Risa wanted to say

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.680
was directed towards Nick.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.600
I would say it's best not to try to pigeonhole people

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.280
and just argue on the specifics of the arguments.

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.240
That's all I'm going to say.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.880
I'm not going to talk about it.

01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:30.720
Okay. Okay.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.320
Oh, you reviewed it, Alex?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320
Yeah, sorry, I made it myself.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.640
All right.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.400
Next, we have Linda Martin.

01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.680
Thank you, Linda, Linda wrote.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.480
What fact do you know about narcissism

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.080
and how do you think it impacts income inequality?

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.080
Capitalism, government.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.280
Are you familiar with research

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.040
that has been done on the destructive impact

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.120
of narcissists on corporations?

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.440
And then they also add also on even your own fields

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.240
or the impact on business or government in general?

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:09.680
I'm concerned that in America

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.480
that we've landed on a blame culture

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.320
and we could review problems in society to someone else

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.120
or our outgroup rather than looking at what we as well

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.880
in our in-group can do to affect positive change.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:24.920
And that's more narcissistic.

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.520
But I mean, there's a difference

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.440
between taking ownership and responsibility

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.960
and the scheme of out-group politics

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.640
which I think is very corrosive.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.520
I'm not sure if that's a, is that a non-sequitur?

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.800
I mean, it's, I mean, that's related to narcissism in a way.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.680
The only paper I'm sure, Bob, you've read more

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.320
but because you study luxury markets

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.720
but on narcissism I read,

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.480
took Murray-Gell-Man, the physicist as its prime example.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:57.040
So I don't feel comfortable representing those views

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.000
completely because they were very unfamiliar to me.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.800
I mean, to the extent that you associate narcissism

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.440
with luxury consumption,

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.160
then the main consequence of it

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.160
is that it's simply wasteful that if you need

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.880
a diamond three times as big to express

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.520
a given level of commitment,

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.200
that's not really doing anybody any good

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.720
compared to a regime when all we're spending less

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.120
and express the same amount of commitment as before.

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:33.440
Okay.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.680
Alex, the next question.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.600
Okay.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.720
Next one.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.120
This is from Mel M.

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:42.960
Thank you, Mel.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.120
They wrote, what are the chances of Ray Dalio's worry

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:48.600
that inequality between the wealthy and the poor

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.600
could lead to a bloody revolution?

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.960
Is the current rise in populism on the left and the right

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.080
a sign this has already started?

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.440
I'll say, I've been able to say that I think

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.760
that our political divide in the United States

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.720
is at least in part the class divide.

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.720
And that healing the class divide,

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.720
I think it's gonna require fresh thinking

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.720
and some kind of realignment.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.720
And I would like to, I mean, this is a political statement,

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.720
but I would like to see the Democrats think a little more

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:25.720
about the demos and about creating an inclusive,

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.720
an America that's inclusive of all people.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.720
And that probably means focusing on rebuilding,

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.720
rebuilding the working and middle class.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:40.720
Interesting, that was exactly Bernie Sanders' advice

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.720
in an interview around the Guardian.

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.720
So you made the same point.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.720
I do read the Guardian.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.720
But yeah.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.720
Can I ask that question?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.720
I mean, why do you think that the political divide

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.720
is a class divide when we see some of the wealthiest people

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.720
in the United States supporting very left-wing

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.720
points of view?

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.720
Well, what they support that's left-wing are our cultural values.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.720
It's not about how we organize the economy.

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.720
And so we shifted from a debate over economics and class

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.720
to a coded debate that's about quote unquote

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.720
traditional values versus, you know,

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:27.720
what term should I use here?

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:30.720
I mean, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.720
the other side of the culture of wars.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.720
And I don't want to put a label on that because labels,

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.720
we need to be very careful of that as you said.

01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.720
But I do think that it's become, you know,

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:44.720
there's a, there's, it's also that not, not just income,

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.720
but it's about education.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:48.720
And so what really marks this best of why it's about

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.720
educational status or educational attainment.

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.720
That's at least partly what I read in the Guardian and other

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.720
blists.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.720
I'm not sure.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:00.720
I mean, I, I, I, in the general statement about political divide

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:04.720
being class divide, we have seen Bill Gates or in Buffett come

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.720
out and say, we really want to be taxed more.

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720
Okay.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.720
Right.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.720
I mean, and these are some of the wealthiest people in the United

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.720
States, correct?

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.720
Yes.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:16.720
So that's, that's, that's fair.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:18.720
I'm not calling for a class war.

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:21.720
I mean, I, but I do think that we need an economy that's more

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.720
inclusive.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.720
And I look at the, that the Rust Belt from Milwaukee all the way

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:29.720
over to Rochester, New York, maybe even Detroit, New York.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.720
And I see a part of the country that has to struggle for the last

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.720
four years since the, since the Paul Volcker interest rate hike.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.720
And then when the manufacturing went downhill and for that

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:43.720
country, for that part of the country to do better, it seems

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:47.720
that we need some form of regional economic development and

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720
industrial policy.

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.720
And, you know, I'm not an expert on that, but that's, that's,

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:55.720
I'm inclined to think that, that would help our politics.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:36:02.720
I am adding to the chat a great book on the red last year on

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.720
billionaires and stealth politics because part of this also is

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720
about reputation.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720
So Bill Gates gets a lot of attention for that.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:14.720
Soros gets a lot of attention, but the vast majority of

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.720
billionaire wealth actually is going to support Republican

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.720
candidates.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.720
And this was a great empirical treatise on that point.

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.720
I just want to read the next question.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.720
Yes, I'll go on the next one.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.720
I'm trying to make sure I got everyone.

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.720
There was one in the chat.

01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.720
Okay.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.720
Okay.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.720
So let's see.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.720
I have two more for now.

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.720
So this was from Gregory Burke from YouTube.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.720
They wrote, why do we obsess about GDP when it does not include

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.720
health, education, or general well-being?

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:57.720
I think it was a point Jennifer major a little bit earlier.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.720
You started talking about.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720
Okay.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720
Did anybody want to ask?

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:10.720
How can we get the chat record because, uh,

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.720
can you give us a copy of the chat because it's a very interesting

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.720
post there.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.720
Jennifer's post and, uh, no, I'm collecting the,

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:25.720
I'm collecting URLs and I could post it as a comment on the

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:27.720
website, uh, a later.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:29.720
So I could get, I could do that.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.720
Yes.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.720
So is there, is there anything more you'd like to add to that?

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.720
I could go on, or I could go on to the next question.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:36.720
If you feel it hasn't been, if you feel it's been.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.720
Well, just so what, what matters as well being and then the

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:43.720
production of market goods and services plus governance services,

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.720
I mean, measure that we call that GDP, but there are other things

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.720
that contribute importantly to GDP.

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:51.720
And we also know that in, well,

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.720
in an affluent countries that that GDP growth doesn't really increase

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.720
average well being very much.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.720
Um, and so we should stop using GDP as a, as a,

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:06.720
as a metric of, of the good society.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:09.720
But what I would agree though, with the market stand and probably

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:13.720
with, with, with Nicholas, but economic growth is a means.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:17.720
If we use the means of growth to support the right ends.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:22.720
Maybe Bob wants to talk about Nepal's, um,

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.720
view of GDP growth, national happiness.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:27.720
Yeah.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.720
Yeah, it's actually Bhutan that is taking the.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:34.720
On that, the, the, they have what they call the gross national

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.720
happiness index and they measure their progress according to

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.720
movements in it rather than movements in GDP.

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.720
And I think there's a, there's a case to be made for that.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:48.720
Certainly focusing only on the dollar value of the stuff we can

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:54.720
buy leaves out a whole longer list of things we know we care about.

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.720
And so, uh, I mean, even, even just counting the fact that we're

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.720
depleting resources, uh, to produce this GDP, we don't take any

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:07.720
account of that, which seems like an odd thing to leave out.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:13.720
If you burn up, uh, billions of dollars of resources producing, uh,

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.720
an annual GDP, and it's barely more than that.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.720
You're not really, uh, adding much to the picture.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:22.720
If you're doing that. And, and the.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.720
There's a long list of things that we know that matter to people's

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.720
well being that aren't included at all in GDP.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.720
I mean, if you have time to do exercise every day, uh,

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:36.720
that makes people happier and healthier.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.720
There's good evidence on that.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.720
If people had six weeks of vacation a year, uh,

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.720
instead of one or two weeks, they would be happier and healthier.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.720
They're, they're hard data on that.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.720
So the fact is we don't measure those things.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:52.720
We could be.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:55.720
And we ought to.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:59.720
We would be more likely to pay attention to them if we met.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.720
Well, just put it in a comment.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.720
I'll put it in a comment for a few things.

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.720
Yeah.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.720
When it's, when it's the book with San and Stiglitz and Tusey that was

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.720
the report to the French government.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.720
Yes.

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.720
And that's outstanding.

01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:16.720
And that's two no-dell, laureate economists.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.720
And so if we think that the industry and economics is all over

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.720
the list about GDP, then that's an exception.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.720
And I'm also an admirer of Kate Rayworth's concept of the

01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.720
donut economy, which has planetary boundaries and living with

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.720
military limits, but also the social floor, which means meeting

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:37.720
people's basic needs and focusing on them flourishing or

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:43.720
thriving, rather than the opulence per se as the goal.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.720
On the point of the happiness index.

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:52.720
It should be, I actually discuss this in my last book, the global

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.720
solar commons.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:59.720
And the people of Bhutan don't live really that long, actually.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:06.720
So people can be happy with the assumed constraints, which may

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:10.720
be unconscious of what, of their society.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.720
You can, you know, you could be happy.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.720
Well, I'm not going to, you know, my parents didn't live more

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.720
than 70 years.

01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.720
So that's my expectation.

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.720
And you could be happy under those conditions.

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.720
So I think there's limits to the happiness index.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:34.720
If you want to apply this globally, you know, to what is really

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.720
possible to, for quality of life with people in the world, I

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:42.720
wouldn't go by the happiness index.

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.720
Or see me not only by.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:48.720
I think we have to think about wrapping up.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.720
Is there one more question when we're going to pose?

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:57.720
Yeah, I think the way, sorry, I was like, it was lost in the, in

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720
the chat.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:58.720
Well, okay.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.720
So, I mean, there's a few people talking about stock buybacks.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.720
We had Mel M again and then also Anthony Lobeir.

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.720
They're talking about stock buybacks.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720
I guess.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.720
Is there any comments anyone wants to make related to, like,

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:15.720
incentives to discourage stock buybacks or like what role stock

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.720
buybacks could play?

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.720
I guess in a relatively ethical manner or moral manner that fits

01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:22.720
in line with what everyone's been talking about today.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:25.720
Because that seems to be what people are sort of grasping at in

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.720
their comments about stock buybacks.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.720
I mean, maybe I'll say something about stock buybacks.

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.720
I don't, first of all, I don't see there's a crucial issue, but

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:45.720
I would be concerned as an economist about the, about

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:50.720
companies that are doing widespread stock buybacks because

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:56.720
essentially what, what they're saying is that we don't want to

01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.720
give this money to its dividends to shareholders, but we want

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.720
to just invest in ourselves more.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.720
I mean, I'm not sure that's the best strategy, but at the same

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.720
time, I don't really see as a, this is a big deal.

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.720
I mean, this is, we talked about a whole bunch of other problems

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:14.720
today.

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.720
I don't think that's a crucial one.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.720
As we are coming to ending, I just want everybody to know that

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:29.720
if they want to go on our website, there may be more comments.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.720
And if you want to respond to them on the website, you're

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.720
welcome.

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.720
Great.

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720
All right.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.720
Well, look, I want to really, Alex.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.720
Well, if you'll ask one question or if you want to close out

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:43.720
on fun with that too, I don't want to.

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:44.720
Go ahead.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.720
Oh, yeah.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:48.720
So I guess, um, I guess going back to the definition of

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.720
neoliberalism, it seems more oriented towards the market

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.720
liberalization side.

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:57.720
But do you think that overlooks that government spending has

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.720
gone up a lot in a bipartisan manner since about, you know,

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.720
Reagan, given the fact that usually when people talk about

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.720
neoliberalism, they talk about sort of the change in economic

01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.720
policy from Reagan and Thatcher on.

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:11.720
Because I mean, I'm looking, you know, the U.S.

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:15.720
print-up or capital basis does spend more on health insurance

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.720
and education compared to the OECD index.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.720
So like, do you think if we, like in the critiques of neoliberalism

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:27.720
by mostly saying it's a supply side, we tend to overlook some of

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.720
the more Keynesian issues that have common neoliberalism?

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
Because when I hear red syncing behavior and the corny

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.720
capitalistic complaints people make, that seems to be more of

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:41.720
an issue of the, um, where, like the points where government

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.720
and private industry mix together.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:47.720
So yeah, what do you have to say about those comments?

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.720
On the question of are spending more on health insurance?

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.720
It's true.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:58.720
We spend twice what the OECD countries spend on health insurance

01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:00.720
and we get way worse outcomes.

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.720
And you can hold a, I think, a variety of, of discussable views

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.720
about whether government is more efficient or the private sector

01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:10.720
is more efficient.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:16.720
But I think there are certain structures of markets under

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:21.720
which we know that pure private market incentives lead to bad

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:25.720
outcomes and I think health markets are exactly a case in

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:29.720
point of the adverse selection problem.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:35.720
You know, people hated the mandate in the Obamacare bill.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.720
They were all in favor of the idea that we require insurance

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:43.720
companies to sell us insurance at affordable rates, even if we

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:46.720
had pre-existing conditions, but they hated the mandate.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.720
And I could never have a, uh, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.720
a conversation that went anywhere with those people until quite

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.720
by accident one day I asked the question, what do you think

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:02.720
would happen if the government required home insurance companies

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:06.720
to sell fire insurance at affordable rates to people after

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:08.720
their houses had already burned down?

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:12.720
And, and thinking about that question, everybody got it right

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.720
away.

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.720
Well, the insurance companies would go bankrupt, of course.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:19.720
Well, the health insurance companies go bankrupt if they

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:22.720
have to sell health insurance at affordable rates.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.720
Even if you have a pre-existing condition, that's the guy who's

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.720
house has already burned down.

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.720
They can't insure you unless everybody's in the pool.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.720
Every other government just puts everybody in the pool.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.720
And they don't argue about it, but, you know, it's paid for out

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.720
of tax revenues.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:39.720
Uh, you're, you're insured, you're covered.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.720
We don't do that here.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:44.720
We've taken a small step toward doing it, but the, the history of

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:21.720
how we've done it in the past under reliance on the

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:48.720
government.

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:52.720
And so we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're

01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:56.720
we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,

01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:00.720
we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.720
relying strictly on private incentives thinking that the

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.720
private sector is always more efficient.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.720
It just has led us to this absolutely horrible outcome.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.720
And relying on relying on employer.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.720
Employed paid insurance.

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.720
Can be a burden on working people because of the very high.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:17.720
Very high benefits costs, which gives companies and in, in

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.720
the United States.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.720
And you can't leave your job.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.720
If that's how you get your insurance.

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.720
And that does not feel like freedom.

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.720
Yeah.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.720
Well, that's freedom.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:32.720
Freedom to do I sooner than our cohorts, wealthier cohorts that

01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:37.720
provide, you know, guaranteed health insurance for everyone.

01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:40.720
I think I think I think I think I think I think I think I think

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.720
what he is in the world and life expectancy now in the United

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:45.720
States.

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.720
But I think on the issues of, of, of the health system, they're

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:53.720
very, very serious issues of monopolization of certain

01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:54.720
sectors.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.720
And I would also say that I think that there are very serious issues

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:02.720
of monopolization in provision of broadband, for example, we pay

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.720
much more on broadband than people play, let's say in France.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.720
And these are very serious issues.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:12.720
And well, unfortunately, we didn't talk about them in most of our

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.720
top today because we couldn't talk about everything.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720
There are other issues.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:20.720
And Alex, in terms of the question that's being asked, that

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.720
it's very important to also, to a significant extent, beef up the

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:30.720
antitrust enforcement in the United States so that we deal with

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.720
the monopolization issues.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.720
Now, of course, on the issue of insurance, Robert is absolutely

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:36.720
right.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.720
There is the problem of adverse election and has to be dealt with

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:42.720
very specifically on that.

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.720
But anyway, I wanted to, to, to end at a good note.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:51.720
I appreciate being invited and talk about every, with everybody.

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:58.720
And I am, I am humbled by all the good opinions that I hear today.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.720
And I thank you very much.

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:02.720
Well, thank you, everybody.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:03.720
Wonderful.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:09.720
And I thank you very much.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720
Well, thank you, everybody.

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720
Wonderful.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720
A challenge for us.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720
We appreciate that.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.720
Well, that's very, very, very boring.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.720
Yeah.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.720
On that very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.720
on dismal note, I want to thank everybody for a wonderful and

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.720
very lively conversation today and look forward to having a

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:29.720
reason to being in touch with you again in the future sometime.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:30.720
Thank you, Joe.

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:31.720
Okay.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:33.720
Bye bye.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:08.720
Thank you.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:38.720
Thank you.
