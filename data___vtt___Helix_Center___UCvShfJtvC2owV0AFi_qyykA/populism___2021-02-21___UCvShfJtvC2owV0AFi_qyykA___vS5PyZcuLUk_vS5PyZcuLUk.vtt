WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.060
you

00:30.000 --> 00:32.060
you

01:00.000 --> 01:23.300
do

01:23.300 --> 01:34.020
Well, it being the noon hour here in New York City, I want to welcome everyone and wish

01:34.020 --> 01:39.340
you a good morning, good afternoon or good evening depending on where you're viewing

01:39.340 --> 01:43.020
the Zoom roundtable.

01:43.020 --> 01:52.140
This is I think our third Helix Center roundtable for which we've relied on the Zoom format.

01:52.140 --> 01:56.020
And of course that's due to the COVID pandemic.

01:56.020 --> 01:58.140
We're trying to do the best we can to make the best of it.

01:58.140 --> 02:03.340
I think so far these Zoom meetings have been quite lively and interesting.

02:03.340 --> 02:10.060
So before I tell you about today's roundtable, I want to make just two very brief announcements

02:10.060 --> 02:17.340
and those relate to our upcoming roundtables scheduled for March 20th.

02:17.340 --> 02:23.220
We will have a roundtable on placebo and the placebo and no-cibo effects.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.980
That should be very interesting.

02:24.980 --> 02:34.540
And then either on April 17 or 24th to be determined, we're going to have a talk on stress.

02:34.540 --> 02:40.660
And right now we're not stressing out about which data is exactly, but we should be able

02:40.660 --> 02:43.300
to have that nailed down shortly.

02:43.300 --> 02:49.580
Today we have a really wonderful panel of discussions convened to discuss this topic

02:49.580 --> 02:52.220
of populism.

02:52.220 --> 02:58.620
And before I get things underway, I want to just say a word, a brief word about each

02:58.620 --> 03:06.140
of our discussions and in the interest of equity, I'm going to do this in alphabetical

03:06.140 --> 03:08.740
order.

03:08.740 --> 03:15.740
Jeffrey Alexander is the Lillian Shavinson, Sade and Professor of Sociology at Yale University,

03:15.740 --> 03:21.460
founder and co-director of Yale's Center for Cultural Sociology and co-editor of the

03:21.460 --> 03:25.460
American Journal of Cultural Sociology.

03:25.460 --> 03:30.620
A social theorist whose early work challenged the anti-cultural reductionism of classical

03:30.620 --> 03:35.900
and modern sociology, Alexander has worked with generations of students and colleagues

03:35.900 --> 03:43.980
to create a quote strong program unquote in cultural sociology.

03:43.980 --> 03:51.660
Alexander has also developed the civil sphere theory, a macro sociological model of democracy

03:51.660 --> 03:53.900
and the forces that can undermine it.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.300
He is currently organizing a series of conferences and edited a book project, The Civil

03:58.300 --> 04:06.460
Sphere in Latin America, The Civil Sphere in East Asia, bridging the civil order radicalism

04:06.460 --> 04:09.860
and civil sphere.

04:09.860 --> 04:17.620
Don J. Jaganathan is a philosophy professor and also classical studies professor at Columbia

04:17.620 --> 04:23.180
University, his academic research centers on Aristotle's ethics and political philosophy

04:23.180 --> 04:25.860
and contemporary virtue ethics.

04:25.860 --> 04:30.420
He's also written about issues at the intersection of philosophy and literature, including on

04:30.420 --> 04:32.580
tragedy and the novel.

04:32.580 --> 04:38.900
At present he is completing a book manuscript entitled Aristotle's Practical Epistemology,

04:38.900 --> 04:43.460
which seeks to situate Aristotle's theory of practical wisdom within his views of knowledge

04:43.460 --> 04:48.820
and understanding and thereby to explain why Aristotle thinks of practical wisdom as an

04:48.820 --> 04:54.220
extraordinary achievement as equivalent to political wisdom.

04:54.220 --> 05:00.180
Thakas Pappas has a PhD from Yale in political science.

05:00.180 --> 05:05.060
He's a Greek author and researcher currently associated with the University of Helsinki

05:05.060 --> 05:06.980
in Finland.

05:06.980 --> 05:11.460
Formerly a professor of comparative politics at the University of Thessalonica in Greece

05:11.460 --> 05:17.780
is also held teaching and research appointments at the universities of Strasbourg, Oslo,

05:17.780 --> 05:24.260
Freiburg, Luxembourg, Central Europe University, and Budapest, European University in Florence,

05:24.260 --> 05:26.020
Yale, and Princeton.

05:26.020 --> 05:36.860
Among his books are Making Democracy in Greece, The Charismatic Party, and Populism and Crisis

05:36.860 --> 05:39.660
Politics in Greece.

05:39.660 --> 05:46.500
And lastly, Harry L. Watson is an Atlanta distinguished professor in Southern culture

05:46.500 --> 05:50.780
in the history department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

05:50.780 --> 05:55.420
A native of Greensboro, North Carolina, he received his bachelor degree from Brown University

05:55.420 --> 06:02.020
and his doctorate from Northwestern before joining the UNC history department in 1976.

06:02.020 --> 06:06.980
His teaching and research interests focus on American political history, the early American

06:06.980 --> 06:10.140
Republic, and the Antebellum South.

06:10.140 --> 06:16.140
He served as director of the UNC Center for the Study of American South from 1999 until

06:16.140 --> 06:22.940
2012, and an editor of its journal, Southern Culture, from 1993 to 2019.

06:22.940 --> 06:28.260
He is the author or editor of eight books, including Andrew Jackson versus Henry Clay,

06:28.260 --> 06:33.820
Democracy in Development and Development in America, Liberty in Power, the Politics of

06:33.820 --> 06:42.260
Jacksonian America, and Building the American Republic, A Narrative History to 1877.

06:42.260 --> 06:49.620
Okay, that they're with, I'm going to open up our conversation by asking each of our

06:49.620 --> 06:58.860
discussants to make some comments about how they define populism, and I want to make it

06:58.860 --> 07:05.140
clear at the outset that I think everyone will agree that the term populism is not something

07:05.140 --> 07:12.900
it has an exact and precise definition, but it's something that we all at some point seem

07:12.900 --> 07:19.420
to be wrapping our minds around, and then especially recently with the developments in

07:19.420 --> 07:23.780
our modern history, I think it's become a very hot topic.

07:23.780 --> 07:27.020
So I throw it open.

07:27.020 --> 07:37.260
Who wants to take a quick shot at just making a quick definition so we can get things underway?

07:37.260 --> 07:42.260
Well I don't know if that's a student or any account, if I may, if everybody else is going

07:42.260 --> 07:43.260
to be shy.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.780
First of all, thank you very much for inviting me to participate.

07:46.780 --> 07:50.100
I look forward to this as being very interesting.

07:50.100 --> 07:58.100
It seems to me that you're very right to stress that populism is a fuzzy category, but it seems

07:58.100 --> 08:05.540
to me, almost always to refer to a mass movement, usually a mass political movement but not

08:05.540 --> 08:14.620
always, of a large group of people who define themselves as simply the people, usually not

08:14.620 --> 08:22.740
subdivided further than that, they usually have agreements against elites who may feel

08:22.740 --> 08:31.500
have deserved them and who are not too, who are there to serve the people but have not.

08:31.500 --> 08:40.700
And the people are asked to replace, overthrow, displace these elites and govern more directly

08:40.700 --> 08:42.540
themselves.

08:42.540 --> 08:47.460
Sometimes the people also define themselves against a subordinate group and they regard

08:47.460 --> 08:57.820
as also undeserving and who perhaps are allies of elites who are working from both ends,

08:57.820 --> 09:05.100
as it were, against the people.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.900
Yeah I think I can endorse quite a lot of that.

09:07.900 --> 09:13.620
What I want to add is I think something that distinguishes a lot of populist movements is

09:13.620 --> 09:21.740
that it's not just that they want to define a group of people as the people, but also

09:21.740 --> 09:28.660
that the people are kind of repository for certain kinds of qualities that are underappreciated

09:28.660 --> 09:32.300
by that elite that the people are defined in relation to.

09:32.300 --> 09:38.460
So I think coming from a kind of classical perspective, populist movements, you might

09:38.460 --> 09:43.380
say, appeal to the virtues that the masses possessed that are not commonly recognized

09:43.380 --> 09:51.380
and that it's a reaction to a construal of the people as lacking those virtues and deserving

09:51.380 --> 09:56.020
only secondary forms of political or social participation.

09:56.020 --> 10:00.420
I can go with that.

10:00.420 --> 10:08.540
Can we begin talking without?

10:08.540 --> 10:10.020
Yeah.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.820
So I will go next.

10:11.820 --> 10:17.780
And I beg to differ here because I do not believe that optimism is a fuzzy category and

10:17.780 --> 10:25.140
I think that we can arrive at exactly the precise definitions of that.

10:25.140 --> 10:28.940
But before that, let me take a different approach here.

10:28.940 --> 10:34.620
My concern is when we talk about populism is why do we care about populism and why do

10:34.620 --> 10:36.340
we care about it now?

10:36.340 --> 10:39.380
And I think that there are, we're talking about modern populist here.

10:39.380 --> 10:44.140
Of course, there have been populist phenomenon history from, you know, from the Greek demagogues,

10:44.140 --> 10:49.780
for example, to the Romare public and all the way down to our own days, right?

10:49.780 --> 10:52.420
But we're talking about modern populist now.

10:52.420 --> 10:58.620
So what is very interesting about populism and about our concern about populist is that

10:58.620 --> 11:00.180
first it is a novelty.

11:00.180 --> 11:07.820
It is a new phenomenon that emerges in the aftermath of World War II in the liberal democracies

11:07.820 --> 11:11.140
that developed after the end of World War II.

11:11.140 --> 11:14.220
Secondly, it is a geographically diffused phenomenon.

11:14.220 --> 11:20.140
We see that firstly in Latin America, then it comes into Europe in the late 70s and then

11:20.140 --> 11:22.180
it expands to the United States.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.780
Thirdly, it is a very ambivalent phenomenon.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.380
We have left-wing populist and right-wing populist.

11:29.380 --> 11:33.900
And sometimes they come together very nicely and neatly like it happened in my country

11:33.900 --> 11:35.420
a few years ago.

11:35.420 --> 11:41.020
And finally, the fourth factor that makes populist such an intriguing phenomenon is

11:41.020 --> 11:44.260
that it has a strong impulse for autocracy.

11:44.260 --> 11:49.340
Although populist leaders come into power by the ballot box, okay, it has a very, very

11:49.340 --> 11:52.540
strong impulse for authoritarianist for autocracy.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.220
We saw that in the United States quite recently.

11:55.220 --> 12:01.620
Now, all of those four factors lead us to a very, very simple definition.

12:01.620 --> 12:05.140
If we put them together and my definition has two words.

12:05.140 --> 12:07.900
It is the most minimal definition you can get around.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.980
There's nothing more minimal than that.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.940
So I define populism in my work.

12:11.940 --> 12:17.740
I've been here in this area for many, many years actually working on populist democracy.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.020
So I define that as democratic liberalism.

12:20.020 --> 12:22.460
So it is a system, it is a political party or a party.

12:22.460 --> 12:30.380
So it's for a system or a leader if you like any kind of level of unit of analysis that

12:30.380 --> 12:37.540
abides by the rules of democracy, but not by the rules of post-war liberal democracy.

12:37.540 --> 12:43.060
It is a democratic, illiberal kind of rule.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.620
And I will leave it here for the moment.

12:45.620 --> 12:53.620
But illiberal democracy and illiberal democracy, a democracy that is not liberal.

12:53.620 --> 13:01.900
By the way, this is the question used by Viktor Orban.

13:01.900 --> 13:10.860
I think a lot of the people wouldn't agree with Orban's definition.

13:10.860 --> 13:18.980
But I don't think there's anything to argue with any of these definitions.

13:18.980 --> 13:25.140
And people who are listening to this podcast have to realize that this word is a fuzzy

13:25.140 --> 13:26.380
concept.

13:26.380 --> 13:33.340
And anybody who says that they have a precise definition is just taking a position in the

13:33.340 --> 13:36.140
field of discussion.

13:36.140 --> 13:43.620
And that definition will stand for certain other associated positions.

13:43.620 --> 13:48.740
I would like to argue, I would like to add on to these, I don't have any disagreement

13:48.740 --> 13:57.580
that with a few questions, one, populism isn't a post-war phenomenon that it goes back to.

13:57.580 --> 14:06.020
Certainly, it's endemic to, in fact, it's endemic to a Republican idea of democracy.

14:06.020 --> 14:10.780
It's a theme, it's a dimension, and it's a strain.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.500
Why is it a strain?

14:12.500 --> 14:21.580
Because a democracy, let's just call it, always has a reference to the people.

14:21.580 --> 14:29.740
It always has a presupposition that there is a civil community regulated by law and that

14:29.740 --> 14:34.900
the people vote and elect somebody.

14:34.900 --> 14:41.900
So you're never going to have a democratic process, even if it's a relatively elitist

14:41.900 --> 14:48.860
18th century process or something more incorporated like the one we have now, that doesn't have

14:48.860 --> 14:51.780
continuous references to the people.

14:51.780 --> 14:53.020
The people should rule.

14:53.020 --> 14:56.060
This movement is on behalf of the people, et cetera.

14:56.060 --> 15:04.140
Obama, who's not a populist, had populist dimensions, he talked constantly about the

15:04.140 --> 15:05.140
people.

15:05.140 --> 15:11.900
The other thing is I'd say that there's a continuum of populism, therefore, that moves

15:11.900 --> 15:22.820
from within the institutions of democracy to beyond what I call radical populism, which

15:22.820 --> 15:33.180
breaks then the institutions and results in one man or one woman rule on the left or the

15:33.180 --> 15:38.180
right.

15:38.180 --> 15:44.940
I certainly agree with the idea that there's a kind of endemic feature that, especially

15:44.940 --> 15:52.260
in Republican politics, because lowercase-R Republican politics has this internal tension,

15:52.260 --> 15:58.060
and you can see populism as one kind of way that that tension comes to the surface.

15:58.060 --> 16:04.300
I think as one of the prompts for this panel, we got this quote from either Madison or Hamilton

16:04.300 --> 16:09.180
from the Federalist Papers about how even if every opinion citizen had been a Socrates,

16:09.180 --> 16:11.540
a group of them would still have been a mob.

16:11.540 --> 16:16.580
This idea that when you, for Republican politics to work, you need a suitable number of people

16:16.580 --> 16:22.620
who are fit to the task of governing, but who in governing represent, in some sense,

16:22.620 --> 16:27.340
the will of the people and are accountable to them, but whom the people as a whole see

16:27.340 --> 16:29.380
is better than that.

16:29.380 --> 16:36.060
That particular intrinsically elite dimension of Republican forms of democracy is, I think,

16:36.060 --> 16:40.500
unpopular in the 20th century and the 21st century.

16:40.500 --> 16:45.500
It's no longer seen as appropriate to regard the political elite as superior in virtue

16:45.500 --> 16:49.660
or in decision making or anything like that.

16:49.660 --> 16:53.500
As a result, I think that explains why populist movements have emerged.

16:53.500 --> 17:04.060
It's the suspicion of a governing elite who are better at the job than the rest of us.

17:04.060 --> 17:08.580
We can see other circumstances in which these kinds of suspicions have broken forth in the

17:08.580 --> 17:14.220
past where elites have not done a good job of maintaining the illusion, let's say, at

17:14.220 --> 17:19.460
least of governing well or of representing the will of the people or remaining accountable

17:19.460 --> 17:20.460
to them.

17:20.460 --> 17:26.180
I do think it's intrinsic to Republican politics because it has this combination of a popular

17:26.180 --> 17:31.900
basis and the establishment of a governing class.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.620
I'd like to endorse that.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.180
I think that's very well put.

17:38.180 --> 17:46.020
My perspective as an American historian focuses my attention, I guess, so I'm less familiar

17:46.020 --> 17:54.780
with some of the other examples, but if we restrict populism to the post-World War II

17:54.780 --> 18:00.820
period, it leaves out the biggest episode in American history that's been labeled as

18:00.820 --> 18:03.180
populist ever since it happened.

18:03.180 --> 18:11.620
That was the uprising of the emergence of the so-called People's Party of the 1890s.

18:11.620 --> 18:21.060
I think going back, there have been several conspicuous occasions in American history

18:21.060 --> 18:31.580
again where movements have appeared that say the people have inherently more virtue than

18:31.580 --> 18:33.260
the elites.

18:33.260 --> 18:40.060
While it's true that virtue is essential to Republican government, we, the people, have

18:40.060 --> 18:47.060
more of it than those stuff shirts at the top and we demand that they be displaced and

18:47.060 --> 18:53.060
replaced by people who are more authentic representatives of our will.

18:53.060 --> 18:58.820
I think that was very much a characteristic of Andrew Jackson's political movement.

18:58.820 --> 19:06.580
I think they're going back into episodes like the Whiskey Rebellion or the North Carolina

19:06.580 --> 19:12.380
regulation even in colonial period at times, there have been mass movements with populist

19:12.380 --> 19:15.060
features like that.

19:15.060 --> 19:20.620
I think that's one of the benefits of calling it, of using a fuzzy definition because you

19:20.620 --> 19:28.580
can legitimately talk about a movement with populist features without getting utterly bogged

19:28.580 --> 19:34.660
down into whether it fits this box exactly or that one.

19:34.660 --> 19:40.260
Okay, let me try to link some dots here if I may.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.260
Do we care about populist mass historians?

19:43.260 --> 19:49.580
That would be fine, of course, and populist has been out there in history since Memorial

19:49.580 --> 19:50.580
Times.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.980
I mean, all societies have been divided between elites and the people, right?

19:53.980 --> 19:58.220
If you go back to the Roman Republic, for example, you can find the party that is called

19:58.220 --> 20:05.260
the Populares, that was the party that went against the Senate, against the optimatists,

20:05.260 --> 20:11.300
and the tribunes of the plebs like Tiberius Grák, who's, for example, his brother, Gaius

20:11.300 --> 20:13.580
Grák, who's were populist leaders.

20:13.580 --> 20:18.260
And this is why they were assassinated because they went against the Senate, against the elites

20:18.260 --> 20:19.420
of that time.

20:19.420 --> 20:23.260
And if you go all the way up to today, you find many, many populist movements.

20:23.260 --> 20:28.100
I mean, no one doubts about that, and when it comes to the United States, Michael Kazan

20:28.100 --> 20:33.820
has written a marvelous book about populist in the United States since the 19th century.

20:33.820 --> 20:37.380
But and of course, Jackson was a populist leader.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.780
I mean, he was divisive.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.740
He was the one who relied on the spoiling system.

20:41.740 --> 20:48.500
And those are phenomena that we see in contemporary populist galore, I mean, polarization, patron

20:48.500 --> 20:53.500
of politics, et cetera, but it's not the reason.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.780
I mean, we're not historians.

20:54.780 --> 20:57.060
I mean, we care about populist because-

20:57.060 --> 20:58.060
Wait a minute.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.060
I am.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.060
Yes, you are.

21:00.060 --> 21:01.060
You are.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.060
Yeah, yeah.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.060
I mean, I mean, yes.

21:03.060 --> 21:10.860
I mean, we the people, the ordinary people, okay, we are not historians like, you know,

21:10.860 --> 21:11.860
like you.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.500
Now, it affects our lives.

21:14.500 --> 21:23.540
I mean, this is why there is this booming thing about since 2016, actually, about populist,

21:23.540 --> 21:27.700
because populist and populist governments affect our lives.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.860
And this stands on two puzzles.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.820
This presents us with two puzzles.

21:32.820 --> 21:40.260
First, how can that populist emerges in recent times in our liberal democracies?

21:40.260 --> 21:42.180
We used to live in liberal democracies.

21:42.180 --> 21:44.100
Now, something is happening here.

21:44.100 --> 21:49.980
We see one of those guys who are not liberal, pull, do, period.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.220
What do we do with that?

21:51.220 --> 21:52.620
How can we deal with that?

21:52.620 --> 22:00.460
And secondly, what would populism, if successful as it sometimes is, how does it do to liberal

22:00.460 --> 22:01.460
democracies?

22:01.460 --> 22:11.220
How can people like Chavez or Bond, Trump, et cetera, how, what can they do to our lives

22:11.220 --> 22:13.940
for liberal democracies?

22:13.940 --> 22:19.900
So this is why I focus on the modern times, because I'm not a historian, first of all.

22:19.900 --> 22:28.060
And secondly, because I care about the future, my future and my children's future.

22:28.060 --> 22:30.060
I want, can I respond to that?

22:30.060 --> 22:34.700
Yeah, I think, you know, one of the things that a historical perspective offers you is

22:34.700 --> 22:36.540
alternatives to liberal democracy.

22:36.540 --> 22:41.100
I mean, I think it depends a little bit on how optimistic or pessimistic you are about

22:41.100 --> 22:44.380
the liberal project in the post-World War II period.

22:44.380 --> 22:49.300
And if you feel that there are, you know, that the, for instance, the rise in economic

22:49.300 --> 22:55.020
inequality over the last 50 years is a, you know, it's a feature, not a bug of the liberal

22:55.020 --> 22:56.940
order.

22:56.940 --> 23:01.220
It's a consequence of concentration of certain kinds of power in the hands of some people.

23:01.220 --> 23:04.100
Then you might not be so optimistic about thinking, well, what we need to do is to get

23:04.100 --> 23:05.100
back to that.

23:05.100 --> 23:09.900
I'm very suspicious of Golden Age thinking whether it's looking back to the 17th century

23:09.900 --> 23:12.580
or looking back to the 1950s.

23:12.580 --> 23:17.580
And you know, if there are vulnerabilities in our form of life, our form of political

23:17.580 --> 23:21.940
life, then looking to some of the alternatives and thinking in historical terms can give

23:21.940 --> 23:23.980
you perspective.

23:23.980 --> 23:29.020
And I think this applies, you know, even when you're thinking sort of cross-constitutionally,

23:29.020 --> 23:32.940
I find it very illuminating to think about the groggy and their land reforms when I'm

23:32.940 --> 23:37.580
trying to understand what Narendra Modi is up to, you know, how he came to power on the

23:37.580 --> 23:42.460
back of the struggles of ordinary farmers in India and the kind of land reforms that

23:42.460 --> 23:44.460
he's put into place.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.660
Monty is not the tribe, you know, the blabs.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.260
Monty is the prime minister.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.260
So he's the senate.

23:50.260 --> 23:51.260
Yeah.

23:51.260 --> 23:53.260
It is here to draw the analogy.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.540
Go ahead, Jeff.

23:55.540 --> 24:06.180
I mean, I think that most of the populism that people are afraid of most but not all

24:06.180 --> 24:11.820
is populism of the extreme right today.

24:11.820 --> 24:18.940
There are some exceptions like Manuel Lope has Obrador in Mexico.

24:18.940 --> 24:25.820
But the fear, the ones that move to the right usually combine an anti-elitist movement on

24:25.820 --> 24:32.180
behalf of the people with a deep person with, well, that's part of populism on the left,

24:32.180 --> 24:33.460
extreme left.

24:33.460 --> 24:47.460
But also with bigotry and anti-Semitism, anti-Islamism, some kind of anti-civil discourse that targets

24:47.460 --> 24:48.940
not just an elite.

24:48.940 --> 24:55.740
I think one of you referred to that earlier, but another group as a tremendous danger.

24:55.740 --> 25:02.660
So that the country that they or the people that they want to set up are ethnically homogeneous

25:02.660 --> 25:04.140
group.

25:04.140 --> 25:11.060
The left populist is not as concerned usually with that, but thinks more in terms of the

25:11.060 --> 25:17.740
class so that there's a pure class that they will represent and they'll come to power.

25:17.740 --> 25:24.300
But they're also just at Sanders because they will then possibly well eliminate members of

25:24.300 --> 25:30.180
all the other classes that the people don't represent.

25:30.180 --> 25:38.380
I was interested in this reference to virtue because of course, virtue is also, I don't

25:38.380 --> 25:42.500
want to say, I don't want to keep repeating that it's a fuzzy category, but it's certainly

25:42.500 --> 25:48.340
not something easily defined or it can take it tomes to define virtue.

25:48.340 --> 25:54.780
And yet it seems to be an engine, the issue of virtue and who has it seems to be an engine

25:54.780 --> 25:57.220
driving these conflicts.

25:57.220 --> 26:02.660
And I think similarly, this is the idea of who are the elites because I think elitism

26:02.660 --> 26:04.300
also has been changing over time.

26:04.300 --> 26:06.300
What exactly, who are those people?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.300
Just a moment.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
Just a moment.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.060
I mean, populist comes into power quite often.

26:11.060 --> 26:13.300
I mean, it has happened in many, many places.

26:13.300 --> 26:20.100
Not only with left-wing populist like in Venezuela, for example, think about Soutes and Maduro.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.180
Think about my little country Greece.

26:22.180 --> 26:28.140
We have had our share of left-populism for many, many years under Papindreo and under

26:28.140 --> 26:33.580
Tupras more recently or under right-wing governments.

26:33.580 --> 26:38.460
Now what happens here is when they come into power, they become the elites.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.060
How do we deal with that?

26:40.060 --> 26:44.460
I mean, populists have been in power in several countries for many, many years.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.540
They are the elites.

26:46.540 --> 26:51.060
It is very simple or simplistic to say that those are against the elites because they

26:51.060 --> 26:53.900
do become elites.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.420
Think about Trump.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.420
Think about Orba.

26:56.420 --> 27:00.220
He has been in power since 2010, 11 years now.

27:00.220 --> 27:10.620
First, secondly, if I may, left-wing populist, right-wing populist, I alluded to that earlier,

27:10.620 --> 27:15.340
often come, they form a tandem and they rule together.

27:15.340 --> 27:23.020
This happened again in my country in 2015 until 2019 for four years, full years.

27:23.020 --> 27:29.340
A populist party, Syriza and a right-wing party, a stream right-wing party, a native party,

27:29.340 --> 27:30.900
independent Greeks, rule together.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.260
No problem there.

27:32.260 --> 27:35.260
Or think about Peronism in Argentina.

27:35.260 --> 27:37.620
Peron was a right-winger.

27:37.620 --> 27:44.420
And today, the Peronist party, the judicialist party, is a left-wing party under the Kirchner.

27:44.420 --> 27:52.860
So, it is not that simple.

27:52.860 --> 27:58.940
So you're making it simple by arguing that left and right are the same.

27:58.940 --> 28:04.180
This is a common argument of people who attack populism, which is, well, there's no real

28:04.180 --> 28:07.020
difference between the left populism and the right.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.220
In fact, there's a great deal of difference.

28:09.220 --> 28:16.980
I mean, going back to what Donaje said, if there are vast structural inequalities in

28:16.980 --> 28:25.860
a country that has a democratic form of government, there have to be, and there should be, constant

28:25.860 --> 28:33.500
movements to overthrow the people who have privilege or to restructure the society.

28:33.500 --> 28:39.940
Now as long as you have democratic institutions, that's not going to end up in an anti-democratic

28:39.940 --> 28:40.940
form of power.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.980
It will be metabolized in various ways.

28:43.980 --> 28:51.260
But these populist threads, I think, throbbed through the history of all stratified societies

28:51.260 --> 28:53.420
that have democratic forms of government.

28:53.420 --> 28:58.740
I actually want to say something that might be surprising given what I said earlier,

28:58.740 --> 29:02.540
which is that I actually, you know, I think in our contemporary global context, I want

29:02.540 --> 29:08.060
to endorse what Taka said about the contrast between populism and liberalism, because I

29:08.060 --> 29:13.620
think that is the most illuminating pairing of phenomena.

29:13.620 --> 29:18.220
But I think, you know, one way in which the, I mean, there are left liberals and right

29:18.220 --> 29:21.620
liberals, and I think this helps us get some clarity on the differences in the origins

29:21.620 --> 29:24.780
of fluffing and right populism.

29:24.780 --> 29:31.060
And in particular, I think there are different kinds of elites or phenomena of elite capture

29:31.060 --> 29:33.460
that drive populist movements.

29:33.460 --> 29:37.300
And this might be one of the reasons there's overlap between the left and the right, because

29:37.300 --> 29:38.980
it's not all economic.

29:38.980 --> 29:43.780
If it were just about economic elites and a corresponding sort of class critique, then

29:43.780 --> 29:46.820
we would not expect left and right wing populism to overlap.

29:46.820 --> 29:52.260
But in addition to economic elites or phenomena of economic inequality, there's also, I think,

29:52.260 --> 29:54.300
political and cultural phenomenon.

29:54.300 --> 29:59.620
So I think this is especially true in the United States context where economic, political

29:59.620 --> 30:02.860
and cultural capital come apart in very visible ways.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.820
You can think about Wall Street, K Street and Hollywood.

30:05.820 --> 30:10.820
That's kind of the totemic, you know, things to pin this on.

30:10.820 --> 30:15.860
So you know, as has been documented extensively, especially in recent years, we have this phenomenon

30:15.860 --> 30:19.580
stagnation of wages and rising economic inequality in this country.

30:19.580 --> 30:24.180
But the government, I think related to that, but separate, conceptually separate from that

30:24.180 --> 30:28.860
is the fact that our government institutions are increasingly responsive to certain kinds

30:28.860 --> 30:31.060
of private interests.

30:31.060 --> 30:35.100
And people don't feel like they have the possibility of political accountability.

30:35.100 --> 30:39.780
And that's for a wide range of reasons, including our campaigns, our electoral system and our

30:39.780 --> 30:42.260
campaign finance system, lots of other reasons.

30:42.260 --> 30:44.220
Those are the things that I care about the most.

30:44.220 --> 30:49.420
But, and then there's a kind of phenomenon of cultural elitism, where, you know, I think

30:49.420 --> 30:55.500
we've lost a kind of mass culture that we have had in the past in various ways, which

30:55.500 --> 30:59.420
help to unite people across different kinds of social strata.

30:59.420 --> 31:06.060
And you know, there's a kind of, there's a sort of pluralism, a form of cultural pluralism

31:06.060 --> 31:10.300
that has taken hold in elite institutions, like universities, and many of us are affiliated

31:10.300 --> 31:18.340
with the media, certain other kinds of institutions, that I would call a pluralism without aspiration.

31:18.340 --> 31:23.560
It says that people are essentially different from each other, and we don't have any common

31:23.560 --> 31:27.900
values around which to unite, and you have to accept these essential differences and

31:27.900 --> 31:34.180
not try to make common cause with people across those differences.

31:34.180 --> 31:40.660
And I think that that particular cultural phenomenon has driven a kind of popular insurgency in

31:40.660 --> 31:44.260
the United States that crosses the left-right wing distinction.

31:44.260 --> 31:48.300
Whereas I think when it comes to the economic issues, and I think to some extent the political

31:48.300 --> 31:50.660
issues, that's been much more polarized.

31:50.660 --> 31:55.540
And I think those things stand much more behind the success of someone like Bernie Sanders

31:55.540 --> 32:00.860
and Democratic Party politics than it does explain the rise of Donald Trump.

32:00.860 --> 32:06.660
But famously it was documented that in the 2016 election, people who actually were at

32:06.660 --> 32:11.860
the bottom of the economic poll went for Clinton over Trump by some extent, which put the lie

32:11.860 --> 32:17.740
to the idea that this is an economic populism that was really driving the Trump phenomenon.

32:17.740 --> 32:23.900
So I think because of this sort of plurality of forms of elitism or elites and the ways

32:23.900 --> 32:29.620
of these come apart, I think you actually have overlapping populist energies that can

32:29.620 --> 32:38.420
get sucked into different forms of populism across the political spectrum.

32:38.420 --> 32:46.540
John Rawls had written in laws of people that liberal democracies had a sort of, I'd

32:46.540 --> 32:55.180
call it a homious static principle where liberal people educated in liberal democracies

32:55.180 --> 33:01.260
grew to value the democratic process so much so that they would not allow it to slip back

33:01.260 --> 33:02.860
into tyranny.

33:02.860 --> 33:08.740
And I think latter day developments and developments in history sort of put the lie to that approach

33:08.740 --> 33:10.700
and perhaps overly optimistic.

33:10.700 --> 33:23.300
Well, I think if you've got democratic forms that have created results that are profoundly

33:23.300 --> 33:31.980
alienating, disillusioning, engraving to those who define themselves as the people, then they

33:31.980 --> 33:40.660
may decide that those democratic forms are the source of their deprivation and may turn

33:40.660 --> 33:41.660
against those.

33:41.660 --> 33:49.300
So I think we all recognize that democracy is a lot more fragile than maybe Professor

33:49.300 --> 33:55.180
Rawls appreciated at the time he was writing it.

33:55.180 --> 34:00.820
I mean, I think that we have to realize that when we let talk us first, because I think

34:00.820 --> 34:06.780
his his feed delay kind of got him behind the behind the eight ball go ahead, talk us.

34:06.780 --> 34:11.780
No, I'm fine.

34:11.780 --> 34:19.780
I mean, let me see how how to how to how to work how populist works.

34:19.780 --> 34:22.300
So what we have in the beginning that's the situation of nature.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.900
We have a liberal democracy.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.740
What's a liberal democracy, right?

34:25.740 --> 34:30.820
A liberal democracy is a system that acknowledges that there are many divisions in society, class

34:30.820 --> 34:33.420
divisions, cultural divisions.

34:33.420 --> 34:39.580
So again, I'm trying to link the dots, but regional divisions, religious divisions, you

34:39.580 --> 34:40.580
name it, right?

34:40.580 --> 34:48.020
Now, Rawls comes and says, Hey, guys, let us play moderately.

34:48.020 --> 34:51.340
Let us know what he calls over overlapping consensus.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.260
He uses this phrase overlapping consensus.

34:54.260 --> 35:00.420
How do we do that by applying the rule of law and protecting the rights of minorities?

35:00.420 --> 35:02.220
Now this is liberal democracy.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.700
This is what we have.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.660
Now a guy comes.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.140
Okay.

35:07.140 --> 35:12.220
And he says, because it is always a he, by the way, but I don't want to get into that.

35:12.220 --> 35:14.620
He says, no, no, no, no, no, no, democracy.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.500
I mean, our societies are not divided by so many divisions.

35:17.500 --> 35:21.540
We have one one over our division, the people versus the elites.

35:21.540 --> 35:24.460
Therefore we cannot build bridges.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.180
There will be polarization.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.180
Forget it.

35:27.180 --> 35:29.100
Yes, adversity conflict.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.620
We have to fight against each other.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.220
Who's going to win?

35:33.220 --> 35:34.220
We?

35:34.220 --> 35:35.220
Why?

35:35.220 --> 35:36.220
Because we are the majority.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.220
We are the people.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.220
Okay.

35:38.220 --> 35:42.900
Forget rule of law, forget the protection of minority rights, et cetera, et cetera.

35:42.900 --> 35:46.100
And this is how you get wrong.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.060
And this is how I just said I disagree with that.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.060
Five million.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.060
Forters.

35:51.060 --> 35:58.100
You have to realize that we are social movements that have that communicate our society all

35:58.100 --> 35:59.100
the time.

35:59.100 --> 36:04.820
I mean, Rawls is describing an idealized.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.300
He's a political theorist.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.500
He's a normative political theorist.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.780
He's not a sociologist.

36:09.780 --> 36:13.460
You can't wear political empirical social scientists.

36:13.460 --> 36:24.380
You can't convert Rawls's idea into a empirical description of how democracy actually works

36:24.380 --> 36:29.060
in an actual society.

36:29.060 --> 36:34.420
So you can't criticize an actually existing society from the point of view of Rawls and

36:34.420 --> 36:36.780
say it doesn't work right.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.780
No.

36:37.780 --> 36:41.460
It, in se we have to think about how does it work?

36:41.460 --> 36:49.460
And I think it's fascinating to me that despite the most radical right-wing challenge in American

36:49.460 --> 36:59.020
history, which was Trump, because he took the presidency, the structural difference

36:59.020 --> 37:04.340
in the administration of the United States, the set of office obligations of many office

37:04.340 --> 37:13.740
holders, the legal order, other civil associations, and the institution of journalism as a profession,

37:13.740 --> 37:19.540
it contained this very dangerous populist movement.

37:19.540 --> 37:24.700
And so we can't just broadly talk about populism taking over countries.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.500
We have to think of them as movements.

37:26.500 --> 37:33.860
And we need to think of institutions and other kinds of virtues.

37:33.860 --> 37:39.980
I think it's sort of a populism as a stress test, I think, is an interesting way of thinking

37:39.980 --> 37:40.980
about it.

37:40.980 --> 37:47.900
Insofar as it's not just individuals who are singled out as the bad elites, but actually

37:47.900 --> 37:53.180
institutions like the media, like universities, I mean, I would say the United States has

37:53.180 --> 38:00.420
passed a stress test a lot better than Hungary currently is, given the state of civil society

38:00.420 --> 38:02.660
institutions there.

38:02.660 --> 38:11.940
And that might have to do with the particular forms of decentralization of power that are

38:11.940 --> 38:12.940
possible.

38:12.940 --> 38:17.140
And power thought of very broadly, not just as political power, but also as economic,

38:17.140 --> 38:19.980
cultural power.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.260
How many people know each other in certain kinds of political circles?

38:23.260 --> 38:27.620
And can a political party take over a media apparatus or not?

38:27.620 --> 38:31.100
Those kinds of things depend on networks of affinity that are much harder to pull off

38:31.100 --> 38:33.260
in a country of 330 million people.

38:33.260 --> 38:36.900
Oh, no, I don't think that's exactly true.

38:36.900 --> 38:43.100
I mean, we have big countries like Brazil and Turkey.

38:43.100 --> 38:49.220
I think if you have a democracy for 200 years and you have a gradual institutionalization

38:49.220 --> 38:57.940
of professions, I mean, most of the weak, the illiberal democracies, including Greece,

38:57.940 --> 39:05.340
including Poland, including Hungary, including Brazil, are very recently established.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.780
They have very, very fragile.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.020
Look in the liberal democracy.

39:10.020 --> 39:14.340
No, it's not, but it has a very unstable democracy.

39:14.340 --> 39:18.020
It has had in the past your references to the right.

39:18.020 --> 39:23.420
I mean, it's a great democracy is very stable.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.420
I'm sorry.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.420
I mean, we didn't say now.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.420
I didn't say now.

39:27.420 --> 39:31.260
It is almost 50 years in the scheme of things.

39:31.260 --> 39:34.140
That's not very wrong.

39:34.140 --> 39:35.580
I'm sorry.

39:35.580 --> 39:38.140
I mean, I'm glad that that's fine.

39:38.140 --> 39:39.140
That's fine.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.140
No problem.

39:40.140 --> 39:41.140
No problem.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.140
I don't take that personally.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.140
Don't worry.

39:43.140 --> 39:49.940
But, you know, democracies, right.

39:49.940 --> 39:54.980
I mean, the thing is that when a populist party comes into power and this has happened

39:54.980 --> 39:58.820
in Greece, as I said earlier, I mean, I've lived through this.

39:58.820 --> 40:02.260
I mean, this is the story of my life as a matter of fact.

40:02.260 --> 40:09.460
They stop the weakening situations and then another populist may come down the road and

40:09.460 --> 40:14.660
then another one and then you do not know what will happen to your democracy.

40:14.660 --> 40:20.100
And this is what happened in the Republican room, by the way, after Tiberius Gracus, we

40:20.100 --> 40:25.940
mentioned earlier that 60 years down the road, another guy came that's in a gun called

40:25.940 --> 40:33.020
Marius and another one called Silla and then Bruce's and then the Republic was gone.

40:33.020 --> 40:35.060
This is what we get.

40:35.060 --> 40:42.100
I mean, I cannot see how Hungary, for example, Poland can go back to even weak liberalism.

40:42.100 --> 40:50.020
Yes, those are weak liberal democracies, but liberal have been in the past.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.260
This is what I'm saying.

40:51.260 --> 40:56.260
And Greece might go down that same road again.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.260
I know what you mean.

40:57.260 --> 41:02.700
I mean, I didn't mean to disagree with you, but democracy has been stable in Greece for

41:02.700 --> 41:05.740
a number of years, but the institutions are not that strong.

41:05.740 --> 41:06.820
Yes, I know what you mean.

41:06.820 --> 41:09.540
So I don't disagree with you at all.

41:09.540 --> 41:17.740
But it is exactly those feeble institutions that charismatic leader because there is

41:17.740 --> 41:21.660
charisma there and there is agency.

41:21.660 --> 41:26.380
They may win power over and over again and lead those democracies to some authoritarian

41:26.380 --> 41:27.380
direction.

41:27.380 --> 41:29.340
That is the fear.

41:29.340 --> 41:39.140
So this populism is a deep tendency in, I would say, all societies and it's counteracted by

41:39.140 --> 41:40.300
what?

41:40.300 --> 41:48.860
By deeply structured autonomous institutions committed to certain virtues that are run

41:48.860 --> 41:55.060
that are deeply professionalized by strong civic traditions.

41:55.060 --> 42:00.140
But that won't stop the populist impulse, right?

42:00.140 --> 42:05.180
And the populist impulse can be very productive if you have these institutions.

42:05.180 --> 42:12.180
It can lead to reforms like the working man's movement in the 19th century or socialism

42:12.180 --> 42:19.340
being transformed into social democracy and the big welfare state in Western Europe.

42:19.340 --> 42:26.340
And these are very positive developments, but then you can have something like the peasant

42:26.340 --> 42:34.940
movements in China and the workers and peasants movement in Russia that end up creating dictatorships

42:34.940 --> 42:39.220
that last for a long, long, long time.

42:39.220 --> 42:43.300
They don't have populism, right?

42:43.300 --> 42:48.940
They don't have populism.

42:48.940 --> 42:55.260
One point I want to make and I challenge here is that I do not know in the modern world

42:55.260 --> 43:04.820
again any case in which anywhere in the liberal world, meaning the Americas, Europe, Canada,

43:04.820 --> 43:13.140
Australia, etc., Japan, any case in which populism has had positive outcomes that populism has

43:13.140 --> 43:17.940
been positive after being in power.

43:17.940 --> 43:18.940
Olivia?

43:18.940 --> 43:24.820
Well, I honestly think that's one of the advantages of his talk with perspective because it gives

43:24.820 --> 43:33.820
you a lot more examples of populist movements that have been very beneficial.

43:33.820 --> 43:37.700
And I think the working men's party in the United States is a good example.

43:37.700 --> 43:42.220
I think the People's Party in the 1890s was a good example.

43:42.220 --> 43:50.820
I think we can all think of revolutionary movements that looked maybe pretty awful and close,

43:50.820 --> 43:56.500
but had beneficial results over a longer degree.

43:56.500 --> 44:06.380
So let me put in a plug for historical examples and a historical perspective because I think

44:06.380 --> 44:14.580
that gives us a much more complicated nuanced view of what the possibilities are.

44:14.580 --> 44:16.780
What would you be aware of?

44:16.780 --> 44:20.260
I think I focused on modern populations.

44:20.260 --> 44:21.260
Yeah.

44:21.260 --> 44:24.260
Would there be a way to distinguish?

44:24.260 --> 44:28.260
I know this is not likely, but good populist movements.

44:28.260 --> 44:34.460
What is that may be in a good populist movement that leads to reform versus one that seems

44:34.460 --> 44:38.860
to be what we use the words divisive, polarizing, et cetera?

44:38.860 --> 44:41.660
I don't think polarization is necessarily bad.

44:41.660 --> 44:44.060
I mean, right, I think-

44:44.060 --> 44:45.060
Polarization.

44:45.060 --> 44:47.820
The fracturing of civil society is bad.

44:47.820 --> 44:51.180
And maybe that's a characteristic effect of long-term polarization.

44:51.180 --> 44:58.460
But if we think about corruption as obviously one phenomenon we can identify, it's possible

44:58.460 --> 45:05.020
for a mass movement to demand more accountability from political actors and economic actors for

45:05.020 --> 45:06.460
that matter that reduces corruption.

45:06.460 --> 45:10.140
And that's something that's quite measurable.

45:10.140 --> 45:13.980
And I would say that that's one phenomenon.

45:13.980 --> 45:18.940
Another- The reason I brought up Bolivia is that inequality has gone down.

45:18.940 --> 45:26.100
And of course, there- Under Morales, who has obviously had authoritarian tendencies, which

45:26.100 --> 45:32.020
we should think are bad, to maintain power and to self-aggrandize in certain ways.

45:32.020 --> 45:36.300
But infrastructure spending is massively up.

45:36.300 --> 45:41.660
The welfare of people in rural poverty is massively up in Bolivia over that time frame.

45:41.660 --> 45:48.100
And you might think that's a happy accident of the resource extraction economy and market

45:48.100 --> 45:49.100
prices and so on.

45:49.100 --> 45:50.660
There's disagreement to be had.

45:50.660 --> 45:55.220
But one interpretation of those events is that that was a situation in which- This is

45:55.220 --> 46:03.340
especially a problem in petrostates or resource-dependent states that that money gets tied up in the

46:03.340 --> 46:09.140
hands of a handful of people and does not get used to bring people out of poverty.

46:09.140 --> 46:12.940
Of course, Norway is a petrostate too, and they seem to do a pretty good job of taking

46:12.940 --> 46:15.780
care of people there.

46:15.780 --> 46:20.740
And you can see how resource extraction can be to the benefit of a welfare state and to

46:20.740 --> 46:24.740
the welfare of the worst-off people.

46:24.740 --> 46:28.500
And I think there are different trajectories that a populist movement can take.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.100
And I think Venezuela versus Bolivia is an interesting contrast because of the relatively

46:32.100 --> 46:33.260
similar time frames.

46:33.260 --> 46:40.820
I mean, Bolivia is a very unusual movement of a very unusual example of left populism.

46:40.820 --> 46:41.820
Radical.

46:41.820 --> 46:49.340
I mean, radical left populism staying within the tracks barely of democracy and the recent

46:49.340 --> 46:56.700
elections, a great example of a populist being elected again after an interim liberal.

46:56.700 --> 47:03.660
But I mean, what I'd like to ask the panel, like, what about the surging of black people's

47:03.660 --> 47:07.340
movements in the United States from the 1960s?

47:07.340 --> 47:13.620
That's a social movement, and they call themselves the people acting on behalf of the people.

47:13.620 --> 47:15.940
I mean, they have charismatic leaders.

47:15.940 --> 47:17.540
How do you fit that in?

47:17.540 --> 47:24.780
I mean, there's this tendency to look at the issue as elites dominating or populism.

47:24.780 --> 47:31.140
But there's very positive social movements starting with the socialist or working people's

47:31.140 --> 47:34.420
movements in the 19th century that have...

47:34.420 --> 47:41.180
So what do you deal with the mass movement against racial oppression?

47:41.180 --> 47:47.340
And how do you classify that in these terms?

47:47.340 --> 47:52.100
Mass movements are part of, you know, they fit very well in the framework of a liberal

47:52.100 --> 47:53.100
democracy.

47:53.100 --> 47:55.780
I mean, those mass movements have two flurries.

47:55.780 --> 47:56.780
They may flurries.

47:56.780 --> 48:03.300
They may have their leaders as long and they may act and produce their results as long as

48:03.300 --> 48:07.300
they abide by the rules of liberal democracy by the institutions.

48:07.300 --> 48:11.740
There's nothing problematic about those movements.

48:11.740 --> 48:18.420
I mean, by the way, let me say that Bolivia, Bolivia is not a good example, because Bolivia

48:18.420 --> 48:24.060
is the only country in Latin America in which you have the majority of the population is

48:24.060 --> 48:25.060
in the US.

48:25.060 --> 48:29.380
So if you don't take the ratio issue, you cannot make sense of Bolivia, and you cannot compare

48:29.380 --> 48:34.620
Bolivia to any other country in Latin America and the world, actually, because...

48:34.620 --> 48:38.820
And this is what Morales was an individual, right?

48:38.820 --> 48:45.580
So here, we support of his people, essentially, and he became president of Bolivia, and then

48:45.580 --> 48:47.940
the end was not very happy.

48:47.940 --> 48:50.820
It was a very unhappy end, but that was...

48:50.820 --> 48:55.500
I mean, Bolivia is not comparable because of the racial composition of the country.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.780
So let us leave Bolivia out.

48:57.780 --> 48:59.620
It's a bad case.

48:59.620 --> 49:03.860
It sounds like it's a case that doesn't fit your priors, and that's why it's a bad case.

49:03.860 --> 49:04.860
I think it's a very interesting and illuminating...

49:04.860 --> 49:05.860
It doesn't fit in the others.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.860
But anyway, I want to respond to the question about...

49:07.860 --> 49:08.860
I think I examined...

49:08.860 --> 49:13.860
I mean, I think I answered by, you know, data.

49:13.860 --> 49:23.220
I mean, I'm giving you data, and there is something that distinguishes Bolivia, and this is race.

49:23.220 --> 49:25.940
Well, let me talk about race in America for a moment.

49:25.940 --> 49:26.940
So I think...

49:26.940 --> 49:27.940
I'm a compartment.

49:27.940 --> 49:33.060
I think the 1963 March on Washington is a fantastic example of what the civil rights

49:33.060 --> 49:34.820
movement accomplished and what it didn't.

49:34.820 --> 49:40.060
This is the March on Washington for jobs and freedom, and in the writing of American history,

49:40.060 --> 49:42.020
the jobs part has dropped out.

49:42.020 --> 49:46.940
The minimum wage that is being debated in our country now is roughly corresponds to

49:46.940 --> 49:51.220
the minimum wage that was one of the main demands of that march, a $2 minimum wage in

49:51.220 --> 49:56.900
1963, which works out to something like $15 or $16 I think today.

49:56.900 --> 49:58.540
And it didn't get passed.

49:58.540 --> 50:02.780
And in general, you know, people remember the... I have a dream and the content of the

50:02.780 --> 50:04.500
character and things like that.

50:04.500 --> 50:10.500
And that's been written into sort of American history, but not the economic demands.

50:10.500 --> 50:16.820
And I think the profound failures of the labor movement, both through internal fracturing

50:16.820 --> 50:20.820
and through external pressures and the failure of the kind of regulatory apparatus in the

50:20.820 --> 50:25.740
government side, that is one of the reasons for the continued massive gap in wealth between

50:25.740 --> 50:27.820
black Americans and other Americans.

50:27.820 --> 50:32.980
And one way of looking at that is that the civil rights movement was a beginning, obviously

50:32.980 --> 50:38.380
guaranteeing civil rights in legislation and constitutions is crucial.

50:38.380 --> 50:44.740
But it was seen as only one piece of a larger platform of changes to the material benefit

50:44.740 --> 50:48.980
of black people that have largely not been realized in the country.

50:48.980 --> 50:53.620
And I think from that perspective, that I think is a huge stain.

50:53.620 --> 51:02.780
And I think there will be... There's a continued opportunity on that front for multiracial

51:02.780 --> 51:06.900
coalitions of people within the labor movement and in other venues in America.

51:06.900 --> 51:11.420
And I think there will be a kind of resurgence of economic populism along those lines before

51:11.420 --> 51:16.380
too long because it looks like the basically center left and center right policies of the

51:16.380 --> 51:20.580
democratic and republican parties are not sufficient to address those kinds of problems.

51:20.580 --> 51:27.300
But what I was really asking is whether the black movements in the 20th century have...

51:27.300 --> 51:33.660
Don't they have many of the elements of populism, not whether they're incompatible with liberal

51:33.660 --> 51:34.660
democracy?

51:34.660 --> 51:36.700
No, no, I think they absolutely did.

51:36.700 --> 51:39.020
And I think their economic dimensions are underplayed.

51:39.020 --> 51:43.260
So that's what I was suggesting is that actually seeing them as a... Seeing that movement as

51:43.260 --> 51:46.820
an economic populist movement is really essential to understanding what it was.

51:46.820 --> 51:47.820
Yeah, exactly.

51:47.820 --> 51:52.020
And they also critique the white even if you take the non-economic dimensions.

51:52.020 --> 51:55.460
They were a movement and are a movement against an elite.

51:55.460 --> 51:57.460
They called the white elite.

51:57.460 --> 52:06.020
And just as the women's movement is... Has been very, very anti-black male elites.

52:06.020 --> 52:10.980
It's been a mass movement of attack on male power.

52:10.980 --> 52:12.300
I mean, the Me Too movement.

52:12.300 --> 52:21.260
These are massive uprisings of people in a quote unquote class that I regard as a part

52:21.260 --> 52:26.420
of this populist impulse that nobody would call them populist though.

52:26.420 --> 52:31.780
Because they like them too much or many of the elites like them too much.

52:31.780 --> 52:32.780
Harry?

52:32.780 --> 52:40.820
Well, I would say there, if I could interject just a moment, I think the women's movement

52:40.820 --> 52:46.460
or the civil rights movement are good examples of movements with populist features.

52:46.460 --> 52:54.100
But the race-based civil rights movement cannot claim in the United States to represent the

52:54.100 --> 53:00.140
whole people because African Americans are what?

53:00.140 --> 53:04.540
20% of the population, 11% of the population in some counts.

53:04.540 --> 53:11.340
We've seen in recent years coalition building efforts.

53:11.340 --> 53:22.140
So now you hear about black and brown people or broader or black Latins and indigenous.

53:22.140 --> 53:24.300
And so there's coalition building.

53:24.300 --> 53:30.220
But nevertheless, the civil rights movement doesn't claim to represent the whole people.

53:30.220 --> 53:35.380
But it, Jeffery's absolutely right there, it has very strong populist features.

53:35.380 --> 53:40.940
Women's movement, the same way the women's movement can represent half the people, but

53:40.940 --> 53:44.540
not the whole people.

53:44.540 --> 53:52.340
So this I think is one of the benefits of fuzzy categories is you can say, look at the populist

53:52.340 --> 54:01.700
features of civil rights, look at the populist features of anti-sexism and make those kind

54:01.700 --> 54:11.060
of productive comparisons without getting hung up on just exactly how well they fit your

54:11.060 --> 54:12.060
prayer definition.

54:12.060 --> 54:18.460
Are these movements we're describing now, the degree they partake of populism as a driving

54:18.460 --> 54:28.100
force, do they succeed to the degree that they also partake of some, they moderate this

54:28.100 --> 54:30.060
radical part of it.

54:30.060 --> 54:35.620
I think MLK is a good example of someone who sort of promised to white folks that he was

54:35.620 --> 54:37.900
not a radical.

54:37.900 --> 54:43.940
And I think to some degree that was helpful, I think abolitionists also a century earlier

54:43.940 --> 54:48.540
tried to make the case or win over the hearts of the rest of the country as a way to sort

54:48.540 --> 54:54.860
of spear, and some of them of course were quite radical, but is that the case that this sort

54:54.860 --> 54:56.820
of moderating their radical?

54:56.820 --> 55:06.660
I wouldn't go to the radicalism effort, but I would say that populist movements, like

55:06.660 --> 55:12.180
minority populist movements, if we can use that expression, succeed to the degree to

55:12.180 --> 55:18.700
which they can build a majority coalition by persuading people outside their base that

55:18.700 --> 55:26.420
hey, I think that's just, or I can see how our people would benefit from that also.

55:26.420 --> 55:34.020
So the degree to which they can build coalitions for radical measures or radical measures,

55:34.020 --> 55:43.100
but the point is that they can move towards a majority in a democratic framework.

55:43.100 --> 55:46.980
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I think that's a good point.

55:46.980 --> 55:54.700
I mean, the idea of a civil sphere or a republic has the idea that there's a vital center.

55:54.700 --> 56:05.220
And if a populist movement moves too far to the right or the left, it says, I don't care.

56:05.220 --> 56:06.220
Nope.

56:06.220 --> 56:07.660
I think we have.

56:07.660 --> 56:08.660
We will.

56:08.660 --> 56:09.660
Yeah, yeah.

56:09.660 --> 56:10.660
Yeah.

56:10.660 --> 56:14.580
Who else wants to jump in?

56:14.580 --> 56:16.460
I mean, I want to endorse that point.

56:16.460 --> 56:21.420
I think the kind of stability of movement depends on coalition building in important

56:21.420 --> 56:28.660
ways, and this is one of the puzzles is that yes, you set yourself up against the elite

56:28.660 --> 56:34.300
and you might complain about the domination of certain kinds of institutions by the elite.

56:34.300 --> 56:37.300
But do you want to get rid of the institutions themselves or do you want to innovate them

56:37.300 --> 56:39.820
so fully that they can't function?

56:39.820 --> 56:42.900
That's the point of which I think this starts to become sort of consumptive of the civil

56:42.900 --> 56:44.700
sphere, the republican spheres.

56:44.700 --> 56:46.340
I think Jeff was saying.

56:46.340 --> 56:48.660
Jeff, I think you're freed up.

56:48.660 --> 56:52.500
You want to finish your thought?

56:52.500 --> 56:54.260
I'm not sure where I was cut off.

56:54.260 --> 56:57.060
It's hard to finish it when I didn't know where I was.

56:57.060 --> 57:01.300
I was saying that, I mean, if a movement on the right or the left moves away and says

57:01.300 --> 57:07.420
I give up on the Bible center, I'm going to establish a power simply on behalf of my

57:07.420 --> 57:08.740
own movement.

57:08.740 --> 57:15.260
So in that sense, black power in terms of black panther, that was a populism.

57:15.260 --> 57:20.020
They spoke to the people all the time by the way.

57:20.020 --> 57:25.900
And Trump, as to the good point that Harry Mann, I mean, Trump spoke on behalf of the

57:25.900 --> 57:31.380
people all the time, but we know it was on behalf of only white people.

57:31.380 --> 57:36.820
His people, especially white people, and he left out.

57:36.820 --> 57:41.580
So this tension is always there, of course.

57:41.580 --> 57:49.220
Let me go back to social movements, if I may.

57:49.220 --> 57:56.060
When I went to school, we called them movements and the whole field was called consensus politics.

57:56.060 --> 58:06.660
So there was, by the eighties, nineies, et cetera, the whole gamut emerged around the

58:06.660 --> 58:09.740
time and they were asking power, essentially.

58:09.740 --> 58:12.580
And the most important of those movements was the Green movement, of course.

58:12.580 --> 58:18.420
They created lots of parties in Europe, some of the parties formed coalition governments,

58:18.420 --> 58:23.100
some of those are in power even today in a number of countries.

58:23.100 --> 58:27.980
Now, those movements are the gist and the essence of liberal democracy.

58:27.980 --> 58:32.740
We need those those movements because they do not go against the constitution.

58:32.740 --> 58:35.740
They want to change how politics works.

58:35.740 --> 58:37.540
They bring in new issues.

58:37.540 --> 58:39.660
Why do we call them populist?

58:39.660 --> 58:42.340
The world populist did not exist back then.

58:42.340 --> 58:47.860
I mean, we knew that Peron was populist, but no one understood what the terror meant.

58:47.860 --> 58:50.660
So those movements are always there.

58:50.660 --> 58:52.900
A very sensual part of democracy.

58:52.900 --> 59:00.580
They did not popularly speak for particular electrics, constituencies.

59:00.580 --> 59:03.020
And that's not.

59:03.020 --> 59:04.020
What about the sort of...

59:04.020 --> 59:05.020
What about the...

59:05.020 --> 59:06.020
Making some claims.

59:06.020 --> 59:07.020
Let me...

59:07.020 --> 59:08.020
Yep.

59:08.020 --> 59:14.460
I was going to say, what about laying some claim to a particular kind of virtue?

59:14.460 --> 59:20.060
Some particular sort of virtue based on their who they are as a people.

59:20.060 --> 59:24.500
That is a component of this.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.740
These movements.

59:25.740 --> 59:29.300
They are not there as people.

59:29.300 --> 59:32.660
They are there as carriers of particular interests.

59:32.660 --> 59:34.900
They want all goals.

59:34.900 --> 59:35.900
Political goals.

59:35.900 --> 59:45.180
They want a better climate, a green development, feminist movement, for example.

59:45.180 --> 59:50.060
I mean, they want to pursue the interests and the rights of the feminist movement, for

59:50.060 --> 59:51.540
example.

59:51.540 --> 59:56.100
And then let me ask something, the whole panel, because this is a very interesting question.

59:56.100 --> 01:00:03.020
I mean, this is one of the elephants, a number of elephants, when it comes to populism.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.420
What do we mean when we say the people?

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:11.380
I mean, do we mean the nation, like, you know, make America great again?

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.380
Do we mean the underprivileged?

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.380
Straight up?

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.380
All over the place?

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.780
The poorer people, the ordinary people?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:26.820
Do we mean the working class, in which case where the Marxist domain, for example?

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.020
Do we mean race?

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.700
Like in Bolivia?

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.700
Do we mean...

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.300
Stay in English?

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.300
Like in India?

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.020
For example, who are the people in India?

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.500
Define the people?

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.900
Well, according to Modi, it's Hindus.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.500
But there is an open question.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Right?

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:47.220
I mean, it's pretty straightforward in some case, what the relevant form of populism

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.220
is trading on.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.220
I mean, changing the laws on citizenship is a pretty clear move to define the people.

01:00:53.220 --> 01:01:00.540
If you want to look at a concrete political action, you know, the 2009-19 Citizenship Act,

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.940
you know, to make it impossible for large numbers of Muslims living in India to remain

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:12.100
or become citizens, you know, that kind of religious test is a pretty clear, you know,

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.060
attempt to define the boundaries.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.700
So what do you say in the United States?

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:21.020
The people that don't exist, the people that don't exist, the people that don't exist,

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.700
the people that are made, yep, it is a construction.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700
Right?

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.740
I mean, Buddha talked about that, I mean, the making of the class.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:34.180
So you have a populist leader who makes his own people, and then he has his own clients

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.820
for going to vote for him, and he's going to stay there in power forever.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.980
And that's that.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:39.980
Enjoy.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.700
It's a function of language to a degree, to label some group.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:49.700
And it's interesting now, and I wanted to open up the conversation to incorporate information,

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:50.700
the flow of information.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.940
We talked about, you know, the free press and how that's important.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:03.020
And it's attacked by populist leaders, demagogues anyway, is often a part of their game plan.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:10.060
You know, labeling any group with any label, elite people, you know, is a language game

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.060
in a way, right?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:18.780
But I wonder how much you all think information, how it flows and who controls it has an effect

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.780
on populism.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:28.980
I mean, I think this is one of the differences in modern populist movements is now the attempt

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.300
to bypass traditional media and use social media.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.260
You know, that's one way of kind of doing an end run.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:41.580
I think that's been proven to be pretty successful worldwide in various cases.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:49.020
I mean, I'll move this to pandemic on filtering the reality for the people in the movement

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.900
so that it recapitulates the tenets of the movement.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:03:00.980
But every social movement for the last 200 years has always had its own misfampers, its

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:09.180
own, you know, you didn't need social media to have Hitler, right?

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:18.540
And yet grasping a new form of communication has been effective for populist movements

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:25.660
and not just in our lifetimes in an early Republican society where communication was

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.460
based on drawing room conversation.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:37.260
It suddenly introduced mass circulation newspapers and political rallies with hundreds of people.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:43.940
That's a new form of political communication and it can be very effective.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:50.780
Even populist are very innovative in their political techniques and seizing new forms

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:57.700
of political communication can be, you know, part of the winning strategy.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:06.100
Well, but Obama was a campaigner and President introduced the digital revolution first.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:11.260
Yeah, and you can see how, you know, you can have these features of populism without maybe

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.740
being a full-throated populist.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:16.780
And of course populist leaders are very good at learning, you know, these kinds of techniques

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.060
and adapting them and it takes time.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:23.980
And I think, you know, the common thread is a kind of attempted direct communication

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.660
unmediated by the kinds of traditional institutional actors.

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:32.220
So instead of, you know, primary politics in America have changed dramatically in the

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.580
last 25 years.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:39.540
It used to be that, you know, it was a very, is a hyper-local sort of phenomenon and you

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:44.180
had to have the kind of grassroots organizing which meant that you had to get hold of people.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.660
But going back to Howard Dean up to the present, you know, the internet has really changed

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.660
that.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.100
The flow of money has changed.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.100
The flow of information has changed.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:55.620
There's been a kind of nationalization of party primaries and that's really changed the

01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.580
influence of political parties and their ability to keep certain kinds of radical people out

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.860
of, you know, presidential primaries in the US.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.540
And I think that's a fascinating change.

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:08.380
And lots of people are learning that lesson all across the political spectrum, sort of

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:09.380
all at once.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:16.620
I would put that in a broader perspective because it is not only the type of the medium, the

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:24.380
type of the, how do they try to reach larger audiences and what do they do, the technique.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:30.780
It is that obviously this, when they come into power, they try to silence the practice

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:34.100
that opposes the rule.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:40.980
So I would put that in the broader framework of institutions because what we see, we put

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:47.820
the playbook there, the populist playbook, is that when they take power, they attack

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:52.300
the institutions, all of them, press is one of them, freedom of the press.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.300
They attack the judiciary.

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:55.780
They go against the courts.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.780
We saw that in America.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.900
We saw that in all other cases, populist rule.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:05.540
They try to violate the division of powers.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:08.740
They try to control education.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:14.580
So they meditate against institutions of liberal democracy, hence my definition of democratic

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.580
liberalism.

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.580
Okay.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:17.580
And this is very typical.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:23.260
I mean, there is not any case of populist rule that I happen to know that you do not

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.700
see the same moves over and over again.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.700
It's like a playbook.

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:31.460
I think the exact same thing.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:38.860
I think the fact that we know there are actors, China, Russia in particular, who have made

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:47.860
an effort to redirect the conversation on or the ideas flowing through social media,

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.220
that that's an important aspect of what we're seeing in modern modern times.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.980
These are not the most important questions though.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.620
I think we can sign them.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.620
China, no questions.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.980
Yeah, are the democracies.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:03.980
Say that again.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.260
I'm sorry.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.260
Repeat that.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.260
Talk to us.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.260
You repeat that.

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.260
Okay.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:16.260
For some reason, I think he's sorry.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.460
Yeah, I didn't say anything.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:19.460
Okay.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:20.460
All right.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:26.420
So the ideas we will open up some of the questions that have come from the audience.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:31.460
And Alex is here to help guide us through that.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:32.460
Yeah.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.380
So if anyone wants to write more, because only I only have one question so far, I guess

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.780
too, from Susanna Black through the Zoom.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.700
So if anyone has any questions, please write it in the Q&A part or on the chat and I'll

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.700
relay it.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.180
But yeah.

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:50.580
So Susanna Black wrote something, I guess, based on what sort of Jeffrey had asked, which

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:55.500
was, are contemporary race and sex-focused progressive movements populist or anti-pop

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.500
list?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:01.860
Can you speak to distinction between class-based left populism of the 2016 Bernie type and

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.940
contemporary progressive politics, which tend to center issues other than in class and

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:12.700
may tend in certain cases to reinforce existing institutional power, i.e. the phenomenon of

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:18.140
will capitalism, and then they wrote, alternatively, how can we do a better job in creating a

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:25.500
common good politics that speaks to and includes all people in a polity as opposed to ontologizing

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.940
the division or antagonism between the people and the elites?

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.940
Is that possible or desirable?

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.380
I mean, one thing that I was saying earlier, I think, in response to that, which is that

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.900
there's different kinds of different forms of pluralist politics.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:47.580
And one of them is sort of concerned with, say, the rectification of historical or present

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:57.340
injustices and attempts to point to places where people cannot meet on an even footing

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:02.780
in the public sphere as is desired by the principles of Republican politics.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:09.100
And I think we don't have a lot of talk about our Republican form of government anymore.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:13.420
We spend very little time, you know, there's attention as paid to the eroding of our institutions

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:20.780
or to certain kind of issues about dark money in our politics and so on.

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.820
We don't talk very much about things like, well, citizens need certain kinds of virtues

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.100
for our system of government to survive, the very things that you can see littered all

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.900
over the federalist papers, as I mentioned at the beginning.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.820
And I think one result of that is that we get a kind of empty pluralist politics, which

01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:42.300
says not taking into account whether people are subject to any form of injustice or meeting

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:48.660
each other and even playing field, that certain kinds of identities are more important than

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:55.300
one's identity as a citizen and need to be sort of celebrated or valued in certain ways.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:59.260
And to some extent, this is a kind of, this is fine because it might be pushing back against

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:04.180
a homogenizing impulse that's also inappropriate to a large plural society.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:08.260
But unless it's framed with a certain set of aspirations about what we want to do together

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:16.860
in civil society, my fear is that it tends to be more, you know, to contribute to certain

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:25.500
kinds of fracturing that make it impossible to have broad coalition-based politics of

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:32.380
a kind that, you know, is in defense of our common life.

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:37.140
So that's sort of my concern about what I call pluralism without aspiration or empty

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:43.620
pluralism that I think maybe certain strands of progressive politics point in this direction,

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.180
not all of them.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:49.660
And I think it's very easy to sort of paint different political movements and dismiss

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.900
them.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.580
And I don't mean to be doing that, but that's a sort of reservation that I have.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:04.420
I really like to endorse that, Jay, because you mentioned the Federalist Papers and the

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:11.980
invocation of virtue over and over again in the Federalist Papers, going past that word

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:20.740
virtue to think about what people in that era meant by the word virtue.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:26.500
When you were talking about public life, they meant virtue to them was the ability to set

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:32.140
aside narrow personal self-interest and to advocate for the common good, however that

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:35.060
might be defined.

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:40.820
And the pitfall there was that every pluralistic group tended to define the common good as

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:47.260
their good, and it sort of collapsed into brokerage liberalism.

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:56.740
But if there were a way for us to recapture a vision of the common good or to advocate

01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:06.900
for a vision of the common good that would embrace more than relatively small, certainly

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:15.060
minority-sized slices of the population, then I think we'd be taking a step in the right

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.060
direction.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:22.300
One of the problems is that the word virtue was so hokey these days that anybody who stands

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.900
up and tries to advocate for it kind of gets wet.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:29.140
I guess we're supposed to say good character now or something like that.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.140
There's something like that.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.060
I mean, I disagree with both of you guys.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:42.420
I think that virtues are completely at the heart of all most of our public discourse

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:50.780
today, and that the idea that we need to go back to an earlier smaller form of republicanism

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:58.620
based on the Greeks or the founding fathers, it's not right because virtues still are here.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:04.780
For example, when people say Trump was selfish and he only cared about himself, and then his

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.700
opponents argued we need somebody who cares about the whole society.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:17.900
Just as virtue talk, when somebody says people are dishonest, when they say they're corrupt,

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:25.980
when they say that they're irrational or insane, that they don't have common sense, this concern

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:34.500
with virtue permeates left, right, and center in all these democracies.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:43.340
I don't think that the way to get a good society is to say that we need a new set of virtues.

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:51.380
I think that in fact there's an ideal of a good society in back of left, right, and center

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:57.820
except for the extremes, and that that ideal is going to be incorporated in a partisan way

01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:59.460
through ideology.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:04.340
You will never have us all sharing this whole thing, but we'll have us talking about it

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340
all the time.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:10.820
I want to push back on that because I think a lot of the, if you look at the polling,

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:16.940
people thought that Trump was not a very honest or a public minded person when they voted

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.700
for him, and that's the scandal, right?

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:23.140
The thought is, and it doesn't have to be Trump in particular, you can apply it to whoever

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:29.340
else you like, the idea is that virtue should be a criterion for high office, and it should

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:33.940
also be what we try to promote in society rather than factional interest rather than

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.380
monetary benefit.

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.100
This is true of technocratic liberals on the left as well as the right that they want

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.380
to measure the flourishing of the society based on how much money is in your pocketbook

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.460
or how good you feel about things rather than character.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.740
I think that is the part of the Republican ideal that is lacking.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.060
Not leaving—all of our moral talk is virtue talk, of course.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.060
I agree with that.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.060
Yes.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:06.780
And Trump, you're taking a poll that says, polls are impossible to use as ways of judging

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:14.620
how people think of leaders, but I'm sure that people thought that Trump, his supporters,

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:18.700
that he has the virtue of telling the truth.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.700
And truthfulness is a virtue.

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.260
It's an important virtue.

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:31.380
But isn't virtue or pretend virtue what essentially ends up creating the groups?

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:38.060
Yeah, I mean, but the thing is we can't try to find what's the true virtue.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:47.180
I mean, not if we stand back and look at the discourse of a complex pluralistic society.

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:51.100
Every group will claim that it has the right virtue.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:54.540
Right, but that's what creates the group.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:56.620
Yeah, I agree totally.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.620
It is.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:05.660
But I think that's also what creates the aggression between the groups because I think

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:12.140
my virtue is better than your virtue and therefore you are wrong and so I can attack you.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.100
Yes.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.980
But if you want to see what is an operational definition of a better society, to me as a

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:28.860
more incorporated one that allows more people the use of their full life forces.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:36.260
And I think that that's really what Trump, the right populace, are a reaction against

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.900
the expansion of the civil sphere in the United States.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.500
And so Susan, I wouldn't be so depressed about this.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:52.340
I don't, I think that these movements are reactions against progress that we may be in

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:58.420
store for another few years of a progressive movement.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.780
Not a populist one.

01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:06.300
May I take a different approach perhaps?

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.820
I like this discussion about virtue.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.100
Of course, we need that.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.300
We need tons of that.

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:18.260
But thinking about our lives and about the future and about what we're going to do in

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:24.060
future, let's see what are the problems first of all.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:31.380
I mean, what are the problems we face as humanity, public health, pandemic, next epidemic, the

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:36.180
other one, the third one, that's it.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:53.660
I mean, my graduation and multiculturalist, fourth, I think, I mean, what do we do?

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.980
I mean, with an ethos who happened to live in the same neighborhood.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.060
And finally, the survival of democracy.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.260
It is not evident that our democracies will survive forever.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:07.180
Now, my question is this.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.540
I will make two points actually.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:15.500
First, I think that in all of those things, technocracy, technology is very crucial in

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.100
all of those things.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:23.940
And I think that populists are very much inimical to the technology and the technocracy.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.340
It is the elite after all, okay?

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.460
We don't like the elites because we're populists, but it so happens.

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:39.780
But among the elites, most of the technocrats from bigade to the universities where all

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:46.460
of you teach in the United States, you are very fond of technocracy and technology and

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.220
populists don't like that.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.780
So we have to do something about it.

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:54.060
So populists do not play a positive role.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:59.940
And my second point is that populists do not solve any of those big problems.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.540
Apparently, accept or theoretically accept inequality.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.700
But do they have the means?

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.460
Do they have the policies?

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.900
Do they have the agenda to solve socio-economic inequality?

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.900
No.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:18.900
So I will leave it here by saying that liberal democracy is the only and better solution

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:25.060
that we have and we have to improve the institutions of our liberal democracies.

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:28.100
And this is the stance I will take in this discussion.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:36.220
Maybe the panelists could respond to the Fishline question that's on the Q&A.

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.300
I'll read it out for you.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:42.660
So the first one, Scott wrote, thank you, Scott, for writing these questions.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:48.220
The first one he wrote was, what do the panelists think about the idea of popular and communitarian

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:53.860
thought and again after Trump that the rise of right-wing populists movements in the

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:59.740
United States is a result of a hollowing out of America's civil society and engagement

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:05.340
in local politics is a big part of left and right-wing populism, some sort of illusion

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:11.300
of national engagement in politics that replaces the vital role of engagement in community life

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:12.580
in societies.

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:18.060
We'll talk about a second question.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:23.380
And then the second one, excuse me, it seems that all right-wing populism is immediately

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:29.180
labeled fascism by the left media and all left-wing populism is immediately labeled socialism

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.900
by the right-wing media.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:35.500
And that ultimately this prevents any real engagement for the country with the very real

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.700
problems that generate these movements and give demagogues like Trump a platform.

01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:45.900
How can we engage with people's outrage in a more constructive way than populism or labeling

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:52.060
people's grievances as politically radical and therefore invalid?

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:56.340
And I think I'll just say briefly, I really like that second point.

01:20:56.340 --> 01:21:04.020
It's very, it's really fascinating and important which is that populism tends to be a label

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:15.460
of denigration often used to undermine the valid dimension of massive social movements.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:22.820
We are right to be very worried about the anti-democratic dimensions as Tarkis has talked

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.820
about throughout.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:34.380
At the same time, I think we want to respond to Trumpism by saying it reveals as Don and

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:42.180
Jay's talk about the underlying displacement of masses of Americans economically.

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:50.780
So I think that's a good point that populism is a label that is right to use in a sense

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:57.700
to pollute the anti-democratic and demagogu-d aspect but yet usually populism responds to

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:02.100
deep fractures that need to be repaired in a society.

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:09.660
I mean, I think one thing we can think about is sort of what is government for and what

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:15.140
are the limits of what government can achieve and what are political movements for.

01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:20.380
And when I think about economic issues or issues of distributive justice or even issues

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:27.060
of access to certain kinds of institutions, those seem like places where government can

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.940
do something and ought to do something.

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:35.100
But if the grievances are related to there are too many brown people in my neighborhood,

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.740
I don't think that's something that government should be in the business of doing quite the

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.820
opposite.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:45.660
So politics of grievance can be politics of legitimate grievance or illegitimate grievance

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.020
and we have to hold the line on we have a multicultural, plural society.

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:54.380
I'm an immigrant, a legal immigrant and a naturalized citizen of this country and I've

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.820
also immigrated to other countries.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:23:03.060
I spent some years living in the UK and I think that's been central to the kind of American

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:07.620
experiment in American national ideology and politicians of all strikes should agree with

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:09.300
that.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:16.540
But we can also say that these kinds of grievance politics are exacerbated by certain kinds of

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:25.020
economic phenomena and you don't have to respond directly to people's feelings but you can

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:28.740
respond to what their feelings might be driven by if you think that's a legitimate side for

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:36.500
government intervention in a problem of distributive justice or a problem of equality and rights.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:45.140
And again, not to sort of jump on the Republican hobby horse too much but solidarity is also

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.340
a word that's kind of dropped out of our politics.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:55.180
The fraternity element of our Republican imagination and I think there ought to be a bigger space

01:23:55.180 --> 01:24:02.020
for solidarity, not just solidarity among say the working class or anything like that but

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.780
solidarity across class divisions, across racial divisions and this is really central

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:10.220
and needs to be restored to our politics too.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:15.140
And so far as we think of populism as a bad thing, I think part of the appropriate response

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:18.740
also has to be building a culture of solidarity.

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:27.060
Well I would say that populism can be redeemed if you will, it is not always bad.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:36.380
If it embraces a coalition building ethos that says let's reach out to other aggrieved

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:45.780
people who don't look exactly like us and let's build a movement, then populism can

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.820
be a very good thing.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:56.700
I guess so far as to say that populism created liberal democracy from the 18th century forward.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:07.100
It's not automatically an opposite force that we have to choose either or instead we need

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:15.100
desperately to have a populist element in liberal democracy and we needed to have a coalition

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.820
building ethos to it.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:25.620
That's how you get things done in a majority based political system.

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:30.380
And I mean what about going back to talk at this first point about illiberal democracy

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:38.700
being a definition in that there are certain virtues associated with illiberalism, they're

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:45.740
actually what they call with these folks who promote it, call their virtues and it's interesting

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:50.260
to think well what are those and how might we neutralize them or engage them in a way

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:54.540
that's more constructive.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:59.500
Can you be more specific about the virtues of illiberal democracy?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.940
Well let's see, one comes to mind.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:08.780
If the elites are overly educated in their egg heads they don't really know how the plain

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:18.060
folk what they experience, what they do, there's this virtue which is we don't listen to experts.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:21.780
In fact listening to experts is considered a negative virtue.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.980
So that would be an example of what I mean.

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:30.780
Also I think that there's such a thing as impartiality or that anyone might strive towards impartiality.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:36.500
I made this comment several times that Trump made a comment about their Republican judges

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.980
and their Democratic judges and Justice Roberts said no no they're not and Trump said well

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:45.100
of course they are you're being a chump and I know.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.340
He was going to speak the truth on that occasion of course.

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:54.860
We have a lifetime appointment super legislature that runs large parts of our public life.

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.860
Of course we do.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.940
Every single political scientist would tell you that.

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.900
But wait wait okay but yes if people want to write and if people left both seem to endorse

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:11.140
that claim of Trump's which I would say is unfortunate in this sense that it's not prescriptive

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.740
of the Democratic spirit.

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:19.180
Because judges do think they're being impartial and we have ways of discerning people who

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:24.540
tend to be impartial were deliberative in their judgments and people who are not and

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:30.620
I think everyone can recognize that or usually can and it's an important virtue that I don't

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:34.540
hear from it very much and not to use a clang term.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:41.540
But just on the point of intention of impartiality I mean one issue we haven't spoken about is

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.620
nationalism versus cosmopolitanism.

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:50.620
That's a different version of it but it's complementary to what you're saying and illiberal

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:58.780
politics are usually highly nationalistic and explicitly anti-conson-polliton which they

01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:09.260
associate cosmopolitanism with intellectuals choose and other people like bankers etc.

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:13.660
Just can I give a Jerry's point about expertise because I think this is really interesting.

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:19.700
I mean I think listening to experts you framed it very carefully listening to experts is

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:25.140
a good thing we might think because there are problems that arise in complex political

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:28.660
societies that require expertise to address them.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:35.500
But rule by experts is bad anti-democratic and inappropriate.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:41.740
And there's a strain of anti-democracy on the technocratic left just as there is on

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:49.820
the kind of hyper-nationalist or hyper-populist right which wants to exclude people from voter

01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.540
rolls and things like that.

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:57.300
And one way of being anti-democratic is being technocratic, two technocratic and saying

01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:03.380
I think a great example of this is in the current pandemic we've had this kind of polarized

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:08.980
response to public health guidance that either wants to say well public health experts are

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:14.020
the right people to make these political decisions on our behalf and Anthony Fauci should decide

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:19.900
whether we should shut down or not which fails to recognize that there are lots of goals,

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:23.220
political goals that we have in a public health crisis that have to be balanced against each

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.220
other.

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:28.180
And I think this comes out most clearly in the conversation about school closures.

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:32.260
Even after it's been, it seems like schools can be reopened pretty safely, it's become

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:38.100
a kind of principle in certain corners of the left in our current political system to say

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:42.660
no the schools have to stay shut which ignores the massive inequality that is drive as when

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:47.620
you think about the radically higher effects of school closures on poorer and minority

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.100
children.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:55.820
And so I think just realizing that there is no such thing as political expertise that

01:29:55.820 --> 01:30:00.380
there is only political wisdom which is to say there is a sense of the different kinds

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:04.940
of goals that we are trying to pursue on behalf of all of us.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.500
And we have an sort of imperfect people who are sufficiently different from each other

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:13.260
who are going to deliberate and figure this out but they are not experts in anything.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:18.140
They should listen to experts and so far as expert knowledge is relevant and available.

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:20.980
And of course saying you never listen to experts is just as foolish as saying always

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.460
listen to experts.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.340
But I think there is a deeper truth that is not a nonpartisan truth about the nature of

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.780
politics that we can get to here just by careful reflection on what it is that we are doing

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.780
when we are deliberating together.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:41.100
I think one of the things that gives expertise a bad name is that experts claim their authority

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:48.540
on universal characteristics they would say we know the scientific truth and that is good

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:55.500
for everybody and we sort of insist that it go down.

01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:02.620
When in fact they are advocating a set of policies that benefit a very narrow slice of

01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:04.380
the population.

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:13.140
So when experts claim to be to have universal validity but actually are being very selfish

01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:20.860
then that is a perfect ticket for getting discredited on the populist level.

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:28.580
So I think one of the reasons, one of the things that sets off populist movements is

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.900
that the elites really have failed for people.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:43.340
And that means that if information based elites that is experts want to retain the

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:50.260
respect of the public and they have to kind of keep doing a gut check about whether their

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:58.860
advice is truly beneficial for people at large or only a fraction.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:07.580
Well last century in his public opinion Walter Lippmann had written about the use of stereotypes

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:15.300
as a potent force in driving public opinion how much they repressed ideas as much as they

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:22.500
put forward ideas which is an interestingly psychoanalytic way of looking at stereotypes.

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:28.980
But I would say that the issue about let's say experts and expertise is that in this information

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:35.620
marketplace some of these stereotypes end up acting as tokens and the sort of subtleties

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:40.540
that you just both of you just expressed about expertise which is wonderful and should be

01:32:40.540 --> 01:32:47.380
out there ends up being repressed pushed away because of the effect of these stereotypes.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:54.500
Okay, how many questions are we feeling sorry just because there's one on YouTube and I

01:32:54.500 --> 01:33:00.220
have one myself but I don't want to abuse my position as a Q&A moderator.

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:04.540
So if that's cautious so there's one on YouTube and then I could give mine if that's okay

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:07.460
with all of you otherwise I'll just do the one on YouTube.

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.460
No no you can do that too.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.460
Okay, okay.

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.460
You're both.

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:15.660
Okay so the one on YouTube is from Robert Price thank you Robert.

01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:21.740
So Robert wrote what is the balance between identity versus issue or virtue with regard

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:23.980
to intensity of emotions?

01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:32.460
Are different orders of passion generated by identity and issues or virtues?

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:36.940
I mean just I just like to say that a lot of can be popular.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.940
Let me let me try.

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.900
Wait hold on Taka's we got a little delay here but Jeff why don't you go first then we'll

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.220
take you talk to us.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:52.100
I think that's a good question because a lot of the fear of populism is the fear of emotions

01:33:52.100 --> 01:34:03.460
in politics as endangering supposedly the virtue of deliberative rationality and I don't

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:12.020
agree with that I think that sociologically mass movements are emotional and in that sense

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:21.860
they all engage in stereotypes they engage in in passion and non rational behavior that

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:27.620
gives them if you want to start from every the center yes it gives them a dimension of

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:32.620
populism but it doesn't make an anti-democratic.

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.820
Taka's?

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:43.220
Well more or less what Jeffrey said but from a slightly different perspective I do not

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:49.220
understand why mass movements are emotional I think they are rational to a very large

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:53.740
extent but let us not argue about that.

01:34:53.740 --> 01:35:00.220
I think that again going trying to answer both questions I was listening to you earlier

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:05.260
guys I mean talking about perhaps populists might be a good thing and populists created

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:12.020
liberallies meant you know to take to technocracy and I was thinking from my little place in

01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:18.380
Europe because I'm in Europe that if I remember well you had an election a few months ago

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:24.860
in the United States and the whole society became very much polarized about those issues

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:29.820
we are all of the motions we are all of technology what do we do with you know COVID-19 how do

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:38.140
we face that and you know rationality technocracy etc etc so that did you forget about that

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:43.940
so populist was not a good thing and this is why the American people voted for you know

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:49.100
a different administration and non populist one because that was the issue I mean a liberallies

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.100
versus liberallies.

01:35:51.100 --> 01:36:00.580
So the interesting thing here is that emotions versus rationality are populists it's always

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:09.580
about words about ethos about emotions about resentment resentment vindictiveness those

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:18.340
are crucial feelings behind the rise of populist movements on the other hand you have rationality

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:25.700
problem solving making positive some games not zero some games how to build positive some

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:33.500
games this is not the game of populist this is the game of liberallies okay so that is

01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:39.460
the the thing that has a balance that has to be achieved in our societies I mean how much

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:46.580
emotion how much rationality what do we want how do we what do we prefer what do we choose

01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:53.100
when you know the chips go down like now with COVID for example so that is you're describing

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:56.940
this is an enormous process for us to understand what they are.

01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:02.180
Well it seems to me I don't know they go to get us forward sample of the importance of

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:11.220
a long term perspective because populism was part of the collapse of the Soviet Union populism

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:17.460
a represent was throughout the Arab Spring that didn't work out as well as it should have

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:23.900
but populism is part of the legacy of the American and French revolutions and that ultimately

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:35.140
strengthens liberal democracy populism can be an enormously liberating thing in the proper

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:47.220
context and so that's why I'd like to keep a window open to the the positive aspects of

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:56.780
populism because in the law in historical long run there it has been very important to my

01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:57.780
way thank you anyway.

01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:04.820
That is fully legitimate Harry I understand that of course but I don't forget that there

01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:10.300
was a populist president in your country a few months ago.

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:18.540
Yes I think that's a perfect example I think the remarks you've made and the remarks I've

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:28.140
made are good examples of the way that populism has in effect a two-faced character it can

01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:36.700
be beneficial and it can be very harmful and you know like like so many other things it

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:42.380
needs to be deployed properly.

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.260
Alex you want to go back fire away with your question?

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:50.300
Yeah so I kind of want to put the mirrors on to the populist leaders so what do you think

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:55.340
about this statement the populism that we see you especially amongst Trump and the other

01:38:55.340 --> 01:39:00.860
leaders you mentioned is a reflection of the road in competence and sadism and incompetence

01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:05.780
being even emotional and confidence and so I've heard references to Venezuela and then

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:11.500
some of Modi's failed policies in India like with the land reform and I think the demonetization

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:15.620
that was a complete catastrophe but I also thought of a funnier example I think it's

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:22.820
also rather telling is the MVP so the member of European Parliament from Hungary I can't

01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:26.460
I don't want to pronounce his name because I'm not going to get it right but he wrote

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:33.500
the Constitution of Hungary that Hungary currently has on his iPad he made gay marriage illegal

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:40.420
and he was found in Belgium at a orgy amongst like 20 other men during the lockdown with

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:45.380
ecstasy on him and so he's like oh that's not mine but boy it's like you know that's

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:49.620
I the other reason I came up with this besides that funny story is that in Hayek Friedrich

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:55.220
Hayek's wrote the serfdom when he looks back on the collectivism amongst Naziism Italian

01:39:55.220 --> 01:40:01.860
fascism and US sarcommism that you have these characters who really exact really brutal

01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:05.500
like this brutalism amongst the people and you really sort of wonder what would these

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:09.980
people be doing if they didn't live in these societies in this way like would they have

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:14.660
this political power and then lastly to bring it more modern if you look at the distinction

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:21.140
in immigration policy between Trump and Obama they did similar things Obama deported I think

01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:25.340
more people than Trump did and a lot of the pictures of kids and cages were also during

01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:30.420
Obama I think Obama was better in general I'm not I'm just saying like what I guess yeah

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:35.020
so what line do we draw between like this incompetence and sadism seen amongst these

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:39.860
populist leaders versus I guess what we see with leaders that we're seeing are normal

01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:46.740
or you know fit the mold that are not populist I mean I think there's definitely a dimension

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:51.580
to which some of these differences are about language about the kind of form of political

01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:58.460
communication and I'm always very interested in what the actual material impact of people's

01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.980
policies are rather than in the way they talk but you have to admit that you know the

01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:09.940
way that politicians and leaders talk does have an effect on the limits of acceptable

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:17.380
discourse on the demonization of minorities in particular I mean I think I think especially

01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:24.900
if you look at the corruption that has come hand in hand with with populist leaders all

01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:29.820
over the map you know the kind of patronage politics or cronyism that you know those are

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:34.020
those are very material impacts that you can see like our contracts going to the friends

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:41.100
of this charismatic leader or not so that those kinds of very concrete authoritarian tendencies

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:48.460
I think are important to keep in mind in competence that's interesting I mean the tendency is

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:53.980
for populist leaders to come in from the outside but not always right Modi is a good example

01:41:53.980 --> 01:42:01.700
he was sort of normal part of BJP politics for a very long time before he came to power

01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:06.660
and it was only because he was stained from from the 2002 scandal in Gujarat the sectarian

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:12.060
violence there that he he had to wait his time before he could he could successfully

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:17.980
run for higher office and he did you know he was kind of forgiven by the elite in various

01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:25.780
ways for his role in that and you know I think some of some of his trade policies and

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:29.900
international development policies and infrastructure policies have worked and some of them have

01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:35.500
been disastrous but you know the I think the lasting legacy is not going to be sort of

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:41.100
the normal politics but rather the demonization of Muslims the reconstruction of India not

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:45.220
as a secular but as a Hindu country and if you think about Trump and his effect we have

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:51.300
a kind of nationalist strain a xenophobic strain in our politics that has not succeeded before

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:56.300
post-World War II I mean other people have had this strain you know think about Pat Buchanan

01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:00.900
and various other people who have been sort of openly nationalistic but you can just sort

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:04.860
of say white nationalist things as a normal member of the Republican Party especially

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:09.060
at the local level and that scene is acceptable and that's a change from the top so I think

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:14.380
I think that's the kind of that's that's the worrisome legacy outlasting any of the

01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:18.780
incompetence or the competence of particular economic or tax policy or whatever else you

01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:19.780
got.

01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:20.780
Okay.

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:26.940
Well, what do you mean by incompetence?

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.740
Can I?

01:43:28.740 --> 01:43:35.860
Yeah well yeah because I yeah because even sort of saw this with because yeah just sorry

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:39.820
just to clarify because you know with the with the people who stormed the Michigan State

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:47.380
House and then even the people who stormed the Capitol building on June January 6th

01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:50.780
there was this idea that they were larping like their live action role playing and so

01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:55.180
this idea that they're enacting a fantasy and then in a way when people talk about even

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:59.740
Trump and some of the policies he did a lot of the time you're like what you know what

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:03.820
like why is he hiring these people who are obviously not good at their jobs like he's

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:08.940
not good at his job to pick competent people so that's what I meant by I guess incompetence

01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:13.540
in that way and I guess even mentally or emotional incompetence would be with the with the you

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:19.260
know talking about the guy from Hungary obviously having maybe being closeted and then enacting

01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:25.180
and then creating a constitution doesn't allow you know civil rights to gay and lesbian couples

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:30.140
so I guess that's it's yeah it's not the most concise definition of incompetence but that's

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:37.940
sort of what I just think words because I mean yeah I mean the Hungarian guy I mean this

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:44.660
happened here in my neighborhood by the way three weeks ago four weeks ago he was you

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.740
know he was a creep I mean he went to that boardy and he was caught and tried to escape

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:55.340
the police he was taken to the police station etc etc I mean that's that's that's okay he

01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:03.380
was a hypocrite anyways I mean he's one of the students of all-bound in Budapest but

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:11.340
that's not the point the point is that police leaders when they come to power they have proven

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:17.540
their competence okay they're strong charismatic leaders in most of the cases they create from

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:24.580
scratch their own parties like Chavez like Orban himself by the way like the Ruscone or

01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:31.620
they take over parties created by others like your Trump for example right or Perron he

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:37.140
created his own party Alberto Fichimor in Peru created his own party Rafael Correa in Ecuador

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:47.860
so those are important strong people with great you know blunt ideas about the future and they

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:58.060
apply radical policies now they may be confident in implementing their policies I don't disagree

01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:04.780
with that of course but they are very charismatic leaders in all the cases there's not any case

01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:12.660
of charismatic leaders if I know again in power that has not had previously a charismatic leader

01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:22.420
so it is that's a fact yeah all right well I think we should as much as I'd like to hear this go on

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:27.820
this has been a wonderful conversation I would say it's incredible I think it's time to wrap up

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:35.660
I want to again thank our our participants for such a lively conversation and our audience too for

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:44.620
