WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
Patrick Rosal and Jean Valentine, we're going to read their poems and discuss each other's

00:06.760 --> 00:13.360
poems and we hope to have a very nice informal conversational experience in which the poets

00:13.360 --> 00:17.040
share their appreciations of each other's poetry.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.920
Patrick, we're lucky to have him as a member of our Poetry Committee here at Helix for

00:21.920 --> 00:24.280
our poetry programming.

00:24.280 --> 00:29.160
He's the author of three full-length poetry collections, most recently Bone Shepherds,

00:29.160 --> 00:35.520
named a notable book by the National Book Critics Circle and the Academy of American Poets.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.240
He's also won the Association of Asian American Studies Book Award, Global Filipino Literary

00:40.240 --> 00:45.560
Award, and the Asian American Writers Workshop Members' Choice Award.

00:45.560 --> 00:50.760
His poems and essays have been published in Grantland, Tin House, Harvard Review, Language

00:50.760 --> 00:54.880
for a New Century, Best American Poetry, and many others.

00:54.880 --> 01:00.120
He's a founding co-editor of some call it Ballin, a sports quarterly, and is a former

01:00.120 --> 01:01.960
Fulbright Fellow.

01:01.960 --> 01:07.720
He teaches on the faculty of Rutgers University, Camden's MFA program.

01:07.720 --> 01:13.840
And Jean Valentine, I think, is the author of a dozen books of poetry, the first being

01:13.840 --> 01:20.640
Dream Barker, which won the Young Young Poets Prize, up through her door on the mountain

01:20.640 --> 01:25.280
new and collected poems, which won the National Book Award for Poetry.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.840
And I think Break the Glass is the most recent book.

01:30.840 --> 01:36.480
She's a recipient of the 2009 Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets.

01:36.480 --> 01:41.200
She's taught at Sarah Lawrence, NYU, and Columbia.

01:41.200 --> 01:48.960
So the format for this afternoon will be that Patrick's going to read some poems, and Jean's

01:48.960 --> 01:52.640
going to have a conversation with him about them.

01:52.640 --> 01:58.040
And then I think Jean is going to read her Lucy sequence, and Patrick is going to talk

01:58.040 --> 02:02.480
with her about his appreciation of that series of poems.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.640
Patrick will read a couple more poems.

02:04.640 --> 02:09.960
Jean will respond, and then I think Jean may finish with a couple of new poems.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.760
Is that still your plan?

02:11.760 --> 02:12.760
Super.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.800
And then we'll have time for the audience to comment.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
So we begin.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
Thank you very much.

02:18.800 --> 02:24.280
Thank you everybody for being here, too.

02:24.280 --> 02:30.160
I'm fighting what I hope is the tail end of a cold.

02:30.160 --> 02:40.400
I'm used to very energetic readings, but I'll muster whatever I can for today.

02:40.400 --> 02:46.360
A lot of the things that I've been interested in lately have been, I've always been interested

02:46.360 --> 02:52.760
in my family history, but more and more I've been trying to place that in terms of a global

02:52.760 --> 02:54.600
history.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.040
My parents are from the Philippines.

02:56.040 --> 03:02.120
This poem is called, The Lendre Undone.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.320
And so we've all been told to shut up.

03:06.320 --> 03:12.240
Don't talk, they say, too fast, too loud, or for too long.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.840
Don't take too much time trying to tell the truth.

03:16.840 --> 03:24.880
But this is my work, to break out among strangers into laughter.

03:24.880 --> 03:30.960
How I've watched small children, for example, fill with the lucky gust a poem can ride into

03:30.960 --> 03:35.440
the mere stillness of a room and dance.

03:35.440 --> 03:42.460
For that, I am always, as now, grateful.

03:42.460 --> 03:48.600
My father tells me in his seminary days, during the Japanese occupation, most of the priests

03:48.600 --> 03:51.520
who ran that school were German.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.560
The boys then were to speak only in Latin and would surely be slapped three Sundays

03:56.560 --> 04:01.600
back if heard speaking in the language of my father's country, which is a beautiful

04:01.600 --> 04:05.120
country and a beautiful language.

04:05.120 --> 04:14.840
And which has a curious word for being so suddenly seized by affection, you clench every muscle

04:14.840 --> 04:20.680
from your eyelids to your toes, for wanting to hold a loved one tight, squeeze one, and

04:20.680 --> 04:28.840
kiss one so deep you place yourself and your beloved on the brink of physical harm.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.360
There's no word for this in English.

04:32.360 --> 04:38.200
No word for those small provinces of silence or for the kind of love that will trouble

04:38.200 --> 04:41.480
that silence into music.

04:41.480 --> 04:50.760
My work is trying to find the very word rippling in my body, which is a woman's body, my mother's,

04:50.760 --> 04:57.160
and a man's body, my father's, and nowhere to be found in the languages that have conquered

04:57.160 --> 04:59.720
the land of my ancestors.

04:59.720 --> 05:05.360
In the outskirts of every empire, there are man-made lakes large enough to receive with

05:05.360 --> 05:09.880
ease, 100 villages worth of bones tossed into them.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.960
This is a fact.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.920
There are more than 7 million illocanos in the Philippines, maybe a million in diaspora.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.840
All of us at one time or another have been told to shut up.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.880
Don't talk too loud, too slow, or for too long.

05:22.880 --> 05:28.720
In Saudi Arabia, in Madrid, in Tokyo, in Milan, on Bowery, near the foot of First Street.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.360
You've been told this.

05:30.360 --> 05:37.360
Some of us have been famous liars, Ferdinand, for example, who married another liar, Ymelda,

05:37.360 --> 05:42.880
and my grandfather, Capitano de Barrio, who clinged to kick the shit bare-fisted and

05:42.880 --> 05:48.640
single-handedly out of 14 ruffians in the small barangay of Santatomas.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.000
Actually, he kicked the shit out of five.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.720
Nine ran away.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.600
These are not lies.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.200
This is the truth.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.520
I'm not wealthy.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.920
I can't buy space or time on billboards or websites.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.400
The name I inherit doesn't part columns in the city's daily journal.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.840
My family comes from a long line of farmers.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.800
My cousins scrubbed their chopping blocks with salt.

06:15.800 --> 06:22.480
They shushed the goats before they killed them.

06:22.480 --> 06:29.640
So Santatomas is essentially a barrio.

06:29.640 --> 06:35.160
And the barangay that my mom comes from is Santatomas.

06:35.160 --> 06:41.840
I was born and raised in New Jersey.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.360
I went to the Philippines for the first time when I was 14.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.560
But I didn't go back for almost 25 years.

06:50.560 --> 06:57.600
So this is a welcoming poem about how I got welcomed to the Philippines after 25 years.

06:57.600 --> 07:08.000
In the middle of my uncle's yard, a goat bounded the hooves wags its tongue.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.520
I've traveled 10,000 miles to be welcomed home by a town that knows me only by my middle

07:13.520 --> 07:18.760
name and photos sent by post more than 25 years ago.

07:18.760 --> 07:23.800
And there is an old man from the foothills of the barrio's far edge who has heard my

07:23.800 --> 07:27.400
uncle Charlie drag this small beast to the block.

07:27.400 --> 07:33.760
Heard the news by music, the bottles, the banging, the laughter inside the slaughter.

07:33.760 --> 07:40.040
The old man limps the half mile by foot up the long dirt road, unshod, a ratty tank top,

07:40.040 --> 07:46.640
a brand new Vegas cap, a cut black strip of inner tube draped around his neck.

07:46.640 --> 07:55.680
And in front of him, he's rolling the whole way, a common jug on its side, emptied of

07:55.680 --> 08:02.360
its vinegar, dusty, immense, to his hip in height and three times the old man's girth.

08:02.360 --> 08:08.080
My uncle is strumming the guts out of his ukulele when the old man arrives and sets the

08:08.080 --> 08:14.880
huge jug upright, pulls the bike tube off his nape and stretches it across the jar's massive

08:14.880 --> 08:21.440
ceramic yawn, holding the rubber strip in place with one big muddy toe and on the downbeat

08:21.440 --> 08:27.560
of the first measure of the second chorus, he joins my uncle in the kind of mooing these

08:27.560 --> 08:34.120
beloved geysers swear has several times tricked a field of blossoms into blue.

08:34.120 --> 08:40.520
The old man plucking from the makeshift base, not so much a moan, but a pulse that ranges

08:40.520 --> 08:47.480
a full octave into each man's chest, the sinews of the old timer's arm straining, the

08:47.480 --> 08:54.360
long muscle of his back top, his quadricep, his calves, his black foot pumping blood into

08:54.360 --> 09:02.280
his whole awful body, his maw flashing every one of his seven good teeth to have him.

09:02.280 --> 09:14.400
And if a man become part of a giant, the song of a giant, each one of us laughing like a

09:14.400 --> 09:21.480
giant, if each one of us fulfill the exact measure of a man, and if the goat at the same

09:21.480 --> 09:28.080
time is singing as it's dying among men who are singing and dying, the youngest cousin

09:28.080 --> 09:35.680
among us butcher slaughtering elbow deep in the animals belly does not sing.

09:35.680 --> 09:44.560
The carcass bloodlet now also silent as if it's stillness were a source of music too,

09:44.560 --> 09:52.680
the way in death one becomes all the sounds one cannot make, the sum total of everything

09:52.680 --> 10:01.480
the living cannot say, sometimes we have to sing just to figure out what we cannot say.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.480
Sure.

10:02.480 --> 10:11.480
Let us know how she feels about your problems.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.480
I love your problems.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
Thanks, Jean.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.520
And it's great to sit here beside you and hear them.

10:19.520 --> 10:25.320
Usually I'm over there hearing them and it's so nice to be near you.

10:25.320 --> 10:34.040
And I was thinking reading them the weeks coming up to now when we would be here.

10:34.040 --> 10:43.760
But I can't really, having her to read, I can't read these without hearing your voice.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.160
And it's so, it's such a gift.

10:47.160 --> 10:55.560
Even if I don't have it really in you being in the room, but the voice is so, as you can

10:55.560 --> 11:04.480
hear, the voice is so present in everything that writes and it's so important.

11:04.480 --> 11:12.120
And one thing I want to ask you is, I've probably been asked this before, but when you're writing,

11:12.120 --> 11:15.400
do you talk it while you're writing it?

11:15.400 --> 11:28.760
Yeah, I think that there's a sort of, you can call it a collaboration between my voice

11:28.760 --> 11:31.760
out loud and my interior voice.

11:31.760 --> 11:38.320
And so I don't know that I necessarily read it while I'm writing it down or composing,

11:38.320 --> 11:43.760
but I certainly, sometimes I will say something and I'll stop to record it.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.160
And then I'll read it again.

11:45.160 --> 11:54.160
So it becomes, it's like kind of transubstantiation between sound and ink, right?

11:54.160 --> 11:57.600
And it goes back and forth between those two substances.

11:57.600 --> 12:03.000
I think that's more what my process is like, but the out loud part feels very important

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
to me.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.880
It's important to you too though, isn't it?

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
Yeah.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.880
Yeah.

12:07.880 --> 12:18.560
It's important to every poet, but I hear, what you've said is perfect for me too, I think,

12:18.560 --> 12:21.680
but not the way I read, as you know.

12:21.680 --> 12:27.800
But I hear the voice inside, and then I put it down.

12:27.800 --> 12:35.320
But I wondered if you actually talked to yourself like Hamlet or somebody.

12:35.320 --> 12:39.480
Well, I love hearing you read.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.720
It's wonderful.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.080
It's beautiful.

12:45.080 --> 12:57.560
And I loved that you have this verse, I guess it is, by Neruda in the front of your book.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.880
You feel like reading that to the folks?

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
I could do it.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.880
Yeah.

13:02.880 --> 13:10.400
I'd like you've had a chance to read that on, but it's wonderful to hear that voice too.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.560
So it's slipping for me now.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.520
My mind is, I'm drawing a blank.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.920
Anyway, I'll read the verse.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.200
It's from Heights of Machu Picchu.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.400
I can't remember which section it is though.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.640
Show me your blood and your furrows.

13:28.640 --> 13:34.480
Show me I was punished here because the jewel didn't shine or the earth didn't surrender

13:34.480 --> 13:37.680
it stone or grain on time.

13:37.680 --> 13:43.440
Point out to me the rock you fell upon and the wood on which they crucified you.

13:43.440 --> 13:49.680
Strike for me into fire the old flint, the ancient lanterns, the whips lashed upon those

13:49.680 --> 13:52.480
wounds throughout centuries.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.200
Show me blood-bright hatchets.

13:55.200 --> 14:00.480
I come to speak through your dead mouth.

14:00.480 --> 14:05.520
Thank you.

14:05.520 --> 14:11.760
I love having that in the front of your book because I think it's what you're doing.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.400
Not always dead mouths, but through others' mouths.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.520
And I think that's really what poetry is doing.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.720
Do you hear us okay?

14:20.720 --> 14:22.520
Yeah?

14:22.520 --> 14:32.360
I think the great poet Mary Ponzo is among us, so I just want to be sure she's hearing

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
this.

14:33.360 --> 14:45.200
I think I've never really, I don't think, met a poet who isn't trying to speak for others

14:45.200 --> 14:57.040
at least some of the time and for people who couldn't speak for themselves oftentimes

14:57.040 --> 14:59.720
or who you feel that about.

14:59.720 --> 15:08.200
But when you read, I've seen you, we work together at Drew University, so I've seen Patrick

15:08.200 --> 15:15.200
read on different occasions something formal like this or something where you're helping

15:15.200 --> 15:22.480
to get something going or to announce students' names who are going to read at that time

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
or something like that.

15:23.480 --> 15:30.680
So I've seen you in different degrees of formality or not.

15:30.680 --> 15:46.120
I think you have such a gift of really using your body, I know you must hear this all the

15:46.120 --> 15:53.400
time, but really the whole body comes into Pat's poetry and not just the voice.

15:53.400 --> 16:02.240
So that's something like I suppose we might be used to a great actor doing, but it isn't

16:02.240 --> 16:09.680
every poet who can even aspire to that and it's a wonderful gift I think.

16:09.680 --> 16:14.240
Can I say something?

16:14.240 --> 16:18.000
Of course you can't.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.480
The Kwame Dawes says, he talks about the sound of a drum and that the striking of the drum,

16:26.480 --> 16:33.080
the moment that you strike it, the attack is like a consonant.

16:33.080 --> 16:39.560
And when the drum rings, those are like the vowels of language, so he likens language

16:39.560 --> 16:42.080
to making drums.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
My buddy Roger just told me this last night, I think it's brilliant.

16:45.080 --> 16:52.240
What I think also is fascinating about that too is that in terms of language, the consonants

16:52.240 --> 16:55.920
are mostly made here up in the mouth.

16:55.920 --> 17:05.080
So those become the percussion and the metronomic sounds in a line or in a poem and that ringing

17:05.080 --> 17:13.800
of the drum, boom, the vowels, they become the harmonics that come between percussiveness,

17:13.800 --> 17:18.920
but they also, they come literally from the body in order to sing them out loud.

17:18.920 --> 17:28.280
You can't say a vowel without, it comes from the body and so, you know, I wasn't trained

17:28.280 --> 17:34.000
as a singer and an actor, but I think that I've always felt very, I was a dancer, I was

17:34.000 --> 17:36.200
a street dancer when I was younger.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.720
I've always felt very connected to my body.

17:39.720 --> 17:48.560
So I think that you're reading something about my own practices and my own engagement with

17:48.560 --> 17:49.560
art.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.760
Coming from that, yeah.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.760
Yeah, thanks, that's fascinating.

17:54.760 --> 18:02.280
I never thought of that consonant vowel thing before, but you mentioned musical instruments

18:02.280 --> 18:10.440
and it's a mouth a lot in your poetry, of course, drums, we just had a wonderful one, that amazing

18:10.440 --> 18:12.440
barrel with the tire.

18:12.440 --> 18:16.160
God, I love that.

18:16.160 --> 18:22.120
And then guitars and, yeah, homemade things.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.120
Yeah.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Piano.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.560
Piano is definitely piano.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.560
Yeah.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.640
Beautiful one.

18:29.640 --> 18:33.520
Maybe you'll read that to us later on.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.320
That's a big poem.

18:35.320 --> 18:45.960
You know, when I was young, I think the biggest reader I ever heard are the most impressive

18:45.960 --> 18:48.440
reader I ever heard was Dylan Thomas.

18:48.440 --> 18:49.440
Oh, wow, yeah.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.200
You ever hear recordings of him?

18:51.200 --> 18:52.200
I have, I have.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.200
Yeah.

18:53.200 --> 18:58.640
And I think although it's different, he came from a tradition, the Welsh tradition of

18:58.640 --> 19:07.720
singing and reading and he just took our heads off when he came over here, you know?

19:07.720 --> 19:09.560
I just, I never heard anything like it.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.520
I'm sure there was stuff like it, but I just never heard it.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
Yeah.

19:14.520 --> 19:20.200
And speaking of consonants, I mean, the way that he sort of was able to conjure sound

19:20.200 --> 19:22.560
in a poem is just unbelievable.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.440
He's a real model for me in that way.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.440
He's a real model.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.440
Yeah.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.440
Wow.

19:29.440 --> 19:39.560
There's so many different styles of reading, but I really love, I love sound so much.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.280
It feels like it's more than half of what goes on.

19:42.280 --> 19:48.320
Were there any readers throughout your career?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
Were there any readers?

19:49.320 --> 19:58.000
I think that it's sort of, it's easy to perhaps remember people who are dynamic.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.600
They're like readers and good readers.

20:00.600 --> 20:07.600
But were there readers who were more pulled back that you found not just their poems being

20:07.600 --> 20:12.600
sort of arresting, but the performance of their poems?

20:12.600 --> 20:14.600
Being arresting?

20:14.600 --> 20:20.480
Yeah, or being able to grab your attention by being not sort of bardic necessarily, but

20:20.480 --> 20:23.040
more interior in their performance.

20:23.040 --> 20:27.840
Oh, more interior and arresting in that way.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.840
Yeah.

20:28.840 --> 20:29.840
More.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.840
Yeah, I would think, well, let me just think for a minute.

20:34.840 --> 20:43.960
There was a couple of interesting things about Robert Lowell.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.240
I don't know if you've heard him on a tape or anything.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.880
I think he'd never heard any tapes of him read ever.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.240
Well, he was from New England, but he had gone into a southern accent somewhere along

20:53.240 --> 20:54.240
the way.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.920
It was important to him.

20:56.920 --> 21:02.440
So that was one surprise when you heard him read if you didn't know anything about him.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.120
You thought he came from Boston, which he did.

21:06.120 --> 21:14.120
But then he, at first, would we, and I didn't hear this, but he talked about it in interviews.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.000
I don't know if any of you ever heard him in life?

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
You did, yeah.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.840
Oh, great evening at St. Mark's Church.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.040
Ginsburg was there.

21:25.040 --> 21:29.920
And Peter Orlowski was sort of giving him a hard time from the sidelines.

21:29.920 --> 21:33.160
And Ginsburg was very like a supplicant.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.600
It was surprising to see, because most of us were sort of younger, heard of hippie-ish

21:37.600 --> 21:40.120
group, sort of on the Ginsburg side of things.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.240
He got right down and he kind of kneeled in front of Lowell as he was reading.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.240
It was Ginsburg.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.240
It was quite a sight.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
That's wonderful.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
I think they became friends at the end.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.240
Yeah, that's beautiful.

21:52.240 --> 21:59.280
I heard that they went on a march to Washington together.

21:59.280 --> 22:03.600
And there was a reading, and of course Ginsburg is heard by everyone.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.520
And Lowell got up there, and there was a mic and everything.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.800
But people kept saying, we can't hear you.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.320
We can't hear you.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.600
And he said, well, I can't do anything.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.120
I could shout, but you still wouldn't hear me.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.640
It was a big, huge crowd of people, I guess.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.360
He just didn't have that Ginsburg.

22:20.360 --> 22:28.120
But the interesting thing that I was going to say is anecdotal anyway, that he would

22:28.120 --> 22:32.600
read quite formally as he wrote at the beginning.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.840
And I think quite resolved.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.440
But then he went out on a reading tour in California.

22:39.440 --> 22:43.240
He said, no, the country in those days.

22:43.240 --> 22:48.720
It was very different, politically and far geographically.

22:48.720 --> 23:02.040
And I think he sensed that nobody understood a word he was saying in this very formal,

23:02.040 --> 23:11.680
very kind of formal metrics as well as formal language.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.920
And it was before life studies.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.760
It was the more formal work before that.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.800
And people just didn't get it.

23:18.800 --> 23:27.400
And so he started in response to audiences talking much less formal, including the way

23:27.400 --> 23:29.680
he would read.

23:29.680 --> 23:34.200
But he would also stop and say something if he thought people weren't getting it.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.120
So it was happening in front of people's eyes that he was changing his style of writing

23:39.120 --> 23:43.520
too, as we found out later when he got to life studies.

23:43.520 --> 23:49.840
So the audience helped transform the way that he saw his own poems.

23:49.840 --> 23:54.600
I mean, that's a wonderful story, I think, an interesting story anyway.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.640
Now, people don't think of you as somebody who performs your poems, but you do embody

23:58.640 --> 24:05.880
your poems in the way that you're crafting silences and your lyrics.

24:05.880 --> 24:14.800
But do you imagine yourself or do you think about performance at all or an interaction

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
with the audience?

24:15.800 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, I want to talk to the audience.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.600
I want to reach the audience very much.

24:22.600 --> 24:28.240
But I don't think of myself as performing because I've seen yourself and other people

24:28.240 --> 24:31.720
who really can reach probably wide audiences.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.880
And I don't think I would be good at that.

24:33.880 --> 24:40.080
But sound is everything to me.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.760
So I want to have that.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.600
And if I've got a good mic, I'm okay, I think.

24:44.600 --> 24:50.360
But as you know, if I don't, it's pretty hard.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.360
I haven't ever learned how to really project my voice.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.680
So I need a mic.

24:54.680 --> 25:03.560
As you were saying before, you feel that probably all poets want to speak also for someone

25:03.560 --> 25:09.960
else who doesn't have the same capacity to speak.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.120
And that should bring us to Lucy.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.080
Because you're speaking to Lucy and speaking for Lucy.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.080
And...

25:17.080 --> 25:18.080
Cross my fingers.

25:18.080 --> 25:21.240
Yeah, she certainly spoke to me.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Yeah.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.920
Yeah, thank you for bringing her up.

25:23.920 --> 25:30.920
I'll read that later when we get to my turn.

25:30.920 --> 25:42.200
I was thinking when we were talking about sound and performing how I once, when I was

25:42.200 --> 25:47.600
in Ireland, there was another anecdote, but there was a sign by the road that said poetry

25:47.600 --> 25:49.080
school.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.920
And it was pointing down this way.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.280
And so I said to the guy, I was, I said, let's go.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.440
I was so lonely, I was dying.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
You know.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.400
So I said, let's go see the poetry school.

25:59.400 --> 26:03.320
And so we drove down this little dirt road and it got to the ocean.

26:03.320 --> 26:10.080
And there was a few rocks piled up on each other where you could go in and say it.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.280
And it said poetry school.

26:12.280 --> 26:17.560
And I thought, that is the best.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.440
I ought to just stop right here, you know.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.440
Never leave.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.520
It was just wonderful.

26:23.520 --> 26:30.960
But I was thinking about the first poets probably, they had to speak.

26:30.960 --> 26:34.640
They wouldn't have gotten the job otherwise, right?

26:34.640 --> 26:38.320
I mean, that was the job, I think.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.920
That's not true anymore, but I think it's true of some people.

26:41.920 --> 26:42.920
Yeah.

26:42.920 --> 26:43.920
Yeah.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.920
So should we hear Lucy?

26:45.920 --> 26:46.920
We could do Lucy.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
I don't know how time is.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.920
Do you do this?

26:48.920 --> 26:49.920
Well, we're going to think about it.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.960
I don't know how time is.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.200
Well, we're going to 3.30, so I don't know.

26:57.200 --> 27:01.000
You think it's probably 20 minutes to read those poems or more?

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't know.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.760
I can stop at 20 minutes though.

27:03.760 --> 27:09.720
But you want to get Patrick a chance to respond to the Lucy sequence and we have some more

27:09.720 --> 27:11.040
things to read.

27:11.040 --> 27:15.440
And to read more to us.

27:15.440 --> 27:18.280
Well I don't know if you can hear back there.

27:18.280 --> 27:22.520
I said, okay, you're where you want to be.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
Okay.

27:23.520 --> 27:36.280
This is a sequence about Lucy who is a hominid so called, whose skeleton is approximately

27:36.280 --> 27:38.360
3.2 million years old.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.800
You've probably heard about her.

27:40.800 --> 27:45.040
And they found her skeleton in 1974.

27:45.040 --> 27:55.640
And she was, if I understand it right, she was one of the first early people who was

27:55.640 --> 27:59.080
able to stand up and walk.

27:59.080 --> 28:06.000
And for me she's very much a mother.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.920
And one thing about standing up is you can then hold your child in your arms because

28:11.920 --> 28:14.120
you're not on all fours.

28:14.120 --> 28:21.760
And so that was one of the moving things about her, that development of humans.

28:21.760 --> 28:32.800
And she was found, I told you in 1974, the Ethiopian people where she was found referred

28:32.800 --> 28:41.360
to her as Dinkenos, which is an Amharic language term meaning you are beautiful.

28:41.360 --> 28:51.760
And they called her Lucy, the, what do you call the people who find skeletons?

28:51.760 --> 28:58.400
Anthropologists, paleontologists, people who found her called her Lucy because they got

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
back to the campground.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.440
Oh, this is a thing I love about this finding.

29:02.440 --> 29:08.680
And if you went to the museums or any of the exhibits you'd see, they were walking along,

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
end of the long day.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.240
And they didn't see anything, they were looking for her but they couldn't find anything.

29:13.240 --> 29:17.880
And then one of them saw a little gland of light out of his eye and he turned around

29:17.880 --> 29:23.320
and it was a bone poking up from the sand or earth or whatever it was.

29:23.320 --> 29:28.080
And they went back and that was the beginning of the skeleton that they found.

29:28.080 --> 29:34.560
And I love that because it must happen all the time but you know it's just chance what

29:34.560 --> 29:38.160
we would call chance if you hadn't turned around.

29:38.160 --> 29:45.400
You know, somebody else would have found it later maybe but it's so chancey.

29:45.400 --> 29:52.280
And then when they got back to the campground, the radio was playing Lucy in the sky with

29:52.280 --> 29:53.280
diamonds.

29:53.280 --> 30:03.920
This was Beatles time so they named her Lucy from that.

30:03.920 --> 30:11.560
Lucy, your secret book that you leaned over and wrote just in the dirt.

30:11.560 --> 30:17.440
Not having to have an ending, not having to last.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.760
This is a quote from a song.

30:21.760 --> 30:29.160
In thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there

30:29.160 --> 30:31.760
was none of them.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.960
And this is the poem again.

30:35.960 --> 30:42.080
Two hands were all you owned for food, for love.

30:42.080 --> 30:47.440
Now you own none Lucy nor no words.

30:47.440 --> 30:55.200
Only breath marks, breath marks only nor no words.

30:55.200 --> 31:04.360
For what do you do now, Lucy, for love, your eyes?

31:04.360 --> 31:12.080
This has a quote from William Carlos Williams, my saxophage that splits the rocks.

31:12.080 --> 31:16.640
Lucy, my saxophage that splits the rocks.

31:16.640 --> 31:23.280
Wild good mother, you fill my center hole with bliss.

31:23.280 --> 31:34.240
No one is so tender in her scream, wants me so much, not just but brings me to be, is

31:34.240 --> 31:41.160
when I am close to death and close to life.

31:41.160 --> 31:51.000
The spider in her web, three days dead on the window, Lucy.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.600
In the electricity of love, it's lightning strike or in its quiet hum in the thighs,

31:58.600 --> 32:05.480
like this little ice box here, not knowing any better, or in the dumb hum of the heater

32:05.480 --> 32:07.800
going on.

32:07.800 --> 32:17.120
Little stirs in the room tone, I rush outdoors into the air you are, Lucy, and you rush out

32:17.120 --> 32:27.120
to receive me, at last there you are, who I always knew was there, but almost died, not

32:27.120 --> 32:29.000
meeting.

32:29.000 --> 32:40.520
When my scraped out child died, Lucy, you hold her all the time.

32:40.520 --> 32:46.600
This one has some names of people I knew who died around this same time, this next one,

32:46.600 --> 32:58.160
also talks about a story of Chekhov's called Easter Eve, where there's a fairy man in

32:58.160 --> 33:03.240
this story whose name is Jero Neem.

33:03.240 --> 33:13.040
Lucy, when the dark bodies dropped out of the towers, when Ruth died and Grace and

33:13.040 --> 33:26.200
Helen Ruth, and Iraq, and Iraq, and Nikolay, Lucy, when Jane in her last clothes goes across

33:26.200 --> 33:40.720
with Chekhov, you are the fairy man, the monk, Jero Neem, who throws your weight on the rope.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.800
I wash my plate and spoon as carefully as a priest.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.320
Did you have a cup, Lucy?

33:48.320 --> 33:54.560
Oh God, who transcends time, let Lucy have a cup.

33:54.560 --> 34:00.320
You Bodhisattva, here with us, you wanted to come back.

34:00.320 --> 34:05.200
I'm afraid and can't pay attention to it.

34:05.200 --> 34:10.640
I'm wild with heat and cold, and my head hurts.

34:10.640 --> 34:17.600
The nine wild turkeys come up calmly to the porch to see you, Lucy.

34:17.600 --> 34:24.960
When I was writing this, I began to get the idea that Lucy's name, at least, was going

34:24.960 --> 34:27.840
to be in every one of these things.

34:27.840 --> 34:34.000
I didn't have any idea about that beforehand, or anything else, really.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.120
This is called My Work of Art for Lucy.

34:39.120 --> 34:46.480
It's a piece of brown wrapping paper taped to the wall over the table in this beautiful

34:46.480 --> 34:50.200
room with no pictures.

34:50.200 --> 34:57.560
First written across the top, quote, it was as if she was standing across the road waiting

34:57.560 --> 35:02.200
to see if anyone wanted to get to know her.

35:02.200 --> 35:08.600
Then taped under that, forgive my German, I'm going to quote Rilke for one line only,

35:08.600 --> 35:15.040
do dare do vise, und gessen, vaiten, svissen.

35:15.040 --> 35:22.560
You, this is Rilke still, you who know and whose vast knowing is born of poverty, abundance

35:22.560 --> 35:24.840
of poverty.

35:24.840 --> 35:31.360
Make it so the poor are no longer despised and thrown away.

35:31.360 --> 35:38.440
Look at them standing around like wildflowers, which have nowhere else to grow.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.080
That's Rilke.

35:41.080 --> 35:51.320
Then a blue panther, a 26 cent stamp from Florida for postcards, then a Catalpa leaf curling

35:51.320 --> 35:57.800
from its huge curving stem, curving rather from its huge curving stem.

35:57.800 --> 36:06.040
The leaf a little broken and its passing from the west onto the east.

36:06.040 --> 36:12.920
And the note, I found this leaf on my way to the post office.

36:12.920 --> 36:23.880
Then Lucy, you, hominid, sapiens, seperi to taste be wise.

36:23.880 --> 36:29.480
Rilkeleton standing around like a wildflower.

36:29.480 --> 36:42.560
Lucy, what you want that I will do to hear you know your poem, but you need nothing.

36:42.560 --> 36:51.680
The deer and the wild turkeys that draw close now to hear you my life is for.

36:51.680 --> 37:03.920
In its language, your voice, I can't tell cold from heat, anxiety, dust, death, no,

37:03.920 --> 37:07.160
not even dust.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.760
So I don't know.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.560
Let's finish it up.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
Okay, we'll finish it up.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.240
But hang that too much further to go.

37:14.240 --> 37:24.120
Your picture, brown museum hair, brush the way they brush it there, brow lit from inside,

37:24.120 --> 37:30.840
intelligent eyebrows, a slightly wrinkly nose, a little flat.

37:30.840 --> 37:36.480
Brown woman, I want your nose, your cheekbones of light.

37:36.480 --> 37:40.640
I was brown, I got white.

37:40.640 --> 37:49.560
Her large and friendly mouth, half open, in a half smile, surprised.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.400
But Lucy, your eyes.

37:53.400 --> 38:03.200
So I gave all I had to the poor, standing around like wildflowers.

38:03.200 --> 38:09.000
Lucy, the spider moved last night and again this morning.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.680
I wonder, do you sleep and wake where you are now?

38:14.680 --> 38:17.080
Do spiders hibernate?

38:17.080 --> 38:21.560
Do they lay eggs and webs on window panes?

38:21.560 --> 38:27.080
You must know everything.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.200
Enter the sweet why.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.800
Don't treat it or question why.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.280
Whistle why.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.760
Whisper why.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.560
Was sweetness done to you?

38:38.560 --> 38:45.200
What I wanted most, the mother, has come to me.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.360
Will she stay in my ear?

38:48.360 --> 38:51.360
Lucy, is it you?

38:51.360 --> 38:56.560
Still all night long my Lucy, I entreat you.

38:56.560 --> 39:02.360
I will not let thee go except thou bless me.

39:02.360 --> 39:10.440
Well, here comes another character in the last few pages of this and his name is Martin

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
Ramirez.

39:11.440 --> 39:16.280
He's what we call an untaught artist.

39:16.280 --> 39:21.920
And I have to just say that I was looking at his work one time.

39:21.920 --> 39:30.120
He did a lot of tunnels, railroad tunnels and railroad tracks and landscapes around railroad

39:30.120 --> 39:37.640
because he was a railroad worker from Mexico, came to California.

39:37.640 --> 39:43.840
What they say had a nervous breakdown, no longer could do that work, was put into a hospital

39:43.840 --> 39:50.560
and mental hospital in California where he began to draw and paint.

39:50.560 --> 39:57.880
And different people in the hospital helped him and brought him crayons and pencils and

39:57.880 --> 40:01.480
paper and everything he needed and gave him time.

40:01.480 --> 40:08.280
And one of the doctors particularly collected his work and that's why we have it.

40:08.280 --> 40:12.880
And so when you go to these folk art museums and so forth you can find his work there,

40:12.880 --> 40:14.720
Martin Ramirez.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.400
And I don't know how he got into this but here he is.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.800
Except I love him.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.000
That could be why.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.720
You think so?

40:24.720 --> 40:28.680
You love coming to the poems, don't they?

40:28.680 --> 40:32.840
Martin Ramirez, be with me.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.640
It looks, oh this is something I heard in the gallery when I was looking at one of his

40:36.640 --> 40:39.160
paintings of tunnels.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.440
I'll start over.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.880
Martin Ramirez, be with me.

40:43.880 --> 40:48.000
It looks just like a vagina, a bystander said.

40:48.000 --> 40:55.920
Yes, it is a vagina with chains and tunnels and like in the great cathedrals a clitoris,

40:55.920 --> 41:05.440
a starry one and a womb, John T. Martin being born, Lucy, did you hear animal woman screams

41:05.440 --> 41:06.920
in the night?

41:06.920 --> 41:08.760
Were you afraid?

41:08.760 --> 41:10.840
Was it you last night?

41:10.840 --> 41:17.560
Your scream over and over as you give birth.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.400
How did you pray, Lucy?

41:20.400 --> 41:25.640
You were a prayer, your hands and toes.

41:25.640 --> 41:35.000
When writing came back to me, I prayed with lipstick on the windshield as I drove.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.560
Newton made up with the world.

41:37.560 --> 41:41.160
He had already turned himself into gold.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.200
He was already there.

41:44.200 --> 41:53.280
A skeleton woman in, down, over, around.

41:53.280 --> 41:58.520
Blessing from the old English bleats the end.

41:58.520 --> 42:02.560
Its root is the same as for blood.

42:02.560 --> 42:07.560
My head is at your window, Lucy, at your glass.

42:07.560 --> 42:10.800
But we offer nothing but money now.

42:10.800 --> 42:15.080
We beam it to each other near and far.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.720
But you are my skeleton mother.

42:17.720 --> 42:23.760
I bring you coffee in your cemetery bed.

42:23.760 --> 42:31.880
This morning I miss most of all you, Martin, and her who when you were born looked and

42:31.880 --> 42:34.720
blessed your beauty.

42:34.720 --> 42:44.280
You see, when you are with me, I feel the atoms racing everywhere in this old oak table

42:44.280 --> 42:53.280
in the eight pointed double star spider and in the starry rippling all around us.

42:53.280 --> 43:05.360
Newton woman, guardian, death woman, Lucy, here, a picnic, cornbread, here, an orange

43:05.360 --> 43:16.640
with my teen and me at the lip of the earth's surface world.

43:16.640 --> 43:28.360
So, last semester, this spring, actually, I first taught this course in the fall semester

43:28.360 --> 43:29.360
to undergraduates.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.440
It's about digital remix of all things.

43:32.440 --> 43:41.400
And that I taught it again as a graduate seminar in this past spring.

43:41.400 --> 43:47.080
So Lucy Palmas is one of the assignments that I signed in this digital remix course.

43:47.080 --> 43:51.880
So for the remix, for those of you who might not be familiar with the concept, essentially

43:51.880 --> 44:02.440
remix is gathering random or disorganized data or even organized data for that matter

44:02.440 --> 44:05.640
and then reorganizing it into another form.

44:05.640 --> 44:09.320
Any kind of data can be sound or whatever.

44:09.320 --> 44:16.000
This is how I've almost always composed poems because I came out of a music production background.

44:16.000 --> 44:24.600
I thought about gathering data, gathering bits and figuring out ways in which these different

44:24.600 --> 44:28.240
pieces fit together.

44:28.240 --> 44:37.040
Reading the Lucy poem gave me this window, I think, into what many, if not all of Jean's

44:37.040 --> 44:41.320
poems are about or the process anyway.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.720
And that I think it's about collecting bits.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.080
And it's very clear.

44:45.080 --> 44:50.280
She was sort of, she was making the commentary and she was going along, but there's a quote

44:50.280 --> 44:51.280
from Assam.

44:51.280 --> 44:54.680
There's a catalog of the dead.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.640
There's personal memory.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.840
There's an elegiac address.

44:58.840 --> 45:03.440
These are not necessarily things that you will find next to one another.

45:03.440 --> 45:13.320
Up here in this long poem inspired by Lucy, she draws them together and rearranges them.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.920
I don't mean to talk about you in third person, but it's funny, Eugene.

45:16.920 --> 45:20.400
I'm happy.

45:20.400 --> 45:28.040
I actually had never heard of Joseph Cornell before Jean had told me about his work.

45:28.040 --> 45:31.680
And I'm fascinated now with his boxes.

45:31.680 --> 45:39.720
And I see a real correlation between what Cornell is doing in terms of collecting these

45:39.720 --> 45:46.280
bits and arranging them in boxes and what you're doing in poems.

45:46.280 --> 45:49.880
Is that, do you see that parallel as well?

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
Not until this matter.

45:50.880 --> 45:53.520
But I'm very happy with it.

45:53.520 --> 45:54.520
Is this still working?

45:54.520 --> 45:57.680
I'm very happy with it.

45:57.680 --> 46:04.680
I love him as you know, and is my cooking?

46:04.680 --> 46:07.680
Yes.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.480
I get you.

46:09.480 --> 46:12.440
Yeah, I love him.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.680
But I've never thought of doing that.

46:15.680 --> 46:19.320
But on purpose, you know, like he did.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.400
But you know, he did it first little brother.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.240
It's so sweet.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
Yeah.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.280
So I guess that would be a wonderful reason to make anything.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.280
Yeah.

46:30.280 --> 46:34.040
I'm so happy to know that you love him so much too.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.040
Yeah.

46:35.040 --> 46:44.520
I think the other thing that I love about that sequence too is that the book has, it's

46:44.520 --> 46:45.760
elegiac also, the book.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.880
I mean, it has the elegy for Reginald Shepard in there too.

46:49.880 --> 46:55.640
And so this long sequence ends a book that goes in and out of elegy.

46:55.640 --> 46:59.760
This is a long sequence that ends up addressing the dead.

46:59.760 --> 47:04.920
And it's the oldest dead that we know in some ways, the oldest standing dead that we know.

47:04.920 --> 47:09.280
And I love that pairing.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.160
And what is it that paleontologists do?

47:11.160 --> 47:12.960
They excavate.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.400
They dig up the remains.

47:15.400 --> 47:19.440
I think poets are trying to do that also.

47:19.440 --> 47:23.640
And in fact, in DJ culture, one of the things that you learn is the art of digging, which

47:23.640 --> 47:32.600
is going into record stores and finding sounds and records that nobody has found before.

47:32.600 --> 47:33.600
Right?

47:33.600 --> 47:39.200
And anyway, so on so many different levels, that long poem, I mean, it's just a moving

47:39.200 --> 47:47.000
poem anyway in terms of both personal and long historical meditation on motherhood, on

47:47.000 --> 47:53.840
being in the world, on death, on living, on making art for that matter.

47:53.840 --> 48:01.080
On so many levels, that poem is beautiful to me.

48:01.080 --> 48:08.080
And I think that if I told people that you work, I find these parallels between your

48:08.080 --> 48:13.120
work and mine or the way that I think about art, I think if people heard us, people saw

48:13.120 --> 48:17.720
us walking together in the street, they'd be like, what an uncoupled they are.

48:17.720 --> 48:20.600
In my mind, I think we make the most sense, actually.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.600
Yeah.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.600
I feel the same way.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.600
Yeah.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.600
I feel the same way.

48:24.600 --> 48:25.600
I'm so happy.

48:25.600 --> 48:30.000
Well, because I do think when I'm reading through this book of yours, which I have here

48:30.000 --> 48:33.440
Bone Shepherd, it's really a sequence, too.

48:33.440 --> 48:34.440
I feel that.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.440
You know?

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
I don't know if you've thought of it that way, any of you.

48:37.440 --> 48:52.480
But it really may partly come from being in such a, your family's part of diaspora and

48:52.480 --> 48:59.480
your drawing on a lot of that and your travels back and your travels back here and all that.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.440
And that's a little further back in my life.

49:01.440 --> 49:05.080
But I wonder, quite a few generations back.

49:05.080 --> 49:14.320
But I wonder if part of that is maybe unconsciously wanting to bring things together a little

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
bit.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.320
Absolutely.

49:16.320 --> 49:23.160
Like making a box for your younger brother or putting things in it, even if it's not

49:23.160 --> 49:29.640
a pointed to sequence, things that do kind of, I felt that reading your book a lot, yeah,

49:29.640 --> 49:31.440
this book.

49:31.440 --> 49:37.000
And I feel it when you read, you know, from music to speech, too.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.680
That's another kind of historical sequence, isn't it?

49:43.680 --> 49:44.680
For everyone.

49:44.680 --> 49:48.880
But with you, it's very, very alive, you know?

49:48.880 --> 49:50.880
And I love that.

49:50.880 --> 49:56.960
So I wonder if this happens to you, because what happens to me, and there's poets in the

49:56.960 --> 49:59.080
room, I'm sure I'd love to hear.

49:59.080 --> 50:05.040
When I was writing the Lucy thing, I was very fortunate, because I was in one of these artist

50:05.040 --> 50:08.000
colonies for probably a month or something.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.200
I had nothing to do at all.

50:10.200 --> 50:15.200
And so, except if I could write something.

50:15.200 --> 50:21.760
But with that kind of silence or any kind of silence we can find, you know, or a little

50:21.760 --> 50:28.560
space, maybe in the summer vacation or something like that.

50:28.560 --> 50:36.440
I wonder if things come to you the way, I just sort of sat there, and things come, you

50:36.440 --> 50:37.800
know, by themselves.

50:37.800 --> 50:41.400
If you can have that kind of quiet, sometimes that will happen.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.480
It doesn't always happen.

50:42.480 --> 50:46.080
But this poem, that was happening.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.240
You know, I'm just copying down.

50:48.240 --> 50:49.240
Wow.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.240
Really great.

50:50.240 --> 50:51.920
Coping down what I heard.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.400
So a lot of it came just as it was.

50:54.400 --> 51:00.040
Because I've seen you sort of, I'm confessing here that I've peaked over your shoulder while

51:00.040 --> 51:05.240
you're kind of composing on your yellow pad, and I see you arranging and crossing out.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.240
Yeah, I'll do that.

51:06.240 --> 51:11.080
But for this poem, it seemed to sort of let itself out.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.640
Pretty much as is.

51:12.640 --> 51:19.280
You know, I had to look up some stuff, but I even went to the house and used the phone.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.760
I didn't have a cell phone.

51:20.760 --> 51:26.840
I went up to the house of the writer's colony and called up a friend, mutual friend of

51:26.840 --> 51:28.400
ours, Anne-Marie Macare.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.800
I said, I can't stop writing this thing.

51:31.800 --> 51:34.960
I said, I've been depressed, but I've never been manic.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.280
You think I'm in trouble?

51:36.280 --> 51:40.360
You know, I was going day after day, you know, writing this thing.

51:40.360 --> 51:45.040
She said, you know, she said, isn't it funny when something good happens.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.400
People think they've done something wrong.

51:47.400 --> 51:54.320
Yeah, and she said, it sounds like you've got a little more to do on that poem.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.960
Why don't you go on back and do it?

51:55.960 --> 51:58.760
And she said, just don't operate any heavy machinery.

51:58.760 --> 52:01.680
You can hear her say.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.840
I can totally hear her say.

52:03.840 --> 52:06.480
Both of her, you know, in common.

52:06.480 --> 52:09.520
But it was just amazing.

52:09.520 --> 52:16.000
I don't usually certainly get things like that, but I wondered if you do sometimes.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Occasionally.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.400
And it does, I mean, teaching doesn't allow for a whole lot of silence because most of

52:23.400 --> 52:28.240
that quiet time is being used to think about my students and so forth.

52:28.240 --> 52:33.040
But you know, I just told you I moved to Philadelphia about a month and a half ago.

52:33.040 --> 52:38.280
And it's a different quality of silence than living in New York City or other places that

52:38.280 --> 52:39.280
I've been.

52:39.280 --> 52:45.960
And there's a kind of, I don't know, you just settle into a place.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.200
And images arrive.

52:48.200 --> 52:58.960
I think part of it is that the silence allows me to access deep memory.

52:58.960 --> 53:03.920
And that doesn't necessarily mean that this deep memory is whole.

53:03.920 --> 53:11.280
Sometimes this deep memory is fragmented, but it's their intense fragments.

53:11.280 --> 53:14.960
So yeah, I have a very intimate relationship with silence.

53:14.960 --> 53:18.960
I would have thought so.

53:18.960 --> 53:19.960
Yeah.

53:19.960 --> 53:25.960
So if you want to help an artist, give them some silence.

53:25.960 --> 53:26.960
That's it.

53:26.960 --> 53:27.960
That's the thing.

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Yeah.

53:28.960 --> 53:32.960
That's why they had that poetry school down by the way.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.960
Down by the ocean, a couple of rocks.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.960
It's got the waves, but nothing much else.

53:37.960 --> 53:38.960
Oh God.

53:38.960 --> 53:43.960
So, Packard, maybe you could read a couple more of your beautiful poems.

53:43.960 --> 53:44.960
Yeah.

53:44.960 --> 53:50.960
I'm sure which ones I gave you later.

53:50.960 --> 53:58.960
I'm just going to start picking from the book.

53:58.960 --> 54:25.960
I wonder if maybe I'll read a couple of poems that I don't normally read out loud.

54:25.960 --> 54:32.960
There's still quite narrative of the poems, but they make more lyric leaps in Al-Ajean

54:32.960 --> 54:36.600
Valentine than many of my other poems do.

54:36.600 --> 54:42.960
So this one's called Undrowning.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.720
In Spanish, there's a word called disallerci.

54:45.720 --> 54:51.240
I learned that word from my friend Jessica and it sort of gave me this poem.

54:51.240 --> 54:57.240
She was going through a hard time and her mom said that you have to undrown yourself.

54:57.240 --> 54:59.240
Yeah.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.440
Undrowning.

55:01.440 --> 55:05.320
Who needs to be convinced of loneliness in murmurs?

55:05.320 --> 55:12.040
In the palimpsest of a few words rising out of a sentence you don't understand, unless

55:12.040 --> 55:15.400
it's whispered directly into your fingers.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.560
The rain itself isn't terrible.

55:18.560 --> 55:26.360
But sometimes I believe whole oceans are lifted in the name of some worshiped fury and dropped

55:26.360 --> 55:30.120
into our eyes mid-life.

55:30.120 --> 55:37.000
You tell me the word is disallerci, which is to say you've already drowned.

55:37.000 --> 55:43.640
And to undrown you must recall how the light of Venice's lamps and the stars long traveled

55:43.640 --> 55:50.560
a reverent burn break on the wake of a small boat, ferrying you and a couple friends.

55:50.560 --> 55:58.640
One you now grieve, another an opera singer, drunk her hair you remember sweeping over

55:58.640 --> 56:00.800
the prowl.

56:00.800 --> 56:08.800
If the gondolier speaks a word of English, it is yes, which is one of two words in the

56:08.800 --> 56:14.600
language to contain so many disparate categories of sadness.

56:14.600 --> 56:22.920
I mean in the whole of one syllable, half a universe stays afloat, sinks, swims back

56:22.920 --> 56:30.520
up with too much liquor or wine in its blood, and in drowning or its opposite, a life doesn't

56:30.520 --> 56:33.800
flash before your very eyes.

56:33.800 --> 56:40.880
But if I say the multitudes of ghosts put to sleep by centuries of conquerors awaken in

56:40.880 --> 56:41.880
your veins.

56:41.880 --> 56:48.120
And you must answer them with a grief that is neither famous nor deadly.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.360
It's even simpler than that.

56:50.360 --> 56:55.800
One Saturday night you sit under the slant ceiling of your cramped kitchen in a winter

56:55.800 --> 57:02.480
that's lasted a few extra days into spring, doing precise damage to a bottle of coconut

57:02.480 --> 57:06.400
rum that will pay you four times back.

57:06.400 --> 57:12.400
You turn up the sad tangos your lovely shit-talking father used to sing, he who could dream in

57:12.400 --> 57:17.360
the steel language of flight, and you weep.

57:17.360 --> 57:22.760
Your lamentation counts you squarely among the living.

57:22.760 --> 57:24.280
Get either.

57:24.280 --> 57:31.600
I'm sorry a beautiful young man you once laughed with under the near blaze of a foreign sky

57:31.600 --> 57:38.520
while an opera singer slammed her melismatic eyes into the stone and glass of a city sinking

57:38.520 --> 57:43.040
into its shallow glacial canals is dead.

57:43.040 --> 57:48.000
We can't call up all the wreckage of generations.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.040
Do not forget you are witness to a scent.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.640
Tonight sleep well.

57:54.640 --> 58:01.800
When solitude calls it doesn't mean to kill but offers the kind of sight one earns when

58:01.800 --> 58:07.400
you've lain a long time still.

58:07.400 --> 58:15.000
It's a beauty.

58:15.000 --> 58:29.040
Let me read Despely d'Ardiente.

58:29.040 --> 58:31.960
I was teaching at an MFA program in the hall.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.760
You can teach a line.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.800
You can teach meter, you can teach rhythm, you can teach form.

58:38.800 --> 58:44.440
There's a lot of things that you can teach.

58:44.440 --> 58:53.480
The hardest thing to teach, maybe it's impossible to teach, is how to make a poem blaze.

58:53.480 --> 59:00.000
This is my urging towards my students to make it blaze.

59:00.000 --> 59:03.440
Despely d'Ardiente.

59:03.440 --> 59:11.160
Dear feverless, dear poets, dear love sick ones now cured.

59:11.160 --> 59:16.840
There are bloodless battles to be won, but stout your maw with your finest curses.

59:16.840 --> 59:19.400
Yap your demons to their proper graves.

59:19.400 --> 59:23.400
O meek weepers, asymmetries, be kissed.

59:23.400 --> 59:26.280
Let the trash stack in the kitchen.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.720
Keep your lover a full day from work.

59:28.720 --> 59:36.360
O sweet neglect, O nectarine, those bitter pits are meant for more than nibbling.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.240
There is a holy jump off.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.240
There is a funky genesis.

59:40.240 --> 59:45.240
There is a reason love and jive kind of rhyme.

59:45.240 --> 59:48.760
You oblong fruit not three days ripe.

59:48.760 --> 59:53.720
Somewhere in you lies the science of typhoons, a dream of strings.

59:53.720 --> 59:59.840
Oh dirty word, oh first murder, oh cocoa butter whiff on a smoky bus.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.680
There are theories were made of mostly nothing but motion.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.680
Oh dap tooth guitar.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.320
Oh sound hole, you far away drum, you slang mouth blessing, you long time, you chamberless

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.320
sex step.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.400
Let me leave you with a few last words.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:29.240
When mad dogs break chains to run at you, charge back.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240
Bear your very teeth.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.360
No monster I promise outruns you.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.040
Let them on the ankle with a stick, chase the bastards down.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:43.600
Listen, this vertigo, this wreckage, this bad ballad straining the thickest tendons of

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600
your legs.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.520
Oh darling sleepers, may you wake in the middle of the night strange.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.640
Sounds you champions of laughter.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.480
All you have to do is speak simply.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.360
Your business is the truth.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.120
Your hearts catastrophe is just a little a histories twisted bulwark.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.880
If there were not a sky within your chest worth breaking, believe me, you would have

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.120
stopped all this singing by now.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:17.040
Hey, that's so great.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:43.840
I guess I could tell a story about that poem.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.160
I was teaching at the University of Texas at Austin at the time.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:57.040
One of my colleagues was doing a project in which he was getting several different people

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:04.000
to record song of myself, every line.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.520
I think there might have been six or eight of us who did it separately.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:16.760
I went into the studio and for one day in one session I performed song of myself out loud

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.600
all the way through.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:24.600
I didn't take any breaks but I would flub a line occasionally.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:32.080
It's remarkable how easily his long lines sort of fly.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:41.240
You can imagine the physical intensity of doing that poem I was exhausted.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.000
I fell asleep by 8.30.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:52.160
But I woke up at 1.30 in the morning and this poem came out.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.720
That's one poem that did come out.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:03.800
And I know that the spirit of song of myself was in that poem.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.840
That's a great story.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:16.480
I'm sure he's glad.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.120
That's wonderful though about how the spirit and the body are one and you can get into

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.160
someone else's spirit and body.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.400
I'm going to go home and do that.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.840
See if I can get something too.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.840
Yeah.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.840
Oh boy.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.840
We could all do that.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.840
Yeah.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:41.200
I have a theory that poetry does on maybe molecular or sub-molecular levels and maybe

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.640
there's research already done about this.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:45.000
That it changes the body.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Do you believe that too?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah, I do.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Yeah.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Yeah.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Like music does.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Right?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Yeah.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:01.320
I suppose that's one reason why we love it so much.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320
You think?

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.280
I mean even when we're little kids we love it so much.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:07.280
You're poetry.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:13.360
Come in and change our bodies and make us feel better.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360
Yeah.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Yeah.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Yeah.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:34.160
You know people always talk about Emily Dickinson as being Emily Dickinson and Jean Valentine.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.280
Did what men play a part in your reading life?

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280
Does he continue to?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.680
I mean they're always sort of posing them apart as these kind of binaries right?

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.680
Emily Dickinson.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.680
And what women?

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:47.680
I think that's crazy.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.680
Yeah.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.120
They say he's the man and she's the woman.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120
Yeah.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:57.920
No I think they're very much, I think they're very much, I mean they're called the mother

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.720
and father of our poetry and all that but I mean that doesn't do any harm I suppose

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:09.360
just to think we have one but you know or two but I don't see that myself.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:17.360
You know I think they were both going right to the heart of what was going on and coming

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.360
out different but.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:27.360
They were both.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:45.120
I mean I suppose it would be like thinking, I don't quite what I want to say but like

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:52.080
thinking men and women are different than we are but we are so much the same.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.080
You know much more the same.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.320
I also think you know they don't sit out to do what they do they just do what they can

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320
right?

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320
Just like all the rest of us.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:07.280
I think Dickinson just did what she could and he did what he could and they were called

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.440
differently but I don't see them as opposed to each other at all.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:18.720
I feel like they give us ourselves and lucky us, lucky us you know.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.040
It's just beautiful.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.520
What if we only had one of them?

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520
Wouldn't be as rich.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.240
But I think that kind of opposition is silly don't you?

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:35.920
I think it makes everything smaller instead of what we got.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.040
We could have only had one of them but somebody had to dig up Emily's poems out of the drawers

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.200
and make sure we got them.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.640
She didn't try to get them to us.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640
That's right.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.640
At the beginning I guess you tried to.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.320
I guess it didn't show anything away.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.400
That's true.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400
I think.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:05.520
That you probably put there was probably a great deal of feeling involved in the way

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.040
she strung the poems together into those little booklets.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.040
Oh yeah.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.040
Oh absolutely.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040
Yeah.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:24.960
So did you want to share some new poems with us?

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.600
You said that you might.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:37.040
Those were some together.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.200
Mine are stuck together with white out.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.160
All of the part.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.160
All of the part.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.160
I take out and write something else over.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.440
You know what white out is?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:57.240
I don't know if in this age you use it anymore but that's my sad state anyway.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:04.640
Let that one go for the moment.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.600
This is a strange one.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.440
They're all strange to me anyway.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.760
They're strange when they come to us don't you think?

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.760
If we're lucky.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.120
They are.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:24.120
This is called for Robert Lowell who was a teacher of many of ours of my age and younger.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.040
And I'll just read it.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:36.280
I looked and there he was my father in poetry, my guide to the underworld.

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.840
I was shy to speak.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.560
He said here take my hand.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.840
We cross here.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.440
And I said what you went to earth for.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:49.400
Did you find it?

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.000
He was tall in a blue shirt.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
He pointed across the street.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.920
Over there he said that was the last time I saw Delmore.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:06.520
And I shared it said at the beginning Delmore Schwartz was a good friend of his and died

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.240
before Lowell then.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.880
So that's how he came into that.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.440
And I don't know if you read him anymore.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.440
You do?

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:15.440
Yeah.

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.920
I think he's wonderful.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.760
I also love his name.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.600
So you know both those things got him in there.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.000
I wanted the sound of Delmore as much as I wanted.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.320
Not as much but also you know.

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:35.320
It's to me that you were describing a dream.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.320
It felt like you were talking about a dream of being with Robert Lowell and saying that

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.080
you were doing that.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.160
Maybe that's some of the oddness of...

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.480
It is odd isn't it?

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.000
Yeah I think between dreams and poems I'm not sure where one ends and the next begins

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.080
you know for me anyway.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.040
The three words I often mix up are poem, memory and dream.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040
Yeah.

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.040
They slip into each other's categories.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.040
Yeah.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.040
Yeah.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.040
Yeah.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.200
Do you ever read that book?

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.000
Memories, dreams, reflections.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.320
I love that one too.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.760
I read one more it's called song.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.760
I was...

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.760
Oh this...

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.480
This has a little back reference which isn't going to be in the poem but since we're sitting

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:30.920
here together it's another untaught artist.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.680
Gee what's his name?

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680
Finster.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.840
I don't know if you know Finster.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:45.840
It's Howard Finster and there's also an echo poem you'll hear it.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.120
Stevie Smith, very famous line of hers.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.560
I was not waving but drowning.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.480
It's very famous so I thought I could echo that without people being lost.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
Song.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:10.520
I was asking pardon who am I of them who I am, pardon, of the slow wearing gown, of

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.120
the window, the sun.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:24.000
I was asking forgiveness, of the crocodile, that good hider, of the heron, that good feeder

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.400
and of Christ the Pelican.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:36.600
Christ said over a thousand pages of scripture and I was not reading but dreaming.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:39.360
It's the same right now he said.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.840
He just stood there.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.320
I was not painting but watching the animals.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.720
I was not copying but dreaming.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:59.640
Over one thousand newborns in this clearing we started to lick some clean, dreaming one

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640
by one.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.640
Thank you very much.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.840
Patrick did you want to say anything on the first hearing?

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.720
We get smarter.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:23.680
I was thinking about the Neruda epigraph in my book and both of us have a relationship

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.160
to the dead.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:32.760
Not necessarily in a Macaw way but in a way about how to think about who we are in history

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.760
and where we go.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.680
I think even in your book you talk about you trouble time also.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:46.480
Time and matter, run into one another and the straight hour of time gets confused in

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.840
your poem.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:57.600
If time is reoriented or redefined then so does our relationship to death has to do.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:04.720
So the dead, the dead, like Lowell in this particular poem is allowed to come back and

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:08.640
instruct us where to cross.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:18.040
The other thing I love about your poems is that some of the matter that remains after

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:26.040
I read the poem are questions like who is the cheetah or what is the cheetah.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.240
You have the space cheetah in your book.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:35.280
This is an exercise that I asked my beginning poetry students do all the times.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.720
I would say anything authoritative about a poem right away.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.240
Ask questions.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.240
And so with your poems I find myself with the questions and I'm able to sort of hold

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.360
on to those questions for a while.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:53.600
And they're often very interesting questions about how to live, about time, about space,

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.240
about the dead.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:04.920
They invoke other lyric lines for me too.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:11.840
So you find that when you're writing too, that you're asking questions, maybe when

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.000
you finish something, like where did that come from?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.800
Yeah, I'm sure you do because I can hear it in your poem.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:27.200
I showed this Lowell thing to somebody and they said, oh yeah, he's showing you how to

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.240
cross the street or something like that.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.360
And I said, yeah, I was surprised when he said that.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.320
It was like I think it sort of spoke some or something.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.680
But I was surprised when that came, when I was writing it.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.920
You know how come?

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.440
It sounded okay.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.440
It's interesting.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:54.600
I think when I'm having a hard time writing, the questions are happening, but I don't hear

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:57.360
them or I am refusing them.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.480
And so when I have the silence that you were talking about earlier, it's like I can make

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:09.480
space for the questions and the unknown and the uncertainty of the poem.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.480
All you and I need is a do we know castle.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.480
Yes.

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480
Good day.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.480
You and I and everybody else here.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.320
You can buy one, let's go get away.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.120
Just get quiet for a while.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.480
Yeah, and then all the terrible angels will arrive.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.080
That's true they will.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:33.480
They will say hello.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:40.680
So maybe we can open things up to the audience and they can begin to participate out loud.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.480
Anybody want to ask a question or make a comment?

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:57.480
Yes.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:12.320
My question is why do you say the poem changes the body?

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:20.000
I always thought the poem changes probably the mind, the spirit, maybe the soul, but it

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.680
definitely gets you away from the body.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:30.400
And I like mics because in a mic, with the mic, through a mic, the poem even gets away

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.600
from the human voice.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:40.440
It gets into a life of its own and stands in the room by itself, away from the poet because

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:47.680
ultimately the poet is also a body is part of this earth and the poem gets us away from

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.880
all of that.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:54.440
So that's why I was wondering I never heard that the poem changes the body.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440
So that's my question.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:02.320
It's a theory that I have that the poems change the body.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:11.080
I know that when I've gone to poetry readings, the poems are really good.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.280
I feel something in my body.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.040
I don't have a description for it.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:22.440
Emily Dickinson said that it feels like the top of her head comes off.

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:23.440
And she used the body.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440
She didn't compare it.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.440
It feels like the sky.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.960
It feels like something in her body is happening.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.760
For her, the top of her head is coming off.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.720
For me, I don't know.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.880
Sometimes my hair stands up.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:41.880
Sometimes I've felt so moved by a poem that I want to jump up and run.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.080
I've felt that many, many times.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.880
I don't know if it's true or not.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.920
There's something about it.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.760
I think also that deep memory resides.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:02.440
I think that I believe that geneticists are going to find out that deep memory gets handed

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.480
down across DNA.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:13.640
And if that's true, then what role does intense language like poetry have in the making of

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.760
the human body at the DNA level?

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.760
We don't have tools to measure that yet.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.480
I'm just proposing that.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.160
Maybe somebody with $75 billion to do the research.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.920
But I put the question out there.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.040
I suspect it.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.280
And I think it also goes back to something that Jean said that early on, poetry as a

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:43.400
written art is much younger than poetry as a bodily and performed art.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.360
It was meant to be in the body.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.640
It was meant to be performed and shared in a room full of bodies.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.040
Many times those bodies were dancing.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:19:02.520
And so I think that you can't just erase that very old and persistent tradition of the body

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.400
and its relationship to poetry.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.240
Well, the meter is dance steps.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240
Exactly.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:14.520
And that's the fundamental aspect of the sound of poetry is meter in some way.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.760
Or the notion of plowing a field, right?

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:24.960
The work of the body in the field, going along the lines.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:32.920
So it's just an idea.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.760
I also think of singing, the mother singing to the baby.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.760
Oh, yeah.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.160
That's a very fundamental kind of poetry, whatever's going on, I think.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.160
Excuse me though.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.160
You go ahead.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.760
I just want to weigh in on that.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.080
I think the poem has a life of its own.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.080
Okay.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.680
Patrick, two questions.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:02.440
Is it fair to ask you the Tagalog word for suddenly seized by affection?

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.120
Yes, Tagalog word for suddenly seized by affection is gigal.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.120
Spell it.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.120
G-I-G-I-L.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.720
Gigal.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:16.120
And pronounce the second syllable, emphasize?

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.200
That's the first gigal.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.000
No, it's the first syllable.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Gigal.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Gigal.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yeah.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.480
So if you see, I just saw a video of my god daughter last night.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:33.520
And so I felt a gigal towards her and she's Nakaka Gigal.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.640
But the L isn't pronounced like an L in English, right?

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640
It's close.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.640
It's close.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:42.400
There might be a slightly different, yeah?

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.400
Okay.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:51.800
The other question for you is when you read that poem, how to make a poem blaze.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.800
I love this line.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.800
Still it.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:05.360
When a bad dog, when bad dogs break chains to want you, bite back?

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.320
When mad dogs break chains to chase you charge back.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.080
To change, okay.

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.480
I love, I just revise it.

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.480
That's pretty good, not one hearing.

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:15.480
Bite back.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.080
I wrote bite back.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080
Yeah.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080
Okay, good.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.000
So we'll use that.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.360
And I can always look that up to sighted great.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:34.000
Jean, I was very moved by our meeting when I spoke to you about having been studied with

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.840
Marie Ponceau.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.120
And you said, I'm not worthy.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.120
You did that gesture.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.120
I'm not worthy.

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.320
We were so pleased.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.920
And then I said, I'll give her your regards.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.640
And after I said that, I thought, well, when in hell am I going to see Marie?

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:58.400
And then you said to me, she's right behind you.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.080
So that was really a great moment for me.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:04.520
Chekov is somebody I've been studying.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.320
I mentioned to Marie, I'm studying with Professor Tom Bird, who's a doll.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.480
He's been at Queen's College.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.520
I think since the 1950s, long time, and still teaching.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.160
And we studied short stories of Chekov.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:26.520
So I remember there was a short story, they had a fairy boat.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.920
Do you happen to remember the story?

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.920
What is that?

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:30.920
Easter Eve.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920
Easter Eve.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.920
May I have lost my mind.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.920
It's called Easter Eve.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:35.920
Easter Eve.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.920
Great.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.920
Thank you so much.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.920
Wonderful story.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.920
Anyone else want to thank the comment or ask a good question?

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:52.920
That's for the obvious.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:23:06.240
Gina, if you could, I'd like to ask you to talk a little bit about how your work might

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:17.360
have evolved in a way that in Lucy, for example, you have these very small intersections of

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:24.640
awareness that the speaker of the poem that you have of a moment of a relationship with

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.880
Lucy.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.320
And they're so simple.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:37.320
And yet in that simplicity, you find such poignancy that I wondered if that type of a

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:45.040
trained eye was something that you found over the course of your writing career, an ability

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:53.400
to distill or find the more critical essential bits and pieces and pair away more of the

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.800
unimportant parts of a poem.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:04.280
In other words, do you define that your work became sparrow more essential if that's clear

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.920
or is it poem by poem maybe different?

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:15.320
Does that make sense?

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:25.720
I think I started out more sort of saying everything in a more grammatical way than I

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.720
do now.

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:35.800
And I've noticed over the years I take more out, you know, I might write a lot and take

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:42.840
a lot of it out and ask my friends, you know, if it still makes sense.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.240
But that's more a way I work now.

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:52.560
And I've also come to love sequences because I might write something and it doesn't amount

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:57.040
too much, but then if I put twelve of them together, it might, you know, so that's something

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.960
I came to later.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.960
Yeah.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.000
But I'm not so big on sense as I used to be.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:12.760
And I think it was really being able to be with other poets and read more also.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.880
And boredom, boredom can be your friend.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.480
You know, if you just are writing something that you've written before or you've seen

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.120
written before, you might not have any interest in it.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:32.760
So you might go somewhere else, you know, even if it's what you feel.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.520
But it doesn't have any life for you.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:37.400
Do you know what I'm saying?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.760
It's not that it isn't true, but it isn't alive for you anymore.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:48.000
And so I don't mean just to put something in a new way for newness's sake.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:54.160
That's another thing I would try out to do because that's boring too.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.680
But it can be when I try it sometimes.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:04.080
Just to kind of feel your way and see how much you really need, you know.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.720
And then I couldn't live without my poet friends because then I asked them, you know, do you

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.920
think this is there or not, you know?

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:13.920
Okay.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:14.920
Thanks.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.920
Is that kind of answer?

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.400
Yes, very much.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:25.160
Also if I could just add, they did do a study, I don't know if it cost 75 million, but once

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:29.920
you've been in the woods for three hours, your body physically changes chemically.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.840
So I'm sure the same would be true of reading poetry.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:39.120
Yeah, that's great to know.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.520
Wow.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:44.800
Please.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.120
I don't like these things, microphones.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:51.720
But I love your presentation.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.400
And it's really an honor to be here and hear you both talk about writing poetry and reading

01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.840
so much poetry.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.360
It was wonderful.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:10.040
And I agree when I've only been writing poetry for about seven years and, you know, like

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.400
not full time, but a lot.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.800
And when I write, I feel the same thing with the spirit and the soul, you know, that is

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:26.120
there that was in your Lucy poem and in your dog poem.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.280
And, you know, I mean, it's just, it's wonderful.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.080
It's wonderful getting out of the body.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.480
I don't know what it is.

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:40.640
It's supposedly like other artists tell me that that happens when they paint a painting

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.880
or whatever, you know, they're, I don't know because I can't do anything else.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.480
You know, I can walk.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.800
And my spirit.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:56.040
I feel, you know, my soul is happy when I'm walking, but it's not like, you know, I don't

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:01.880
know that nitty gritty, you know, deep down soul changing.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.880
And it comes out on the page, which is so exciting.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.200
And I don't know what's going to come out on the page, you know.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:11.720
And that is, that's the thrill, you know.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.880
I wish I could do more.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.640
But thanks for giving me the idea of the sequence thing because I never did that.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.560
And I think I might try that.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.880
That Lucy is so wonderful the way you brought her to life, you know.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.120
When you read the first piece, I said, oh no, you know.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:35.640
But as you went on to each other piece, I said, oh, this lady has something going.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.640
Yeah.

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:37.640
Thank you.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.680
You know, it's interesting because if you read other sequences that can get you kind

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:45.760
of maybe towards it.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.520
I was reading The Orpheus Sonnets when I was writing Lucy.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.280
And I didn't sit down to do that.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.800
It just happened.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:59.600
But I think it's like, you know, it can help you.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:05.640
If you read other people's sequences, whatever you're looking for, you know.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.560
It seems like you were saying about Whitman too.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.600
It can help you out.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.320
Not being directly imitative in any way, you know.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.840
But just like soul to soul.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:19.840
Yeah.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.000
Who's your wife in the game?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
We are.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We are.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Which one are you?

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.400
I'll be you.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:34.600
Okay.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.880
No, it's so much fun because we didn't get the chance to do this before.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.400
I've admired you from that part of the room.

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.320
It's so much fun to do this.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.920
Thank you, David, for asking us to read together.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.800
Well, I'm very glad we're coming in a real pleasure.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.920
I'm sure for everyone.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.480
So our time is up.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.320
So we'll stop for this afternoon.

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.240
And we'll do something like this in the fall.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.240
Excellent.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.240
Thank you.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240
Thank you.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:12.040
I've got to stop right now, let me go.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:14.040
Thank you.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040
Thank you.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.040
Thank you.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.040
Thank you.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.040
Thank you.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Thank you.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:55.040
Thank you.
