WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Okay everyone, we are going to start our afternoon sessions.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.000
So please take your seats.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.440
I feel bad ending all of your amazing conversations, but I have to.

00:11.440 --> 00:19.240
So we are now entering the more kind of, it's not more interesting, but we're entering the

00:19.240 --> 00:23.680
phase of our conference where we're going to go into phase two.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.680
We've been in phase one for the last three panels.

00:26.680 --> 00:30.800
And now we're in phase two, because we're repeating the subject matters that we've been

00:30.800 --> 00:35.720
talking about, but with unique participants for each round table.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.680
And so the participants, you'll be seeing in this panel the next one and then tomorrow

00:39.680 --> 00:44.120
morning, we're all going to be talking about the same stuff, but from new points of view,

00:44.120 --> 00:48.400
evolving the same dialogue together, but with new things added in.

00:48.400 --> 00:55.400
So I wanted to just plant this for you guys, because we had a very nice kind of segue from

00:55.400 --> 00:58.560
last panel to this one.

00:58.560 --> 01:03.960
Eric from the last panel mentioned that one way we could think about mending the relationship

01:03.960 --> 01:09.880
between science and society and art and society is to think instead about how science and

01:09.880 --> 01:15.040
art could work together, become stronger partners, and then that would have a trickle down effect

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
into society.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.240
And I think that's a really nice idea.

01:18.240 --> 01:25.280
But this speaks directly to science art collaboration and in the ways that we can improve collaboration,

01:25.280 --> 01:30.080
that collaboration to be a more regular thing, identify the problems that we're having with

01:30.080 --> 01:34.000
collaboration, maybe it's about jargon like we were just talking about.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.280
So I want to kind of plant that as a way for you guys to start out this, because I think

01:38.280 --> 01:40.160
it really ties together nicely.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.680
Zach is going to come up and introduce all the panelists, so please raise your hand when

01:43.680 --> 01:48.960
he says your name.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
Daniel Cone.

01:50.960 --> 01:56.180
Daniel is co-founder of the VISG group and was the founding artist in residence at the

01:56.180 --> 01:58.680
Broad Institute for Genomic Research.

01:58.680 --> 02:05.440
He currently serves as an artist in residence at the center for epigenomic research at Albert

02:05.440 --> 02:10.880
Einstein College of Medicine and manages a variety of other projects.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
Edgar Chueery.

02:12.880 --> 02:13.880
Oh.

02:13.880 --> 02:22.400
Edgar is a professor and director of Princeton's program in engineering physics and director

02:22.400 --> 02:28.400
of Princeton's electric propulsion and plasma dynamics laboratory.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.960
Tega Brain.

02:30.960 --> 02:38.720
Tega is an artist and an environmental engineer whose work intersects ecology, engineering

02:38.720 --> 02:41.720
and the politics of emerging technologies.

02:41.720 --> 02:49.720
She's a fellow at data and society and is an assistant professor of digital media at NYU.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.000
Karen Ingram.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.560
Karen is a creative director, designer, artist and author, as well as a synthetic biology

02:58.560 --> 03:00.120
leap fellow.

03:00.120 --> 03:08.360
She is also a co-organizer of the Empiersis League, a science cabaret based in Brooklyn.

03:08.360 --> 03:16.840
He's a filmmaker and biologist whose interdisciplinary work aims at transforming the way science

03:16.840 --> 03:21.280
is communicated to the public through film and visual arts.

03:21.280 --> 03:28.520
His work has been featured in the New York Times, Forbes, Nature and Ted to name a few.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.240
Patricia Olenick.

03:31.240 --> 03:38.360
Patricia's work explores art, science and technology related themes that often examine

03:38.360 --> 03:43.000
the dialect of natural and artificial and cognition and effect.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.560
She also co-directs the New York laser program in New York and is a former chair of the Leonardo

03:50.560 --> 03:54.360
education and art forum.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.000
Let's begin the round table.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.480
Okay, so whoever wants to jump in on how do we improve upon science art collaborations?

04:05.480 --> 04:09.880
I think each and every one of you engages in science art collaborations either in your

04:09.880 --> 04:18.600
own work with yourself because you have dual degrees or with other people.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.160
I'm looking at you, Patricia.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.160
Okay, well.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.600
Go ahead, Patricia.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.600
Thanks.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
Patricia.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.760
Well, you know, it's something that I think a lot about.

04:31.760 --> 04:42.040
What are the kinds of structures and scaffolding that support, you know, dialogue between artists,

04:42.040 --> 04:48.000
scientists and humanists and writers and anybody who wants to be part of that, people who

04:48.000 --> 04:50.160
are interested in technology.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.920
And there are, I guess, a couple of observations that I would make over the years having done

04:53.920 --> 04:57.080
this in different kinds of forums.

04:57.080 --> 05:07.280
So when I was introduced as the co-director of the New York laser program, which we do

05:07.280 --> 05:13.800
out of Elin Levy studio, Elin Levy is my co-director on that, we very purposely actually

05:13.800 --> 05:21.040
don't record any of our sessions because we're trying to keep the conversations as a kind

05:21.040 --> 05:22.880
of testing ground.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.760
And we think that, well, from our observation that people have been a little bit more hesitant

05:27.760 --> 05:31.680
to speak up, which of course, if you're not really speaking up and you're really digging

05:31.680 --> 05:35.960
deep and you're really maybe saying something that you don't want to have on record, this

05:35.960 --> 05:43.240
can really inhibit, actually recording can actually really inhibit a kind of more exploratory

05:43.240 --> 05:44.720
kind of set of conversations.

05:44.720 --> 05:51.080
But something that I was struck by with even some of Elizabeth Demore's comments.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.720
I'm quite institutionalized as a person at this point.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.960
I really need the research institution to do my work.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.840
I need the maker facilities.

06:01.840 --> 06:07.600
I need, it's a kind of context.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.560
Now, within that context, there are many different ways to structure it.

06:10.560 --> 06:17.680
And I think the University of Michigan, which was already mentioned here today once, actually

06:17.680 --> 06:25.000
has some very interesting programs that give rise to the kinds of situations that then

06:25.000 --> 06:30.320
grow the essential questions that we need to be asking ourselves around these collaborations.

06:30.320 --> 06:36.680
A lot of those situations involve agnostic spaces.

06:36.680 --> 06:41.320
And so I'm a big fan of the agnostic space.

06:41.320 --> 06:47.080
The idea behind the agnostic space is that it's owned by nobody, but it serves everyone.

06:47.080 --> 06:53.200
So when technology or programs aren't growing as nodes off of existing programs, but rather

06:53.200 --> 06:58.360
they're coming from the provost level, and they're not really owned by anybody, but they

06:58.360 --> 07:03.040
serve everyone, then I find that the different disciplines tend to come together a little

07:03.040 --> 07:10.000
bit easier because the questions grow out of essential issues that are pertinent to everybody

07:10.000 --> 07:12.200
sitting at the table.

07:12.200 --> 07:17.560
So I guess I would start by saying that the structure that brings together art science

07:17.560 --> 07:22.920
and technology, that the structure itself can fundamentally shape the kinds of conversations

07:22.920 --> 07:24.720
that emerge.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.560
Daniel.

07:26.560 --> 07:34.960
Giving the eyes.

07:34.960 --> 07:42.920
I fell into art science or into this dialogue.

07:42.920 --> 07:48.440
I met a geneticist or he wrote to me and whatever we started a discussion.

07:48.440 --> 07:54.680
I realized that a lot of questions I had about my readings in physics, which I would give

07:54.680 --> 07:58.400
physics for the light person and physics and philosophy that probably a lot of us have

07:58.400 --> 08:04.240
read, and whether I could better understand some of those ideas that I found difficult

08:04.240 --> 08:10.320
to understand by engaging with this geneticist, and maybe that genetics was sort of poised

08:10.320 --> 08:15.800
to be the physics of the 21st century in terms of this role in society.

08:15.800 --> 08:24.680
But I also, I think I rushed into that breach because I've always been very uncomfortable

08:24.680 --> 08:31.120
in the art world, and I, excuse me, for all the artists in the room, but I often get bored

08:31.120 --> 08:36.280
with talking to other artists because we end up talking about the materiality of our practices

08:36.280 --> 08:40.360
in ways that are, you know, our galleries and if we're lucky, our pigments, and if we're

08:40.360 --> 08:45.000
really lucky, we might give each other critiques, but rarely.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.120
And I found that when I engage with scientists, we had none of that in common, and so the

08:49.120 --> 08:54.240
only things we could actually talk about were the meta structures, the things that are common

08:54.240 --> 08:57.960
to all of us, which are the culture in which we are and the kinds of inquiries we're interested

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
in.

08:58.960 --> 09:06.520
So I've often positioned myself sort of as an outsider to a lot of places, and I think,

09:06.520 --> 09:12.120
so one of the things that I kind of spent a lot of time talking to you all last night

09:12.120 --> 09:18.080
as I was having a hard time sleeping, but one of the things that really came up was the

09:18.080 --> 09:25.000
role of failure in trying to collaborate and the role of madness, and I often found myself

09:25.000 --> 09:32.760
as a sole artist in an institution of which grew to 1500 people, the Broad Institute,

09:32.760 --> 09:40.280
that I never knew if I was totally crazy or a visionary or an idiot, you know, like it

09:40.280 --> 09:53.160
was very hard to understand what my position was, and so I think there are, there's something

09:53.160 --> 09:58.080
that would be interesting to talk about is the role of the ways in which in the different

09:58.080 --> 10:02.160
communities we're part of, we have methods for validation for the kinds of knowledge

10:02.160 --> 10:09.680
that we produce, and as we move between disciplines, those kind of break down, and so I'm sort

10:09.680 --> 10:14.480
of curious with other people around the table, but also in the room in terms of your experiences

10:14.480 --> 10:22.280
and your ideas for solutions, how do we start to build communal mechanisms for locating

10:22.280 --> 10:29.800
ourselves, so whether they be ways of sort of creating a map of the art science activities

10:29.800 --> 10:33.680
that happen in different cities, there's something I've been really interested in doing in New

10:33.680 --> 10:45.120
York, but I feel like we need to find mechanisms to understand our relative positions, like

10:45.120 --> 10:49.840
at one point I think two or three years after I was at the Broad, I found this book that

10:49.840 --> 10:56.000
David Edwards had written about called Art Science in the Post-Google Generation or something

10:56.000 --> 10:59.760
like that, and it was the first time I read something, I thought I was kind of crazy and

10:59.760 --> 11:05.200
on the fringe, and I read something that gave me a context for understanding what I might

11:05.200 --> 11:10.640
be involved in, and the idea that I might have had this intuitive leap, and it might take

11:10.640 --> 11:16.720
ten years to realize it in any way, and to have a few stories was really, really profoundly

11:16.720 --> 11:24.480
useful, and I think that's, a lot of us are wondering as we make these leaps, like am

11:24.480 --> 11:31.480
I crazy, or why am I doing this, and there's actually an emergent moment where a lot of

11:31.480 --> 11:37.480
us are doing it, and I'm just curious, what are the mechanisms we have to understand that

11:37.480 --> 11:43.680
it's actually, you know, like, I often see my ideas on other people's faces, you know,

11:43.680 --> 11:48.040
like, people are constantly using my ideas, they're not my ideas, you know, they're the

11:48.040 --> 11:53.480
emergent ideas, and so I'm curious how to, that's my question sort of for the space

11:53.480 --> 11:59.240
of collaboration, how do we, because it's actually very hard to, I've found, I usually

11:59.240 --> 12:05.440
say I've spent 15 years failing at collaborating, and I think to some degree it's really true,

12:05.440 --> 12:09.680
but there have been really creative failures, I have a whole body of work that came out

12:09.680 --> 12:14.240
of it, and I've really engaged with scientists in very interesting ways, in ways that, which

12:14.240 --> 12:23.280
I think were bi-directional, so I guess that's one thing I'd like to throw out, and the other

12:23.280 --> 12:33.040
one is, I know this is an art science space, or conference, but the thing that always comes

12:33.040 --> 12:38.160
up for me is, that's just one axis that we have chosen to explore, because we are either

12:38.160 --> 12:44.560
artists or scientists, but what to me is really interesting is this intro, whether you call

12:44.560 --> 12:50.200
it trans or intro, or this space in between all of our disciplines, which allow us to

12:50.200 --> 12:53.440
pose questions differently and come out of our, we know we've talked, everybody has kind

12:53.440 --> 12:58.000
of talked about the space, and is that what are the advantages of keeping that an art

12:58.000 --> 13:04.240
science collaborative space, and what are the disadvantages, or what might we gain by allowing

13:04.240 --> 13:10.040
anthropologists of science into the room, or historians, or economists, or how does the

13:10.040 --> 13:15.480
discussion around the table change as you kind of release those boundaries completely?

13:15.480 --> 13:19.200
I'll stop for now.

13:19.200 --> 13:27.760
Yeah, I just want to kind of go on, they said you have space, so I'm a geneticist, actually

13:27.760 --> 13:32.280
just to go off what Daniel will say, I'm a geneticist with parents that are both artists,

13:32.280 --> 13:38.640
my dad's a painter, and my mom's a filmmaker, and I did my PhD at Rockefeller, and I was

13:38.640 --> 13:45.680
very interested, basically, that during my training as a PhD, as a scientist, I found

13:45.680 --> 13:52.000
that the space and being in a laboratory really enabled me to think about artistic endeavors,

13:52.000 --> 13:59.040
and it was actually that experience that brought me into the world of filmmaking, so now it's

13:59.040 --> 14:04.000
hard to define, and it's hard to hear yourself being defined in a certain way as a, I guess,

14:04.000 --> 14:11.240
I'm a biologist, retired at a young age and became a filmmaker, but I was working on

14:11.240 --> 14:15.880
vision, I was working on fruit flies first in Michael Young's lab that just received a

14:15.880 --> 14:21.200
Nobel Prize, and then went on to the stellar lab at Rockefeller, and I found that actually

14:21.200 --> 14:28.440
the work that I was doing was very amenable to narratives and to kind of engaging with

14:28.440 --> 14:36.000
artists, and I guess for me, being in that context is what led me to actually make that

14:36.000 --> 14:40.520
leap, although I would oftentimes not call it a leap because I feel that a lot of people

14:40.520 --> 14:44.600
when you're being interviewed or discuss your journey, everybody always says, you know,

14:44.600 --> 14:50.040
how did you transition from one field to the other, but I never, I don't think about it

14:50.040 --> 14:57.240
that way, I think about it as kind of a natural progression from being a geneticist to now

14:57.240 --> 15:04.240
being a filmmaker and still focused and thinking about those same ideas about how to, you know,

15:04.240 --> 15:08.760
how to visualize science, how to create stories about science, and things that pertain as

15:08.760 --> 15:12.840
much to the research world as they do to the film world, and I find that there's a lot

15:12.840 --> 15:16.240
of similarities between those worlds.

15:16.240 --> 15:23.440
In terms of the importance of the institution in enabling the work, most of what I did started

15:23.440 --> 15:28.320
as a PhD student, I was able to start a film series that Rockefeller and bring scientists

15:28.320 --> 15:33.360
and you know, Paul Nurse and many people to really engage in how they thought about science

15:33.360 --> 15:39.360
and media and especially in film, and I had a particular interest in fiction actually,

15:39.360 --> 15:44.560
in thinking about the portrayal of science and scientists and how to create films that

15:44.560 --> 15:49.800
were about accurate science, compelling science, but also told stories, and this is a little

15:49.800 --> 15:54.360
bit the mission of the Sloan Foundation that was mentioned over the last few days, but

15:54.360 --> 16:00.440
it was that environment that led me to create and to make my first films, but then I left

16:00.440 --> 16:05.880
that institutional world and I created my own nonprofit organization, which is a film

16:05.880 --> 16:10.560
festival that happens here in New York called Imagine Science, and that just celebrated

16:10.560 --> 16:15.520
its 10th year that started at Rockefeller 10 years ago.

16:15.520 --> 16:20.800
Now what I find myself doing is with this institution we go back to universities and

16:20.800 --> 16:27.760
the universities have become the venues in which we actually show the films and my career

16:27.760 --> 16:33.440
as a filmmaker I find that the academic institutions and the conferences that I used to attend

16:33.440 --> 16:41.160
as a graduate student are the places that received me and you know, where I used to have a poster

16:41.160 --> 16:48.000
you know in the middle of like a Hilton lobby I find myself going back there and showing

16:48.000 --> 16:52.680
my film and it's been a real thrill to be able to go back and kind of repurpose these

16:52.680 --> 16:58.800
spaces that are used for scientific talks and conferences and go back there with artistic

16:58.800 --> 17:02.520
projects which I think are happening and we can probably talk about that a little bit

17:02.520 --> 17:05.560
more over the next hour.

17:05.560 --> 17:13.720
So I guess that's my experience has been that I've left the academic world to go back to

17:13.720 --> 17:20.280
it and now I teach at NYU and I find myself kind of interfacing with those worlds but

17:20.280 --> 17:24.320
there was a step where in which I had to kind of push myself out of there.

17:24.320 --> 17:29.960
But I will say that speaking about this overall art science collaborations and I remember

17:29.960 --> 17:36.920
yesterday there was a talk about do artists and a scientist is the exchange mutual I would

17:36.920 --> 17:44.280
say that it's important not to necessarily refer to it as a switch or as a leap but I

17:44.280 --> 17:49.920
find that those two worlds are very similar in processes and you know and every scientist

17:49.920 --> 17:56.360
has an artistic kind of chord in them so I think it's kind of trying to find that middle

17:56.360 --> 18:00.920
ground between those two worlds and it's not always necessarily about the collaborative

18:00.920 --> 18:04.840
process but it's also about what you know what you're trying to in my case it's a lot

18:04.840 --> 18:10.200
about the narrative and the story that I want to say and then based on that I'll engage

18:10.200 --> 18:16.120
with different types of artists and visual scientists and filmmakers and use these different artistic

18:16.120 --> 18:22.200
approaches to answer a question as I would answer in a science lab.

18:22.200 --> 18:27.920
We're going round.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.920
Well my background is environmental engineering and I worked for a number of years in Australia

18:32.920 --> 18:39.440
in this field and you know spent a lot of time doing open design developing stormwater

18:39.440 --> 18:44.200
and water infrastructures in the context of cities and new housing developments and I

18:44.200 --> 18:48.880
got really frustrated with working in this industry and also like coming through an engineering

18:48.880 --> 18:56.520
education where there was not a lot of opportunities to ask questions about the narratives that

18:56.520 --> 19:03.360
are driving these fields, politics, who is funding research, why we frame technologies

19:03.360 --> 19:08.920
through this like solutionism perspective and through stories as if like technology is going

19:08.920 --> 19:14.400
to solve these problems which are inherently political, social, economic and this is something

19:14.400 --> 19:18.960
that you know I think in the US is you know amplified in an insane way right now by the

19:18.960 --> 19:26.240
Silicon Valley and I feel like for me the reason why I now primarily work as an artist

19:26.240 --> 19:35.080
but also as an academic so I also teach a lot of media arts and computational arts at NYU.

19:35.080 --> 19:39.600
So what motivated me to leave the field of engineering and like explore these technologies

19:39.600 --> 19:44.080
and these these you know ways of engaging with the world but from artistic context and

19:44.080 --> 19:51.040
the context of galleries and so forth is because I didn't find a space for that in my work

19:51.040 --> 19:58.600
as an engineer and in engineering education I think this is something that is hugely problematic.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.320
So I guess I'm going to speak to this more from a perspective of practices that are sort

20:03.320 --> 20:08.400
of in between engineering, design, art, I mean we like use a lot of labels I don't know if

20:08.400 --> 20:13.920
it matters so much what you want to call it but I do think there's like you know I do

20:13.920 --> 20:20.920
think in terms of some of the really really thorny problems we're facing that it's so

20:20.920 --> 20:29.040
critical that we find ways to get a better language for you know the culture and political

20:29.040 --> 20:34.400
context in which technologies are developed and the agendas which they serve.

20:34.400 --> 20:41.080
So my work attempts to address this it's often like public experiments online or it often

20:41.080 --> 20:50.280
involves participation for example one of my recent works is sort of like a public demonstration

20:50.280 --> 20:55.400
of how fitness trackers fail and how you can spoof them and how you can author your own

20:55.400 --> 21:00.800
fitness data so that you can take advantage of insurance discounts and health discounts

21:00.800 --> 21:05.080
and all of these things that are available to you and so this project is about telling

21:05.080 --> 21:14.240
a story about how these technologies are representing like they have an agenda and how that they

21:14.240 --> 21:20.280
can fail right and that you know an everyday person can kind of try to reverse engineer

21:20.280 --> 21:24.040
and understand you know what does a step look like from the point of view of a tracker

21:24.040 --> 21:29.280
and therefore what is this story about trackers being representative of health like it's

21:29.280 --> 21:33.520
such a narrow view of what health is right that serves the insurance industry that is

21:33.520 --> 21:34.920
promoting this.

21:34.920 --> 21:39.360
So these you know exist as a website as if we use the language of the Silicon Valley

21:39.360 --> 21:44.720
to kind of invite people into thinking critically about data thinking critically about what

21:44.720 --> 21:50.960
it means to quantify the body quantify health in this way what's left out right who is left

21:50.960 --> 21:56.640
out in this in these sorts of situations.

21:56.640 --> 22:02.320
Other work recently that I did just to give some sort of context what I'm saying takes

22:02.320 --> 22:11.640
a series is a smell based dating service right so we actually my collaborator is here over

22:11.640 --> 22:18.200
sitting over there but we launched a service that allowed people to sign up we had a few

22:18.200 --> 22:23.320
hundred people sign up in New York City and asked each to wear a t-shirt for three days

22:23.320 --> 22:31.760
and send us back their shirts and then they all got ten samples anonymous samples randomly

22:31.760 --> 22:35.920
from the group from which they then chose who they would like to meet based on the smell

22:35.920 --> 22:41.600
of the body odor and our website would then connect to you via email if there was a mutual

22:41.600 --> 22:49.320
match between the participants and yes people went on dates and yes relationships did come

22:49.320 --> 22:55.000
out of it but you know the project really did provoke an extraordinary conversation about

22:55.000 --> 23:03.040
the role of smell in attraction but also provoked this really extraordinary response

23:03.040 --> 23:08.240
from the press in terms of you know smell dating is the next big thing in dating you

23:08.240 --> 23:13.200
know we can extract value from body odor we can quantify it you know we can optimize dating

23:13.200 --> 23:17.800
in this way that really kind of revealed to me the narrative again that you know through

23:17.800 --> 23:22.960
which technologies is kind of deployed but for me that was really interesting so we did

23:22.960 --> 23:26.520
talk to a lot of scientists it wasn't really a collaboration the scientists were kind of

23:26.520 --> 23:32.600
like well we can't really get involved with that because we don't know who knows what's

23:32.600 --> 23:37.600
going to happen but they were it was fabulous because they did really encourage us to you

23:37.600 --> 23:41.160
know we were like should we instruct our participants not to smoke not to eat garlic whatever and

23:41.160 --> 23:46.800
they were like no you do like let people do what they want right that's part of the data

23:46.800 --> 23:54.080
in your in your body odor so it was really a way of inviting a public to questions that

23:54.080 --> 23:58.560
are unresolved in that field right and so people could then see for themselves we got

23:58.560 --> 24:03.320
lots of emails from you know straight men who were like I matched with all men what does

24:03.320 --> 24:08.400
that mean and we were like I don't know why you're asking me like maybe you need to think

24:08.400 --> 24:16.760
about that right so there was lots of uncertainty and humor and obviously questions raised rather

24:16.760 --> 24:22.680
than questions answered I think so yeah well that's a great thing for art to do it's raised

24:22.680 --> 24:30.560
questions yeah exactly and I think for me it's about prodding for asking questions of what's

24:30.560 --> 24:36.000
missing what assumptions are being made like science totally emerges from a from a social

24:36.000 --> 24:43.120
context from a culture and I think art can really like I think as artists we are trained

24:43.120 --> 24:48.520
to kind of look at the stories being told and why certain assumptions being made and so

24:48.520 --> 24:53.880
I think in all fields it's about realizing that science doesn't have this monopoly on

24:53.880 --> 24:58.480
the production of knowledge right and it can take many different forms in terms of collaboration

24:58.480 --> 25:03.520
I think the challenge is you know most of us are like in institutional departments where

25:03.520 --> 25:08.840
if I talk to a science my research is really legible to how their research is assessed

25:08.840 --> 25:15.080
and vice versa I find in the US actually this is a little bit better because research metrics

25:15.080 --> 25:19.040
seem to be a little bit more flexible in Australia but it's I think it's a massive challenge

25:19.040 --> 25:25.120
because it means that collaborations like we're talking about today aren't really legible

25:25.120 --> 25:31.040
to the mechanisms or the institutions that support them so I think we all need to be

25:31.040 --> 25:37.640
trying to reshape our institutions and and make a space and make a metric for actually

25:37.640 --> 25:42.400
supporting this work.

25:42.400 --> 25:48.120
So yeah it's just kind of summing up in my mind we all pretty much agree that having

25:48.120 --> 25:53.840
an institution behind you well maybe difficult to work with and their silos are actually

25:53.840 --> 25:59.480
very helpful that's where the money is oftentimes the money also could come from a scientific

25:59.480 --> 26:04.040
organization doing science outreach stuff that's pretty much where it's at we all agree we

26:04.040 --> 26:07.880
kind of need a neutral space to collaborate whether that space is virtual or physical

26:07.880 --> 26:11.160
there needs to be something neutral about it.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.440
Really interesting your point about not having things recorded maybe a collaborative space

26:15.440 --> 26:21.880
needs to be a safe space in that way where people do feel is freedom.

26:21.880 --> 26:27.560
Yesterday we were talking about types of collaborations a taxonomy of collaborations which is an interesting

26:27.560 --> 26:34.160
idea to think about kind of the potentials of it but I'm wondering from you guys what

26:34.160 --> 26:41.320
are in Mark Ross and spoke to this a little bit but what are the things which make collaborations

26:41.320 --> 26:46.960
you know successful in the way that when we look forward to our futures what do we hope

26:46.960 --> 26:50.160
the future of collaboration looks like is it always going to look like it looks right

26:50.160 --> 26:55.680
now or how can we make it look better.

26:55.680 --> 27:00.960
When we talk about the space to collaborate it might be interesting to consider how we

27:00.960 --> 27:05.520
can enhance opportunities to connect first and I think heard from people who spoke so

27:05.520 --> 27:11.360
far some wonderful examples of interfaces between how things you know evolved.

27:11.360 --> 27:17.240
I would like to answer your original question by starting with a given example the thought

27:17.240 --> 27:18.800
experiment okay.

27:18.800 --> 27:26.280
Even all humans can see color between only green and yellow that's it you cannot see

27:26.280 --> 27:32.160
anything else most likely what your eyes will show you also white because your septus

27:32.160 --> 27:36.240
in your eye will mix the colors and give you white and black if there's no color so you

27:36.240 --> 27:42.600
see white, yellow, green and black that's it and we evolve that way and that's what we

27:42.600 --> 27:43.920
can see.

27:43.920 --> 27:51.400
And then one day I invited to my lab and I give you a pair of goggles put them on and

27:51.400 --> 27:59.520
bang you see the dark color spectrum everything color red blue violet everything around us.

27:59.520 --> 28:05.080
As an artist it's just if you are an artist who put those goggles on it might completely

28:05.080 --> 28:07.120
open up your world.

28:07.120 --> 28:11.840
What I would like to say is that there are actually many such goggles today all around

28:11.840 --> 28:19.000
the world some of which are weak salt which open up which to a scientist and I'm speaking

28:19.000 --> 28:23.480
as a physicist I have no clue what can they expire in an artist.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.920
There's a disconnect there's a latency when these and I'm not talking about technology

28:27.920 --> 28:31.360
only I think a lot of you were talking mostly about technology which I think is a wonderful

28:31.360 --> 28:35.880
interface between I'm also technologist and I believe in technology but I'm talking about

28:35.880 --> 28:42.920
the ability of science to provide tools that open up your perception as an artist that

28:42.920 --> 28:47.320
most artists are not aware of because there's also disconnect between the two communities

28:47.320 --> 28:53.360
that Daniel touched on you know artists talk about galleries and leaders and scientists

28:53.360 --> 28:58.920
talk about journals and as graduate students so there's a disconnect.

28:58.920 --> 29:06.360
So I think one of the questions I'd like to propose is to find ways for these interfaces

29:06.360 --> 29:10.320
to exist so people can see those goggles.

29:10.320 --> 29:14.880
One way which I don't see much of at all as someone who has to go to conferences all

29:14.880 --> 29:19.280
the time New York City for example is known for its galleries and wonderful theaters and

29:19.280 --> 29:24.160
so on but people forget that on a short week in New York City there are at least 12 scientific

29:24.160 --> 29:26.800
conferences being held you know here.

29:26.800 --> 29:32.200
The tops scientific societies hold the conferences here.

29:32.200 --> 29:37.160
I've never seen an artist in my conference my physics conferences even in New York City.

29:37.160 --> 29:44.880
Why not bring people or have the institution level first you will have the American Physical

29:44.880 --> 29:53.200
Society for example with NEA or collaborate on some event that will bring the two together

29:53.200 --> 29:58.200
where first just wandering around scientific conferences an artist and they're quite often

29:58.200 --> 30:03.080
specially talks they might not understand at all but there are sometimes technologies

30:03.080 --> 30:05.800
or imagine a microscope.

30:05.800 --> 30:11.640
This is another example of seeing scale that before cannot be seen.

30:11.640 --> 30:17.120
There are when an artist took to a microscope sees complete different world an abstracted

30:17.120 --> 30:22.960
world which can inspire him or her and that those tools can be seen at conferences.

30:22.960 --> 30:28.440
They are quite often not only actual tools but ideas.

30:28.440 --> 30:32.480
Of course there is a disconnect in terms of the convention you have to know mathematics

30:32.480 --> 30:36.680
you have to know physics to appreciate details but sometimes that disconnect is actually

30:36.680 --> 30:40.840
advantageous because you see the aesthetic aspect of exposure.

30:40.840 --> 30:47.440
So what I'm suggesting is that should be more institutionalized proactive bringing together

30:47.440 --> 30:53.080
of people because the latency between the time when an idea and science comes in and

30:53.080 --> 30:57.040
sometimes decades before an artist picks up on it.

30:57.040 --> 31:03.960
To accelerate this I think and also I encourage a proactive attitude on the individual level.

31:03.960 --> 31:10.480
Artists really skip going to these conferences and there's some dread involved but the only

31:10.480 --> 31:13.960
thing you show you is not as much of the dread of some physicists I know going into gallery

31:13.960 --> 31:17.320
in Chelsea trying to make sense of what's going on in the walls.

31:17.320 --> 31:23.440
So it takes going over that hill and once you do I think the whole world opens up.

31:23.440 --> 31:27.240
Well it seems to me you essentially have done that experiment.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.240
No.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.600
But to the Broad Institute as an artist you've done that experiment so what would you say

31:32.600 --> 31:41.880
was the outcome of having more colors added to your vision.

31:41.880 --> 31:48.560
So I see the world a little differently than that.

31:48.560 --> 31:55.600
I think as artists we're trained to think about representation and I come from I'm

31:55.600 --> 32:00.240
French American I was born in India and sort of Jewish but not religious I grew up in France.

32:00.240 --> 32:07.200
So for me there was always meaning was always context dependent and so and I think a lot

32:07.200 --> 32:12.720
of artists think about the world in that way that they are aware of the tools they use

32:12.720 --> 32:21.640
and the representational systems that they use and so when I went to the Broad I was

32:21.640 --> 32:26.760
curious about what are the tools that we use today in science.

32:26.760 --> 32:32.000
What does the space of science look like and I wasn't so much interested in painting

32:32.000 --> 32:39.480
cells or neurons or double helices but I was interested in you know for example reading

32:39.480 --> 32:44.880
about physics you know strength theorists talk about maybe there are 10 dimensions but

32:44.880 --> 32:50.200
they're curled up in such a way that we can't understand that we see them and I was like

32:50.200 --> 32:54.360
no way you know like I know that there are three dimensions I'm a good three dimensional

32:54.360 --> 33:02.040
thinker maybe four but this is crap you know and the first time I met so the colleague

33:02.040 --> 33:07.200
at the Broad who invited me he said well you can think of dimensionality in a different

33:07.200 --> 33:13.560
way you can think of information and so we choose to chart space on three axes a point

33:13.560 --> 33:18.760
in space with three axes but if you want to chart its temperature you can add an axis

33:18.760 --> 33:22.200
and if you want to chart its fuzziness you can add an axis and its color you can add

33:22.200 --> 33:31.120
an axis and all of a sudden it kind of blew my mind that this was a new tool it wasn't

33:31.120 --> 33:36.920
a I mean perhaps it's a sense that it was a set of goggles right it was a story that

33:36.920 --> 33:45.560
allowed me to look at the world very differently however I also brought my you know I'm a highly

33:45.560 --> 33:52.160
trained visual thinker and I brought my tools and I was not so much interested in just learning

33:52.160 --> 33:57.440
from scientists although that had a huge part but I was also I had the kind of hubris to

33:57.440 --> 34:01.840
think that I could also contribute to the discussion and help them make better science

34:01.840 --> 34:09.880
that it would be a two-way street and so you know on the base level people talk a lot

34:09.880 --> 34:16.400
about the genome as a series of four letters right and it's very powerful because you can

34:16.400 --> 34:22.640
reduce this highly complex framework or this highly complex reality to something for which

34:22.640 --> 34:28.120
we have lots of tools right we've spent thousands of years analyzing texts and doing numerology

34:28.120 --> 34:36.760
so we can manipulate this Bible with a high level of sophistication and but as you do that

34:36.760 --> 34:42.800
you forget that they're not letters right and it's not that that they represent other

34:42.800 --> 34:48.440
things and that they exist in three-dimensional space with electric potentials and etc etc

34:48.440 --> 35:01.520
etc and so you know I listened to this ACTG thing and I went well so you're you're using

35:01.520 --> 35:06.520
you know the idea that genes is sort of like a verb right it's sort of a word and at the

35:06.520 --> 35:11.240
time people talked a lot about junk DNA right so there was these sequences of code that were

35:11.240 --> 35:17.200
like words that were genes and there was all this shit and in between them that was junk

35:17.200 --> 35:23.120
because it wasn't doing anything that we could tell as a visual artist I know that the negative

35:23.120 --> 35:30.800
space of things is essential to the thingness of things right so you know the first thing

35:30.800 --> 35:36.720
you know I learned in art classes was to a person who draws this is our universe right

35:36.720 --> 35:42.760
and anywhere you touch the universe you change the whole thing and so as I draw a cup I know

35:42.760 --> 35:47.920
that it's operating and it's changing the whole thing if I draw the outline or and so I was

35:47.920 --> 35:54.600
like I don't believe that that's junk you know and it's not my saying that that changed

35:54.600 --> 35:59.680
the fact that people realize that junk DNA isn't junk but I was able to kind of critically

35:59.680 --> 36:04.280
intuit that that there was information there because it was it's a representation space

36:04.280 --> 36:10.840
and that's one of the things that artists bring to science basically is just an example

36:10.840 --> 36:16.600
you gave up precisely different kind of goggles okay example I mean the goggles not have to

36:16.600 --> 36:22.600
be colored or sound or it can be ideas and you happen to have an abstracted abstraction

36:22.600 --> 36:27.640
a bend for abstraction which is wonderful one could be inspired by a mathematical ideas

36:27.640 --> 36:33.800
and as a which is a good example of we share those thoughts we give each other goggles and

36:33.800 --> 36:39.360
part of the part of the richness I think of the of transdisciplinary work is that and

36:39.360 --> 36:45.680
there's reasons for this I think that we increase the point the points of view on set

36:45.680 --> 36:50.080
on problem sets and we enrich them and that that echoes in our culture at the moment that

36:50.080 --> 36:55.720
we're thinking and for lots of different reasons high dimensionally we're thinking in terms

36:55.720 --> 37:00.840
of polypiliphanies we're thinking in terms of these integrative social systems and we

37:00.840 --> 37:09.360
need non domain specific ways of addressing them so what if the residency had not been

37:09.360 --> 37:20.040
in like a science context what if it was a neutral space with microscopes technologies

37:20.040 --> 37:26.720
and all of these things were disconnected from art and science and again I go back to

37:26.720 --> 37:31.840
for example the dooders stat center which is like part of the University of Michigan

37:31.840 --> 37:37.240
I quote that because I'm I had taught there for eight years and the dooders stat center

37:37.240 --> 37:46.600
is completely agnostic run by the provost serves everyone and open 24 seven but taking

37:46.600 --> 37:52.520
people out of the equation and they have and they have virtual reality caves they have

37:52.520 --> 37:58.480
three hundred and sixty degrees stereoscopic screens they have five hundred independent

37:58.480 --> 38:03.600
workstations for the experimentation with digital technology and you will be in there

38:03.600 --> 38:10.520
at three o'clock in the morning and the person to your left is is from biology the person

38:10.520 --> 38:14.840
to your right is from naval architecture and marine engineering the person behind you

38:14.840 --> 38:23.760
is from school of medicine person over there is from arts and sciences right how does this

38:23.760 --> 38:30.080
shift the way that we think about that connective tissue between us and I realize I'm putting

38:30.080 --> 38:33.960
out a thought experiment how do we imagine this would shift the conversation because

38:33.960 --> 38:38.560
I've done residencies in scientific context as well and they're wonderful and this isn't

38:38.560 --> 38:46.400
in any way of criticism of that but I'm wondering if if imagining this other space would provide

38:46.400 --> 38:53.280
us with an opportunity to ask a different set of questions I was just thinking about

38:53.280 --> 38:58.880
the idea of space because I curate a speaker series in Brooklyn called the empiricist

38:58.880 --> 39:04.640
league and what what we do is we get scientists and researchers and journalists to get on stage

39:04.640 --> 39:10.880
the same stage the comedians and musicians and people of a different sort of skill set

39:10.880 --> 39:16.480
get on stage and talk about their work you know in 15 for 15 minutes and I think you

39:16.480 --> 39:21.280
know I've also been in the position where I've gone to as an artist gone to a conference

39:21.280 --> 39:27.760
where I didn't understand the jargon but I immersed myself in it this is because I was

39:27.760 --> 39:34.560
involved in this I'm involved in the synthetic biology community and I think that it takes

39:34.560 --> 39:41.320
it's a lot of effort as an artist to be immersed into a field science field of science like

39:41.320 --> 39:48.360
that because you have to you have to take in what's been said and be patient with yourself

39:48.360 --> 39:53.160
and understand that you'll you'll the jargon will become more familiar in time and then

39:53.160 --> 39:57.480
you have conversations with people and you and you kind of compare your your jargon your

39:57.480 --> 40:02.600
mutual jargon and see if you can find overlap so it's it's an interesting process as an

40:02.600 --> 40:09.120
artist to be so closely intertwined with with a scientist you know I experienced this when

40:09.120 --> 40:14.280
I was working on the synthetic biology curriculum with Natalie Kildel and the amazing team that

40:14.280 --> 40:20.200
I worked on it with just kind of being quiet and listening to ideas come up and take notes

40:20.200 --> 40:24.040
and then the next time you have the conversation with them you understand a little bit more

40:24.040 --> 40:29.760
and you can you can and you had said something about about observation and I think that translation

40:29.760 --> 40:34.560
is a part of that as well as an artist like you're you observe what's happening you observe

40:34.560 --> 40:39.560
a process you you question it you think about how it's depicted visually because it is

40:39.560 --> 40:46.320
like a symbol and then you translate it into a piece of work or a graph or a diagram or

40:46.320 --> 40:54.080
or yeah just something that somebody else can build off of so yeah I want I wanted to come

40:54.080 --> 40:57.840
back to this idea of tools because I think that you know we've been talking a lot about

40:57.840 --> 41:03.200
the emphasis of you know kind of repurposing tools and using these tools in different settings

41:03.200 --> 41:10.320
and neutral settings that the way I often think about you know accessing and infiltrating these

41:10.320 --> 41:16.040
spaces or conferences is is also thinking a little bit more in my case and you know I

41:16.040 --> 41:22.440
have kind of a distorted world where a lot of my films are about animals and the way I

41:22.440 --> 41:28.240
kind of infiltrate these conferences is by kind of this anthropomorphic kind of entrance

41:28.240 --> 41:34.840
into these world so I made a my first film was about fruit flies because I spent 10 years

41:34.840 --> 41:41.360
with them they were kind of my my friends I spent 10 most of the time looking at fruit

41:41.360 --> 41:47.640
flies and imagining that I was kind of like a calf they ask like human size fly so I'll

41:47.640 --> 41:53.960
spare you guys with with those dreams they they appear in some of my movies but but the

41:53.960 --> 42:01.440
way I was able to access there was two ways one was through kind of taking a subject matter

42:01.440 --> 42:06.880
I'm very interested in this idea of animals as subject matters in which you can you know

42:06.880 --> 42:12.760
you can create a film that has a kind of a merge of scientific information as well as

42:12.760 --> 42:17.160
kind of like a fictional representation and you can access these conferences you know like

42:17.160 --> 42:22.880
the dress off of conferences that that attract thousands and thousands of people all around

42:22.880 --> 42:27.320
the world and I find that you know there's a lot about the synthesis of the tools but

42:27.320 --> 42:34.520
the way the way I kind of get into these worlds is through these model organisms or through

42:34.520 --> 42:39.400
the actual participants in this case scientists which I invite scientists to be involved in

42:39.400 --> 42:47.280
fictional films so Stuart I think who has spoken or will speak Stuart Fierstein plays a 1920s

42:47.280 --> 42:54.560
professor of he plays Thomas Hunt Morgan in the 1920s lab at Columbia but I and then I

42:54.560 --> 43:00.280
had Leslie Vochal who works on smell play a scientist in the 20s but by involving these

43:00.280 --> 43:07.280
scientists in art projects where they're not only passive advisors but are actually involved

43:07.280 --> 43:11.680
in the making of this project even though there's a bit of resistance initially I find

43:11.680 --> 43:15.320
that I can access you know it's the same way as when you make a film and you want to get

43:15.320 --> 43:19.640
you know this actor will I try to get these scientists that are kind of the experts in

43:19.640 --> 43:25.960
their field to put them in a in a kind of leave their comfort zone and put them in these

43:25.960 --> 43:30.720
settings where they may be talking about their work but they may also be in a fictionalized

43:30.720 --> 43:37.880
setting so think this idea of tools is very important but the tools are evolving and incredible

43:37.880 --> 43:42.560
speed and I feel that the tools will eventually it's you know it's like when you go to film

43:42.560 --> 43:47.000
school and they teach you about the latest cameras but ultimately all of this will change

43:47.000 --> 43:52.120
and and evolve so I think it's important to think about how the tools will enable these

43:52.120 --> 43:59.120
kind of ideas or whether it's also like a mathematical equation or an animal or and I find that

43:59.120 --> 44:03.960
for me the all the scientific jargon that you were mentioning I find that there's a lot

44:03.960 --> 44:09.600
of ways of making parallels between these you know these kind of very abstract ideas

44:09.600 --> 44:14.560
and and make these parallels between the lives of scientists and you know what does it mean

44:14.560 --> 44:19.920
to study the genes that dictate color in a in a butterfly wing and how does that relate

44:19.920 --> 44:27.920
to to a person so I oftentimes transpose or translate these ideas or these equations into

44:27.920 --> 44:32.920
people's lives and and kind of find these relationships between between micro and macro

44:32.920 --> 44:39.000
so I think just to like put this out on the floor I think that you know we think a lot

44:39.000 --> 44:44.960
about tools and we think a lot about DIY spaces that have PCR machines and you know all these

44:44.960 --> 44:51.320
tools but I think ultimately it's you know over the last hundreds of years it's it is

44:51.320 --> 44:56.760
this idea that that kind of motivates these collaborations and so I like that you've

44:56.760 --> 45:03.440
inverted the normal model and you're inviting scientists into an artistic space I think

45:03.440 --> 45:07.160
like maybe also in response to your observations like I would like to see more of that like

45:07.160 --> 45:11.120
what would it mean to have a scientist in residence at a museum or an art or an engineer

45:11.120 --> 45:18.640
in residence in an art context and I think all in college came up once in a in the prior

45:18.640 --> 45:24.560
panel but there's a really wonderful professor there Sarah Hendren who is launching this so

45:24.560 --> 45:29.840
they recently have got some funding to do engineering placements into art engine art

45:29.840 --> 45:37.840
organizations for their students so yeah I mean that's that's a great methodology you

45:37.840 --> 45:44.240
don't do genetics anymore no I don't I mean I dabble in science when I work in a film because

45:44.240 --> 45:49.080
I get to actually come back and shadow scientists and work in those environments and and I will

45:49.080 --> 45:54.920
say that back to your point it is hard to access these worlds and being a geneticist has helped

45:54.920 --> 46:04.240
me but was it doesn't the other way around yeah it's a question I ask myself often is

46:04.240 --> 46:09.760
whether if I have inverted kind of the experience and my background in terms of studying film

46:09.760 --> 46:16.560
and I think that yeah it's a question that I that is a fundamental question I think you're

46:16.560 --> 46:22.560
touching on which I think is to be interesting we all agree that there's a fundamental relationship

46:22.560 --> 46:29.480
between science and and and art I mean aesthetics deals with beauty perception beauty science

46:29.480 --> 46:34.280
deals with truth since Plato to hide a group people talk about truth and beauty being the

46:34.280 --> 46:40.320
same or fundamentally related so we all agree on that the fact that we are here believing

46:40.320 --> 46:47.040
it and we're talking about the fact that how science can and those goggles and those equations

46:47.040 --> 46:55.040
can inspire artists but now both of you open up like turn the table almost and ask it begs

46:55.040 --> 47:03.560
asking fundamental question can art fundamentally enhance science fundamental science it's a

47:03.560 --> 47:09.160
it's not clear to me by the way I mean of course as an artist as a scientist I as a who

47:09.160 --> 47:17.160
loves art yeah no but I'm not sure I'm not totally sure how as a scientist and perception

47:17.160 --> 47:25.800
of of course on a fundamental level there is a looking for simple ideas simple equations

47:25.800 --> 47:31.000
must perceive beauty in simplicity as a whole movement in physics trying to unify things

47:31.000 --> 47:37.880
down to simple single equation possibly and as it people question whether there is such

47:37.880 --> 47:46.440
a thing or with such a funneling down to a single equation is indeed a true a true fundamental

47:46.440 --> 47:52.120
thing to do or an affection of our aesthetic tendencies but my question the question we

47:52.120 --> 47:59.400
would like to put forward is to what extent art can inspire science I think that the first

47:59.400 --> 48:06.200
thing to think about before we you know even address that the question is we first have

48:06.200 --> 48:10.880
to kind of demystify this idea that science is objective and science is you know it's

48:10.880 --> 48:16.200
always about striving for accuracy and I think you know when I approach any type of collaboration

48:16.200 --> 48:22.520
I'd love to mix to kind of work in this middle ground between what is real and what is unreal

48:22.520 --> 48:27.680
and so I think you know what's important is to understand that there's a lot of subjectivity

48:27.680 --> 48:32.960
there's a lot of interpretation and you know and creating narratives when you're publishing

48:32.960 --> 48:41.920
papers that shouldn't necessarily pollute or misconstrue the facts I think you know it

48:41.920 --> 48:48.080
actually enhances it in many ways and I think that is how I think arts art can really help

48:48.080 --> 48:51.840
the scientists is to think about you know how do we use these tools and repurpose them

48:51.840 --> 48:58.200
or how do we think about these questions in different ways you know I have the story where

48:58.200 --> 49:02.400
when I was working on this film about fruit flies I created a by thorax fly that has four

49:02.400 --> 49:07.840
wings and I had many labs in New York that were involved in trying to generate this fly

49:07.840 --> 49:12.160
I had to be in these 18 degree chambers and it's very hard to make because they can't

49:12.160 --> 49:17.080
get out of the pupa and then suddenly we were shooting we were maybe like in the first week

49:17.080 --> 49:22.360
of shooting and somebody told us at Rockefeller that they had this by thorax fly so we went

49:22.360 --> 49:27.480
over to the lab we brought it in a petri dish and a taxi was like escorted and then we brought

49:27.480 --> 49:33.680
it on set we had like these huge cameras and ready to shoot and it lived maybe for a minute

49:33.680 --> 49:39.720
more but when I made the film I had all these scientists that asked me how I generated this

49:39.720 --> 49:45.160
fly so I thought that the film had actually contributed because there was actually no video

49:45.160 --> 49:50.920
of this four wing fly only these images that were made by Ed Lewis and a long time ago but

49:50.920 --> 49:57.040
but anyway this is a case where the film actually gave people ideas about trying to generate

49:57.040 --> 50:05.000
this fly but I think yeah just a side note there I think that you know inherently artists

50:05.000 --> 50:10.560
are there also to kind of show the scientists that the information that they have the facts

50:10.560 --> 50:16.720
that they have they can be used in other ways there's a bit of a danger in what you first

50:16.720 --> 50:21.400
I completely agree with you scientists are full of the biases there could be somewhere

50:21.400 --> 50:26.440
on the on the spectrum of aesthetically minded or not and but we are all at our biases it's

50:26.440 --> 50:32.240
projected in our work but we teach our graduate students when the writer paper they see something

50:32.240 --> 50:38.200
not to tell it because in the making some more beautiful or more aesthetic or more poetic

50:38.200 --> 50:43.200
the other way around of course you all fail to some extent but there's a danger in trying

50:43.200 --> 50:51.800
to inject statuses in the practice of science scientists will recall that we are taught to

50:51.800 --> 50:57.000
recall at it so it's a I'm not saying it's a bad thing the experiment can be wonderful

50:57.000 --> 51:02.240
can be you know although the way we learn is through narrative the way the way I think

51:02.240 --> 51:07.680
aesthetics I agree with you is is is a tricky line but the way we ingest information is

51:07.680 --> 51:13.040
by telling stories inherently whether it's facts you know whether it's experiments that

51:13.040 --> 51:17.040
we did in a chronological fashion or we you know we did experiments over six years but

51:17.040 --> 51:23.520
then we streamline into this paper then so you're inviting the physicists to tell story

51:23.520 --> 51:28.120
artistically in the physical review letters or no not artistically but you have to tell

51:28.120 --> 51:32.160
a story in order to present your data but also powers of observation are very different

51:32.160 --> 51:36.480
between artists I mean I was just a Roger Molina's watering hole a couple of weeks ago

51:36.480 --> 51:41.560
at UT Dallas and there was someone there Patrice Legal who is working with an artist and they

51:41.560 --> 51:48.120
set up these large fluid tanks and he's a works in fluid dynamics and they worked I believe

51:48.120 --> 51:54.280
I could be forgive me if this isn't entirely accurate but as I understand it this pool

51:54.280 --> 52:03.120
was tipping back and forth and they were photographing waves with a very high speed camera and

52:03.120 --> 52:08.040
through the observation of first of all through the setup and through the observation of

52:08.040 --> 52:14.160
these waves they discovered that certain parts of the wave formation itself are still on

52:14.160 --> 52:19.720
the surface of the water this is scientific discovery this is completely new scientific

52:19.720 --> 52:29.240
discovery so I think there are depending on the setup and the lens through which you observe

52:29.240 --> 52:34.320
phenomena I think this is something that artists bring to the table that it can be quite different

52:34.320 --> 52:39.880
and another example former colleague of mine when we were working with particle and theoretical

52:39.880 --> 52:48.000
physicists ended up using the math from physics to visualize a botan and it was a different

52:48.000 --> 52:52.600
interpretation of the math but the math was correct and he brought this back to the physicists

52:52.600 --> 52:58.640
the physicists said holy cow the math is right but we never thought that it could turn into

52:58.640 --> 53:05.280
a form that looked like this this went back and fundamentally changed the research that

53:05.280 --> 53:14.000
was occurring in that physics lab so I think there are occasions where the kind of interpretive

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
lens through which an artist will look at mathematics and the ways in which an artist will actually

53:21.000 --> 53:26.880
observe phenomena can actually bring something quite unique to the table so I have a question

53:26.880 --> 53:34.880
for all of you and this is something I've been wondering about a lot of science art collaborations

53:34.880 --> 53:42.920
maybe 98% of them are started by artists scientists usually agree in the end yeah that was great

53:42.920 --> 53:47.600
I enjoyed that and maybe it added to their work maybe it revealed something about their

53:47.600 --> 53:54.000
work maybe they just liked it because it was fun we need the dating service right but my

53:54.000 --> 53:59.680
question is does anybody have a problem with the fact that that's true that this world

53:59.680 --> 54:06.240
is pretty much artist initiated is that problematic or not I don't really know if I haven't really

54:06.240 --> 54:14.600
necessarily found that to be true just because like as an artist I guess one of the biggest

54:14.600 --> 54:20.160
projects that I worked on was like I said the curriculum and I ended up working on that

54:20.160 --> 54:25.600
because the scientists asked me to because I made like a like an artifact I made a diagram

54:25.600 --> 54:30.720
that explained a process and she saw it was like this makes sense to me I think that this

54:30.720 --> 54:36.360
would be great for the book and we can apply this to how we teach it you know and so I didn't

54:36.360 --> 54:41.240
actually actively seek out the collaboration with her I just made something and said here

54:41.240 --> 54:48.120
look at it you know and was open to corrections and criticisms but I want to talk about something

54:48.120 --> 54:52.680
really quickly about the notion of story because even within like the world of art and the

54:52.680 --> 54:59.200
world of science story can be jargony because I mean I worked in the marketing and advertising

54:59.200 --> 55:04.120
world and and they would they would just harp on the idea of story story story story story

55:04.120 --> 55:10.960
and and what when I think of story from that perspective it's like a crafted narrative

55:10.960 --> 55:17.400
that leads you to a specific outcome which is you know to a purchase that's what it is

55:17.400 --> 55:21.920
and so but but when you're talking about science in term I mean I'm sorry story in terms of

55:21.920 --> 55:28.000
science you're looking at data and you're seeing what patterns emerged from the data

55:28.000 --> 55:33.840
you know and maybe you have an idea of what story you'd like to tell but I mean at least

55:33.840 --> 55:38.320
this is experience that I had when I was working with you know another collaborator who's a

55:38.320 --> 55:42.520
scientist and she was like I'm looking for the story I'm like what do you mean we have

55:42.520 --> 55:49.400
the story it's like how do you know artists and scientists think alike or not not alike

55:49.400 --> 55:54.800
you know and she's like no I mean like the story like the minutiae the details like the

55:54.800 --> 56:04.880
patterns and I'm like oh story so yeah I mean still I think Judas point is still not a two

56:04.880 --> 56:10.600
way street this mostly these things are initiated by artists perhaps one way to get the balance

56:10.600 --> 56:17.960
off from 98% or so to maybe 90% is to encourage scientists I know in my inner to do art my

56:17.960 --> 56:22.680
university has a competition every year scientists are encouraged to make a picture or graphic

56:22.680 --> 56:27.520
and submit it and is it the art of science this is right called the art of science okay

56:27.520 --> 56:33.600
and and I've contributed to it I lost but I have no colleagues who want and we take it

56:33.600 --> 56:39.120
seriously so we all become an artist for a week and and so there could be things like

56:39.120 --> 56:47.480
this done at you know what my residencies are wonderful places to practice these things

56:47.480 --> 56:53.320
in my case it was the other way around I think for a long time maybe that was true I think

56:53.320 --> 56:59.520
we're we're in an emergent space it may be we tired of using that word but things are

56:59.520 --> 57:05.960
changing very fast and and there are more and more institutions that are trying to understand

57:05.960 --> 57:09.880
what's happening in the street sort of sort of so to speak and that are trying to support

57:09.880 --> 57:16.120
it I was really fortunate to be the past two years in a conference organized by the National

57:16.120 --> 57:05.960
Academy called NACFI National Academy's

57:18.960 --> 57:27.640
which is originally a science based interdisciplinary conference and two years ago they started inviting

57:27.640 --> 57:36.200
artists and designers and I know Roger was there Roger Molina was there and I think more and more

57:36.200 --> 57:43.360
these things are happening all over the place and and all sorts of different forms and I think

57:43.360 --> 57:53.080
one of the focus is shifting a little bit to okay well now we know that this is possible and

57:53.080 --> 57:58.280
and maybe now we can start tackling problems and I kind of wanted to come back to what Stuart had

57:58.280 --> 58:06.880
said you know we've found ways of interrogate we all interrogate the world and we're starting to

58:06.880 --> 58:11.880
see our relationship with it we've found out some things about our relationship to and effects on

58:11.880 --> 58:17.640
the world that are problematic I mean I'm adding now that are problematic and that we we're going

58:17.640 --> 58:24.000
to need to address and I think a lot of our motivations come from different kinds of sense of sense of

58:24.000 --> 58:32.880
urgency about what we can or could do in our siloed activity spaces and what we might be able to do

58:32.880 --> 58:39.720
by pooling efforts and points of view and I think there's so for example in the case of NACFI last

58:39.720 --> 58:47.120
year we came up with this idea this question does the ocean have memory and it's a silly question

58:47.120 --> 58:54.240
right of course the ocean doesn't have memory well wait a minute you know and so what's what's nice

58:54.240 --> 58:58.920
is that NACFI also has grants that follow the conference so we applied for Sea Grants and we're

58:58.920 --> 59:09.120
able to bring together 20 20 researchers from across oceanography the humanities and the arts to play

59:09.120 --> 59:14.560
and pose this question and we're kind of iterating this now and it turns out that there's a lot of

59:14.560 --> 59:19.600
fruitful ways to pose that question and just in the articulation of the words and then in the

59:19.600 --> 59:24.240
articulations of our disciplines and so that would set off a different series of narratives for each

59:24.240 --> 59:30.640
of the it sets out an echo chamber and ultimately what we're talking about is shifting and I guess

59:30.640 --> 59:35.680
that was one of the things I wanted to talk about before we leave it it or before we just open it

59:35.680 --> 59:43.440
to questions was we're in a space where we're starting to wonder about caring right and a few years ago

59:43.440 --> 59:52.160
there was a our chance conference at MIT and Bruno Latul was one of the speaker the keynote and he said

59:52.160 --> 59:57.040
you know the science is in about global warming the real question is why don't we care you know and

59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.880
I'm going to be working from now on this was Bruno speaking about why we don't care about Gaia and

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:11.600
I was kind of blown away by you know there's I think to some degree without trying to save the world

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.920
we're all wondering about that question what can I do right now and the reason that we're reaching

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.400
beyond our disciplines has something to do with that is that the solution obviously we're this

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:27.600
we're the cause of the problem so if we don't start acting differently and starting to find ways to

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:35.040
care for this planet that we live on we're toast you know absolutely and I mean I talk to a lot of

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:40.800
ecologists because a lot of my work involves you know environmental research and intervention and

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.560
I think that's a field actually where there's a huge amount of interest and work happening

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.720
inviting artists and designers into research projects because of this because you know this

01:00:52.720 --> 01:01:00.640
the those fields have struggled to get engagement and you know public discussion happening around

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:07.440
the findings and these very urgent problems that we all face and I'm both excited and terrified when

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.120
the discourse changes and all of a sudden the artists are going to come in and solve that problem

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.920
right but yeah I think perhaps this isn't there's not so much of an agenda to do this in physics

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:24.240
but definitely like in environment and ecology there is but I guess part of what that represents

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.760
is we're actually coming out of it we're not going into just into another I'm it's not just about

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.480
going into the lab or coming into the street it's actually going into our common street or whatever

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.200
we want to call it our common world and saying well we need to collaborate on this and it's no

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.880
longer about just doing art about science or science about art I can see how the environment

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:52.800
is a perfect environment for it but what would be another another discipline that would that would

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.720
have such a fraternity for I mean I think because of the way that science is taught it's so hard to

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.680
see outside of these dominant Western narratives that we all just live and breathe because that's

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:10.880
the way we're taught from literally like kindergarten right so an example that I've been talking about

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:18.720
a lot with some friends is recent apparently in the field of ecology they think that the way that

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:25.200
birds evolved to have wings wasn't anything about them trying getting like developing modes of

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.800
transport but it was about an interface for attracting mates right so that the birds would

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:36.160
perform and the wings get larger and it's about doing get attracting your whatever you know your

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.400
partner and so I think this like this idea of affective ecology the narratives of ecology we

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.960
think about it in a very functional sense right so you know wings were developed because you know

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.000
organisms want to get around better or that there's an advantage to doing that or you know when an

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.880
organism is moving around it's looking for food and we we have this super anthropomorphic

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:03.680
perspective on the way that we understand all systems and so I think understanding that affect

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.120
is something that isn't also exclusively human is obviously something that the arts is really

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.840
well versed in and can completely then change narratives of how we understand the natural world

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:19.600
that aren't necessarily in like traditional you know scientific I think those narratives are

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:26.800
really important Ursula Heiser at the Sustainability Institute at UCLA as an echo critic and she's

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:32.480
highly highly critical of the kinds of narratives that we're spinning around ecology today and

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.560
says that they're highly problematic and we have to think of entirely new narratives to actually

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:42.480
budge people forward and to think about futures with these changed environments that we're we're

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:48.880
soon to encounter but back to that idea of the narratives one word that hasn't come into this

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:55.200
conversation yet and I'd like to throw it out there is the word empathy because I teach in medical

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.760
humanities I'm the director of the Graduate School of Art at Washington University in St. Louis and

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:05.920
I've gotten some terrific grants to put together art science fellows groups one of them from the

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.760
Scandalera Center for Entrepreneurship because I managed to convince them that the bringing

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.000
together of artists scientists and humanists was in and of itself an entrepreneurial venture and

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:23.680
I got a nice big grant that culminated with this symposium at UCLA but the um in teaching

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:31.040
predominantly pre-med students and showing them again focusing not on the aesthetic qualities of

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:37.040
the work as much as I'm focusing on the kinds of discourses that the work attaches itself to using

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:44.240
medical practice contemporary medical practices both subject and object how is it that artists

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:50.720
then extend or expand upon conversations about the AIDS pandemic or about disease and healing

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:59.280
or about redesigning the human it's it's really changing the ways in which people going through

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:06.160
medicine training for to become either researchers or to go into clinical practice are really thinking

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.960
about their practice and we know that there's significant data that states that empathy is

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:18.640
extremely important for positive clinical outcomes and yet the average student who goes through

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.920
medical school over time loses empathy so they come in with a very high level of empathy and by

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.840
the time they graduate from medical school they have virtually none and I think increasingly more and

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:37.040
more universities are requiring of their medical students to take medical humanities courses this

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:43.920
has been one of the richest experiences I'm co-teaching with wonderful science historian Rebecca Mesparger

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:51.200
cultural historian and I'm just wondering you know the one word that I keep coming back to in this

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.200
course that I think I'm passing on to the men's students' empathy and I'm wondering if anybody

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.240
has I think by throwing that word out you didn't indeed open up my eyes to an answer to the question

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:07.040
I posed artists are better equipped in general of course to be they are humanist in the sense

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:14.160
that much more so on the average than scientists so how many scientists can build can build a nuclear bomb

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.800
now imagine how dangerous if a scientist who can who can build nuclear bomb and never had a poem

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:26.960
so there is this ethical dimension that the artist is on on the average better equipped to bring

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.800
into into this and all so I think that you touched on a very important point one thing that arts can

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.960
offer in detail science is this humanist view of the world that sometimes scientists can get

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.240
locked in locked out of I'm really glad that you brought up the the connect between art and medicine

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:50.000
because there's a lot of literature being published about that right now and I think it's we were

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.520
talking about you know where the ripe territories for the stuff that's definitely one place so we

01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:02.480
want to open it up to the audience for questions now you know the drill the lineup and uh yeah we

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:17.920
have let's see we have about 20 minutes for questions I I have to make that point that I have done art

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:28.800
that is actually science research and I discovered working with liquid formations that the physics

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:39.520
of liquid formation correlate to biological formation processes and a prime example of my findings is

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:46.160
that I discovered the formation process of the vertebrae I mean I can I don't know maybe can put

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:53.760
it out on the desk afterwards what do you think yes you throw it on the desk but if you have a

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:59.600
question for this panel we would love to hear it let me just finish okay but so what's shown

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:07.280
in what's also shown in ps1 one of those liquid formation vertebrae is in a collection of the

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:18.000
national gallery in Austria and other example of my findings is that I adrift green paint into

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:30.240
red gesso and this mouse formation came out science research um worship crab another paint splash

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.200
Stefan these might be better to look at up close don't you think okay and let me just say one more thing

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:49.440
um anyway spray can markings organisms I put them out there and they'll be out there when you want

01:08:49.440 --> 01:09:00.960
to talk okay but also my my website other dimension website deals with other dimension reality and

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:14.640
that is also research on the facts of other dimensions thank you can I can I say something

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.880
um I just want to mention because we're talking a lot about art practices and we have this

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.000
initiative at Evagion Science which some of the people in the audience have participated where

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.280
we're very interested in unpublished data and very interested in data that kind of sits on

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:39.120
computers especially video obviously because we and we try to um just it was just kind of inspired

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:47.360
by by these presentations these these images that we encourage scientists to actually give us their

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:53.920
data and present it in kind of a cinematic setting and I think that has been an amazing way of

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:59.840
getting scientists to feel that their research is being interpreted in a different way um and

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:06.240
having them actually be there and also talk about the data and we try not to over narrate or over

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.720
kind of explain what the data is we just show it as if it was kind of like an experimental film

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.560
from the from the 20s or something um you know like where they used to show like the Percy Smith

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.080
and the acrobatic fly or the mites on cheese or these types of things and um and we have this

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:28.320
other competition back because I wanted to talk his film I feel it's also the relationship every

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.520
art practices has a different way of thinking about it but we get a lot of scientists that are very

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.040
enthusiastic about participating in film and when we do this collaboration at Imagine Science

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.760
called symbiosis where we get scientists and filmmakers to collaborate usually the scientists

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.320
are you know I mean I don't want to generalize but they tend to be the most enthusiastic they tend

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.000
to open the labs and and be very open to these kind of collaboration so I've I found that if you have

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.360
the right setting and the right organizations these kind of closeted scientists that feel that maybe

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.880
some of their work is not meant to be used in other ways they just it opens it up and then we we

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:11.840
almost get them to be so excited that they want to still continue working and you know Andres here

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.720
he was part of that symbiosis competition and um and we have this event called the lab meeting where

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:21.760
midway through their the making of these films they talk about the the process of it so I find

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:28.240
that scientists actually they re-inject in the art community this kind of sense of of kind of new

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.680
wave and excitement where sometimes artists and again I'm generalizing may have a little bit more

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:39.120
of a blazae or kind of in scientists they just they get really excited and I always prefer to show

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:45.600
my films to scientists people and people in film festivals is a very like a very specific environment

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:51.360
where there's just a lot of pretentious whereas with scientists you just get like these inherent

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.920
excitement about about your point about taking data and information out of a context and put

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:05.680
another context can be really enriching and artistic in conferences or you can go if even if you are

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.400
a specialist you go to a session where you could be completely gibberish okay right and especially

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.400
if a life scientist goes into a physical scientist or vice versa and that will happen to me many times

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:19.120
and I see I sit in the back of the room and I look at the view graphs and the view graphs become

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:25.360
because that is disconnected from their context right completely visual right and it can be gorgeous

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.640
I mean it can be absolutely beautiful to look at and I think this is a great exercise to take real

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:38.160
data plots actually my my office is decorated with plots which are gibberish to most everybody else

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.400
but they are I presume they are beautiful to some extent but I think what you're doing is a

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.520
wonderful thing was to take things out of context and let the visual parts speak

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.600
yeah thank you we're going to take the next question now that's actually a good question

01:12:55.280 --> 01:13:00.480
my name is Anna Fine-Pour and you'll see my artwork later this evening and I'm really happy to be

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:08.400
here I've been working in scientific concepts not solely but it interests me and recently I was at

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:15.200
a event at National Academy of Sciences Alana's here but it wasn't her event and it was about gene

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:22.720
editing and my next project is for an exhibition at NIH about transposons and how they're expressed

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:28.960
in tulips and I found out that the tulip genome hasn't been sequenced so I asked this woman who

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:35.920
works on rare diseases you know I said you know why hasn't the tulip genome been sequenced nobody

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:41.600
can explain to me why except that it's very expensive and she said well you know it would be really big

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.240
and we'd have to understand it and I said no I don't have to understand it and so my question is how

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:55.120
with all of these issues there's not all scientists obviously but too many of them this idea that I

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.280
would say I don't have to understand it is very foreign to them and after the event there was

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:06.320
you know time to socialize and people came up to me and thanked me for putting it out there like

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:12.960
that so it's very much like I just want the visualization to use it as for collage I don't have to understand

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:20.800
how you got to that point so I think that's a really important issue for the scientists to

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:29.600
understand that we don't artists don't have to understand it but they don't always understand it

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.320
either yeah exactly thank you

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:50.720
I'm Dr. Shirley mother I am a physician I wanted to add some balance to the empathy issue I think

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:57.520
this was someone from the University of Chicago and he showed yes then medical students that when

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.560
they start they have a lot of empathy and at the end of their training they don't and then he went

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:09.520
into the positives and negatives of this and although it is true that having some empathy is a good

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:16.800
thing I think for a physician to have way too much empathy is a bad thing I mean that is part of the

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.880
beauty of becoming a doctor is to become objective about the patient for example I could never treat

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:31.280
my family it would be a disaster but I can treat people I don't know so like everything you know

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:37.680
how the whole world goes like this you know at one time one thing is good and that it isn't then

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.440
it's good again I think with the empathy issue that's kind of the same thing balance is the most

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:51.600
important thing not that you didn't say that but it's important to realize it right I'm having co

01:15:51.600 --> 01:16:00.960
teaching with people from radiology for you know about 15 years or so and I was astounded to learn

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.120
from the people that I knew at the universities that I had taught at that there was even only half

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:13.280
a day of ethics training that went into me so there's you know we get a lot of students coming

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:17.200
back and sitting in on our class and saying oh my god I wish we'd have had this course when we were

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:25.680
going through med school so you write it's it's I certainly understand the importance of being able

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:34.720
to make an objective decision in the delivery of medical assistance of any kind but they're you

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.520
know certainly for the students who are sort of taking the course and coming back a few years later

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.120
it seems to really be helping them so we'll see how it all balances out in 10 years yeah thank you

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:50.320
for your comments especially in surgery it's hard to have a lot of empathy you're going to slice into

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:59.120
somebody that's that's where anesthesiology comes into place right yeah hi first of all thank you to

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.520
everybody who's been on these round tables today and everyone who's asked questions I've really

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.800
enjoyed the day so far my name is Kate Saint-Ammon I'm the courtistic director of a New York based

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.920
dance company and for the past few years we've been digging into this intersection of science and art

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.000
we ended up creating an evening length work that Happy to Report Promure to New York went very well

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:27.840
and Edgar you mentioned about bringing art to like for example an APS conference and we did we

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.560
just did exactly that last month we took the whole company to the New England chapter University

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.680
over at Rhode Island to the APS conference and it was amazing what did you guys do we performed

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:41.920
our entire work for the conference and so we went to some of their conference and most of them came

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:48.080
to see the performance and we all spoke after so which kind of leads to my question which Daniel

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:54.800
I think you were starting to touch on we've done a few other examples of that but it just directly

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:59.680
correlated to what he said so that was one performance through which we performed the dance and engaged

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.320
with to us a new audience and what we're coming to a lot is you know I think what you do is amazing

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.400
I think what you do is amazing and that's great that we both know it's really important that what

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.840
we're talking about and doing and you know it's important but it's almost like what what do we do

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:20.800
some what do we do next or and you were talking about kind of bringing this to a more world

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.360
discussion and I don't know I'd be curious to hear you speak a little bit more about like what do we

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.520
do next or what can we do because there is a sense that it's important that we're talking and

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.880
figuring stuff out and having these conversations but sometimes it's good to hear a new perspective

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:40.960
of why like why it feels so important why do you think it's important I think I could

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.560
I could keep listening to all of you say all of these things that are exactly and I think in the

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:52.400
last discussion art can sometimes embody something that we can't say and it can be ugly and beautiful

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.240
and confusing and intelligent all at the same time so for me corn and mechanics just sparked

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.560
something in me very specific and I I knocked on a lot of doors along the way because I am in no way

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:12.000
as scientists so it can say anything nothing and everything I don't want to get too far into my

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.400
personal experience but I feel that it's important and I feel that I learned something after every

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.800
conversation or every performance that I didn't know before and that's what I hear happens after

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.320
people are watching what we're doing so I don't know maybe I'm just seeking more words to quantify

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:34.480
that as we continue to grow our work. Last year at the Space in Between Conference Ellen

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:41.360
Levy who's sitting over there talked about attention and how her work was shifting to attention and

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:47.040
to look at attention there's some really great examples and questions that she asked but for me

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:54.720
that was really transformative and I think we're starting to pay attention you know like we we

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:03.440
are feeling a need to pay attention and it's very hard to pay attention I mean we could go into

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.440
discussion about evolutionary behaviors and stuff like that but if you're in the environment that

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:15.600
you're in always the same it you're you pay attention differently and as you start to reach out and

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.200
to be in a place where you don't quite know the rules or something will come up and you have never

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:28.880
seen it before oh my god you know you pay attention and so I think there's something in this space

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:34.320
that we're exploring which is allowing us to pay attention and we we know that it's urgent that we

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:41.280
do it so I think we all have different things that we're starting to pay attention to you know

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:48.320
places that we turn to for that sense of surprise in my practice in my just before I started working

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.000
with scientists I always move my paintings around in the studio because every time they're on a new

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.440
wall in the new light I see them differently and I can repaint them or I can find find clues to

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:02.960
how to continue them and I think there's something I mean I really think there's something happening

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:09.440
across our cultures where and whatever I have a whole you know theoretical framework around it

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.760
I won't bore you with it but I think there are some very profound changes that happened at the end

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:20.880
of the 19th century that put us into a new sets of causalities and where it's unfolding and at the

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:28.080
same time we're faced partly because we can see it because of those changes that happened we're

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:34.560
faced with these sort of mounting deadlines and so I think those two things together are making us

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:40.720
notice stop and notice and I think there's a real reason for it and you know that's what I think

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:44.720
that's why we're all in this room in some way because we stopped and we're noticing we're

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.040
wondering how to move from here you mentioned that you just want to add one thing to what you said

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.440
you mentioned that art has been described as conference as a certain mechanics press things

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.800
are beautiful ugly and confusing and then you mentioned that you're curious about quantum mechanics

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.040
as someone who teaches quantum mechanics can tell you you pick the right field because it's

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:11.280
it is it is really it can be very beautiful it can be the questions can get very ugly and

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:17.040
it's very confusing and the more the more you dig into it the more confusing it is so as an artist

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.560
you cannot have picked a better branch of physics

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:27.440
Hello hi my name is Leona I'm a laser accelerator student at

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.720
Goran's Berkeley Labs and I've been thinking about a lot of these questions a lot actually and

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:42.640
I think if you asked Einstein if his work with his violin was crucial he would say yes and for me

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:49.040
I have been I have a favorite author it's Jules Byrne and I don't research in exactly that field but

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.800
his work inspires me I've thought about this question of whether art is actually necessary

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:07.440
for scientists to be scientific not just whether art can inspire science and I don't have an answer

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:13.360
to that I'd like to think yes but I also know a lot of scientists who don't know anything about art

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:18.400
and seem to be pretty good scientists so anyway if you could address that would be great

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:32.000
I just wanted to mention two conferences that I don't know how many of you know about that do

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000
bring science and art together and they have art galleries and presentations by artists and they

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:45.440
have workshops at each of these one is called bridges which is an art and mathematics conference

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:52.480
and they have you know a day for families and children and play and so we're talking about

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.840
what can happen at these conferences they're a good example and the other one is it started out

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.960
as a society for literature and science and has become society for literature science and the arts

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.280
and so the kind of work you're talking about has been going on at these conferences for a very

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:17.840
long time and I recommend recommend them to anybody who wants to see how to keep going with this kind

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.120
of thing. Thank you yeah those are both really really great conferences I'm sure some of you in

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:29.440
the room have been there. At the risk of sounding like I'm just plugging an organization but it's a

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.760
good one for anybody who's interested in arts integration in general as the Alliance for the

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:40.080
Arts and the Research Institutions because they're looking at not only how art sort of permeates

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.720
and integrates across campus but how the other you know and again it's the more difficult part

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:50.720
of the conversation how are other you know disciplines coming to the arts but there's one

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.960
kind of branch or node of the research task force the National Research Task Force is called the

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:06.000
third tier aggregator that's looking to establish a research platform and also a kind of committee

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.880
of 100 people who will be qualified to assess transdisciplinary work and if we can get more people

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.200
able to navigate the tenure system who are doing this kind of work it will fundamentally change

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:24.720
the kinds of spaces that open up you know on university campuses the more sort of joint

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.840
appointments you get the more that we can assess this kind of work that's happening in this space

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:38.320
between and this is one group run by Kevin Hamilton and at Champaign Urbana and also

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:42.800
Dara Burnet Carnegie Mellon University they've been working very hard to sort of establish

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:49.200
this and it could again it could it could fundamentally change the way that research universities

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.600
where to have art programs are functioning and science of course is deeply embedded in

01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:01.440
in all of these conversations so yeah yeah well actually since we have yeah you touched on a very

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:07.680
important point creating academic positions in such a field just a field I think if I hear you

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:13.200
right you are exactly doing your faculty going through that process is this something that you

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:19.360
think is difficult are you facing difficulties or facing resistance from traditional academic

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.000
attitude towards merging to in in practicing as an academic?

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.200
Or not necessarily are you in your institution but in general?

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.640
Well I mean I'm very lucky at the moment in that the engineering school in YU is very unusual

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.200
because it used to be Brooklyn Polytech and so we have an SDS department we have a digital media

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.040
department within the engineering school which is like almost unheard of anywhere else but

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.840
it means that like within the school itself there is this interdisciplinarity which I

01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.160
did not experience in the other institutions I've been in I mean I think in the context of art

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:08.400
design there's a lot of opportunities for for people who are doing more interdisciplinary work

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.080
particularly people who are engaging with you know computation media arts as technology is sort of

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.440
and computation is seeping into all aspects of our lives I think there's an sort of an awareness

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:28.480
and an agenda for including that more centrally within an institutional context but I also think

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:35.840
and this relates to the STEAM panel that was earlier that the way that engineering and science

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:43.520
are taught excludes a huge amount of the population I mean if we look at who's in this room like we're

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:49.120
not exactly a hugely diverse bunch in here right why is that and like coming through an engineering

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.160
degree where literally at the start of every subject the professor would be like oh well 60%

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.400
of people failed last year so you better work really hard you know and it's like well that's

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.200
why we face these diversity issues in the Silicon Valley and in the lots of the sort of institutions

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:10.400
where we work we have the privilege of working and so I think for me one thing so I teach computer

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:17.680
science but through an art pedagogy so prompts assignments the work we do is open-ended it's about

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:24.160
personal expression it's not about you know working through problem sets as a traditional

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:29.840
computer science I'm gonna put a course up there unfortunately but all I was gonna say is that that

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:36.000
means that a different community of people feel invited and feel able to participate yes and that's

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.560
a really important part of the game and kind of could I excuse could I just make one more point we

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:47.920
do have to cut off okay the invitation to why don't we show up at more scientific conferences the

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:53.520
12 scientific conferences the artist that I know cannot afford the registration yeah so

01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:03.280
these conferences would put aside a registration or a free registration for an invite an art

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:10.560
that would help to me absolutely okay everyone um thank you conversations to be continued absolutely

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:24.400
thank you round table thank you so much is Jamie McCray in the room are you somewhere where are

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.200
you okay we are having an artistic interlude so if you want to do that fun thing of turning around

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:45.120
in your chair and facing the projector we're gonna watch some science based dance right now
