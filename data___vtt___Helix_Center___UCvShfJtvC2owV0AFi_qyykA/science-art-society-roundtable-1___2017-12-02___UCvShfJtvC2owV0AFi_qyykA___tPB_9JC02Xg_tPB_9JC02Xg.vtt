WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.560
Table discussion before lunch.

00:01.560 --> 00:05.000
So if you're feeling a little hungry, I promise we won't starve you.

00:05.000 --> 00:11.160
We are going to talk for the first time in this conference specifically about the relationship

00:11.160 --> 00:13.920
between science, art, and society.

00:13.920 --> 00:19.160
So we added this subject in because we've been talking a lot about specific examples

00:19.160 --> 00:22.840
in education, in collaborative working groups, et cetera.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.560
But there's this larger issue which encompasses everything that we're talking about.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.440
And that's the multi-directional relationship between science and art, art and society,

00:31.440 --> 00:32.880
and science and society.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.760
And my argument, and I'm happy to hear otherwise, is that all of those relationships are damaged

00:38.760 --> 00:40.280
or dysfunctional.

00:40.280 --> 00:46.500
And so what can we do to solve that and to build upon the relationships that we envision

00:46.500 --> 00:52.240
to kind of go towards the future that we envision for ourselves?

00:52.240 --> 00:57.960
So I will let Zach introduce the panelists.

00:57.960 --> 01:06.520
All right, so participants, if you could raise your hand as I call your name.

01:06.520 --> 01:12.360
Eric Hull is a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and a writer whose works

01:12.360 --> 01:17.840
have appeared in the Atlantic, American Fiction, and other publications.

01:17.840 --> 01:24.520
Seeing us again, Alana Quinn, Alana is an exhibit and program organizer at the Cultural

01:24.520 --> 01:29.560
Program at the National Academy of Sciences.

01:29.560 --> 01:36.840
Ben Lilly, Ben Lilly is a high energy particle physicist and co-founder and director of the

01:36.840 --> 01:41.520
story collider as well as a contributing editor for TED.com.

01:41.520 --> 01:48.120
He has founded a space called Kaviat, an intellectual events venue.

01:48.120 --> 01:57.080
David Grinspoon is an astrobiologist, award-winning science communicator, and prize-winning author,

01:57.080 --> 02:02.520
as well as an advisor to NASA on space exploration strategy.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.800
Elizabeth Demore.

02:04.800 --> 02:11.960
Elizabeth is a fine artist working in sculpture, digital media, and e-Go art to explore the

02:11.960 --> 02:16.680
interface between the built and natural environments.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.520
Stuart Feierstein.

02:20.520 --> 02:28.840
Stuart is a professor and former chair of the biology department at Columbia University

02:28.840 --> 02:34.240
where he studies vertebrate olfaction, as well as an author and advisor for the public

02:34.240 --> 02:38.880
understanding of science to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.240
With that, let's start the roundtable.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.240
Ben Lilly.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.840
So something that occurs to me is that this conversation wouldn't have felt as necessary

02:50.840 --> 02:53.640
a few decades ago.

02:53.640 --> 02:58.840
One of the reasons why is that historically, of course, artists and scientists have been

02:58.840 --> 03:06.040
very separate, there was a very important book called The Two Cultures by C.P. Snow about

03:06.040 --> 03:09.040
exactly how separate they are.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.680
But I feel that something kind of important began to happen in the 60s and 70s, which

03:13.680 --> 03:21.120
is that the public profile of science began to grow and moved out of just being something

03:21.120 --> 03:23.400
academic.

03:23.400 --> 03:29.960
And for instance, there are now science accounts on Twitter with millions of followers.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.640
And that simply did not exist prior to science popularization.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.280
The New York Times has a science section of its website.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.200
It didn't use to.

03:41.200 --> 03:48.680
So I think a lot of this is that science as a cultural institution, if Martians came

03:48.680 --> 03:52.960
to our planet and they were sociologists and they asked, what are some of the growing

03:52.960 --> 03:59.040
really important driving institutions to our culture, they would very quickly hit upon

03:59.040 --> 04:05.080
science, this collection of individuals and institutions and the ideas it's producing.

04:05.080 --> 04:09.040
And notice that it's been growing in relevancy.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.600
And I think at this point it's grown to such a degree that it's kind of colliding with

04:14.600 --> 04:19.760
art and all these other things that suddenly people are realizing, well, they not only

04:19.760 --> 04:24.920
have to deal with this, they have to come to some sort of understanding, whether it be

04:24.920 --> 04:29.720
of criticism, whether it be of support or whatever, but they have to do this.

04:29.720 --> 04:36.200
And so I just want to remark that what I see a lot of here is basically this kind of new

04:36.200 --> 04:41.960
error of collision because quite simply science has gotten so big and so important that art

04:41.960 --> 04:44.040
just has to deal with it.

04:44.040 --> 04:49.440
So I just wanted to chime in on that.

04:49.440 --> 04:55.040
So I do art and science collaboration, I'm a sculptor, but I'm a professor at Rutgers.

04:55.040 --> 04:59.880
And I teach in the engineering department and the computer science department in addition

04:59.880 --> 05:01.280
to the art department.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.960
And one of the interesting things I think about this sort of moment is that in so many

05:05.960 --> 05:13.040
different ways in genomic engineering, in AI, computer science, scientists, you know,

05:13.040 --> 05:16.480
once upon a time there was this idea of like the pure science says, right, you'd go and

05:16.480 --> 05:19.040
you'd study the natural world.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.000
And now even the quote unquote pure sciences are making the things that they're studying.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.280
So it's become sort of an applied practice.

05:28.280 --> 05:34.000
And in many ways I see similar kinds of activities happening in the science department that you'd

05:34.000 --> 05:35.880
see over in the art department.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.640
In other words, researchers are making the things that they're studying and then they're

05:39.640 --> 05:43.320
looking at sort of the emergent properties that are coming from it.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.840
So I think that that might also be sort of one of those other kinds of bridges that we're

05:47.840 --> 05:50.120
sort of seeing right now.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.800
It's interesting that I agree with everything you guys both just said that the historical

05:54.800 --> 06:00.000
perspective on the two cultures, this division.

06:00.000 --> 06:08.480
Of course, if you go back farther in history, there was no such division.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.720
Science didn't exist as a separate professional endeavor more than say 150 years ago, give

06:14.720 --> 06:16.960
or take.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.760
Certainly more than 400 years ago, that was a no such thing.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.600
Science was a branch of philosophy, it was natural philosophy, so it was a part of the

06:24.600 --> 06:25.600
humanity.

06:25.600 --> 06:30.800
So this professionalization, this splintering of our professional communities out of the

06:30.800 --> 06:35.480
specialization of knowledge, you know, it's easy to get down on that.

06:35.480 --> 06:40.760
In some sense that it's also been very necessary, we wouldn't have been able to learn and achieve

06:40.760 --> 06:43.160
a lot of what we have without that specialization.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.880
But then we've lost a lot too in our ability to reconnect.

06:47.880 --> 06:50.840
And I think in a way the same thing is true of art.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.520
Art has become a very professionalized endeavor, certainly fine arts.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.360
And that leads to some problems too.

06:58.360 --> 07:03.040
A word that hasn't come up, I don't think explicitly this weekend yet, but I think it

07:03.040 --> 07:07.800
has been implicit a lot in our discussions is elitism.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.680
And I think both art and science have a problem, have an elitism problem.

07:12.680 --> 07:19.440
And it hinders our ability to do in both areas what we feel we want to do, which is

07:19.440 --> 07:22.640
connect, foster wider connections.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.720
And I think the good news is that the kinds of collaborations we've been hearing about

07:27.720 --> 07:30.280
and talking about can really help.

07:30.280 --> 07:36.760
Both art and science can be helped with their elitism problems by working with one another.

07:36.760 --> 07:41.000
And I've experienced this somewhat in my collaborations.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.080
I primarily identify as a scientist, although I have been involved in a lot of collaborations

07:47.080 --> 07:54.160
with artists and I'm also performing musicians, so I get my art kick that way as well.

07:54.160 --> 07:59.720
And I found that one of the many values of these kinds of collaborations is they get

07:59.720 --> 08:05.880
us, and I mean us, collectively artists and scientists, out of our normal boxes and force

08:05.880 --> 08:16.480
us to extend beyond our normal audiences and present our work beyond our normal spaces,

08:16.480 --> 08:22.320
places where the presenting art in places that are not places where fine arts is normally

08:22.320 --> 08:25.800
presented as often one of the outcomes of these collaborations.

08:25.800 --> 08:34.800
And force scientists to expand our vocabulary in communicating with quote the general public,

08:34.800 --> 08:37.760
quote the non-professional non-science public.

08:37.760 --> 08:42.920
So I think we need each other to fight our elitism problem.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.280
And the good news is there's sort of a natural breaking down of those barriers that comes

08:46.280 --> 08:53.280
when we do this transdisciplinary work of working beyond our normal professional boundaries.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.720
I'll take a just look.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
Nice.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.720
We're going to already start?

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
Yeah, right.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.760
I'll just take a not entirely orthogonal point of view to that, but just sort of a little

09:05.760 --> 09:08.600
off to the side.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.520
So I just came back from a two-day symposium with the Santa Fe Institute on the limits

09:12.520 --> 09:13.520
of understanding.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.400
All I can tell you is I understand less now than less now than less.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.960
So whatever that's wrong.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.720
Yes, whatever the truth is highly successful.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.640
Highly successful.

09:23.640 --> 09:27.560
But one of the things that did come out of it, even though it was largely a science-oriented

09:27.560 --> 09:33.080
sort of symposium, was the idea of a plurality of methods of understanding.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.560
And I think we don't want to smush everything together.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.840
I do think there's a value to boundaries and borders.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.880
Good fences make good neighbors and things of that nature because there are a lot of

09:43.880 --> 09:46.200
ways to understand things.

09:46.200 --> 09:51.400
There's paintings are away, novels are away, scientific experiments are away.

09:51.400 --> 09:56.120
And I don't think we want to dismiss any of those ways or try and mush them all together.

09:56.120 --> 10:02.800
What we really want is to develop a more pluralistic approach, if anything, where not only—and

10:02.800 --> 10:04.320
I don't just mean diversity.

10:04.320 --> 10:11.160
I mean pluralism is, in my opinion, more than simply diversity, it's the ability to allow

10:11.160 --> 10:16.560
more than one thing to go forward, even though those two things are, as they say, incommensurable.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.200
They're at odds in some way or another.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.360
But they're both important ideas.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.800
There's a great quote of you don't mind.

10:22.800 --> 10:28.360
When Neil's board said the opposite of a fact is a falsehood, but the opposite of a profound

10:28.360 --> 10:32.120
truth is often another profound truth.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.720
And that, I think, really hard to hold in your head a little bit, but a very important

10:36.720 --> 10:38.080
idea to hold in your head.

10:38.080 --> 10:44.840
So I'm not entirely against some of the boundaries that we have with art and science.

10:44.840 --> 10:49.840
Now, the failure to communicate or whether the elitism or things like that, I mean elitism

10:49.840 --> 10:52.520
is a second issue which we could talk about.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.560
I'll just give the floor to Ben.

10:54.560 --> 10:59.160
But I think we do have to be a little—this came up a little bit in the last panel, the

10:59.160 --> 11:00.600
idea of expertise.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.960
And so elitism grows, unfortunately, is a little bit of a weed or a lichen on expertise.

11:05.960 --> 11:11.000
Well, we don't want to lose expertise in the fight against elitism, which I agree we could

11:11.000 --> 11:13.760
all do with a little more humility in this world.

11:13.760 --> 11:20.840
I'm actually going to pick up on the expertise thread first, which is one thing we've learned

11:20.840 --> 11:24.920
is—okay, so what I do now, I open an event space.

11:24.920 --> 11:29.760
And our notion is to provide a home for what we call intelligent nightlife.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.400
And we want a place where people can come out and have extraordinary things happen in

11:32.400 --> 11:35.200
the context of drinking with friends.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.940
But more than that, when I pitch to producers, what I want is a space where we have blending

11:38.940 --> 11:42.720
discussion of the academics with knowledge from the performing arts.

11:42.720 --> 11:49.600
And there, it's—what is key to us is recognizing the expertise that exists in all of the domains

11:49.600 --> 11:51.160
that we're bringing in.

11:51.160 --> 11:55.800
So for example, we bring in comedy groups and we ask them, you know, okay, you're really

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
great at comedy.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.320
Can you do something that fits our space?

11:58.320 --> 12:03.960
Can you do something that is in line with our mission of, you know, exhibiting thought

12:03.960 --> 12:04.960
in new ways?

12:04.960 --> 12:08.040
We're still searching for good ways of saying this.

12:08.040 --> 12:12.600
But so we've had a couple great successes with that.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.080
Just last night we hosted a group there called North Coast.

12:16.080 --> 12:22.560
They're a hip-hop improv group and they improvised a musical in the style of Hamilton and it

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
was brilliant.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.440
These people came in, they executed.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.440
It was gorgeous.

12:26.440 --> 12:30.160
A while ago we brought in another comedy group.

12:30.160 --> 12:37.080
They run what's known as a very supportive open mic, trying to develop new comics.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.640
And so we're like, great, we will bring them in.

12:38.640 --> 12:44.240
We'll give them the mission of doing shows that involve science or other think-y thoughts.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.400
And they said, yeah, yeah, great, we'll do that.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.520
And the show had nothing to do with that whatsoever.

12:48.520 --> 12:53.640
And there was somewhere along the line we forgot to look at what they were doing and

12:53.640 --> 12:56.400
say, oh, this is what their expert in.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.640
Let's work with their own expertise instead of trying to put what we want to have happen

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
on top of it.

13:01.640 --> 13:06.160
Whereas with North Coast they have developed their own expertise and now our job is to

13:06.160 --> 13:11.760
pair them with historians and people who are going to really make that sort of thing shine.

13:11.760 --> 13:16.120
But more broadly when you're talking about elitism, and this is a lesson we're learning

13:16.120 --> 13:24.320
and really trying to teach ourselves, whether you can get outside of the box by going trans

13:24.320 --> 13:28.840
disciplinary, it's not automatic and you have to do it very intentionally.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.000
And so part of that comes from what other expertise you recognize.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.040
If we're going out and we're working with comedy groups, are we only going out and working

13:38.040 --> 13:41.760
with ones that already serve sort of in elitist audience?

13:41.760 --> 13:44.560
And I've seen this happen, I've seen us do it.

13:44.560 --> 13:50.720
Or are we going out and looking for groups, I have a group coming in that organizes intellectual,

13:50.720 --> 13:56.520
it's called drunk education, he gets experts drunk and has them give talks about subjects,

13:56.520 --> 14:00.480
but one of the first things he said is great.

14:00.480 --> 14:06.280
It used to be called drunk TED talks but they sent him a cease and desist.

14:06.280 --> 14:11.640
I was great by the way.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.240
But one of the first things he said to me is that he organized one of his most successful

14:15.240 --> 14:18.720
events ever that brought in the most people was an evening of discussion of Carly Rae

14:18.720 --> 14:21.720
Jepsen.

14:21.720 --> 14:26.520
A lot of people in this crowd are going to look at that and say, is that really the

14:26.520 --> 14:28.640
arena we want to be playing in?

14:28.640 --> 14:32.520
And the answer is if you really are serious about breaking through this barrier and not

14:32.520 --> 14:38.960
just reaching the other elite crowds, yes, you have to be willing not just to go beyond

14:38.960 --> 14:44.040
your own disciplinary boundary but outside your own comfort zone in the social arena

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
as well.

14:45.040 --> 14:49.680
And that can be the big challenge for really getting out and really having this discussion

14:49.680 --> 14:52.280
with the kinds of audiences that aren't naturally invited in.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.160
Yeah, presenting in non-traditional spaces is really good for that.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.720
And part of what I was saying before is that these collaborations often force scientists

15:00.720 --> 15:04.400
to present science in non-traditional spaces because I mean I've given talks in art museums

15:04.400 --> 15:07.600
which is where I don't usually give talks because of these collaborations.

15:07.600 --> 15:12.880
And vice versa, I had artist friends come in and do things in science museums and planetariums.

15:12.880 --> 15:21.560
And so just by the nature of reaching across those boundaries you find yourself in front

15:21.560 --> 15:24.600
of non-traditional audiences for your discipline.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.840
And that alone is I think very valuable.

15:28.840 --> 15:34.080
So a C.D. Snow is actually the one who first brought up the idea of a neutral space and

15:34.080 --> 15:36.320
you already brought up C.P. Snow's two cultures.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.520
I wanted to ask you, Alana, since you work at the National Academy's but part of the cultural

15:40.520 --> 15:45.320
programs, what's your experience there of bringing in a very well-educated but generally

15:45.320 --> 15:51.560
lay audience into a science institution where you're doing very art and science things?

15:51.560 --> 15:56.040
I'm not sure how to answer that.

15:56.040 --> 16:03.480
Well I get my question is do you feel like people come in with certain expectations that

16:03.480 --> 16:04.960
are met or aren't met?

16:04.960 --> 16:09.120
Do you feel like people have to dumb down their art or their science in order to reach

16:09.120 --> 16:10.880
a certain audience?

16:10.880 --> 16:14.400
Because some of the questions we're skirting around are like, okay, we talked a lot about

16:14.400 --> 16:18.880
science communication in the last couple of panels but can we communicate, complicate

16:18.880 --> 16:20.680
science to a lay audience?

16:20.680 --> 16:25.840
Can we connect science and society through communication or do we need to reframe the

16:25.840 --> 16:28.600
way we're thinking about it?

16:28.600 --> 16:35.360
I think when people come into the space they really are expecting scientific accuracy.

16:35.360 --> 16:45.240
Actually we really try not to dumb down anything that we do and one thing we're really focused

16:45.240 --> 16:52.840
on is presenting examples of intersections of science and art that are really exciting

16:52.840 --> 16:59.920
and actually are solving some problems that we're facing today so we can get a really

16:59.920 --> 17:04.520
wide audience of people interested.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.080
We definitely try to invite all of our speakers to bring in hands-on objects that they can

17:09.080 --> 17:12.320
share with the audience.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.080
We think a lot about accessibility.

17:14.080 --> 17:17.640
We try to engage all the local universities.

17:17.640 --> 17:23.760
We have a partnership with Gallaudet University, School for the DAF and we have ASL interpreters

17:23.760 --> 17:25.480
at all of our events.

17:25.480 --> 17:30.240
All of our events are free and open to the public so that breaks down some barriers that

17:30.240 --> 17:32.840
might exist for some people.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.760
I'm sorry.

17:34.760 --> 17:40.360
One of the things I think would not be such a bad topic to talk about for a little bit

17:40.360 --> 17:43.120
here because we're all involved in somewhere in other ways.

17:43.120 --> 17:49.840
What we mean by scientific literacy or scientific accessibility or this dumb down versus not

17:49.840 --> 17:53.520
that how you present complicated science to an audience and things like that and whether

17:53.520 --> 17:58.360
there's any value whatsoever in that or...

17:58.360 --> 18:00.520
There's no value in what?

18:00.520 --> 18:07.520
Well, sorry, you said any value in doing that and actually working really hard which many

18:07.520 --> 18:08.760
of us are doing.

18:08.760 --> 18:14.040
I think there is but I would also like to suggest that the scientific revolution, if

18:14.040 --> 18:18.320
you think it was important, which I do, but if you think the Renaissance and the Restoration

18:18.320 --> 18:21.080
world, I think the Reformation were important.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.800
I think the scientific revolution is probably important.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.600
What was important for a new way of thinking?

18:26.600 --> 18:30.520
It was important for a way of thinking that said you don't get knowledge from authority,

18:30.520 --> 18:34.720
whether that authority is Aristotle or the Good Book or whatever it is, that's not where

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
knowledge comes from.

18:35.720 --> 18:41.520
It's a whole new way of understanding knowledge and it seems to me that's what we're not communicating

18:41.520 --> 18:48.200
so effectively by doing physics for poets kinds of things or looking for those things.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.760
We're not communicating the fact that what science is based on, if you'll pardon a kind

18:52.760 --> 18:57.080
of a half-assed plug here, ignorance, failure, doubt and uncertainty.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.200
I wrote about those things.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.600
But especially notions of uncertainty.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.800
I mean, why uncertainty is so crucial to science?

19:05.800 --> 19:09.840
Not that it's a failing, but it's crucial to good science, that you can't have science

19:09.840 --> 19:14.800
nor art for that matter in my opinion, but I'm not an artist so I won't say that.

19:14.800 --> 19:19.840
But that's what needs to be communicated, it seems to me, not just here's a way to understand

19:19.840 --> 19:22.040
quantum physics simply and easily.

19:22.040 --> 19:27.560
I think one of the key things there is the lens that you view the rest of society.

19:27.560 --> 19:31.960
So I'm a huge fan of never using the phrase dumb down.

19:31.960 --> 19:35.960
I think that's a destructive way to look at what we're doing.

19:35.960 --> 19:41.600
Yes, but the sort of lens that you use shapes how you're thinking about the activity.

19:41.600 --> 19:46.800
So you're talking about how do we communicate ideas and so the statement is, oh, then we

19:46.800 --> 19:50.000
do this physics for poet and maybe that's not helping with uncertainty.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.360
To me, there's a sense in which that's mind blowing.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.960
If you want to talk through issues of uncertainty, you could do a whole lot worse than talk to

19:56.960 --> 19:58.200
a group of poets.

19:58.200 --> 20:02.200
And so if you're not doing that in a physics and poet thing, it means the lens through

20:02.200 --> 20:07.000
which you are viewing poets is as the stupid people who don't know the science.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.320
And that is a very destructive way of doing it.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.320
I'm agreeing with you.

20:12.320 --> 20:20.600
It's very unclear and uncertain, as always, but it's really, this is where we need to

20:20.600 --> 20:24.000
turn the mirror inward and ask ourselves, how are we viewing society?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.680
And if we view society as the unwashed masses that need to be educated, that's how our

20:27.680 --> 20:30.000
work is going to come out.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.400
And this is why I keep harping on about expertise and recognizing it out there with the other

20:35.400 --> 20:40.720
people that we're interacting with and going into these things not as authority disseminating

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
information.

20:41.720 --> 20:47.680
It's ironic that most of our sitcoms are exactly that, but going into it as a partnership.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.440
There are different ways to think about scientific literacy, for sure.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.080
I think it's a good question to ask.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.000
What do we even mean by that?

20:55.000 --> 21:00.760
And before in the previous panel, people were talking about not liking the acronym STEAM.

21:00.760 --> 21:06.120
I've never liked the acronym STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math.

21:06.120 --> 21:11.080
Not because I don't think it's a reasonable summation of some corner of knowledge that

21:11.080 --> 21:12.480
sort of fits together.

21:12.480 --> 21:19.840
But it's so often used in this narrow, almost cheerleading role.

21:19.840 --> 21:25.880
We need STEM education because we need to prepare people for jobs and vocations and

21:25.880 --> 21:29.800
increase American competitiveness.

21:29.800 --> 21:35.560
These are not the reasons why I'm excited about teaching science to people.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.920
I mean, I recognize those are important, but it is a way of seeing the world.

21:39.920 --> 21:45.560
There's a more profound, deeper sense of connection to the world than just, here's a way to get

21:45.560 --> 21:46.560
a good job.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.080
That's why we need to get people into STEM careers.

21:49.080 --> 21:57.400
So I think of science literacy as spreading a way of interrogating the world, seeing ourselves

21:57.400 --> 21:59.200
in relation to the world.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.040
And when you think of it that way, it's not just something that's like sort of a good

22:03.040 --> 22:04.400
idea or enrichment.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.840
It's actually crucial, I think, for human survival right now.

22:08.840 --> 22:14.360
We have learned some things about our relationship with the world and the way it's changing right

22:14.360 --> 22:21.760
now and the role that we find ourselves in this world that we need to deal with collectively

22:21.760 --> 22:22.760
as a species.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.320
We can't deal with it collectively if only some of us are aware of this.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.440
And it doesn't do any good to just have the scientists be aware of it and not really

22:29.440 --> 22:30.880
effective at communicating.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.920
We need obviously a larger collaboration to do that.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.880
So to me, this is survival skills for humanity.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.520
We've learned some important things.

22:39.520 --> 22:44.960
We have to figure out how to include more people in that knowledge and in our response

22:44.960 --> 22:46.160
to that knowledge.

22:46.160 --> 22:52.440
And so I do see that in a way science literacy, but it's not like here's the facts we know

22:52.440 --> 22:55.240
and how do we get people to understand.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.520
But I agree about dumbing down.

22:57.520 --> 22:58.520
It's not dumbing down.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.200
It's smartening up.

23:00.200 --> 23:05.640
It's about if you cannot communicate what you think you know, maybe you really don't

23:05.640 --> 23:08.280
know it all that well, or maybe it's not coherent.

23:08.280 --> 23:13.360
So it's about improving our communication skills as much as it is about lowering some

23:13.360 --> 23:16.840
perceived level that we're communicating at.

23:16.840 --> 23:22.080
And in that in an art sense, it's really, really vital work and the collaborations we're

23:22.080 --> 23:24.160
talking about I think are absolutely essential.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.960
I just wanted to follow up, Stuart.

23:25.960 --> 23:30.320
I would love to have an art symposium sometimes titled The Limits of Understanding.

23:30.320 --> 23:38.160
Understanding art can be very difficult, but I just will, following up on the comment

23:38.160 --> 23:43.360
about sort of like what we need now instead of this moment, this anthropocene moment,

23:43.360 --> 23:49.120
so many people don't really understand that science is the creation of factual knowledge.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.880
That's even that sort of basic beyond sort of-

23:53.880 --> 23:55.720
You want a factual uncertainty.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.720
Yeah, okay.

23:56.720 --> 24:04.720
But it's a little problematic at this particular point in time when we really, I feel like

24:04.720 --> 24:12.040
as a society we really need to start helping people understand what our certain ecological

24:12.040 --> 24:14.440
moment is.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.960
And you know, following up on that, it's also interesting to me to see the way that humanity

24:18.960 --> 24:23.000
can, you know, the quote unquote humanities can support that.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.320
There's this really great organization called the AS, the Association of Environmental Science

24:28.320 --> 24:32.800
Studies, and they're really dedicated to connecting like the hard sciences to the social

24:32.800 --> 24:34.960
sciences to the humanities.

24:34.960 --> 24:40.040
And I wandered into, I was presenting there, but I wandered into like the wrong symposium

24:40.040 --> 24:44.520
and I sat down for a while and I realized this is at American University and I realized

24:44.520 --> 24:50.840
that the symposium was on geoengineering.

24:50.840 --> 24:55.040
It was at American University so it was a whole bunch of policy people, their governmental

24:55.040 --> 24:58.400
policy people, they were talking about geoengineering.

24:58.400 --> 25:04.520
And the other thing that astounded me was that at the front of the room there was a theology

25:04.520 --> 25:12.280
talking, a theologian talking about the way that different cultures viewed playing God.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
Right?

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
Like God.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.280
Playing God.

25:15.280 --> 25:21.280
God.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.280
God.

25:22.280 --> 25:28.560
But you know, but it was this idea that, you know, like if, you know, I mean, that these

25:28.560 --> 25:34.000
kinds of considerations about like sort of what we're able to technologically do really

25:34.000 --> 25:39.440
need to be supported by, you know, the sum total of, you know, human cultural production

25:39.440 --> 25:44.480
in terms of what we, the understandings that different cultures have come to in terms of,

25:44.480 --> 25:50.000
you know, the role of us humans in the world and it could equally apply to genomic engineering.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.560
I mean, there's all kinds of different things that those sorts of questions.

25:53.560 --> 25:58.600
Well, but exactly on your point, I think what the most difficult problem in, at least for

25:58.600 --> 26:02.240
scientists now, I mean, we should get back to the art part of this as well too.

26:02.240 --> 26:06.680
But it's a commonly quoted statistic that 48% or something of Americans don't believe

26:06.680 --> 26:07.680
in evolution.

26:07.680 --> 26:12.880
And this has taken us some terrible critique of our abject scientific literacy and there

26:12.880 --> 26:15.840
were a bunch of stupid people, mostly, and things like that.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.440
There's a statistic behind that that's almost never mentioned.

26:19.440 --> 26:25.000
And that is that 90% of those 48 people, 48% understand evolution, at least to the level

26:25.000 --> 26:29.280
of a high school, decent high school education, which is about as well as many biologists

26:29.280 --> 26:30.280
understand it frankly.

26:30.280 --> 26:35.680
And I'm going to biology department so I can tell you that first hand.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.400
The point is these are people who understand evolution.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.160
They're literate about evolution.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.640
They're not illiterate.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.400
They have made a kind of a Pascal's wager.

26:44.400 --> 26:48.480
And I think it's important to understand what kind of a wager that is, what the cost is

26:48.480 --> 26:51.240
of not believing in evolution.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.680
The costs are considerable for many people.

26:53.680 --> 26:59.320
Community, church, deeper held beliefs, morality, ethics, lots and lots of things.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.520
And what do you get for believing in evolution?

27:01.520 --> 27:06.880
Anybody tell me in here what you get for believing in evolution unless you're a biologist doing

27:06.880 --> 27:09.120
a certain kind of experiment?

27:09.120 --> 27:14.480
So that's not to defend intelligent design or any of the rest of that.

27:14.480 --> 27:18.560
But it is to, I think, suggest that this is the deeper problem.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.600
That is not just a literacy problem.

27:21.600 --> 27:26.880
It's a question of why it's better, why it makes more sense to think scientifically than

27:26.880 --> 27:32.200
some other way, why this makes a different kind of a world, and why we'll solve our problems

27:32.200 --> 27:37.360
in the other way, we'll not solve our problems, for example, and things of that nature.

27:37.360 --> 27:43.800
So far, a lot of this conversation has been about this notion of science communication,

27:43.800 --> 27:46.960
I mean effectively.

27:46.960 --> 27:51.680
And one of the reasons for that is because of this growing popularity, and as people were

27:51.680 --> 27:57.840
talking about last night, that's clearly one way in which art and science can kind of intercept.

27:57.840 --> 28:02.240
But it's by no means the only way.

28:02.240 --> 28:10.960
I think that as the cultural volume of science continues to grow and butt up against art,

28:10.960 --> 28:16.960
a lot of interesting things happen that aren't just how do we communicate a scientific idea

28:16.960 --> 28:20.640
to the public in some appeasing way.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.760
I mean, that's a really important question.

28:23.760 --> 28:28.360
And as we say, we're in the Anthropocene age, like these questions become ever more important.

28:28.360 --> 28:33.800
At the same time, there's just this cultural phenomenon that's happening.

28:33.800 --> 28:42.440
And I'm a neuroscientist who's also a writer, and something about neuroscience kind of fundamentally

28:42.440 --> 28:48.120
inspires me because as was mentioned earlier, scientific fields provides kind of metaphors

28:48.120 --> 28:49.200
for thinking.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.280
They provide a certain frame and type of language.

28:53.280 --> 28:58.480
And I actually think something very, very interesting is happening here at the outskirts,

28:58.480 --> 29:06.080
kind of in some of what we just saw, for example, those statues that used quantum superposition

29:06.080 --> 29:10.280
or to kind of as a dominating metaphor.

29:10.280 --> 29:16.200
And what that sort of work reminds me of, and that work's purpose isn't to necessarily

29:16.200 --> 29:17.680
communicate anything.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
Right?

29:18.680 --> 29:22.720
I mean, in fact, the whole point of art, and possibly as Kant said, the defining property

29:22.720 --> 29:24.520
of art is that it's not normative.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.880
It's some form of intellectual play.

29:27.880 --> 29:32.080
Who knows exactly why we do it, but for some reason, we think that this is really, really

29:32.080 --> 29:33.480
important.

29:33.480 --> 29:40.280
And in previous historical periods, one of the things that happened was that the art reflected

29:40.280 --> 29:45.320
the important and rich ideas that were out there in the culture.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.360
And one example of this is art based around religion.

29:47.360 --> 29:52.920
I mean, if you go to any museum, there's so much in that art that you don't understand

29:52.920 --> 29:57.400
that I don't understand because we're not nearly as well versed in like deep doctrines

29:57.400 --> 30:02.160
of, say, Christianity to really get what's going on in that painting and what it means.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.160
And that meaning-

30:03.160 --> 30:04.160
Social people paid for it.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.160
Right?

30:05.160 --> 30:06.160
Well, it's also-

30:06.160 --> 30:07.160
Exactly.

30:07.160 --> 30:11.640
But for example, people, you know, if you look at frescoes or like anything else, there's

30:11.640 --> 30:13.240
all these deep, deep meanings.

30:13.240 --> 30:18.360
And that's because artists play around with deep meanings that are out there.

30:18.360 --> 30:25.480
And it used to be the case that possibly, you know, name the most semiotically loaded

30:25.480 --> 30:30.880
symbol of the last 500 years, you know, in Western culture, and you probably named the

30:30.880 --> 30:31.880
cross.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.880
Right?

30:32.880 --> 30:33.880
What would you name today?

30:33.880 --> 30:39.920
Because another alternative competing symbol for something that's just as loaded with concepts

30:39.920 --> 30:44.920
and history and knowledge is the double helix of DNA.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.960
And so I think that what's happening is that science, and especially as science becomes

30:47.960 --> 30:54.720
part of the larger culture, people have developed quite literally the concepts, symbols, signs,

30:54.720 --> 30:56.240
and language of science.

30:56.240 --> 31:01.160
And something very interesting that's happening is that artists are beginning to play around

31:01.160 --> 31:05.040
with that, just like they used to play around with the fact that everyone knew the Bible

31:05.040 --> 31:08.680
backwards and forwards or all the big stories, and then they would make art based around

31:08.680 --> 31:09.680
that.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.840
And so it provides this rich vocabulary.

31:11.840 --> 31:17.080
So I think that's not maybe that is in a sense elitist, it's not science communication, but

31:17.080 --> 31:21.120
it's certainly something that I see happening as this science bubble expands and then it

31:21.120 --> 31:26.960
kind of frogs up against the art bubble in the social sphere.

31:26.960 --> 31:32.560
It's also helping us to process things that are happening in our world, new ideas, new

31:32.560 --> 31:34.880
realities, new concepts we're coming across.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.520
You know, you mentioned Christianity, you mentioned DNA.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.520
Now we've got, you mentioned the Anthropocene, and we're trying to come to grips with ourselves

31:42.520 --> 31:47.440
as a planet altering force and figure out if we can survive with that knowledge and actually

31:47.440 --> 31:52.760
thrive as a part of the Earth system that we are, whether we like it or not.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.800
And I do see artists now responding to that challenge.

31:55.800 --> 32:00.480
It's very disturbing this notion of the Anthropocene and it's also kind of essential.

32:00.480 --> 32:06.960
And so another iconic image is the image of the Earthrise from the moon, you know, has

32:06.960 --> 32:11.200
gotten into our consciousness now and that's, you know, I think almost up there with DNA

32:11.200 --> 32:12.440
and the cross.

32:12.440 --> 32:19.840
And you know, this notion that we're grappling with our planetary nature is something that,

32:19.840 --> 32:24.440
you know, I think is obviously there's a lot of science that we need to understand and

32:24.440 --> 32:28.360
learn and communicate, but it's necessary, but not sufficient.

32:28.360 --> 32:34.000
And I think the artistic response to that reality as a way to help us process our situation

32:34.000 --> 32:40.120
and somehow gain the global maturity to deal with it is really essential.

32:40.120 --> 32:48.480
And one thing that I see happening that I think is very exciting in that vein is the

32:48.480 --> 32:53.480
tools of connectivity which are very fraught these days and are leading to all these kinds

32:53.480 --> 32:58.160
of fragmentation that we're all freaked out about on the news are also being used to facilitate

32:58.160 --> 33:00.480
global collaborations in really cool ways.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.440
What is that, what is that, that playing for change project where people are doing these

33:04.440 --> 33:07.400
musical collaborations all around the globe?

33:07.400 --> 33:12.720
And you know, there are things like that where there are these sort of glimmers of some kind

33:12.720 --> 33:19.680
of global aesthetic response to our inherently global problems and global reality.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.360
And that is completely a new kind of artistic response that, you know, wouldn't have been

33:23.360 --> 33:27.920
possible 20 years ago because we didn't have the tools to collaborate across boundaries

33:27.920 --> 33:29.320
in that way.

33:29.320 --> 33:37.080
So I think art simply as a response, like you say, to emerging ideas and emerging realities

33:37.080 --> 33:42.040
that help us to process the things that maybe problems that are originating with science

33:42.040 --> 33:45.120
but go so far beyond that domain.

33:45.120 --> 33:49.320
So I want to jump in here but I'm going to kind of direct it towards you.

33:49.320 --> 33:55.920
So, well, I'm directing it towards the artists in the writers in the room or in the panel.

33:55.920 --> 34:00.720
We've talked a lot about science literacy, we've not talked about art literacy.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.720
Please talk about that.

34:02.720 --> 34:07.400
How do we, I mean, yeah, science literacy, people make a choice to not believe in evolution.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.920
Okay, that's tricky, you know, how do we deal with that?

34:10.920 --> 33:55.920
But most scientists at S

33:55.920 --> 33:57.800
We've talked a lot about science literacy.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.720
We've not talked about art literacy.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.680
Please talk about that.

34:02.680 --> 34:07.240
How do we, I mean, yeah, science literacy, people make a choice to not believe in evolution.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.920
Okay, that's tricky.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.880
You know, how do we deal with that?

34:10.880 --> 34:16.200
But most scientists at Sitis Room don't know a darn thing about art.

34:16.200 --> 34:20.000
They don't care because it doesn't affect them on a day to day basis or at least they

34:20.000 --> 34:21.280
don't think it does.

34:21.280 --> 34:27.320
And yet on the walls of their office are paintings that some, you know, administrator put there.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.960
And if it weren't there, then they would say, huh, there's nothing on that wall.

34:30.960 --> 34:37.440
You know, so how do we get not only scientists to care more about art as something that's

34:37.440 --> 34:45.000
not like functional, something that's, you know, conti and not functional, but important.

34:45.000 --> 34:51.840
And Elizabeth makes a really interesting art that merges with technology and kind of forces

34:51.840 --> 34:55.960
you to confront it in a lot of ways, whether you want to or not.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.760
It might be a robot plant that travels around and bumps into you.

34:59.760 --> 35:04.000
So, so yeah, hearing from the writers and the artists in the table about art literacy,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.160
I'd love to hear more about that.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.160
Wow.

35:07.160 --> 35:08.160
Art literacy.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.160
Yeah, that's so interesting.

35:11.160 --> 35:18.360
And I named here I was going to talk to you about the loss of religion and art taking

35:18.360 --> 35:20.160
the place of that.

35:20.160 --> 35:25.200
Well, you know, one of the things that I think is really interesting and this hasn't really

35:25.200 --> 35:29.040
been part of this conversation, and I'm sure I missed the conversation last night, but

35:29.040 --> 35:36.360
I'm sure that a lot of this was about, you know, how art science collaboration broadens

35:36.360 --> 35:38.800
the audience for science.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.440
And I think also for art.

35:41.440 --> 35:47.720
The thing that I'm really interested in in terms of what art can do is, you know, there's

35:47.720 --> 35:54.120
these wonderful, Soluit wrote this great document, 25 sentences on conceptual art.

35:54.120 --> 36:02.480
And in sentence two and three, he says, rational ideas beget rational experience.

36:02.480 --> 36:07.800
And number three says, but irrational ideas lead to new experience.

36:07.800 --> 36:12.600
And I really think that that's one of the things that that's one of the kind of spaces

36:12.600 --> 36:15.120
that art sort of inhabits.

36:15.120 --> 36:21.800
It sort of allows us to be in a poetic or a metaphoric or an irrational space that can

36:21.800 --> 36:25.040
lead to new experiences.

36:25.040 --> 36:29.720
And I just, I don't know, I find myself as an artist working with scientists, often in

36:29.720 --> 36:34.280
collaboration with scientists, on asking really irrational questions.

36:34.280 --> 36:40.720
And I think that that can really lead to all kinds of wonderful different sorts of directions,

36:40.720 --> 36:44.520
both in art making and in scientific endeavor.

36:44.520 --> 36:49.680
So I just kind of want to throw that out, which is that innovation, especially when

36:49.680 --> 36:54.280
you're looking at different disciplines that are bumping up into each other, you know,

36:54.280 --> 37:02.160
those kinds of irrational sorts of, you know, irrational kinds of questions or ideas are

37:02.160 --> 37:05.280
such a wonderful result of that.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.040
But I just kind of want to make sure that art sort of has a place at the table in terms

37:09.040 --> 37:12.400
of innovation from that perspective.

37:12.400 --> 37:17.680
In terms of art literacy, you know, how do you get people to look at art more, you know,

37:17.680 --> 37:18.680
that I don't know.

37:18.680 --> 37:23.360
I mean, maybe, you know, I feel like I'm sitting here talking about the importance of everyone

37:23.360 --> 37:24.680
learning science.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.400
Maybe you scientists have some thoughts about, you know, the importance of people looking

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
at art.

37:29.400 --> 37:45.520
Certainly, I think that there's really no sense in which scientists have a huge literacy

37:45.520 --> 37:48.040
concerning what's going on right now in our world.

37:48.040 --> 37:53.040
I think most of it's completely opaque to them.

37:53.040 --> 37:59.960
Some of that is simply because I'll be quite frank and say that a lot of the concerns of

37:59.960 --> 38:03.120
art are very insular.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.360
And I get to say this as a complete outsider to the community and someone who has no, you

38:07.360 --> 38:10.440
know, serious background as an artist.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.320
So this is just my personal opinion.

38:12.320 --> 38:18.440
But I think for about 30 years, the subject of art has been art and that's a relatively

38:18.440 --> 38:23.000
boring way to go without it.

38:23.000 --> 38:30.120
And one of the things, one of the reasons why I'm so interested in what's going on here

38:30.120 --> 38:36.400
is that science seems to provide, and I don't mean it in some sort of, in some sort of

38:36.400 --> 38:37.560
worshipping way.

38:37.560 --> 38:42.240
And I'm not actually even, I don't even mean it in terms of a communication way.

38:42.240 --> 38:48.320
I mean it in terms of a, there seems to be a new set of public symbols, metaphors, and

38:48.320 --> 38:53.920
so on that have come into existence that art has not spent much time playing around with

38:53.920 --> 38:55.020
yet.

38:55.020 --> 38:56.560
And art is really great at that.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.200
Art is great at criticism.

38:58.200 --> 39:01.880
Art is great at representing things in new ways.

39:01.880 --> 39:05.800
And all of those are things that science needs.

39:05.800 --> 39:11.040
So I think, you know, if you want to get scientists interested in art, one of the easiest ways

39:11.040 --> 39:15.760
is start doing art about science and don't just do it in a way that's just, wow, this

39:15.760 --> 39:24.000
is so amazing, do it in a way like, okay, what, you know, let me to do my interpretation

39:24.000 --> 39:27.640
of what this means, right, or something along those lines.

39:27.640 --> 39:32.120
Or, you know, a lot of the pieces that we saw up there are really, I think, really wonderful

39:32.120 --> 39:33.920
examples of that.

39:33.920 --> 39:41.560
But so I think part of it is on the responsibility of artists to kind of publicly engage with

39:41.560 --> 39:46.800
some of these things, and I wish there was more support, open support in the artistic

39:46.800 --> 39:53.920
community for things that are maybe a little bit more new and a little bit more out there,

39:53.920 --> 39:58.200
even though, of course, given what I said previously, I think that this is a very old

39:58.200 --> 39:59.200
conservative notion.

39:59.200 --> 40:04.440
I mean, that in the best sense, as in, you know, art has been about nature, art has

40:04.440 --> 40:08.720
been about human institutions and religion, art has been about politics and art has been

40:08.720 --> 40:10.320
about art.

40:10.320 --> 40:16.720
And, you know, art about science is, I think, very much in line with some of the things

40:16.720 --> 40:21.560
that have produced some of the best art ever in the history of humankind.

40:21.560 --> 40:26.440
One problem, and I think this gets to your question of, you know, why we focus so much

40:26.440 --> 40:32.240
on communicating about science rather than communicating about art, and this was alluded

40:32.240 --> 40:39.480
to in the panel yesterday, is that a lot of the support for these kinds of collaborations

40:39.480 --> 40:45.200
comes from, certainly that I'm familiar with, comes from the world of science and this notion

40:45.200 --> 40:49.840
of broader impacts, or EPO education and public outreach, where this art is kind of treated

40:49.840 --> 40:53.800
as an add-on to a science project, and it doesn't come for free.

40:53.800 --> 40:59.240
You have to satisfy the funding agency, why you're doing this, and a lot of it on some

40:59.240 --> 41:02.520
level or another is that I'm going to, this artist is going to help me communicate the

41:02.520 --> 41:05.320
science to a broader audience, and there's nothing wrong with that.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.400
I'm in favor of that, but it does tend to cast things as that's the purpose of the art

41:09.400 --> 41:13.160
is to teach about science, and then what about, you're asking about, well what about just

41:13.160 --> 41:14.760
teaching about art?

41:14.760 --> 41:20.080
One remedy for that, or one alternate model that I've seen being very successful is, artist

41:20.080 --> 41:22.200
and residence programs.

41:22.200 --> 41:27.200
NASA for a long time had this artist and residence program, I don't think they still do.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.840
It's an association, they can't say residence anymore.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.080
It still exists.

41:33.080 --> 41:35.800
For a long time it was, I think, very successful.

41:35.800 --> 41:41.440
They had this not too long ago, they had this 50 years of the NASA arts program traveling

41:41.440 --> 41:45.240
exhibit that was wonderful, and they had people like Robert Rothenberg and Andy Warhol and

41:45.240 --> 41:50.840
a bunch of different kinds of folk artists doing really cool stuff.

41:50.840 --> 41:55.320
I don't know if it's true, but the rumor is the last one they had was Laurie Anderson,

41:55.320 --> 42:01.160
and the art that she did was so hostile to NASA that they were like, you know what, we're

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
not going to do this anymore.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.040
I don't want to spread rumors, but I heard that.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.560
But for whatever reason, I think it's a shame.

42:07.560 --> 42:12.520
I think that where you're encouraging an artist to be for a year or whatever in that environment

42:12.520 --> 42:20.200
and respond, and there's the legacy of that is some incredibly deep work where artists

42:20.200 --> 42:25.240
just responded to what NASA and what scientists were doing.

42:25.240 --> 42:29.800
And the other benefit of that is that then you had these, you know, when you go to NASA

42:29.800 --> 42:34.880
Ames Research Center, a place of science, you see these Rothenberg paintings of, you

42:34.880 --> 42:40.920
know, of the Apollo project hanging on the walls there, you know, so it's also, so artists,

42:40.920 --> 42:46.680
scientists get their hit of art from the fact that these, the legacy, the residue is still

42:46.680 --> 42:53.200
hanging in these places, and I think that kind of project is a little bit more open

42:53.200 --> 42:59.720
than the sort of broader impacts mentality at really getting artists to respond to science

42:59.720 --> 43:02.120
and increasing what you might call art literacy.

43:02.120 --> 43:05.480
I'm not even sure what that is among scientists and among the general public.

43:05.480 --> 43:11.600
I was just going to ask what, I'm not absolutely clear what we mean by art literacy.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.840
I'm always suspicious of it because it sounds like somebody's going to explain a joke to

43:15.840 --> 43:17.400
me and now it's not going to be funny.

43:17.400 --> 43:21.040
And if somebody explains a piece of artwork to me, it's not going to be really inspiring

43:21.040 --> 43:22.040
to me anymore.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.040
I would say I won't say a joke to you.

43:23.040 --> 43:27.400
And I actually, I don't have a good answer for that, but I would start by saying you

43:27.400 --> 43:30.440
guys, please build upon this.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.280
What's the difference between a print and a painting?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.240
Some people don't know that.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.120
And I would argue that's decent information to know about.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.680
I think this is where it's worth looking at the discussions that I've been having in

43:42.680 --> 43:44.480
the science literacy world.

43:44.480 --> 43:51.000
What David brought up and Stuart, that it's worth interrogating very closely.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
What do you want people to know and why do you want them to know it?

43:54.000 --> 43:58.760
And if you sort of look at the science literacy discourse, for a long time it was about people

43:58.760 --> 44:01.160
need to know these facts and they need to know things.

44:01.160 --> 44:04.400
And you just start adding up the sheer number of things that experts in every field feel

44:04.400 --> 44:06.280
like everybody should know.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.960
And very quickly it's more than you can anybody can learn in any lifetime.

44:09.960 --> 44:14.440
And so you have to start asking yourself this question of like, what, when we say people

44:14.440 --> 44:16.320
should know stuff, why?

44:16.320 --> 44:20.560
What's the purpose of that and what are we expecting them to get out of it?

44:20.560 --> 44:24.080
And taking very seriously the notion that the vast majority of people are not going to

44:24.080 --> 44:25.720
know the vast majority of things.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.080
And that's a math problem.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.280
That is not a society problem.

44:29.280 --> 44:34.760
And so I haven't been part of these discussions but I suspect that's the place to start attacking

44:34.760 --> 44:36.640
this art literacy question.

44:36.640 --> 44:44.120
So as one answer, so my answer of what bit of art literacy do I want scientists to know,

44:44.120 --> 44:47.960
the one that I've chosen to attack that I want the people who work with us to understand

44:47.960 --> 44:52.360
is I want them to understand the process and the training that goes into it and I want

44:52.360 --> 44:53.920
them to understand it in a visceral sense.

44:53.920 --> 44:59.440
And so I've been going around giving talks where I ask this question, why don't more

44:59.440 --> 45:03.560
people go to science lectures as an evening activity?

45:03.560 --> 45:08.440
And as part of this talk, I add up the number of hours of stage time that a stand-up comedian

45:08.440 --> 45:13.680
accumulates before they're good enough to be invited to be the first guest for a show

45:13.680 --> 45:15.680
for a real headliner.

45:15.680 --> 45:20.440
And it's literally months standing on the stage doing this work over 10 years of time.

45:20.440 --> 45:25.120
Okay, so that's the thing I want to get across but the broader point is you have to pick

45:25.120 --> 45:28.200
and choose and you can't want people to know everything.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.200
Well, isn't also the issue of usefulness.

45:32.200 --> 45:37.880
So if I'm in a certain field where knowing between the difference between DNA and RNA

45:37.880 --> 45:42.760
doesn't matter to me, I don't have to know the difference between DNA and RNA.

45:42.760 --> 45:48.800
So if I'm not in a field that print or painting matters to me, why should I know about it?

45:48.800 --> 45:52.560
And I think this is why process and method questions are often much more interesting

45:52.560 --> 45:57.880
than specific fact type questions because those tend to be more broad and universal.

45:57.880 --> 46:02.480
Yes, I would say that the place where it's most applicable, and this is something we've

46:02.480 --> 46:07.160
been talking a lot about where things are applicable in science art collaboration, what

46:07.160 --> 46:13.920
are the things that you want your scientist collaborator to know about you and vice versa?

46:13.920 --> 46:17.200
At a conference about a year and a half ago with some of the people in this room, we started

46:17.200 --> 46:23.000
to talk about is it possible and then I would have control, is it possible to create a list

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
of terms that every single human should know?

46:27.000 --> 46:30.360
And it gets just so we can all get along better.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.840
But it's unmanageable.

46:32.840 --> 46:38.040
So how do we deal with the jargon issue is part of an issue between art and science,

46:38.040 --> 46:41.920
but especially between art and society, science and society?

46:41.920 --> 46:47.840
Speaking to your point about the art that's getting made, I think that there's a lot of

46:47.840 --> 46:52.040
things, there's a lot of trends that are happening in art right now that you don't necessarily

46:52.040 --> 46:56.840
see in the art market, that you don't necessarily see in galleries and that you don't necessarily

46:56.840 --> 46:58.800
see in museums.

46:58.800 --> 47:07.000
I was just at the National Socio Environmental Synthesis Center, it's a big mouthful, but

47:07.000 --> 47:15.800
it's one of the NSF synthesis postdocs supported synthesis centers down at University of Maryland.

47:15.800 --> 47:23.760
And I found myself telling people there's this amazing new area of community art, where

47:23.760 --> 47:28.400
artists go into communities and work within communities to make stuff.

47:28.400 --> 47:33.240
There's this wonderful area of relational aesthetics where people are going into place

47:33.240 --> 47:35.440
and working with the things in the places.

47:35.440 --> 47:42.920
In order for some of these postdocs who are working in applied practice, so they're modeling

47:42.920 --> 47:46.840
and they're using statistics and all kinds of good stuff, but they're also trying to

47:46.840 --> 47:52.120
figure out sort of applied practices that are applicable to their research.

47:52.120 --> 47:59.320
And so sometimes I also find that people who need this information are not necessarily

47:59.320 --> 48:04.440
interested in this information until they figure out that it's specifically applicable

48:04.440 --> 48:07.000
to them or their process.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.880
But lots of amazing things are happening that maybe we're not seeing in terms of what's

48:11.880 --> 48:15.680
called quote unquote art in a gallery or in a museum.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.880
The New York City Gallery Circuit.

48:17.880 --> 48:24.360
Yeah, yeah, so you don't necessarily see, and yet these are how many artists today are

48:24.360 --> 48:25.840
practicing.

48:25.840 --> 48:32.840
These are some of the kinds of art that we're trying to showcase at the National Academy

48:32.840 --> 48:38.400
of Sciences in our exhibitions and also in the Daser series.

48:38.400 --> 48:45.840
One example that I love to talk about is the work of Matthew Schline, who is a paper engineer

48:45.840 --> 48:50.560
and has an expertise in origami and kirigami.

48:50.560 --> 48:56.600
And he decided he wanted to try to work with some scientists at the University of Michigan

48:56.600 --> 49:03.720
and he was moving there and he emailed something like 30 scientists and out of that a collaboration

49:03.720 --> 49:10.680
began where he's working with a solar panel engineer to apply the kirigami and origami

49:10.680 --> 49:17.720
techniques to make the solar panel track the sun throughout the day and it's about 150%

49:17.720 --> 49:20.520
more efficient than our regular solar panel.

49:20.520 --> 49:23.400
This is the type of thing that you wouldn't see in a gallery.

49:23.400 --> 49:30.360
You know, it could be a very meaningful collaboration that scientists would be interested in.

49:30.360 --> 49:37.640
Another one was this video game called Fold It that anyone can play that's about the way

49:37.640 --> 49:44.360
proteins fold and people outside of the scientific community started to play this game and were

49:44.360 --> 49:49.720
able to actually solve some problems, I think, related to the HIV protein that scientists

49:49.720 --> 49:53.760
had been puzzled by for close to 40 years.

49:53.760 --> 49:59.840
So these are some of the kinds of impacts that we're trying to show to maybe make scientists

49:59.840 --> 50:02.000
care a little bit more about the arts.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.440
Well I think, you know, as a scientist, both in my own experience in observing the experience

50:07.440 --> 50:16.400
of other scientists, whenever we genuinely collaborate with artists, whenever I have,

50:16.400 --> 50:20.280
I always learn something new about the science, it's not just about like, oh, I'm going to

50:20.280 --> 50:23.720
find a new way to tell my story.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.800
And I think this is common.

50:25.800 --> 50:32.960
When I first encountered the art of Monica and Tiger Ayala, both of who have spoken here,

50:32.960 --> 50:37.000
I was really blown away because as a planetary scientist and astrobiologist I think a lot

50:37.000 --> 50:44.760
about, you know, trying to understand comparative planetology, planetary surfaces, and comparative

50:44.760 --> 50:46.520
biology life on other planets.

50:46.520 --> 50:53.760
And then when I saw Monica's artwork where she's responding deeply to not just trying

50:53.760 --> 50:59.480
to depict what it looks like on other planetary surfaces in a photo-realistic way, which is

50:59.480 --> 51:05.160
what a lot of space art is, but actually trying to understand the processes and the over time

51:05.160 --> 51:11.000
how a landscape is built up and then using different materials to somehow duplicate or

51:11.000 --> 51:16.760
synthesize that in building up these 3D, you know, canvases, when I started understanding

51:16.760 --> 51:21.640
her process and looking at it and thinking about it, it really made me realize new things

51:21.640 --> 51:25.160
about the way planetary surfaces work and the way I was seeing them.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.640
So it made me not just, I think, better at communicating but better at understanding

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
through seeing things through her lens.

51:30.640 --> 51:32.440
Same with Tyler's sculpture.

51:32.440 --> 51:34.560
He does these 3D amazing.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.880
If you haven't seen his work, check it out, look online.

51:37.880 --> 51:43.600
But he'll do these giant metal sculptures of some really tiny biological thing that

51:43.600 --> 51:49.800
in real life is like this big, you know, a blade of grass or some insect piece, but

51:49.800 --> 51:52.120
they don't make it, you know, 20 feet high.

51:52.120 --> 51:54.560
And it looks like some alien thing and I'm like, oh, what is that?

51:54.560 --> 51:58.240
And it's like, well, it's an actual duplication of this thing on just on a completely different

51:58.240 --> 51:59.240
scale.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.520
And it made me think about scale in a whole new way.

52:01.520 --> 52:08.160
And when you think about life on other planets, which is what I do for a living in part, you've

52:08.160 --> 52:12.080
really got to think about scale because the physics is such with a planet with different

52:12.080 --> 52:17.520
gravity and different atmospheric pressure and all this, that some of the same shapes

52:17.520 --> 52:23.720
and the same forms are going to manifest to solve the same biophysical problems as they

52:23.720 --> 52:24.720
are solved here on Earth.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.320
But it will be at different scale in response to different physical domains.

52:28.320 --> 52:34.000
So simply seeing his artwork not only moved me in the way that I think art just for its

52:34.000 --> 52:38.240
own sake does, but it made me think, wow, you know, that could actually exist if you had

52:38.240 --> 52:39.600
a planet that was like that.

52:39.600 --> 52:44.080
And this initial impression has led to a long and fruitful collaboration that I've had

52:44.080 --> 52:48.160
with them that I think both the art and science has benefited.

52:48.160 --> 52:53.920
So it goes so much more beyond just like a tool to communicate what we know and what

52:53.920 --> 52:55.680
we think the masses need to know.

52:55.680 --> 53:01.480
I was going to change the discussion completely.

53:01.480 --> 53:03.880
It's might as well.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.400
All right, maybe not.

53:06.400 --> 53:13.640
So what I want to know in terms of my own personal artistic literacy from artists are

53:13.640 --> 53:17.000
the kinds of things that I think are actually common to science.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.520
I don't believe in the scientific method.

53:18.520 --> 53:22.200
I don't believe there's any such thing as a crock or shit that we dreamt up.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.360
So there's no thing where you put stuff in and you turn a crank and outcome gadgets

53:26.360 --> 53:28.520
and cures and things like that, right?

53:28.520 --> 53:32.640
The way scientists work is with intuition, inspiration, curiosity.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.720
They make choices.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.720
They rehearse.

53:34.720 --> 53:38.840
They do all kinds of things that I think you would say any artist does as well.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.640
I want to know how they do it.

53:40.640 --> 53:47.880
I want to know how they treat these same sorts of ideas, these same sorts of processes, because

53:47.880 --> 53:53.800
I think that's where there's a real connection to be made in a way that's where not only

53:53.800 --> 53:58.800
for its usefulness, but because I think it's again a kind of a pluralistic approach to

53:58.800 --> 54:02.040
these things that would provide value in both directions.

54:02.040 --> 54:05.120
I assume artists would like to know the same thing about scientists.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.680
Science is a little bit of an art.

54:06.680 --> 54:10.040
Well, it's a great deal of it, really.

54:10.040 --> 54:13.360
No matter what we may pretend.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.480
So we've been talking, for example, mostly about, I think when we say art, we somehow

54:17.480 --> 54:22.160
or another in our head get painting and sculpture, but it does include things like theater and

54:22.160 --> 54:26.640
writing and performance in general dance and so forth.

54:26.640 --> 54:33.840
And I think the uncertainty of a performance, the uncertainty in a live performance is extremely

54:33.840 --> 54:34.840
important.

54:34.840 --> 54:38.720
The experimentalism of a live performance especially is extremely important, although

54:38.720 --> 54:41.880
I think graphic artists experiment too.

54:41.880 --> 54:47.600
The notion of rehearsal is a kind of, to me, has a great deal in common with what we do

54:47.600 --> 54:51.520
in the lab for weeks and weeks before we publish a paper on opening night.

54:51.520 --> 54:52.520
You know?

54:52.520 --> 54:54.600
I think it's true.

54:54.600 --> 55:03.200
Science is in a way good because it's useful to us, but the arts are really what most of

55:03.200 --> 55:06.080
us are engaged in.

55:06.080 --> 55:09.120
There's a lot more engagement in art than there is.

55:09.120 --> 55:13.840
In other words, everybody in this room is, I'm sure, engaged in one way or another with

55:13.840 --> 55:18.480
art, but not everybody in this room is interested in science.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.280
So art is a much bigger part of our life.

55:21.280 --> 55:26.080
Well, it might be a bigger part, but it's easy to take for granted.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.080
Well, that may be.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.560
Like Eric was saying, you know, we've been doing art forever.

55:30.560 --> 55:33.000
We don't really know why.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.520
Maybe some of the neuro-esthetics fans in the room can shed light on that, but...

55:37.520 --> 55:43.920
Certainly, everyone in this room is extremely engaged with entertainment, but it's not

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
always art.

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
I mean...

55:45.920 --> 55:48.640
It's on the entertainment.

55:48.640 --> 55:50.960
Yeah, absolutely.

55:50.960 --> 55:58.160
But just very, very briefly before we move on to the next topic, it was to say that one

55:58.160 --> 56:02.320
of the things that I think is important is not just saying that, okay, you have this

56:02.320 --> 56:07.160
relationship between scientists and the public, and then you do that through science communication,

56:07.160 --> 56:11.600
and then you have the relationship between artists and the public, and you do that through

56:11.600 --> 56:13.840
science communication.

56:13.840 --> 56:18.280
But I think it's very, very important to put the scientists and artists in communication

56:18.280 --> 56:22.800
together, because regardless of whether or not we immediately go out and talk about the

56:22.800 --> 56:29.680
findings, I do think that this creates a trickle-down kind of effect where the moment you have intellectual

56:29.680 --> 56:35.480
fields put in contact with one another, there will be, at some future point, there will be

56:35.480 --> 56:38.280
communication about it, there will be ideas about it.

56:38.280 --> 56:44.800
So, you know, I think it's just as important to ask, how can we get a very good artist

56:44.800 --> 56:50.160
and a very good scientist working together, and how can we get scientists to understand

56:50.160 --> 56:55.480
what artists are doing and artists to understand what scientists are doing without immediately

56:55.480 --> 57:00.760
then going to this next step of what's going to be this outcome of that?

57:00.760 --> 57:05.320
How will you know a very good scientist and a very good artist?

57:05.320 --> 57:09.960
I can tell you about, I'm sure the artist could tell you that.

57:09.960 --> 57:14.560
It's not super undefinable.

57:14.560 --> 57:18.960
So I just, I have to tell you guys, when I saw that I was on a panel called Art and

57:18.960 --> 57:23.960
Science in Society, I thought, oh no, because we're going to be asked to answer, you know,

57:23.960 --> 57:26.760
we're going to be asked to, you know, cure all of these societal ills.

57:26.760 --> 57:28.760
I thought, ah, this is going to be really rough.

57:28.760 --> 57:30.600
And then I noticed that there were two panels.

57:30.600 --> 57:34.640
I noticed that there was one before the other one, and I thought, ah, the first one has

57:34.640 --> 57:37.240
these wonderful opportunities to bring up all these problems.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.240
And then you get out here.

57:38.240 --> 57:40.520
And then you kick into panel number two.

57:40.520 --> 57:45.280
So I'm just curious, like what are you guys, I mean, you know, in terms of society, what

57:45.280 --> 57:48.320
do you guys think that we can answer?

57:48.320 --> 57:52.560
What should we be answering right now in terms of art and science collaboration and, you

57:52.560 --> 57:54.320
know, society at large?

57:54.320 --> 57:58.000
What could be, what could we or should we be doing?

57:58.000 --> 58:02.440
Well, people, I mean, we have some real problems in our society, and artists in science

58:02.440 --> 58:06.800
collaborate and cannot solve them all, but I think we can actually play an important

58:06.800 --> 58:08.800
role.

58:08.800 --> 58:14.960
People are alienated from these sources of creativity and these sources of knowledge.

58:14.960 --> 58:21.440
And we also are at a time of somewhat of crisis in our world right now.

58:21.440 --> 58:28.160
And so if we can, you know, any form of communication where you're getting people to think about

58:28.160 --> 58:35.160
the big picture of our existence and how we relate to the planet and the universe is,

58:35.160 --> 58:38.440
we're contributing to the solution.

58:38.440 --> 58:40.800
We're helping to save the world, I think.

58:40.800 --> 58:46.280
And I'll just give you an example of something I've been involved in.

58:46.280 --> 58:51.680
I have this group called the House Band of the Universe.

58:51.680 --> 59:00.880
And it's a band, a musical group, but one of the band members is a visual projectionist.

59:00.880 --> 59:04.440
And we only play in planetariums.

59:04.440 --> 59:13.080
And the part of the content is, well, we use a software called Uniview where you can drive

59:13.080 --> 59:15.880
through the entire universe through any data set.

59:15.880 --> 59:20.760
It's very powerful from the cosmic microwave background right up to the latest information

59:20.760 --> 59:24.480
from New Horizons at Pluto and Solar System and seamlessly drive through it.

59:24.480 --> 59:28.520
This has been used a lot in educational programs, which is great.

59:28.520 --> 59:32.680
But when we get the band in there and we do this spoken word component about the history

59:32.680 --> 59:38.240
of the universe, we tend to get a different kind of crowd in there.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.680
And I think it's very successful.

59:41.680 --> 59:46.760
People are thrilled and I think they learn some science, but that's not really the goal

59:46.760 --> 59:49.200
is like they should go away knowing some facts.

59:49.200 --> 59:53.680
In fact, we've evaluated it in that way because it helps us to get some funding.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.000
But they also, clearly, people are inspired.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.320
But also the musicians, the artists have an outlet.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.720
And they get to be in an environment where they don't normally play.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:09.560
And then a sonic environment too, because a sphere is a very weird and challenging sonic

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.840
environment as well.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.800
I mean, a hemisphere, a dome.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.520
And I think it's a case where the hall has been very much greater than the sum of the

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
parts.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.760
And people leave their feeling inspired and they've learned something and they've been

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.240
exposed to some art.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:31.000
And there's a sort of ecstatic thrill of like, well, I was going to this thing.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.600
I didn't know what it was going to be.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.880
It wasn't a science lecture.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.400
It wasn't a normal concert.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.440
Now I'm leaving and I still don't know what it was.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:40.360
But I feel great.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:48.120
And I feel maybe even a little bit more committed to trying to spread the word that we live

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.120
on a planet and we have to deal with it as a planetary species.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.120
So I don't know.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.000
I just think that when you actually do these things, that magic can happen that is very

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.640
useful.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640
We are...

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.800
I hate to cut you off.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.720
We are going to open it up for questions now from the audience.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:12.240
If you have a question, please line up at the microphone behind me.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.080
And emphasis on the question part.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.880
We love, love your comments.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.280
But you can comment all you want over at lunch, too.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.680
We want to get in some good questions before we take a break.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:23.680
Great.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.680
Hi.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680
I'm Patricia Oléna.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.960
I'm the director of the Graduate School of Art at Washington University in St. Louis.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:40.000
And I co-host the Leonardo laser events with Ellen Levy here in New York every six weeks.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.840
And I'm also part of this group called the Alliance for the Arts and the Research Institutions.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.160
So for those of you who have sort of seen me at some of these meetings, you know that

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.040
what I'm really passionate about is kind of articulating a position for the intrinsic

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.960
value of the arts.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:04.480
There's so much talk, particularly in academic circles about arts service to other disciplines.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.560
And although I understand why, you know, the kind of quantification and the data that goes

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.120
with that is very important, especially if you're writing a grant.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:19.800
I do think that the other side of that has to be balanced out in the art that we as artists

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.560
have to do a much better job of articulating what it is that we do.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.960
So getting back to, I'm sorry, your name.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:37.960
Eric's comments about, you know, art being sort of focused very inwardly on itself and

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.400
the example of the sort of the painting on the wall.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.320
I think this is a common kind of misconception, especially within academic circles, the function

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.280
of artists to beautify walls, right?

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.520
Nobody ever really talks about what art does, right?

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:57.840
It's the more, it gets relegated strictly to the realm of the aesthetic.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.400
And there's not enough focus, in my opinion, on what it is that art does, not what does

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.200
it look like, but what it actually does.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.960
And I think if we can focus more on that, I think that this will really help to expand

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.840
the conversation.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.120
So I'll be speaking at 215, a little bit about my role in a medical humanities program as

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
well.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.640
But I'm wondering if any of you want to comment on the institutions that you work at and how

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.400
focusing on what art does, I hope that wasn't me, what art does rather than what art, you

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:33.240
know, what the aesthetic properties are, but what it does, especially when it comes into

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.680
contact with other disciplines.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.440
I would love to hear other comments on that.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.960
I would love to think that, and actually this is something to something I wanted to mention

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:48.680
this to you while we were talking in terms of like, you know, the importance of art.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.480
As an artist, I always feel like I can't function.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:57.120
I'm an advisor at the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers, which is a platform

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.040
for the artistic use of computer vision and machine learning.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:08.280
And I can't make my art unless I have collaborators in other fields that allow me to function.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.600
So I can't even make art unless I have all of this other wonderful support.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:19.320
So I always kind of feel like I'm sort of in this weird situation where I am really appreciative

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:23.560
of all of these other wonderful disciplines that allow me to even function.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.640
But in terms of what art does, I was just kind of, when we were talking about this, my

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:31.720
undergraduate background is cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.280
But I realized that when you make a piece of art, you can communicate things that are

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.560
very difficult to communicate otherwise.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.600
You can make a statement that is contradictory.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:48.080
You can make something that is simultaneously beautiful and ugly at the same moment.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.080
And you know, conceptually, I just, when I figured that out, I was so extraordinary

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:59.520
that you can communicate things and in ways that you can't do in other kinds of disciplines.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.280
So that's just one of the things that I wanted to sort of offer up as this funny little

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.880
thing that might be a little different.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.200
I don't know if anybody else wants to take Patricia's question.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:19.880
As a biologist, don't you think there is some connection between art and emotion?

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:26.480
I don't think you have to be a biologist to feel that.

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.840
You know, being elitist now.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.240
There was no, but when there was the Matisse show at the moment a couple years ago.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.240
There was what?

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.000
Matisse show at the moment.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.160
And I heard from a number of people that no matter how you felt when you got there, by

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.880
the time you left the show, you felt calm.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.400
You felt peaceful.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:57.360
So I'm just wondering that what that role of art is an important role in our lives.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.520
And I just wondered from your perspective what?

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.680
I mean, I don't have an answer to that, but I feel it's a little bit of telling the person

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.360
the meaning of the joke problem.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.240
I mean, in a way, we should be happy that that's the way it works.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.880
So I don't know that we need to understand the underlying neuroscience of why it is that

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.480
I don't think that we'll add to art one.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.840
I mean, I think it's one of the big problems right now with the neuro-hyphen everything

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:26.720
in the world that neuroscience is about to explain law, ethics, humanity, arts, writing,

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.080
all this other stuff.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.920
And I'm not interested in those explanations for the most part.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.560
I mean, they may be okay, but I don't think it will add any one thing at all or an ounce

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.560
of anything to any of those areas in my opinion.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:46.480
But in terms of evolution and in terms of the presence of art in the history of mankind,

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.320
there is a particular role that that plays.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:55.040
Well, I mean, I think there are a lot of people that make the case, and I think it's generally

01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:01.440
maybe even well accepted now, that graphics preceded language necessarily.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.040
That you first paint a deer on the cave before you have a word for deer, which is a significant

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:09.520
abstraction from just representing the deer.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.400
But representing the deer is the beginning of an abstraction and that we could never

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.720
have developed the language that's allowing us to have this talk today without it.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.800
So yes, you could say that it precedes it.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.440
I want to just very briefly say that there's a bit of a linguistic thing going on here

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.480
if we say that the aesthetics of art is just how something looks on a wall.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.240
Saying that art doesn't have to have a function doesn't mean that it's non-causal.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.280
It doesn't mean that it's epiphenomenal.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:43.480
It means that there doesn't have to be an express outcome for this thing that you're

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.240
generating, and it doesn't have to have a particular use in the world.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.080
And many argue that is the fundamental definitional aspect of art.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.440
Of course, it ends up causing experiences, causing change in the world, causing all these

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
ramifications, right?

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:02.960
But it is definitely true that at least if you look at the history of art, there was

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:11.240
a period where both representation of just other things kind of really went out the

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.040
window for a period of time.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.880
And one of the things that's happening with science and art is that because science is

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:21.280
literally the stuff out there in the world, definitially, or, well, I could talk about

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:25.800
arguing about that, but clearly we think of things that way.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:32.320
It provides this new way that you representational art that I think is really unique and novel.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.040
So I think we're at the dawn in a lot of ways of understanding what the actual impacts

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.040
of art are on learning, on behavior, on emotion, on lots of things.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.280
But I want to put out a little bit of a model here to ask you to react to it.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:53.000
So if we take as a point of departure, Eric's point at the beginning of this panel, about

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.640
the explosion of science and the impact of that, let's take that a step further and say

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:04.840
that we live in a world which is heavily and increasingly defined by the products of science.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:10.080
And that shapes our experience, our life, our culture, many, many things about how we live

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.640
and how we behave.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:17.920
Okay, so in that environment, there are maybe, here I'll kind of borrow from Rogers fuzzy

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.080
taxonomy a little bit, there may be three ways that we might think about that, how art fits

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.160
into all of that.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.480
The first is that art can kind of help us understand it better.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.080
And so that embraces, but it's not limited to science communication because it also then

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:38.600
touches on understanding what the implications of that are and what that might mean to us

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.040
as humans.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.320
And so then there's the second level.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:48.040
So this world that we're living in where science is and its products are driving our

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:54.560
society is requiring behaviors of us which we don't necessarily have high levels of

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.280
skill and development for.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:00.440
And in some cases, maybe at odds with our evolutionary heritage.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.960
So art, and as we begin to understand more about how art actually impacts us, we'll learn

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.920
more about this.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.400
Art can help us with that in lots of different ways.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.640
And so there's that second level.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.000
Then of course there's the third level which goes beyond that which is so if the products

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.240
of science are driving us in directions which are beneficial but also troublesome in many

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.680
ways can co-creation between art and science be a way of addressing that.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.720
So I think of that as a little bit of a framework and I kind of want to throw that out there

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.880
and see what you think about that.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:42.360
I'll take that a little bit and tie it to the answer of a couple previous questions of

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.280
what the function A function of art and society is.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:53.360
Which is I think one of the things that gets missed a lot in the sort of the traditional

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.600
psychomart mode, particularly the ones funded by science agencies, is that one of the best

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:05.160
things art can do for science is to critique and to critique and to ask very hard questions.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:12.360
I agree with your premise that, and Eric's, that one of the defining features of now is

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.000
that our experience is mediated by science and technology.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.200
And I would go a step further and say it is absolutely essential that art engage with

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.280
that in a way that really wrestles with important questions.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.440
And if you want to, you know, you can point at very specific things where, you know, you've

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.640
got Elon Musk building a program to send us to Mars.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.440
And this whole discussion happens very often in a science and technology environment where

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:43.520
you're not bringing in people looking at the social aspects of that and the ethics of it.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.640
And so I feel like there's two functions art can do that in that environment.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.480
One is the direct critique, you know, make a parody of Elon Musk or whatever.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.560
I come from the comedy world.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
That's what I would do.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.160
But I, there's other ways to do it, obviously.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.120
And then, but the other thing to do is to try and chip away at this barrier because one

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.120
of the reasons we don't critique science and engineering is that it is viewed as this thing

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.480
that is walled off and that there is no access to.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.400
And that's where the value of the access oriented part of this science communication

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.440
and art, et cetera, stuff comes in is making it possible for those critiques to happen

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:31.360
by convincing people that it isn't this high priesthood that can only comment on these

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.520
things.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:38.480
Hi, again, as a member of the next panel on science and art and society, I'm going to

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.720
feed forward to what we would feed back later if we had time machine development.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.280
There's anyway, so thank you for the provocation.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.880
So what do you think of this?

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.880
I'm putting together how to deal with the jargon issue, the knowing too many things,

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:59.360
lists of everything someone should know issue, together with preaching to the choir issue,

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.000
which is no matter how wonderful it is, we still do.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.320
And the alienation from science and art, these are all kind of related to me.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:17.880
So coming at it this way, ethno science, the things that people have done way before even

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:23.000
writing was invented that make things work for us, ecologies and so forth.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.280
NASA and other agencies have had some projects with this in the past where, for example,

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.200
they worked with people in the northern regions and the arctic regions to figure out different

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.080
ways of seeing snow and ice so they could then better map and model using the data from

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.080
satellites.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.160
Great, how was that done?

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:42.160
And this is the answer to all those previous questions, the public.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.600
They basically hung out in the community for months, weeks, whatever, to get through lots

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.360
of things like what's the problem here, what's life, and then finally getting to even metaphysical,

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:59.280
maybe epistemological question, and then finally getting to the sea and the ice and all that,

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.560
the actual ice colors.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.760
They were working with people who were not scientists and not artists, but they came

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.840
out with some really good stuff.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.360
And that's kind of the answer to what I'm thinking here.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.480
The best context for art and science coming together is the public one.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.720
And that brings me to the other thing I left out.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:25.840
Art is free from rationality, which is the beautiful thing about the public.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.480
The public is free from the rest.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:34.240
Because we see so much today, very free from rationality, and they can say contradictory

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.040
things and it becomes a news story and it becomes a president and that's just the way

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.760
we live.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.480
And that's normal, that's totally has always been that way.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.120
So you know, work with it, right?

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:51.600
So anyway, I'm thinking the public sphere, those synthesis center kind of things.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:15:00.520
So how would that work if we were to at every scale find some public that wants something

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:05.000
done with their community and they know their community and whatever the hell that is that

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.120
they would like?

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.680
And then artists and scientists get together around that and then kind of work with these

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.360
people and whatever the result is, who cares?

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360
You don't know that in advance.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.600
It's going to be messy and stupid and then something's going to come out of it and everyone's

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.520
going to be happy if they listen to the public.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:23.560
And because the brilliant scientists and artists have time to talk to each other about all

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.760
that.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:30.920
So I think the keyword or a keyword, it's a great point.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.200
You make a great question.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.680
A keyword is listen.

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:44.200
And we can do those community projects in different places where we don't normally maybe

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.920
do science projects and work with communities.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:54.160
But we have to get away from a mindset that I think is pretty endemic in the scientific

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.960
community and shed some of our arrogance and shed some of our sense that we're bringing

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:06.640
the word from on high to work really successfully with the community like that requires a lot

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.640
of humility and requires a kind of radical listening where you're willing to not be

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:13.840
efficient and that's a little hard where you're getting paid to do something.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:20.440
You're going to spend some time being purposely a little bit aimless and just listening.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.160
I'll give you an example of something that I think was very successful.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.920
I was part of something for a few summers.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.560
I wish it was still ongoing.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:36.960
Called the NASA and the Navajo Nation Summer Space Camp with middle school students.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.960
And we collaborated.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.680
We had a few NASA scientists.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:48.800
I was one of them and a few Navajo elders and a medicine man and about 20 middle schoolers.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:53.400
And we spent a couple weeks traveling around the Navajo Nation together going to different

01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:01.320
landscapes, learning the cultural stories of the land, teaching our perspective on the

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:06.240
scientific stories of the land, listening a lot, everybody learning a lot.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:12.880
And then in the middle school kids synthesized all of this with art projects in which they

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:19.280
combined the stories, the scientific and the cultural stories.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.360
And they were really, really powerful.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.560
Like one group of, and the kids collaborated to do this.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.040
So one group of middle school kids made a, you know, the Navajo cradle boards when a

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.120
child was born is this whole symbolic thing.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.360
So they made the cradle board, but it was also the story of the universe with, you know,

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.040
the big bang and all this stuff.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:41.920
And another group of these middle school kids, they synthesized this volcanic site we went

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.640
to, which we told them about basalt flows and this and that.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.000
But their traditional story is that the basalt flows are the giant's blood because they're

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.480
with these, this battle of giants.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.840
So they did this diorama that had the giants battling in their blood spilling out.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.600
And then it was also basalt flow.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.560
And it was just, it was tremendous.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.720
We all learned so much.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.400
But it wouldn't have worked if we had gone in there with the attitude like, these are

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.560
the points we're going to teach.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.280
And this is our time scale.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.720
And at the end, you will be able to be quizzed on this knowledge and you'll be able to learn

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:11.720
it.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.800
You know, you have to listen and you have to be open to the fact that you're going to

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.800
learn as much as anybody else.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:23.040
Just a quick comment about artistic literacy.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.880
I ran a little round table a couple of years ago about art and science at Emory University.

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.440
And one of the people at the table, the surgeon, and said, you know, well, I'm an artist as

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.440
well.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:36.040
I'm an artist at the table got infuriated.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.760
That's like me saying I've dissected a few frogs, so I'm a surgeon.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.400
And so without getting into the realm of elitism, I do want to point out that the elephant in

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.560
the room is that art and science are not on a level playing field.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.160
And an example of that is that we teach science K through 12 and into universities.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.440
And it's required in most of those grades.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.560
And we stop teaching art in what, maybe fourth grade depending on the whatever the school

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.680
district is.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.520
And if you look at funding amounts, the National Endowment for the Arts and National Science

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.960
Foundation, you can add zeros to NSF and to DARPA grants.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.400
So that's my comment.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:25.120
So my question, sort of reflection, is sort of picking up at this topic of listening.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:29.400
I'm starting up an art and science residency program in the Appalachians called Art Science

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.120
in Field as if center.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.600
You can go there as if dot center.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.360
Our residency program starts this March.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.520
That's my little plug.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.220
And it's in a sort of cosmopolitan part of the Appalachian that's very near to Pennland

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.640
School of Crafts, where right over the mountains from where Black Mountain College used to

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.000
be, Matthew Schline was actually at Pennland this summer.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.320
There are a lot of makers in the area that come from other places.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.840
But nevertheless, that 48% of people who don't believe in evolution, a lot of those people

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.200
are my neighbors.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.160
And so it presents a problem.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.800
I don't want to exist in a vacuum.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:06.080
I don't want to be this jewel of wonderfulness in the middle of, quote unquote, nowhere.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.560
I want to actually have relationships with the community.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.920
And so one of the things I'm thinking about approaching this is, well, there are three

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:15.920
things.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.200
This is an area that's sort of tribal.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.560
I thought, you know, I'm from the south.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:22.640
I can just breeze right in and I'll blend in after a couple of years.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:27.000
But actually, people have been in that community for like eight to ten generations.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.200
They all know each other.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.840
They're like 30 last names that are in the county.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.440
And there's like this real sense of, you know, not from here.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.160
And so there's this tribalism.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.440
And I've thought like finding an ally within the community who's from there who can sort

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.960
of like help to, you know, approach people and help tell our story and present our work

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.280
is a real important thing.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.640
And then the other two things are that people are more the older generations than younger

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640
generations.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.960
They're tied to the land, tied to place.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:03.760
And that's a lot of what this art science center is about is like art science plus nature,

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:08.000
you know, being this southern Appalachians, which is incredibly biologically diverse and

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.200
interesting geology.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.800
So that pride of place is another way to tap in.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.400
And the third one is that, you know, there's a sense of independence.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:22.760
And like as much as people from that region are they value authority from the church,

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.560
they do not value authority from the federal government.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.800
And this kind of goes back to their Scottish roots and, you know, a lot of history.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:35.280
But that sense of DIY that, you know, makers have and that scientists have and trying to

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.280
use that.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:43.080
And so I guess my question is like looking for wisdom about dealing with difficult, almost

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:49.520
sometimes hostile audiences to science and like what are some approaches for tackling

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.120
that challenge?

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:58.120
Anybody up for it?

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:05.840
There is a growing literature on this that is run by people who describe themselves as

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.120
studying the science of science communication.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:14.640
Dan Kahan, Yale, I am utterly blanking on everyone else's name, but he has a blog where

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.640
he lists these people.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:21.520
And there's no magic bullet, of course.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.440
You know, it's lots and lots and lots of hard work.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.520
But they have identified things.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.240
And it's like David's point or no, sorry, Stuart's point about people actually do understand

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.320
how evolution works.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:37.080
And so learning things like, you know, if your approach is to teach them evolution, you're

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.240
going to fail.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.920
And so they've learned a number of things like this.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.920
And to be honest, it feels like they're about 2% of the way we need to be, but it's growing.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.200
I feel like we need a panel just for that question.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.200
Honestly.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.080
I'm Patricia Miranda.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:58.720
I'm an artist and an educator and curator.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.000
I've done a lot of work with my own work with art and science.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.160
And I teach in a BFA and MFA program and also develop K through 12 programming, steam-based

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:11.000
programming in New York City and the tri-state area, especially.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.300
But I wanted to just push back a little bit on some of the art conversation, which I thank

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:20.400
you for Patricia's starting that pushback.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.280
I felt a little bit like the conversation about art in this panel has been kind of like

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.320
a poor stepchild or the poor relation a little bit.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:31.600
And I just want to echo what Patricia was saying about art having a value of its own.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.400
I think you've mitigated some of those since she got up and said that.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.600
But I also think this idea of artistic literature.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.120
I want to, literacy, I want to push back on that too with all due respect.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.320
I don't think it's the artist's fault.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.200
I don't think that artists are making art about art and that that's an isolated thing.

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.880
I think that the aesthetic and the formal are always unfolded by the social throughout

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.320
history in every instance of art making.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.840
So those frescoes that you may, that we may not understand is not necessarily only because

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.760
we may not understand all of the Christian symbolism, but also because it's unfolded

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.560
by the social of the time.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.400
And so there's an entire culture built into those paintings which were didactic and they

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.320
had certain functions that it's invisible to us and we'll never know because we can't

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.480
enter a medieval mind or Renaissance mind.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:20.840
And I would also say that I could take any of you to Chelsea tomorrow and give you an

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:24.680
well, tomorrow, not tomorrow, it's Sunday, but I could take you to through Chelsea and

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.440
show you artists that are deeply, deeply engaged with the issues of the day and that

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.280
maybe it's not getting out into the mainstream culture in that direct way, but it filters

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.600
down even to like Doho Se's painting work appearing in like a Drake video or something

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.600
like that.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.000
So I think that there are artists that are in conversation with each other, they're in

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.720
their conversation with art history and they're in a conversation with all of culture.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.800
So you can just think of the Carol Walker, sorry not the Carol Walker.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.760
Well, yes, you can think of Carol Walker as an artist who's done that, but the Dana

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:59.520
Schutz Emmett Till painting controversy if you know about that or the Sam Durant scaffolding

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:03.840
at the Walker Art Museum, these are two things that created enormous, enormous discourse

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.720
that bled out.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:09.880
Maybe it is this kind of core community that's having the depth of the conversation, but

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.400
it does filter out and I've had these conversations with my students over and over again.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.120
So framing it as the aesthetic and the formula always unfolded by the social is one of the

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.960
sort of pedagogies that I've developed.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.600
And I developed a pedagogy of critique based on, you know, critique is something that in

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.640
the art world we do all the time.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.840
But to help artists and professional artists I work with a lot in developing a critical

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:37.160
language to be able to communicate what they're doing in their work without it dissecting,

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.280
trying to do the thing where you're like, what does this mean?

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280
Well, who cares?

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280
Right?

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.000
It's not about why, it's never about why, it's about what?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
What is happening?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000
What is the art doing?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.120
Because even a painting on the wall is a verb, right?

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.800
It's in action, it's in dialogue and it's in discourse.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.800
And I think that people don't understand that about art, not because artists are not doing

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.800
it, but because we don't teach art in the schools in such a way that discourse like

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:04.640
someone just said before that science is taught K through 12 and art is not.

01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.040
So it's a constant, constant conversation that we're having.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:13.560
And I think in the pedagogy that I work in, it is about developing a critical language

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:19.160
that communicates those things without dissecting them into sort of, you know, if you dissect

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.120
the frog you understand the frog, right?

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120
We don't.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.120
You can dissect the frog and understand many things, but you still don't understand the

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.920
frog, so the same thing is true of art.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.640
So I just wanted to push back on that.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640
Sure, sure, sure, absolutely.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:35.240
We'll have a good short time.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.440
Yeah, let me briefly comment on that.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:44.520
So you know, I completely agree, I was speaking specifically to science literacy among, sorry,

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.920
artistic literacy among scientists.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.920
So you know, it is certainly true, I mean, there are many-

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.640
But that's a cultural thing, right?

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.720
It's not embedded in the culture of education in a way that a scientist would come up.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:02.400
So I worked in Europe this past last semester and it is much more-

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.120
Art's not perfect, of course, but much more embedded in the culture that people are learning

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.240
about art the same way they're learning about wine or food, you know what I mean?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:15.000
It's considered this kind of larger conversation that you're all a part of as a citizen.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.160
And so, yeah.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.320
It's not here.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.960
It's very siloed, you know.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.080
Hey, hello.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.480
So I wanted to push on for a second the society part of this panel and, specifically, unfortunately,

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:36.480
politics.

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:46.000
So as was just said, artists are very engaged in political issues these days and more than

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.160
ever.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.640
But I'm curious, my question for the panel is, what is the responsibility, the unique

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.240
responsibility of scientists politically?

01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:03.080
In my opinion, very quickly, is- There's sort of too often a sort of view from nowhere

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.640
in neutrality that's mixed with a little bit of elitism.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:13.600
And I worry sometimes that the best we can do is like make signs for the climate march

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:20.480
and get out in kind of a way that could be construed as elitism when you're just sort

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.520
of presenting the facts and hoping for the best.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.080
And then one other example I want to mention was last year during the campaign, the heat

01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:35.200
of the campaign, Neil deGrasse Tyson, made this unfortunate idea, I think, called- Why

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.000
why don't we all just live in a world called Rachinalia?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.320
And then I think some of the new atheist people made T-shirts and it was this whole thing.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:45.320
Like really?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.120
Okay, so anyway, that's my question for you guys.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.760
I thought that was bad and I think it speaks to a certain kind of elitism that was talked

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.160
about earlier.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.560
What should scientists be doing politically or what should they not be doing?

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:05.200
Yeah, it's a fair question and it's a difficult one, of course, and something I- A lot of my

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.040
colleagues have been involved in discussions of that for a long time and you're right,

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.840
we were sort of trained, brought up with this idea that science is value neutral, which

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:17.240
of course is- it's not.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.920
And it gets us off the hook in a way that we're really not.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.960
But the opposite extreme of that is an interesting question.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.320
Should scientists be activists?

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.400
And there's danger there too.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.200
You don't want to enslave your- when you're actually practicing science, you don't want

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:40.880
to enslave, you don't want to have an outcome that you're seeking to try to make a point.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.040
I can give you examples of science that is aired in that way because- oh, if I only had

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:48.440
this result, it would help strengthen this political thing that I think is important.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.720
That's dangerous too.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:54.080
So there's no simple answer to this, but it's obviously not we just pretend we're from

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.720
on high disengaged.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:06.440
One thing that I will say is that there is a genuine power and I think radicalism to

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:10.240
telling the truth about the world the way we really see it.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:15.720
In other words, when you see the Earth from space, you don't see national borders.

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:24.280
You know that macroeconomics as it is described by economists is wrong fundamentally because

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.920
it doesn't include ecology and notions of natural limits and so forth.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:37.560
You understand that the world is a place of deep cycling, of elements and energy that

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.200
we're embedded in those cycles.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.480
So there is a radicalness to just simply teaching things about the world that we've learned

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.640
that we need to integrate to be successful as a species.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.920
And if that's a political act, then I'm guilty of it.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.680
Something very quickly about this?

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.680
Okay, very quickly.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:56.680
We're at time.

01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:00.040
I actually don't agree with you largely about this.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:05.480
Some of it's okay, but I think the job of science and society now is to be optimistic.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.400
That may sound like a crazy thing to say today, but I think we completely blew the climate

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400
change thing.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.280
I think it's a scientist fault that it's as screwed up as it is because we took this

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:21.960
thing, we have made it a kind of a finger wagging problematic issue for everybody.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:25.160
You've got to get on board with this or there's something wrong with you.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:27.520
My opinion is we should have said, you know what?

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:31.760
We have these amazing new technologies from space and geology and elsewhere.

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.000
We have learned that the planet is warming up.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.920
This is potentially dangerous.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:36.920
Guess what?

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:37.920
We're great at this.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.920
We can solve this.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920
We got to the moon.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.920
We can solve this too.

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.360
We just need to work on this.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:46.880
And then it's a kind of a, you know, there's a sense of optimism, maybe it's foolish optimism

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.040
or whatever.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:51.560
But to me, this is the way you garner social activity with science.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.320
I actually agree with you completely.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.800
Perhaps you misunderstood me that I do think that there is also kind of an optimism that

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:02.800
comes from that global long-term view that you can see that we've actually confronted

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.720
problems like this before.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.720
And many times.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.760
I'm going to have to go off to the street before people are starving.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.200
But a great conversation over lunch and to be continued for sure.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.400
Everyone, we don't have time.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400
Very quick.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:23.400
Oh, questions for lunch.

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.400
Questions for lunch.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.760
So I have a really provocative question.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:34.920
If we're not really, if we're being honest with ourselves, is it not the role of art

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:41.680
in science, collaborations to glorify and help us worship science?

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.760
Science has kind of taken the role of the church in our society.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.480
And we erect these huge buildings with magnificent architecture that we get architects in.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:54.720
And we commission sculptures and statues like the ones we saw that sit in and around our

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.360
scientific spaces.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:00.520
And they become these behemoths that society can worship against.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.920
And art enables that worship in the same way as it did with the church.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.120
It does that, but it also does the opposite.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.880
There's the critique and bringing it down to science.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.280
Questions for lunch.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:17.080
But the part that I wanted to include is that the common vocabulary here would be art history.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:21.640
And the fact that technology made art change over the years.

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.280
And so you start with charcoal and caves.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:30.080
And then you go into ate-tempere, you go from Mesopotamia to Egypt to Greece to Rome to,

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.000
that's a Western focus view for sure.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.280
But in that, that's the vocabulary that we could use as commonality to cross over.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:41.320
The technology would be used to basically progress all of this.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320
Okay.
