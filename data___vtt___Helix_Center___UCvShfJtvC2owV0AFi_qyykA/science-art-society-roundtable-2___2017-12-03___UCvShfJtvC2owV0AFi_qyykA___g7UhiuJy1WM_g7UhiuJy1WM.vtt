WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
So, as you know, this is our last roundtable event.

00:03.360 --> 00:06.360
Now, we are going to do a sort of group-wide wrap-up

00:06.360 --> 00:09.160
after this roundtable, so don't feel like this is the last chance

00:09.160 --> 00:11.720
to ask a question or a voice, an opinion, et cetera.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.920
So, the last panel is another Science Art and Society panel,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.040
our first panel on this topic.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.920
We talked about how to overcome elitism in the arts and sciences

00:25.920 --> 00:27.880
and better connect with the people.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.680
You know, the people are who, you know, look at art

00:31.680 --> 00:34.480
and engage with science, and it's important that we repair

00:34.480 --> 00:36.520
this kind of broken relationship between science

00:36.520 --> 00:39.480
and art, science and society and art and society.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.680
We also talked about literacy or lack thereof

00:43.680 --> 00:47.160
for the arts and for the sciences, and so, you know,

00:47.160 --> 00:49.480
there might be some panelists who want to continue

00:49.480 --> 00:52.880
that conversation because I don't think we quite finish it.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.160
And we also talked about, you know, how to maintain the integrity

00:56.160 --> 00:59.880
of art and science while trying to connect with people

00:59.880 --> 01:02.960
who might have different ideas about what we should be studying

01:02.960 --> 01:06.040
or what we should be making work about.

01:06.040 --> 01:10.640
So, anyways, I am going to plant a seed question as soon

01:10.640 --> 01:13.720
as I sit down, but I will let Zach introduce our roundtable

01:13.720 --> 01:15.360
panelists.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.240
If each panelist could raise their hand

01:19.240 --> 01:24.120
as I announce the name, Suzanne Anker.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.920
Suzanne is a visual artist and theorist working

01:26.920 --> 01:30.520

She works in a variety of mediums ranging

01:32.800 --> 01:36.240
from digital sculpture and installations

01:36.240 --> 01:41.520

04:46.000 --> 04:48.160
Faculty of Liberal Studies.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.240
His interdisciplinary work focuses

04:50.240 --> 04:53.800
on the interactions of metaphor, myth, and science

04:53.800 --> 04:58.320
in the context of scientific theory, practice, and history.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.800

05:08.240 --> 05:11.200
and Civilization.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.160
With that, I think Julia is going to start us out

05:13.160 --> 05:14.560
with a question.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.600
OK, thank you, Zach.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.880
So over the last couple of days, we've

05:18.880 --> 05:20.600
been talking about a lot of things,

05:20.600 --> 05:25.280
and I'm going to mix some of our subject matters here.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.960
So I want to start by asking you all,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.080
since I think you'll all have a kind of informed opinion

05:29.080 --> 05:32.200
about this from one aspect or another.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.200
How can science art collaboration help

05:36.200 --> 05:39.280
repair the relationships that we're

05:39.280 --> 05:41.600
talking about between art, science, and society?

05:41.600 --> 05:44.480
So feel free to approach this question, as you will,

05:44.480 --> 05:47.000
but with a focus on art and science working together

05:47.000 --> 05:47.600
to do this.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.240
I'll start.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.360
Hi.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.480
Just want to actually have a look at each of the people

05:58.480 --> 06:00.080
that I'm talking about.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.320
Because I woke up this morning thinking

06:02.320 --> 06:05.960
how strange it was to be going to have a conversation,

06:05.960 --> 06:08.480
fairly personal conversation, because that's how it feels

06:08.480 --> 06:11.920
to me with people I didn't know.

06:11.920 --> 06:16.720
And so for me, I find myself in the last couple of days

06:16.720 --> 06:20.360
really not knowing whether I belong here.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.200
I'm not sure why I'm here and whether I belong.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.680
I don't know if I'm a scientist, and I don't

06:25.680 --> 06:27.320
know if I'm really an artist.

06:27.320 --> 06:27.840
I don't.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.120
I don't know if I belong here.

06:31.120 --> 06:35.600
And then I thought, well, maybe that's exactly why I belong.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.000
Because if I can find a way of feeling that I belong,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.120
then we've done our job.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.120
And so for me, it's really about how

06:44.120 --> 06:45.840
we listen to one another.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.320
So most of the work that I'm involved in

06:49.320 --> 06:54.880
is looking at the space that exists between people

06:54.880 --> 06:57.440
and what occupies that space and what

06:57.440 --> 07:02.040
shapes the space and how we can unclatter the space.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.000
So when we look at art and science,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
the question is, what is the space?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.160
Is there a space between them?

07:08.160 --> 07:12.720
And what can we do to take out whatever obstacles there are

07:12.720 --> 07:15.320
for them to coexist?

07:15.320 --> 07:20.480
So I realize people ask me, what do you do?

07:20.480 --> 07:23.240
What kind of psychiatrist are you?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.480
What's your specialty?

07:25.480 --> 07:28.440
And I have a really hard time answering,

07:28.440 --> 07:31.720
because I grew up in South Africa

07:31.720 --> 07:35.000
knowing that I wanted to be an actor.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.720
And so I went to medical school.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.800
And finished medical school.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.560
And when a year out of medical school

07:43.560 --> 07:46.280
gave that up and went to drama school in England

07:46.280 --> 07:47.960
and became an actor.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.760
And my life has been this endless back and forth

07:50.760 --> 07:56.080
between am I an artist, am I a guest scientist?

07:56.080 --> 07:57.800
Because I am a psychiatrist and I think

07:57.800 --> 08:00.520
one of the big struggles of psychiatry

08:00.520 --> 08:05.080
has been that it wants so badly to be a science.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.280
And I don't believe that it is.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.520
I mean, there are aspects to psychiatry which are science.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.200
Do you know, do psychopharmacology?

08:13.200 --> 08:16.320
But even that is not a science.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.440
How you interact with the person

08:18.440 --> 08:22.440
in such shapes whether the medications are going to work?

08:22.440 --> 08:27.880
So I start with that and I say that what I would love

08:27.880 --> 08:31.280
is if this conversation rather than us talking about how

08:31.280 --> 08:35.440
we could create generative conversations out there,

08:35.440 --> 08:38.840
if we could create one right now right here,

08:38.840 --> 08:40.240
that would be great.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.880
I don't like what people say.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.120
And I think that there are a number of threads here

08:47.120 --> 08:52.520
we can pick up on about the antagonisms really

08:52.520 --> 08:54.960
between art and science.

08:54.960 --> 09:01.880
Scientists like to think that if they are sort of engaged

09:01.880 --> 09:06.880
in art practice, it makes their science more humanistic.

09:06.880 --> 09:12.520
And for artists, if they are engaged in scientific ideas,

09:12.520 --> 09:19.400
it makes their intuitive kind of gestures

09:19.400 --> 09:23.560
more palpable to a general audience.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.280
But I don't think we're going to solve this problem here.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.640
This is an ongoing problem.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.160
And it's a problem that may even go back

09:33.160 --> 09:40.320
to epistemological issues about knowledge and its production

09:40.320 --> 09:43.480
and its measurement.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.720
In science, there's consensus.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.000
There's consensus based on mathematical kind of rules.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.080
They may be bogus, but there is a methodology.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.640
There is a scientific method.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.520
There is no method in art.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.280
Every method is an individual method.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.720
It's more or less a dialogue with art history

10:07.720 --> 10:09.920
and speaking to the dead.

10:09.920 --> 10:17.880
So I think the bigger arches here,

10:17.880 --> 10:23.480
not that they can't overlap somewhat, and they do.

10:23.480 --> 10:28.320
But trying to put them one on top of another

10:28.320 --> 10:31.280
is not in our interest.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.480
I mean, some people have talked about a third culture.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.920
And I think that's another bad idea.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.120
I think there are three people on top of each other,

10:40.120 --> 10:41.680
generally better than two.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
Sometimes.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.720
That's who they are.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.440
In the spirit of generating conversation,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.800
contradictions always a good place to start.

10:50.800 --> 10:51.800
Absolutely.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.640
So as you contradicted Paul, I'm going to contradict

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
part of what you said.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.760
I didn't feel like I contradicted Paul.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.480
I just sort of picked out some threads.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.840
Well, the scientific method thing part of yesterday,

11:05.840 --> 11:08.600
a couple of the panels, some of the scientists said,

11:08.600 --> 11:10.120
there's a scientific method.

11:10.120 --> 11:10.960
There is no such thing.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.080
I think one of them said it's crap.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.440
That was the olfactory scientist.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.240
But anyway, whether it's crap or it's not there

11:17.240 --> 11:19.200
or it's looser than it is.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.440
And I think you could probably find a few scientists.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.280
I mean, confusing artists with scientists.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.680
A few artists who would say that there's a lot of method

11:26.680 --> 11:30.080
in what they do, even if they change that method

11:30.080 --> 11:32.200
when they get to the next piece.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.640
Having said all that, I'm going to contradict myself

11:34.640 --> 11:36.560
on top of that.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.800
Well, that's OK.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.160
I mean, in science, you aim towards repeatability.

11:41.160 --> 11:46.080
In art, if you repeat yourself, if someone repeats yourself,

11:46.080 --> 11:50.880
then they're either a plagiarist or an appropriationist.

11:50.880 --> 11:57.640
So the consensus in art is not based on repeatability.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.200
Is there a consensus in art?

11:59.200 --> 12:05.280
Yes, of course.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.600
I'm going to have to jump in there and say,

12:07.600 --> 12:13.320
I have never seen a like Paul.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.600
I feel pretty strongly like an imposter in this crowd.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.880
When I was hearing my short bio read,

12:20.880 --> 12:24.360
I thought, so what's the skin I have in the game here?

12:24.360 --> 12:27.200
I've been writing about art for about 30 years.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.920
A part that I usually don't put in.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.080
My biography is that I've been married to a neuroscience

12:33.080 --> 12:36.120
for those 30 years and more.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.880
So I've been following very closely

12:37.880 --> 12:40.680
the relationship between the arts and the sciences, which

12:40.680 --> 12:42.720
has gotten a lot better.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.240
30 years ago, there was very open hostility.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.640
So I think one question that hasn't really

12:48.640 --> 12:52.480
been addressed that I'd like to introduce at some point

12:52.480 --> 12:56.480
is why, historically, culturally, socially

12:56.480 --> 13:00.360
has led us to this point of greater intersection

13:00.360 --> 13:03.520
than we had 30 years ago when postmodernists were saying,

13:03.520 --> 13:05.120
scientists were the enemy.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.960
They were searching for absolute truths.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.000
Only postmodernists understood that no such thing

13:10.000 --> 13:12.880
was attainable at the same time.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.520
So I'm going to go with the spirit of contradiction,

13:15.520 --> 13:18.800
including self-contradiction.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.520
I really firmly believe that what is most fruitful

13:22.520 --> 13:26.560
about the sciences and the arts talking to each other

13:26.560 --> 13:30.200
is understanding how important the boundaries between them

13:30.200 --> 13:30.400
are.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.720
This came up yesterday, I think, Stuart Feinstein brought it up.

13:33.720 --> 13:40.040
Boundaries are crucial, I think, in our current political climate.

13:40.040 --> 13:44.120
We really have reason to understand

13:44.120 --> 13:48.120
how ethically important the search for facts are

13:48.120 --> 13:49.880
for alternate facts.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.840
I'm sorry for facts that are not alternate, that are not.

13:53.840 --> 13:59.640
Somebody's hope or somebody's political ambition.

13:59.640 --> 14:06.440
So I think on that level where artists and scientists

14:06.440 --> 14:08.640
are aimed is fundamentally different.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.560
I think artists are disruptors a couple of times

14:13.560 --> 14:16.600
over the course of this weekend.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.840
Artists have been enlisted in the role of clarifying

14:19.840 --> 14:29.200
of making science understandable to everyone, which

14:29.200 --> 14:31.680
brings us to the issue of populism, which has also

14:31.680 --> 14:36.800
gotten a very complicated politically in the past year.

14:36.800 --> 14:42.200
And I think that I guess the biggest difference

14:42.200 --> 14:45.480
between, or at least, that's the way it seemed to me

14:45.480 --> 14:48.600
over the past few days, between how science

14:48.600 --> 14:55.160
and art operate, is that art is fundamentally communicative.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.400
It's fundamentally about reaching from inside out.

14:59.400 --> 15:04.200
And scientists aren't, that's not a first order of business.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.920
Scientists are interested in figuring things out.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.960
And so this idea has arisen that artists can then

15:11.960 --> 15:17.440
be kind of brought in to take the figuring out and explain it.

15:17.440 --> 15:22.080
But the most interesting art I know that reflects ideas

15:22.080 --> 15:27.360
from science uses them in a kind of poaching way.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.040
You sort of go into somebody else's territory,

15:30.040 --> 15:33.280
take what you need, you're not explaining it.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.600
You're communicating something entirely else that

15:36.600 --> 15:37.800
can't be reduced to words.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.200
So I'll stop there.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.760
In the spirit of contradiction, I would say that one thing

15:43.760 --> 15:45.160
I've picked up from this conference

15:45.160 --> 15:48.160
is the similarities between art and science,

15:48.160 --> 15:51.840
that if they're both sort of an investigation of the world

15:51.840 --> 15:56.440
as we know it, and so little of what we do in school

15:56.440 --> 16:00.680
and in society is really talk about the real world,

16:00.680 --> 16:04.280
the physical world we live in.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.320
And so both art and science are largely

16:07.320 --> 16:11.440
self-directed, people choose there, if not specialties,

16:11.440 --> 16:15.400
and whatever draws them, the big question that draws them,

16:15.400 --> 16:19.360
and then explore it usually in an iterative way.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.200
So even if an artist isn't doing the scientific method,

16:23.200 --> 16:25.320
they're working through things over and over

16:25.320 --> 16:29.520
to get to something that they're trying to say,

16:29.520 --> 16:33.240
whether it's in or out or so.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.880
I think from that point of view, they're

16:35.880 --> 16:39.960
sort of using different tools to get to some sort of reality

16:39.960 --> 16:43.240
or some sort of view of the world,

16:43.240 --> 16:48.640
that is more in common than a lot of other things that you do.

16:48.640 --> 16:54.080
Yeah, I think there is basic epistemological differences.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.160
And certainly as far as art being a pedagogical tool

16:58.160 --> 17:00.240
for science, I think it's something

17:00.240 --> 17:01.600
that's necessary in the world.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.280
I think somebody brought up yesterday,

17:03.280 --> 17:07.960
48% of the population in the United States

17:07.960 --> 17:10.000
does not believe in evolution.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.880
And there are people out there that believe the Earth is flat.

17:13.880 --> 17:20.400
So we need as much science and art as possible.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.600
Train of thought that came up with something,

17:22.600 --> 17:23.560
I think Nancy said.

17:26.080 --> 17:35.000
For me, in art school, I found the conceptual underpinning

17:35.000 --> 17:38.960
that I wanted to have from my work did not fit in with the postmodern

17:38.960 --> 17:42.400
theory that was going on at the time.

17:42.400 --> 17:50.200
And I think this is a way that artists can refer to something

17:50.200 --> 17:53.240
that is an objective truth.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.200
Postmodernism, when I was in school,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.440
I couldn't talk about something being beautiful

17:59.440 --> 18:02.360
and conceptual at the same time.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.440
If it was beautiful, it could not also be smart

18:06.440 --> 18:08.400
and have conceptual underpinning.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.520
And the conceptual art at the time,

18:11.520 --> 18:14.040
I didn't find visually interesting.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.600
I find science to be the ultimate conceptual adventure.

18:17.600 --> 18:22.480
And so I kind of had to quietly, secretly build a methodology

18:22.480 --> 18:30.080
for making work that science was the underpinning to what was going on.

18:30.080 --> 18:35.240
But it enables us now to talk about a truth that is true,

18:35.240 --> 18:38.400
whether we believe it or not, and whether we know it or not.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.800
And I think that's really an important thing.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.400
So I have a question for you guys.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.280
We're talking about the differences between them

18:46.280 --> 18:48.400
and then the similarities.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.040
Let's jump on the similarities a bit, or at least the points

18:52.040 --> 18:57.640
of convergence where there's a functional, meaningful relationship.

18:57.640 --> 19:02.440
And how do we address some of these kind of societal things

19:02.440 --> 19:06.600
that we've been talking about, whether it's not as specific

19:06.600 --> 19:09.240
as how do we make people believe in evolution

19:09.240 --> 19:10.840
through an art science partnership?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.440
But this is the meat of what we're talking about here,

19:13.440 --> 19:17.760
is how can art and science band together to really do something,

19:17.760 --> 19:23.240
to bring us into the future that we envision for ourselves?

19:23.240 --> 19:31.280
I think that is being on the scope of essentially our thoughts here,

19:31.280 --> 19:40.440
because as I said earlier, this is an age-old kind of discussion.

19:40.440 --> 19:45.880
The esteemed art historian, Lee of Steinberg, wrote an article a number

19:45.880 --> 19:52.080
of years ago, whether art and science should be linked together.

19:52.080 --> 19:58.600
And he brings up Leonardo, of course, who is the master icon in this area.

19:58.600 --> 20:04.400
And he said, although Leonardo's scientific discoveries were very important

20:04.400 --> 20:11.000
at their time, that even without him, they would have been discovered.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.800
But his works of art had to do with the work of the man itself.

20:17.800 --> 20:24.240
And I thought that that was some of the most intelligent conversation

20:24.240 --> 20:26.040
about this subject.

20:26.040 --> 20:31.040
Now, what wasn't mentioned in my introduction is I'm chair

20:31.040 --> 20:34.400
of the Fine Arts Department at the School of Visual Arts.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.840
And in 2011, I built the first bio-art laboratory

20:38.840 --> 20:41.600
in a fine arts department in America.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.040
And we have been on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.600
We've been on community TV.

20:47.600 --> 20:53.800
Etc. And the idea here is to use the tools of science to make art.

20:53.800 --> 21:00.080
And tools of art also include metaphor.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.920
They include irony.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.440
They include cultural critique, et cetera.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.680
And you're not going to do that in science.

21:08.680 --> 21:21.760
OK, so I think that the question of comfortability between disciplines

21:21.760 --> 21:24.160
is about territory.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.840
And there are many programs that invite artists, and particularly

21:28.840 --> 21:31.960
in Europe, to work with scientists.

21:31.960 --> 21:36.040
And sometimes they're accepted, and sometimes they're not.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.640
Well, we've reversed it.

21:37.640 --> 21:42.160
We have now invited scientists to work with artists.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.600
And it's the same kind of apprehension

21:44.600 --> 21:49.520
that these scientists feel about artists.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.720
It's what they come into a bio-art laboratory.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.360
They're stunned.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.920
It doesn't look like anything that they're familiar with,

21:57.920 --> 22:00.960
because it's a cross between the 19th century.

22:00.960 --> 22:05.200
Sciences such as live animals, plants, et cetera,

22:05.200 --> 22:07.360
and molecular biology.

22:07.360 --> 22:13.840
So it's been a subject now that is brewing

22:13.840 --> 22:18.560
in many other educational systems, University of Dundee,

22:18.560 --> 22:25.680
University of Albany, Windsor University, and Canada, et cetera.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.200
So this is a growing phenomenon.

22:28.200 --> 22:35.360
And I think education is perhaps one of the key points of this conversion.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.120
And I think it's important to recognize

22:39.120 --> 22:42.160
that an essential element of the conversion

22:42.160 --> 22:43.640
is always going to be technology.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.400
And it's about sharing tools.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.880
Every medium in art is a technology, painting is a technology,

22:51.880 --> 22:54.240
sculptures the technology.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.320
Books were a technology that were cutting edge

22:57.320 --> 22:59.920
at the time that they were introduced.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.360
And that it's at that level, I think,

23:03.360 --> 23:06.800
rather than there's been a lot of talk about transdisciplinarity,

23:06.800 --> 23:09.760
which I think Suzanne, you and I both are suspicious of.

23:09.760 --> 23:13.960
Maybe there's a lot of suspicion around the table

23:13.960 --> 23:19.200
about whether or not there's this third way that actually is fruitful

23:19.200 --> 23:21.680
and constitutes a path forward.

23:21.680 --> 23:28.800
I think to bring the society piece into it, Julia, which maybe we're all

23:28.800 --> 23:30.880
a little bit suspicious of, can we do that?

23:30.880 --> 23:32.920
Can we change the world?

23:32.920 --> 23:38.880
At the same time, points to something that I think is more prevalent now

23:38.880 --> 23:45.280
than perhaps once was, which is all of these things have ethical dimensions.

23:45.280 --> 23:50.440
So it's something that I think scientists are thinking more about.

23:50.440 --> 23:56.960
I think artists are just assuming as part of the project in a way

23:56.960 --> 24:01.720
that maybe wasn't true 40 years ago or 50 years ago.

24:01.720 --> 24:05.200
Yeah, especially when you consider we're experiencing exponential growth

24:05.200 --> 24:10.040
and technology, whether or not we're going to have artificial intelligence

24:10.040 --> 24:13.680
in 50 or 100 years is relevant.

24:13.680 --> 24:21.480
It's coming, and the moral and ethical implications for that are ambiguous.

24:21.480 --> 24:27.480
And because of this advances in technology, it's also we live in an age

24:27.480 --> 24:31.280
where I think religion is losing its relevance.

24:31.280 --> 24:39.800
And I think that the arts can step up and be the moral conscience of our species.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.520
I think it's a duty, in fact.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.600
In what way?

24:44.600 --> 24:52.680
Critique, we can build a nuclear weapon, we could build artificial intelligence,

24:52.680 --> 24:54.360
but should we?

24:54.360 --> 24:59.080
And if we're going to build artificial intelligence, what kind?

24:59.080 --> 25:01.520
You know, there's a lot of talk about this.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.600
I think some people have talked about it.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.600
That's going to have a huge implication on society,

25:06.600 --> 25:10.320
depending on what type of artificial intelligence we make.

25:10.320 --> 25:17.880
It could be a time of human flowering of humanity,

25:17.880 --> 25:20.800
or it could be something quite different.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.920
And how art is going to fit into that, I think.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.560
Art is in a bit of a state of crisis now.

25:27.560 --> 25:36.680
And if that's the case now, what will it be when a human-level artificial intelligence

25:36.680 --> 25:44.520
can print out an artwork that will fool a human being into thinking another human being made it?

25:44.520 --> 25:49.040
And beyond that, find it interesting.

25:49.040 --> 25:57.040
And as well as if 3D printing is getting better and better and cheaper and cheaper,

25:57.040 --> 26:02.840
we'll be able to print out exact replicas of great master paintings,

26:02.840 --> 26:05.600
or even living artists' paintings.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.600
Have huge implications on the gallery system.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.720
Perhaps galleries wouldn't be necessary in a situation like that.

26:14.720 --> 26:18.480
You could just print out a version of the painting and live with it for a while.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.040
And if you wanted to buy the real one, you could.

26:21.040 --> 26:26.560
It's sort of what happened with the music industry, streaming of music.

26:26.560 --> 26:31.320
Art was always different because there was a reproducibility problem.

26:31.320 --> 26:34.680
But this would be a big change.

26:34.680 --> 26:46.000
It's not enough thought is being given, but there are people who are starting to work on it.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.080
Max Tegmark has written a book on it.

26:48.080 --> 26:59.000
How to get ready for artificial intelligence when it actually goes to a point where it can,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.400
in fact, function better than we can.

27:01.400 --> 27:06.520
Which he says will happen very quickly, which is why we need to have the conversation now.

27:06.520 --> 27:13.360
I mean, it's been possible to fake paintings and do reproductions of things for a long time.

27:13.360 --> 27:18.120
Take you back a moment, could I ask if you are so interested in the boundary between art and science,

27:18.120 --> 27:20.560
why build the bio lab?

27:20.560 --> 27:22.120
Why build the bio lab?

27:22.120 --> 27:26.520
Why paint with acrylics when you had oils?

27:26.520 --> 27:29.120
Because it expands the artist's palette.

27:29.120 --> 27:33.200
Can you pinpoint enough?

27:33.200 --> 27:40.080
I think there's so much going on here.

27:40.080 --> 27:45.480
I don't know where to start, so I'll just start with science.

27:45.480 --> 27:50.640
The products of science don't last, but those of art last, that's a fantastic distinction

27:50.640 --> 27:56.960
that is true and good until we get to AI where you can reproduce it.

27:56.960 --> 28:02.640
That messes some things up and brings chaos in an interesting way.

28:02.640 --> 28:07.440
But fundamentally, the products of science shouldn't last.

28:07.440 --> 28:12.880
Could there be ironic science the way there is ironic art?

28:12.880 --> 28:14.800
That would be interesting to see.

28:14.800 --> 28:19.600
I think in the long run, historically, it is ironic because it does contradict itself.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.600
Well, there's also junk science.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.600
And there's junk science, yeah.

28:23.600 --> 28:29.080
I mean, a lot of the stuff in a lot of the journals is just a way to pad things, and that's

28:29.080 --> 28:31.120
junk, and even if it's true.

28:31.120 --> 28:39.160
But there are things that what's interesting about science is that the itself-correcting

28:39.160 --> 28:48.960
nature is able to cast out what it felt was true and beautiful and move on.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.240
And that's great, and that's to its benefit.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.840
We don't have to throw out Leonardo's artwork ever.

28:55.840 --> 29:02.360
That's a real clear distinction, I think it's important and absolutely true.

29:02.360 --> 29:11.520
So what do we learn from that is part of the question of the boundary, I think.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.960
There's clear boundary on that point.

29:13.960 --> 29:22.280
So taking a scientific point of view on this, when you set up an experiment, you have to

29:22.280 --> 29:26.600
really make sure the boundary conditions are tight so that you know that the results you

29:26.600 --> 29:27.880
got are because of this.

29:27.880 --> 29:32.520
And if you did all the boundary conditions, you get other results from the same sort of

29:32.520 --> 29:34.360
experimental setup.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.800
And that kind of thing is basically improvisation.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.480
And Andrew Pickring writes about this, the mangle of practice.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.520
It's basically, you do one experiment.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.000
It's not coming out exactly.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.160
The results are not exactly what you thought.

29:47.160 --> 29:52.000
So you can did all the boundary conditions, or you can do your theory.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.880
And keep basically messing around with both until you're not breaking the instrument totally,

29:57.880 --> 30:00.680
but you're modifying it and you're stretching it to its limit.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.320
And you're not totally breaking the theory either.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.320
You might.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
You don't care.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
You can do that too.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.280
That sounds exactly like art.

30:08.280 --> 30:12.560
Methodically speaking, you're willing to take risks, do improvisation.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.240
You don't know exactly where you're going.

30:14.240 --> 30:19.200
You're pleased with whatever might come out of it's useful to you if it's fun.

30:19.200 --> 30:25.360
And in that way, they're, again, a lot alike because of how they're playing with boundaries.

30:25.360 --> 30:30.560
In both cases, you have to know what the boundaries are very tightly in the case of science much

30:30.560 --> 30:31.560
more tightly.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.760
But in the case of art, too, you created an effect.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.800
You kind of want to know how you did that.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.320
You don't have to go down to the micron, but it's good to know.

30:41.320 --> 30:46.360
So there's a lot of similarity there in the spirit of the improv.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.400
And so then that brings me to the social part.

30:48.400 --> 30:54.480
And this is the part that's really crazy because the current administration is playing

30:54.480 --> 30:56.040
fast and free with facts.

30:56.040 --> 31:03.960
They are improving the shit out of the political context, international context.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.040
And how is that different from art and science?

31:07.040 --> 31:11.840
They've taken the stuff that we teach in colleges about how, well, it's interpretation.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.440
And you can really alter the boundary conditions, all the stuff I just said.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.080
You can use that to create absolute bullshit.

31:18.080 --> 31:25.840
So what is the difference between being rhetorical and improvisational with your facts and your

31:25.840 --> 31:27.240
method of creating facts?

31:27.240 --> 31:33.320
And what seems to be happening now, I'll suggest one thing that I'm interested in hearing

31:33.320 --> 31:35.560
what you think the difference is.

31:35.560 --> 31:42.000
They're just doing it for maintaining power and money where it should be, territory.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.360
If you don't do that, then you're in an other territory.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.600
You're doing other stuff.

31:46.600 --> 31:51.640
And I think that's where the sublime and transcendent nature of art and science goes

31:51.640 --> 31:58.040
to not just keeping more power and money, but to discovery.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.440
Other than that, it seems a lot alike.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.440
It seems like...

32:01.440 --> 32:06.680
Well, I think this is a huge area of concern and complication.

32:06.680 --> 32:17.600
The legacy of prioritizing improvisation and prioritizing flexible thinking and acceptance

32:17.600 --> 32:20.680
of contingency, all that stuff.

32:20.680 --> 32:26.880
I think one important or useful distinction is between cynicism and irony.

32:26.880 --> 32:30.840
To know that you're being deceptive and to go ahead with it anyway is very different

32:30.840 --> 32:40.320
than being open to a range of interpretations of a dataset, whether it's in the arts or

32:40.320 --> 32:42.640
in the sciences.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.240
Also an aesthetic component.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.640
What they're doing is so ugly.

32:45.640 --> 32:50.760
I mean, it's as age people.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.760
I think both science and art are the truth and beauty thing that we're trying to look

32:55.760 --> 32:57.200
for something deeper.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.880
I mean, is it a matter of motive?

33:01.880 --> 33:06.640
So is it a matter of what purpose is being used for?

33:06.640 --> 33:07.640
And is it art?

33:07.640 --> 33:09.640
Is it science?

33:09.640 --> 33:15.360
When I hear that there is a distinction, so epistemologically, they're different systems.

33:15.360 --> 33:24.880
But when it becomes an identity that you start saying, I am an artist, he is a scientist.

33:24.880 --> 33:31.480
What concerns me is then we become, we stop being able to really see the other because

33:31.480 --> 33:36.160
we have so many assumptions about what it is to be an artist, what it is to be a scientist.

33:36.160 --> 33:42.240
There are limits, our capacity to be, just to be.

33:42.240 --> 33:48.200
And so I'm thinking as we're having this conversation, I'm thinking, is this conversation

33:48.200 --> 33:52.920
a scientific conversation or an artistic conversation?

33:52.920 --> 33:54.920
Is it either?

33:54.920 --> 34:01.160
Because if it's an artistic conversation, then anything is possible in the conversation.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.640
That's the way I feel about it.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.160
That's how it occurs to me.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.320
It's a scientific conversation.

34:06.320 --> 34:11.240
What happens for me is that I think there are experts.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.720
There are experts and I'm not one of them.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.960
I should leave it to the experts to talk about.

34:17.960 --> 34:23.160
And I think that's harmful, I think that gets in the way of a generative conversation.

34:23.160 --> 34:31.080
So for me, contextualizing this as an artistic conversation gives me freedom to just to belong,

34:31.080 --> 34:35.480
to feel like whatever anybody is saying will add and build something.

34:35.480 --> 34:40.920
So I'm interested to know how you relate to this conversation for yourselves.

34:40.920 --> 34:41.920
Is it artist?

34:41.920 --> 34:42.920
Is it scientist?

34:42.920 --> 34:46.960
I think in relation to that, I think we need experts.

34:46.960 --> 34:51.360
But then there are experts that connect the dots.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.440
Gregory Bates talks about the pattern that connects.

34:54.440 --> 35:02.280
And finding similarities between these experts and connecting in a way that's interesting.

35:02.280 --> 35:06.720
We've divided things for so long and we've found success with that.

35:06.720 --> 35:11.240
But there is value in connecting, I might think.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.240
Interesting.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.320
I come from two fields.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.400
One is narrative therapy and the other is narrative medicine.

35:18.400 --> 35:23.800
And both of them essentially believe that the person who's consulting the doctor or the

35:23.800 --> 35:25.800
therapist is the expert.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.960
They're the expert in their own lives.

35:28.960 --> 35:35.920
And that does not mean that the practitioner hasn't got a particular scientific or therapeutic

35:35.920 --> 35:42.280
expertise that is necessary, but it really is a shift in the power relationship.

35:42.280 --> 35:47.080
There's Brian Eno, who's known as a musician.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.840
He also has an interesting idea.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.560
He's also a great collaborator.

35:51.560 --> 35:58.200
He has this notion that he calls cenius, where we live in a society that's obsessed with

35:58.200 --> 36:01.960
the individual achievements, the genius.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.920
And we almost have a cult of ego.

36:04.920 --> 36:08.400
And I think we need to move past that.

36:08.400 --> 36:13.240
And he talks about we may obsess over Picasso or something like that.

36:13.240 --> 36:17.800
We don't really look at the scene that he came from.

36:17.800 --> 36:26.480
It's an ecology of ideas, a conversation about ideas that forms the ground from which a person

36:26.480 --> 36:28.400
like that can emerge.

36:28.400 --> 36:34.880
I think we've obsessed so much on the individuals that we need to think about the entire ecology.

36:34.880 --> 36:41.080
I was thinking about that just today, too, that a lot of the examples of SciArt successes

36:41.080 --> 36:42.560
are these rock stars.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.880
And they're great.

36:43.880 --> 36:48.160
And they just like, just bam.

36:48.160 --> 36:53.640
And then there's everybody else.

36:53.640 --> 36:59.280
And so with reference to society, again, how many of these geniuses can we spread around?

36:59.280 --> 37:02.120
A similar conversation in history of science, too.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.840
We pick these heroes.

37:03.840 --> 37:07.360
And then there's all this other stuff going on, legions of people doing.

37:07.360 --> 37:10.520
But we only have a very small handful of names.

37:10.520 --> 37:15.680
So in reference to society, how can we basically what we want to do?

37:15.680 --> 37:19.960
I think it sounds like we want science to be more widespread.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.680
We want art to be more widespread.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.680
Generally, that would be good regardless of how.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.640
Although we don't want to turn art into a propaganda tool for science because science

37:28.640 --> 37:29.640
keeps changing.

37:29.640 --> 37:34.920
It's like monkeys out of artists and scientists to be really good at propagandizing today's

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
science.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.840
That's happened so many times already.

37:37.840 --> 37:43.760
So instead, what do we do if we could harness the power of many ordinary individuals, which

37:43.760 --> 37:47.520
we are mostly, through a generative process?

37:47.520 --> 37:55.480
So this is the idea for a SciArt project that doesn't involve too many geniuses, but

37:55.480 --> 37:59.880
it involves lots of non-geniuses.

37:59.880 --> 38:05.880
It's going to be a disaster.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.560
Chaos is generative, too.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.440
So it would be something like this.

38:09.440 --> 38:16.800
You have some large scale, literally, I'm talking scale now, large scale in space and

38:16.800 --> 38:21.840
time thing that you want to, what do you call it?

38:21.840 --> 38:26.200
It's not an exhibit, it's not going to be any museum, but event, or maybe you want it to

38:26.200 --> 38:27.200
last.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.240
Maybe it's a mural that covers several square miles or something.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.680
And then the bits of it are going to be done by individual people.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.240
There's things like this before.

38:36.240 --> 38:41.760
I don't know the examples of it, but it's through some kind of combinatorial analysis

38:41.760 --> 38:42.920
too that you can do this.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.520
It's not just you're going to make a grid and you guys are going to be responsible for

38:45.520 --> 38:47.920
these things, so hold up the blue plaque.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.520
It's more like the improv element comes in.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.240
It's more like, okay, there's a problem.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.480
You all have to solve it.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.880
Here's your boundary.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.880
You solve your problem in here when I say go.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.440
And so they're all going to be solving.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.440
It's like parallel processing.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.080
That's what I'm trying to say.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.680
Instead of serial processing in the computer, a lot of people are solving the same problem

39:09.680 --> 39:11.640
at the same time, in the same area.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.160
They don't know exactly what they're going to get when they hook up.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.440
But it's done by a bunch of small, slow processors.

39:17.440 --> 39:24.840
This is like when you hook up a bunch of little computers, 256 of them in a big array, you

39:24.840 --> 39:28.960
can do a lot of great things that a supercomputer can do where you take a bunch of really low

39:28.960 --> 39:34.520
res lenses and you wire them together in an array like a dragonfly.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.160
You get very high res, comparable to it.

39:37.160 --> 39:44.920
So this is getting a bunch of low res people, non-geniuses, something that they understand

39:44.920 --> 39:49.360
in their locality and then the product is something that's great, even though individually.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.560
And then sort of some way that's happening.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.280
I mean to go back to Paul's, this is a very good question.

39:55.280 --> 39:57.480
Is this a, I'm going to be thinking about that for a while.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.600
Is this a science conversation or an art conversation?

40:00.600 --> 40:05.360
I think one of the things that has fostered a better relationship between the arts and

40:05.360 --> 40:11.760
sciences is the trend in the arts toward collaborative and participatory work.

40:11.760 --> 40:14.160
I mean that's something that's been on the rise.

40:14.160 --> 40:22.400
For decades now and I'm thinking in terms of this idea of lots of low res people, none

40:22.400 --> 40:28.600
of us are going to identify ourselves as those, lots of low res people.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.960
There is work that sort of enacts that.

40:30.960 --> 40:36.320
I'm thinking of Tino Segal, although he's just one artist who's done that kind of participatory

40:36.320 --> 40:41.440
work where you know he had to show it that some people here are familiar with his work.

40:41.440 --> 40:52.880
He had to show the Guggenheim that was about having his collaborators stage conversations

40:52.880 --> 40:54.880
with visitors to the museum.

40:54.880 --> 40:55.880
They were scripted.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.720
He walked into the museum.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.840
He did this also in galleries and other places around the world.

41:00.840 --> 41:05.000
And the conversations that took place were the art.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.160
And they were scripted in the beginning.

41:07.160 --> 41:12.840
But then after that it was, you know, it was a real time, real life conversation.

41:12.840 --> 41:21.680
So that is a kind of artwork that sits on this boundary.

41:21.680 --> 41:32.160
As do a lot of more sort of conventionally definable collaborations between artists and

41:32.160 --> 41:33.160
scientists.

41:33.160 --> 41:38.680
I'd like to pick up on collaborations in the visual arts.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.520
And there are some.

41:40.520 --> 41:43.640
And there are more now coming.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.080
I agree with you.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.320
But artists, visual artists are not great collaborators.

41:48.320 --> 41:55.560
They're not going to sit there and take instruction about, you know, from geniuses or non-geniuses.

41:55.560 --> 41:58.640
It just doesn't happen that way.

41:58.640 --> 42:05.920
But I do want to bring this back to society because I think that's the triangulation that

42:05.920 --> 42:13.320
we need to concentrate on rather than the dyadic structure, art versus or art and science,

42:13.320 --> 42:14.320
et cetera.

42:14.320 --> 42:21.600
In 2004, I wrote this book called The Molecular Gays, Art in the Genetic Age, published by

42:21.600 --> 42:27.040
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, which is an august scientific institution.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.240
It's the first time they produced an art book.

42:30.240 --> 42:37.320
It's a collaboration with the late Dorothy Nelkin, who was a sociologist of science.

42:37.320 --> 42:41.400
And unfortunately, she died before the book came out.

42:41.400 --> 42:51.360
But when we teamed up together and I said to her for every sociological aspect of science,

42:51.360 --> 42:57.120
you can come up with, I will come up with a visual constituent image.

42:57.120 --> 43:07.640
So there is a certain kind of possibility here of not essentially patronizing scientific

43:07.640 --> 43:14.880
companies or whatever, but really looking at the data bank in art history of how people

43:14.880 --> 43:20.920
were thinking about some of the things that are prevalent in society now, such as genetic

43:20.920 --> 43:21.920
engineering.

43:21.920 --> 43:27.760
Now, this is very similar to the concept of collage or cut and paste techniques.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.720
This goes back to 3000 BC.

43:30.720 --> 43:35.040
So it's not a question that this is all new.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.240
It's not new.

43:36.240 --> 43:45.600
It has this kind of creeping build up that includes innovation, includes accident, includes recognition.

43:45.600 --> 43:53.560
Last time I was here and I was on a panel with you, Galasi was here and Barbara Stafford

43:53.560 --> 44:00.320
and several others who quite a high res group, I must say.

44:00.320 --> 44:08.960
And Galasi is the scientist who discovered mirror neurons by accident.

44:08.960 --> 44:17.080
So that is one of the things I think is part of discovery that may join these two forces,

44:17.080 --> 44:24.520
but it's about recognition of the accident and being able to extrapolate it.

44:24.520 --> 44:30.600
And the reason I went into design originally was that I was interested in art and interested

44:30.600 --> 44:35.440
in science and it seemed to me that design was the combination of the two.

44:35.440 --> 44:42.720
So therefore, the perfect thing, but then you have designed somewhat subservience to

44:42.720 --> 44:49.920
commerce, that you're making a living, you're doing propaganda in some ways.

44:49.920 --> 44:54.840
And that's why when started thinking about the environment and we have to change our

44:54.840 --> 44:58.600
whole energy system, what's a new energy system going to look like?

44:58.600 --> 45:02.600
Or how is it going to be better than the hodgepodge we have now?

45:02.600 --> 45:08.840
So I guess I think there are ways that art and science can impact the future, whether

45:08.840 --> 45:17.400
it's having something to say about AI or energy systems or where we're going.

45:17.400 --> 45:26.080
I think actually looking forward in the future, I think design and architecture really have

45:26.080 --> 45:32.200
high possibility of blurring the line between fine art and science.

45:32.200 --> 45:41.160
I was, we were in a symposium last month called Strange Attractors and I spoke to some scientists

45:41.160 --> 45:50.960
there that felt that neuroscience or neuro-aesthetics is, there's nothing to it that, you know,

45:50.960 --> 45:59.720
it doesn't have real science behind it yet, but with three decades plus of making art

45:59.720 --> 46:07.560
under my belt and the subjective experience of that, I think personally I can say absolutely

46:07.560 --> 46:14.880
my thinking and my creative problem solving skills have been enhanced by both the product

46:14.880 --> 46:18.920
that I have made and the process of making it.

46:18.920 --> 46:26.400
And when we think about the architecture that we have around us being dictated by profit

46:26.400 --> 46:37.280
and margins and costs, where if we could study further neural-aesthetics and find the pattern,

46:37.280 --> 46:44.600
I think it was in the newest book by Max Tegmark, he says, you know, it's not matter that matters,

46:44.600 --> 46:50.320
it's the pattern, it's the structure that gives intelligence.

46:50.320 --> 46:58.960
And if we can extrapolate from that structure that we can surround ourselves in our civic

46:58.960 --> 47:08.640
design and architecture, you know, we could build a city, an urban design, an interior design

47:08.640 --> 47:16.080
that could potentially have a small part in making us better thinkers and problems.

47:16.080 --> 47:21.800
architecture and building has been often a joint venture all along.

47:21.800 --> 47:29.520
Yeah, if you want to go back to Plato with that too, if I just design the ideal republic,

47:29.520 --> 47:33.880
then the citizens will naturally be good.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.400
That's the idea, right?

47:35.400 --> 47:40.400
And if we add science to that and get some really good artists, not push the poets out,

47:40.400 --> 47:45.680
but bring them back in to work with the scientists, then we can make this ideal republic that

47:45.680 --> 47:50.080
not only is designed well but also produces.

47:50.080 --> 47:54.400
The only thing that, and he was being kind of ironic and metaphorical all that, and we

47:54.400 --> 47:59.440
should take him as that when he pushed the poets out, but I think it points up one really

47:59.440 --> 48:06.440
good thing that I think Plato does express very well.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.640
Collaboration's not enough.

48:07.640 --> 48:13.080
If we get really good at science art collaboration, we could still do some really heinous things

48:13.080 --> 48:14.080
that look beautiful.

48:14.080 --> 48:17.600
I mean, intelligence by itself is not enough.

48:17.600 --> 48:23.120
We can do some horrific things with better intelligence and make it palatable with art.

48:23.120 --> 48:27.440
So it leaves the moral component that many people brought up the other day about how

48:27.440 --> 48:34.960
what are the social values, where social justice, how does that work into this picture?

48:34.960 --> 48:42.440
And there we don't want of all places to be elitist in the sense that, well, we'll design

48:42.440 --> 48:48.000
the size of the room and door and window for you, and we'll also decide for you, what are

48:48.000 --> 48:52.680
the best moral values for you and you're all so much alike and all that?

48:52.680 --> 48:53.680
So that can't be done.

48:53.680 --> 48:54.680
So how do we do it?

48:54.680 --> 49:01.440
Instead, it goes back to the ground layer of working, listening to each community and

49:01.440 --> 49:03.640
letting those values come from them.

49:03.640 --> 49:08.600
In other words, trusting its chaotic again, but trusting in the sub-low res, whatever

49:08.600 --> 49:15.040
community, which already has pride of place as the person who mentioned Appalachia the

49:15.040 --> 49:20.320
other day yesterday, people have pride of their, they know their place, they know their

49:20.320 --> 49:24.080
land and they know that community many generations.

49:24.080 --> 49:32.160
They're in the best position to express something beautiful about it artistically as well as

49:32.160 --> 49:35.920
other values as well as knowing what the problems there are.

49:35.920 --> 49:40.480
So applying just raw intelligence to what we think are the main problems of some part

49:40.480 --> 49:46.760
of West Virginia, not the best way to go, but the participatory research stuff that you

49:46.760 --> 49:48.240
mentioned, that's the way.

49:48.240 --> 49:53.560
And when you do that, you can add to that participatory art as well as participatory

49:53.560 --> 49:58.280
science as well as participatory social value and social justice.

49:58.280 --> 50:02.160
So you're listening more and letting it come up and really all you're doing is creating

50:02.160 --> 50:04.320
the context.

50:04.320 --> 50:08.080
Is this an art adventure, is this a science adventure, is this a government adventure?

50:08.080 --> 50:12.360
Well, no, we're just going to set up a context, not sure what to call it, but then it'll

50:12.360 --> 50:18.640
be something the community can define as it goes and redefine and redefine and redefine

50:18.640 --> 50:20.400
as it goes.

50:20.400 --> 50:26.440
And from that will emerge something better than a top-down design that's done by intelligent

50:26.440 --> 50:28.600
people, which fails utterly.

50:28.600 --> 50:35.560
Yeah, well, you now have do-it-yourself bio labs internationally.

50:35.560 --> 50:43.240
In New York, it's GenSpace and Bioacres Without Borders.

50:43.240 --> 50:52.640
And this sort of theme is an expansion of what computer hacking was in the 90s to now

50:52.640 --> 50:56.360
engage in hacking biology.

50:56.360 --> 51:05.160
And the general public is invited in to take very short courses in whether it's genetic

51:05.160 --> 51:11.560
engineering or cloning or painting with bacteria, et cetera.

51:11.560 --> 51:21.240
And this is a very interesting construct because if you look at the do-it-yourself bio community,

51:21.240 --> 51:25.240
you'll see it's almost in every country in the world.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.600
I don't know what the repercussions are going to be with this.

51:28.600 --> 51:36.080
Alan Jorgensen, who's one of the founders of GenSpace, and comes in as an invited scientist

51:36.080 --> 51:42.920
to do my lab, is also friends with the FBI, okay?

51:42.920 --> 51:44.920
That's so many times.

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
Friends, right.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.520
How do you do that?

51:48.520 --> 51:53.480
Well, they were very taken by her.

51:53.480 --> 52:00.440
And she has never received any intrusive kinds of arrests.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.440
She knows it.

52:01.440 --> 52:04.240
She's a PhD in molecular biology.

52:04.240 --> 52:07.960
She's a member of TED.

52:07.960 --> 52:16.640
And this is sort of her forte is to bring science to the community, from children to

52:16.640 --> 52:22.920
adults to even scientists who do not have an institutional affiliation.

52:22.920 --> 52:28.680
By doing science at home, I mean, you need a lot of equipment.

52:28.680 --> 52:34.840
So I think we need to fold that into this conversation as a fact that science has spilled

52:34.840 --> 52:43.680
out of the laboratory into our everyday lives in many ways, and to articulate some of those

52:43.680 --> 52:51.480
things from the clothes we wear to the food we eat to the medicine we take, et cetera,

52:51.480 --> 52:59.840
et cetera, that this is a revolution in the transformation of materials, human materials,

52:59.840 --> 53:04.360
animal materials, the sale of materials, blah, blah, blah.

53:04.360 --> 53:09.080
And this has been going on since the late 80s.

53:09.080 --> 53:16.240
So I think those are some of the areas that people could be engaged with when they go

53:16.240 --> 53:23.400
to the supermarket and their food is not labeled as a GMO, and that's another thing we do

53:23.400 --> 53:26.640
in our lab is we do GMO testing.

53:26.640 --> 53:30.480
So we get to see what's what.

53:30.480 --> 53:40.400
And so, for example, when you're on delta airlines, don't eat the cookies.

53:40.400 --> 53:47.120
And other things like that that are GMOs, whatever that means.

53:47.120 --> 53:57.000
I mean, that's a whole conversation for the social order that people are hidden.

53:57.000 --> 54:03.840
I mean, that people are hidden, but products are hidden in terms of what they consist of.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.840
Okay.

54:04.840 --> 54:11.120
It's interesting to me that you say people are hidden.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.320
People are hidden too.

54:13.320 --> 54:19.840
Some of the more rewarding work that I've done in the last several years has been working

54:19.840 --> 54:28.200
with people who are marginalized for some reason and who are trying to, a part of movements,

54:28.200 --> 54:32.920
trying to change the narrative around them, around who they are.

54:32.920 --> 54:40.600
And they resort to pseudo-scientific language, trying to explain to people, for example,

54:40.600 --> 54:49.080
an example would be people in Croatia with intellectual disabilities are often institutionalized

54:49.080 --> 54:50.080
from birth.

54:50.080 --> 54:55.240
For a whole lot of psychosocial reasons, there aren't enough resources that people are put

54:55.240 --> 55:02.440
in these draconian institutions and never see the light of day are very poorly treated.

55:02.440 --> 55:09.040
So there is a movement to de-institutionize people and reintegrate them into the community.

55:09.040 --> 55:14.440
And so there was a whole body of knowledge trying to teach people that people with intellectual

55:14.440 --> 55:17.800
disabilities deserve to live in the world.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.760
They don't need to be locked away.

55:20.760 --> 55:25.680
But with opinion, what you get is opinion.

55:25.680 --> 55:30.160
So when you say, when you try and bring facts to people and say, if people don't belong

55:30.160 --> 55:32.360
in institutions, people say, but they do.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.000
And it becomes an argument.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.600
So we were hired to come in and work with an organization of people with intellectual

55:39.600 --> 55:46.960
disabilities, training them to tell their personal stories and they're not stories about living

55:46.960 --> 55:48.440
in institutions.

55:48.440 --> 55:52.080
They're ordinary stories about living in the world.

55:52.080 --> 56:00.640
And just so in order to be accepted into this organization, I needed to speak about

56:00.640 --> 56:02.280
my credentials.

56:02.280 --> 56:09.680
So I had been told before I went to Croatia that I should speak about my credentials as

56:09.680 --> 56:17.000
a doctor, as a psychiatrist, and I should definitely not mention my own personal story,

56:17.000 --> 56:22.480
which is if you go Google me, you'll find out that most of my work has been around my

56:22.480 --> 56:30.440
own personal journey about being a gay man living with HIV and that my storytelling was

56:30.440 --> 56:37.240
a way of before there was the science of surviving, really, of finding a way of making

56:37.240 --> 56:40.560
sense of my experience as a person with HIV.

56:40.560 --> 56:46.600
I was told, do not mention this in Croatia because no one will listen to you.

56:46.600 --> 56:51.520
So I arrived at the organization and they said, welcome, we will not introduce you to

56:51.520 --> 56:53.160
the people you're going to work with yet.

56:53.160 --> 56:56.680
They're a vulnerable group till we feel safe with you.

56:56.680 --> 56:57.680
Who are you?

56:57.680 --> 57:01.120
I said, well, I'm a psychiatrist.

57:01.120 --> 57:10.880
I don't even mention that word because in institutions the psychiatrists were the people

57:10.880 --> 57:17.280
that participated terrible harm on the people in institutions.

57:17.280 --> 57:19.880
They said, can you tell us something personal about yourself?

57:19.880 --> 57:23.120
And I said, well, I like to hike.

57:23.120 --> 57:33.840
And first of all, it got more and more difficult until the simple in my performance partners

57:33.840 --> 57:40.160
was another whole story of a 20-year collaboration with someone, which is not easy, I can tell

57:40.160 --> 57:41.160
you, really collaborating.

57:41.160 --> 57:46.920
But he said to me, listen, if we don't speak the truth, we're not going to get to work

57:46.920 --> 57:47.920
with these people.

57:47.920 --> 57:52.480
So I told my story and the social workers who were the interface with the organization

57:52.480 --> 57:56.520
ended up in tears and saying, well, that's why you're here.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.840
Come on in.

57:57.840 --> 58:05.600
And so what we did was teach people who really some didn't have language, some were beyond

58:05.600 --> 58:08.400
terrified to sit in front of a group.

58:08.400 --> 58:14.400
We eventually taught them to sing and to tell stories about very simple stories.

58:14.400 --> 58:18.640
One woman told the story of her niece and she showed a picture of how much she loves

58:18.640 --> 58:21.680
that little girl, plays with her in the park.

58:21.680 --> 58:23.720
She's a woman with dance syndrome.

58:23.720 --> 58:31.360
And they then used these stories as part of a campaign that is you can find as part of

58:31.360 --> 58:33.280
their organization.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.280
And it was the art.

58:34.280 --> 58:38.880
It was the art of storytelling, it was one of the women couldn't speak at all.

58:38.880 --> 58:39.880
She just danced.

58:39.880 --> 58:47.920
It was the art that communicated what this, I would say the science couldn't have.

58:47.920 --> 58:51.520
And honoring those people as experts.

58:51.520 --> 58:56.560
So I think what you're saying is allowing it to come from the people, what it is that's

58:56.560 --> 59:04.200
needed, is a particular kind of consciousness that we can bring as artists and as scientists.

59:04.200 --> 59:10.040
I think that is a really good point to pause at and invite the audience up for questions.

59:10.040 --> 59:14.160
I'm going to emphasize again, people come up for questions.

59:14.160 --> 59:18.080
Please ask questions for this panel because we're going to do an open group session where

59:18.080 --> 59:23.600
it's going to be more like pass around the mic, talk about your reflections for a minute

59:23.600 --> 59:26.360
or two and what you want to see next and that sort of thing.

59:26.360 --> 59:29.720
So more commentary things we can save for a little bit later.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.720
But let's get some questions going.

59:31.720 --> 59:36.240
Can I just say to your point that we throw out science and keep art?

59:36.240 --> 59:40.800
I mean Newtonian physics works really well for most of the world.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.480
Darwinian evolution.

59:43.480 --> 59:48.480
There are some things that we build on.

59:48.480 --> 59:50.640
I was going to say something very similar.

59:50.640 --> 59:57.040
I'll expand on that a little bit on this notion that science is always discarding itself.

59:57.040 --> 01:00:03.960
Whereas we keep Leonardo, but we don't keep all scientific ideas.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.120
It's not quite true.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.440
It's true that science is in an important sense self-correcting.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:17.080
But it's not disposable in the sense that whatever version of the truth we have at any

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:23.520
one moment is path dependent and knowing that path is very important.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:32.200
We need to understand Aristotle's cosmology and what was wrong with it and what we learned

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.680
about the universe that made us realize that that was limited.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.240
Like you just said, we need to understand Newton's laws.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.720
In fact, we can't teach science without teaching Newton's laws.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.200
And then we teach why they don't quite apply fully because of what we've learned since

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200
then.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:56.320
We teach science and to know science without knowing that history of ideas that are wrong.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.080
I mean in a certain sense limited.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:06.480
And so maybe keeping Newton and keeping Aristotle is not that different from keeping Leonardo.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.960
You don't teach artists.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.960
I mean artists have to learn about Leonardo, but you don't teach a professional artist

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960
now.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.560
Go out and make art exactly like Leonardo.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.120
Any more than we teach, go out and do Aristotle's cosmology.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:28.600
As I understand, art, which is not fully, there are also movements and things that, you know,

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.400
ways that are things are done and you don't go out and do art the way it was done 20 years

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400
ago.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.880
So there is that sort of revision too.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.320
It's not quite the same sort of linearity.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:43.240
But maybe there's a little more commonality there than was represented.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.040
The other quick point I wanted to make was about this notion of not having everything

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.520
just done by geniuses.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.760
I thought it was a very interesting part of the conversation.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.840
And there is this question of who owns art and who owns science?

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.120
Who's it for?

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:02.240
Is art just for professional artists in art departments or is it for everybody?

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.400
And we can ask the very powerful thing about science.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.000
And so this notion of having projects that everyone can do and you were kind of crowd

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.320
sourcing and all that, you were kind of feeling it.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.880
There's a really good model in science now for citizen science where there are these

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.840
projects where it's not just because it's cool as an outreach thing to involve people.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.360
In fact, the science is better.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.080
There are certain kinds of science where having lots of people out there recording and sensing

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.280
and contributing gives us an ability to do kinds of science that we couldn't do when

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.920
it's just the genius.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.280
And so the idea, and you mentioned a project at a museum that maybe kind of hinted at

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.120
this too, but the idea of sort of citizen side art where we use some of these same platforms

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.400
to really be collaborative in some way that it's not about the genius vision of the great

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.600
ego, but the contribution of the masses.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.000
And maybe there's a way that the citizen science model can be further applied to side

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
art.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.920
And also, I mean, in that language, the maker movement, which is something that's going

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.880
on where, and you mentioned these bio labs, just kind of like that where you really are

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.600
bringing in lots of people.

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.320
And it's not just about the lone genius vision, but like getting people involved.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.800
So I think that's a very useful direction we can think of in this conversation.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:28.000
As far as Leonardo, I'm reading the new biography by Isaacson.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.360
And it's maybe, you know, the thought that I had was not that we should paint like him,

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.800
but we should think like him.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.800
He was an integrator and brought disparate things together.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.280
And I think that's where his real inspiration is.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.760
Mr. Foden question.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:54.960
I was asked yesterday by this gentleman to say some of my artwork out there.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:08.480
I noticed the ongoing difficulty we have with correlating art and science, et cetera.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.360
I was fortunate enough to, when I flashed paint and mixed paint with other paint, et

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.120
cetera, et cetera, to discover the formation process of the vertebrae, et cetera, et cetera.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.720
Those are out there and I would like you to give me some feedback as to if you can agree

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720
to that.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.640
I mean, I just think I discovered the formation process reverted by an other important like

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.000
horseshoe crab splashes, exactly.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:41.680
They established the fact that the physics of liquid formation correlates to biological

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.600
formation processes.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.800
And yeah, give me some feedback if you would.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800
Please, I'll be here.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800
Thank you.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800
Thank you.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.960
I just want to say you had a lot there.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.720
I didn't want to gloss over the value of art, which probably you have a whole conference

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.520
on that question alone.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:06.320
But I think something I've been thinking about a lot is that we emphasize the product that

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320
is art, the noun of art.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:16.360
But I think we should emphasize and put as much value, perhaps an education on the verb

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:22.040
of art, the process of art, the thinking that is art.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.600
But again, that's a loaded conversation.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.600
No, no.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:31.000
So thank you all for your wonderful thoughts today and on other days.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.480
I had, I guess, two questions related to authorship, which I think came up a lot in

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.680
this discussion and it was part of the first question.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:48.080
Even as kind of the model of authorship in sciences versus arts, I think in science publications,

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:52.520
there's a long history of many authors being on the publication.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:58.080
And less so with humanities and artists, although we have fields within the arts that know how

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:05.480
to credit many people, theatrical performances, the film industry, animations, there are hundreds

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.480
of people listed as producers in a larger work.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.840
And I'm wondering whether these kind of considerations of authorship might also affect how we think

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:23.480
about science, art production and collaboration and whether changing our models for authorship

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:30.160
when we have a participatory piece, we're actually crediting the low res people in that piece

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:36.040
and not just saying, oh, this is a Nick Cave sound piece that happened to be sown by 100

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.560
people found on Craigslist or whatever.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.200
So one is this question of authorship.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.640
I'm curious about your thoughts about changing models of authorship within the fields of

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.080
art science and art science and psi art, whatever.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:56.800
The other is a question about, in particular, participatory art.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:05.760
And you kind of put forward this model of the grand mural with small components fabricated

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:12.480
or designed by other people and we have this idea of seenness, which as opposed to genius,

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.120
which I thought was very interesting.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.720
And I think there's another interesting strand that I would be curious for the group to comment

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:28.000
on, which is sort of trends in evolutionary art where the participant is part of the aesthetic

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:36.400
where I think one of the kind of standard examples, we have electric sheep where people

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:43.240
are voting on the aesthetic direction of a digital artwork and there's genetic algorithms

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.800
involved in its production.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.200
Another interesting example is comar and melamine who kind of say, you know, this has some

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.640
problems to it.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:57.520
When we ask everybody to participate and vote, you get something that's pretty dreadful

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.520
and everything that we get.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.000
But that's painting of every country that is a landscape and it has George Washington

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.880
in the corner and kind of like a deer on the side and everybody is happy.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:13.240
But the end result is something that is not all that satisfactory.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:21.880
And so I guess the second question is in this question of authorship intersecting with the

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.240
people or the public or the low res people, whatever you want to call it, how do you also

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:35.480
preserve this aspect of novelty search that is so important in art making and finding outliers,

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:41.440
you know, artistic visions that do not come about through a democratic process.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.240
That is such an important question.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.560
I mean, two questions, three questions, many questions.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.200
And I'm glad you brought comar and melamine into the discussion.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:55.840
I'm sure most people in this room know about this series of town hall meetings they had

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.520
where they would ask the attendees to vote on elements that should be in the best picture

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.920
and they varied according to region of course.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.480
But there's always a lot of blue because blue is everyone's favorite color.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.160
It's like an extraction to people like landscapes.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160
So there's all.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:18.560
So, you know, on the one hand, you know, I think it's really important that people who

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.760
are involved in the creation of artwork be credited.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.960
This has resulted in a lot of wives being acknowledged as co-authors of work that used

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.200
to be attributed only to their husbands.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:37.040
You know, we're looking at the Keene Holtz and Christo and Klaus Haldenburg and missing

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.040
a lot of people.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.880
But so these are, you know, these are good things happening.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.680
There are artists who acknowledge their assistance very explicitly.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.840
There are artists who don't.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.800
On the other hand, and I think this is really important and I'm not going to be proposing

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:08.960
a hard and fast rule here, there is tremendous danger in, I think, seeding the initiative

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.880
for producing the work to the public.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:18.640
And I think it's suspect because it's, you know, it's a way that institutions have boosted

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.640
their audience, you know, this sort of drive toward everyone's a winner, everyone's an

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.480
artist, everyone's a participant.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.520
You know, your expertise is as valuable as mine and it's particularly prevalent in the

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:38.200
arts because really everyone does feel in their hearts of hearts that they're artists.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.200
Why not?

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:40.520
What do you need to be an artist?

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.920
Not much, just an opinion, right?

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:56.080
I think being clear about negotiating those two, you know, kind of irresolvable perspectives

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.080
is really important.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.080
I'm not sure who it was.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.840
It might have been Thomas Jefferson that said democracy only works with that educated

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.800
public.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.400
And saying it's true with the status of art education in this country, we can't expect

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.120
people to know how.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:18.600
I mean, there are certain basic teaching that needs to happen.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:25.840
And as far as authorship, I think if there's a matter of prioritization, if we have a priority

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.520
more on the product and what the product is, the thing and the product as the thinking,

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:39.320
what it is doing for us, there'll be less of a need to want to have authorship.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.520
I don't know, I think it's important, but I think the focus should be on what it is

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.520
and what it's doing.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.080
Yeah, I have two comments.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.480
One, one, distance on the wall under his name.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.680
But let's take this expression, everyone's an art critic.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.640
I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.800
What if I go into a scientific laboratory?

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.600
And I say, I don't know much about science, but I know what I like.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.640
And that's what's happening.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.560
I know what facts I like.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.720
I use that as a segue for my question.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:23.360
So I wanted to ask a question based on Farzad's parallel processing question.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:30.280
And whenever I come to some of these conferences as a guest or whichever on this side or this

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.240
side, I always wonder how can we harness the power of the people in the room?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.720
And so you're talking about science and science in society.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.640
This is a micro-society.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:47.200
And we often, and these are great conversations to listen to and be part of.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:53.960
But I wonder how can we also use our experimental processes that we're going through finding

01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:00.760
out how to collaborate and how to collaborate in these new ways that are not genius-centered,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:10.280
that are about looking at other people and listening to them and taking time and doing

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.040
things in parallel and then coming back together.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.840
And so I'm curious, just in terms of having you as a smaller group, iterate about the

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.760
next panel in terms of like where or not panel.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.520
The collective discussion is where do we go as a community?

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.080
Are we a community?

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.440
And do we have processes that we can start to put into place so that we always make sure

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:40.240
that even if we don't harness the power of the room today, we leave the room knowing

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.600
that the power of the room is going to be, that there are processes in place, whether

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.240
they be online, offline, about meeting at the next cafe, next week or whatever.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.080
I'm just curious to have you play with that.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.560
I think that's a great suggestion for the final panel, for the structure of the final

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.000
panel to do that.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.200
And can you figure that out between now and then?

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:10.920
It reminds me of in family therapy, there used to be, well, there still is in some context,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.800
a one-way mirror in which the expert sat on the one side and watched the family working

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:23.880
with the therapist, there was a phone and the experts would call in and the therapist

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:29.760
would pick up the phone with the family sitting there and go, okay.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:40.480
Thank you, and say they want to know why you're so angry or whatever it is.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.800
It sets up the unknown invisible experts.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:52.160
I think his name was Tom in 1987, decided to do away with the one-way mirror and he took

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.280
down the mirror so that now the people could see the experts and it changed everything

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.360
because behind those one-way mirrors, people would say things to each other about the family

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.800
that the family would never hear.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.160
Suddenly, anything that God said was heard and that became known as a reflecting team.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.760
And what it did was it broke down the power relationship.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.560
So I think the question is really important.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:23.560
I think that what can happen here is even when you're having questions directed at us,

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:30.680
we become somewhat, we are the experts in the room and everybody else is an outsider,

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.640
witness group really.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:40.360
If we don't turn, if we all shut up and listen to reflections from the room that don't necessarily

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:46.720
have anything to do directly with what we've spoken, we would get a whole other body of

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.840
knowledge that would arise and then it would end with us reflecting on what we'd heard.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:58.200
And that's a standard practice in narrative therapy using communities and then outsider

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.360
witness groups and then reflection.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.200
I think that's a wonderful way to go.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:07.280
Well, clearly I should have just asked you to introduce the last, you know, collective

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.880
session because that is exactly the idea.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:15.040
There's not going to, when we meet again in 20 minutes or whatever, there aren't going

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.240
to be people sitting in the middle.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.920
It's just going to be kind of, you know, as we are and the thoughts that we can squeeze

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.720
in, you know, in the time that we have, which will continue.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:27.560
And there are a lot of ideas floating around which we'll discuss a little bit later about

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:34.040
how to continue this online offline in person over there over here sort of take yours.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:41.080
So I want to give a little contribution to this therapy session.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:45.800
I actually, I'm a long term collaborator with Tala Volk.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.040
I'm a scientist.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:55.720
I'm retired, but I'm still active and I always crash at his apartment and makes it very convenient.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.360
So he invited me here.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.880
I came Friday night.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.840
My name's David Schwartzman, by the way.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:08.480
And I want to start with a quotation, which I don't know if it's been used yet because

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.840
I wasn't here yesterday.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:17.600
Art is not a mirror of reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:23.440
And that's attributed to Bertolt Breck, but there's some controversy whether it's Mayakovsky

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440
or whatever.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:30.000
But what it brings up is art as a technology.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.360
And I think that the technology part has been alluded to, but it's the intersection of art

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.080
technology and science, I think is really critical.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:48.160
So yes, art is a mode, there's a mode of production technology to make art.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:55.840
But art itself is a technology like a million's design, so a design.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.000
And obviously architecture and so on.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.720
So it's technology, but it's also, and let me make a quick point about the conflation

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.960
of science and technology.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:15.840
If you're critical of GMO, then you're anti-science.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.280
You've heard that.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:25.320
If you're critical of a technology which appropriates molecular biology, then you are immediately

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:33.920
out by those in that, let's say, business, your attack as being anti-science.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:44.280
And I was very influenced by Lewis Althuss's philosophy works, in particular, brought as

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:52.480
a mode of aesthetic production, which I think some of his followers already also wrote about.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:19:02.120
And not only brings in the mode of production of making art, but how art interfaces with

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.800
social movements.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:13.040
The Swat Sticker is an obvious example of a fascist aesthetic, which had a powerful,

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:21.120
I think it had a real powerful influence in empowering the fascist movement, that symbol,

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.440
which of course was appropriated from India or in the Navajos, whatever.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:32.480
But I would share with you two a more positive example.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:38.040
I, as a scientist, I went to the science march.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:44.680
And of course, I'm a climate justice activist and all the rest.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:52.400
But there was science saying science has brought us the cell phone and a cures for, I don't

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.360
penicillin or whatever.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:00.000
No one held up the science saying science brought us nuclear weapons.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:09.720
So the, what I pose, I guess there's a question here, what I'm posing is the great potential

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:17.400
of art being a part of progressive social movements to change the world.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.360
Going back to Brex quotation.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:25.240
I'll sort of make a comment to that.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:32.360
Well, art is a way to engage in the cultural imaginary.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:42.120
And if we go back to Aristotle, he talks about the poetic epistemag, which is the role of

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:49.720
images, objects, words, et cetera, to essentially get towards that.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:55.920
That it's the idea that is expressed through this materialization.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:06.600
And the influence of art as an icon within social practice is a thesis in itself.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.520
We can take it on both sides.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:19.680
Another image that the Nabam, young girl running naked with burnt body from Vietnam

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:25.160
or the Abu Ghraib images or Michael Jackson.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:32.440
These are icons that then carry with them huge social dimensions.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:41.000
And that's in many ways what an icon does, whether we go back to Russian Orthodox religion,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.400
et cetera, that it encapsulates all of the social surround.

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:48.720
And it has not changed.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:58.320
Yeah, and art also could be a simulation for the full spectrum of the human experience.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:04.960
Science is mostly objective, but there's this huge subjective part of us, motions.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.960
And art can be a stage in which we can put these things together and run a simulation.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:18.560
I think that's another valuable way to think of it.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:21.600
My name is Cynthia Panucci.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.360
So I founded art and science collaborations here in New York 30 years ago.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:33.720
And I've watched the field slowly develop over these years.

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.120
After being an art student and coming to New York to start my art career in the early

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.120
70s, I worked in the top print gallery in New York.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.640
The AAA gallery doesn't exist anymore.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.200
But I saw the elitism of the art world.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.560
And then I see my family members who mostly they're not artists, and people that I know,

01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:02.440
galleries are incredibly off-putting to the common person, the common man.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:10.480
So science, yesterday I said we have to sort of sneak in science and surprise people with

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.280
it because you mentioned the word and people turn off their eyes glaze over.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:24.360
So I think that the people in this room, we represent a really privileged, rarefied environment.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.600
And I just went to Thanksgiving with my family in relatives.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:36.960
And I cannot talk about my work because there's no talking about, they feel they're not experts.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.920
And they feel because I've been in this field for x-men years, maybe I'm somewhat of an

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.480
expert anyway.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:50.540
I like the ideas of crowdsourcing information and citizen science because it's sort of a

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:57.360
natural way to bring people into the issues that we're all really concerned with, I think,

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.720
in this world.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:04.840
We want to make the world a better place to live, one that's environmentally sustainable

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.840
for future generations.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:15.960
And we have the privilege of thinking about the implications of AI or genetic engineering.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:23.000
Most of the people in my family and the people on the common man, they come home, this is

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.240
how my brother explained it years ago, we come home, we have three children, we do dinner

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.240
dishes, we make their sandwiches.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:40.400
We do their homework with them, we read stories to them, we're exhausted, we go to bed.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.440
We have hybrid minds.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:51.360
I think we have a responsibility to our society, to put our energies together and to work on

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.640
some of the very, what do they call the complex problems of our time, the stubborn issues.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.640
What is that term?

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.600
The wicked problems.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:09.600
Anyway, it's sort of for the next rooms panel, but it sort of addresses the crowdsourcing

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.600
information, the elitism.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:22.040
Thinking that the local person, like an Appalachia, wherever, or my brother lives in Michigan and

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:27.400
there are invasive species going into Lake Michigan, and that's why the water is crystal

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.920
clear, you can drink it practically, it's beautiful, it cannot sustain life.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:41.720
And the fishing where tourists like to come and fish, it's seeded by the forestry biology

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.800
department at University of Michigan, they put the fish in there every year.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:51.520
I mean, what type of environment do we want to live in, a totally artificial environment?

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:58.880
But we are the kind of hybrid minds that can be the visionaries, the leaders, and I'm not

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.600
meaning to be elitist.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:08.000
I think we have to listen to the problems, but the people in Michigan or Wisconsin, the

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.280
whole border, Chicago area, they're not thinking about this in the future, what it's going

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:20.040
to mean for the tourist industry and for just enjoying the lake.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:26.480
I think that is a great place to end and is kind of giving us the impetus to not let this

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:30.440
fizz out as things so often do after conferences.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:35.720
Okay, so we're going to have our last artistic interlude of the weekend, we're going to hear

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:44.000
from Dr. Shirley Mueller, who is a neuroscientist, but we're going to hear how neuroscience can

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.680
interact with museum exhibition, which is a kind of new trend I see happening around,

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.640
especially at places like Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.760
So we're going to watch a short video, we'll take a break, reconvene for the wrap up.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:57.760
Okay, we got through.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.400
We have a fun chair dance turn around and thank you panelists for a wonderful panelist

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.400
morning.

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:10.000
I was still mic'd.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:19.280
If we could get the lights turned down a little bit on this side, it's perfect.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.980
Yeah.
