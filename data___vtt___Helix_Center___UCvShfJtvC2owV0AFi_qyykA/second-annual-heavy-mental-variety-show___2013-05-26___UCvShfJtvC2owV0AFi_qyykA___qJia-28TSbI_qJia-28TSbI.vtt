WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Thanks for coming. We've got a good crowd tonight and we'd like to welcome you to the

00:05.680 --> 00:11.840
second annual heavy metal variety show. We're going to have a lot of fun tonight and we're

00:11.840 --> 00:16.400
especially glad to be here at the Helix Center and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.960
Before we start I want to thank Ed who runs the Helix Center for putting this together and all

00:24.960 --> 00:30.640
the people involved, Sharon Weller and others who helped make all this happen. There was a lot

00:30.640 --> 00:37.520
of logistical details and Miguel and the sound crew because this is not obviously a sound room so

00:37.520 --> 00:42.480
we're very pleased with what they've been able to put together and we hope you'll enjoy the show.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.520
We're going to be doing some songs about mind and brain and mental disorders and talking a

00:49.520 --> 00:55.440
little bit about it. We want to start with a kind of big question. Who are you or what are you? Are

00:55.440 --> 01:00.640
you a body, a mind, a soul, all of the above, none of the above? Everybody has a different

01:00.640 --> 01:08.880
opinion about this but it's a pretty ancient question. The oracle of Delphi told Socrates,

01:08.880 --> 01:15.280
know thyself and you know this was a kind of deep thing because he also told Socrates he was the

01:15.280 --> 01:23.600
wisest man on earth. So some two millennia later, a fellow named Renee had a different idea. He said

01:23.600 --> 01:32.000
well dude I already know this stuff right? Not only do I know myself that's the only thing I can know.

01:33.360 --> 01:40.880
All I know is what's in my head. So with his famous Kajito Ergo Sum he became the godfather of

01:40.880 --> 01:46.880
consciousness. This of course is Renee Descartes and he's the grand poopov of consciousness and

01:46.880 --> 01:52.400
tonight we're going to celebrate Renee by starting out with a song in his honor. The first two songs

01:52.400 --> 01:58.160
will be about mind and brain and consciousness in particular and the first song is called

01:58.160 --> 02:14.080
Inside of Me and it's a direct tribute to Renee Descartes. Okay let's try it now.

02:28.640 --> 02:41.520
I think so I am. I feel so I must be. Sometimes I don't know. It used to be me.

02:44.240 --> 02:53.840
I see your eyes. They're staring at me. They're sharp as knives.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.360
What do they say?

02:57.360 --> 03:19.680
Inside of me.

03:28.080 --> 03:33.200
My soul has passion.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.800
It's trying to feel.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.720
Searching for desire.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.640
Nothing is real.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.640
My will is weak.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.480
Not very free.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.320
Nothing to get hung about.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.320
Well that's just the deal.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.280
It can't seem.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.280
It can't seem.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.280
Inside of me.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.280
Inside of me.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.280
That's the way.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.720
For me I can be.

04:16.720 --> 04:22.720
You can't see.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.720
Inside of me.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.720
Inside of me.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.720
That's the way.

04:28.720 --> 04:46.720
Oh me I can be.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.720
I can be.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.640
I think so I am.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.280
I feel so I must be.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.040
Sometimes I don't know.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.640
It used to be me.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.840
I think so I am.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.840
I feel so I must be.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.840
I sometimes I don't know.

05:31.840 --> 05:35.840
It used to be me.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.840
You can't see.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.840
Inside of me.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.840
Inside of me.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.840
That's the way.

05:45.840 --> 05:49.840
For me I can be.

05:49.840 --> 05:55.840
For me I can be.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.840
For me I can be.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.840
For me I can be.

06:01.840 --> 06:05.840
For me I can be.

06:05.840 --> 06:13.840
For me.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.840
All right thank you.

06:17.840 --> 06:25.840
So now we're going to move to

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
another mind song, consciousness song.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.840
This one's about that eternal struggle between

06:31.840 --> 06:33.840
mind and matter specifically about that.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.840
And it's called Mind Over Matter.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.840
Mind Over Matter

06:41.840 --> 06:45.840
Something I'm trying to do

06:45.840 --> 07:09.840
I guess it's only physics

07:09.840 --> 07:15.840
It keeps me apart from you

07:15.840 --> 07:19.840
Mind Over Matter

07:19.840 --> 07:23.840
Something I'm trying to do

07:23.840 --> 07:27.840
Break down space and time

07:27.840 --> 07:31.840
We meet together with you

07:31.840 --> 07:35.840
I'm trying to wheel you here

07:35.840 --> 07:41.840
Find you wherever you are

07:41.840 --> 07:45.840
Locate your body your soul

07:45.840 --> 07:49.840
Pull you in from afar

07:49.840 --> 07:53.840
Are you still in my time?

07:53.840 --> 07:57.840
Have you slipped away?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.840
Have you gone?

07:59.840 --> 08:05.840
Have you gone?

08:05.840 --> 08:09.840
Well it's about living in another day

08:09.840 --> 08:25.840
We're aware of my journey

08:25.840 --> 08:29.840
Different path to another on the sea

08:29.840 --> 08:33.840
In the air, life free

08:33.840 --> 08:39.840
In the place, life free

08:39.840 --> 08:43.840
Wherever you are now

08:43.840 --> 08:47.840
Is my much fun

08:47.840 --> 08:51.840
No amount of space or time

08:51.840 --> 09:05.840
It keeps you from being alive

09:21.840 --> 09:37.840
Mind Over Matter

09:37.840 --> 09:41.840
Something I'm trying to do

09:41.840 --> 09:45.840
I guess it's only physics

09:45.840 --> 09:49.840
It keeps me apart from you

09:49.840 --> 09:57.840
Mind Over Matter

09:57.840 --> 10:05.840
Something I'm trying to do

10:05.840 --> 10:09.840
Break down space and time

10:09.840 --> 10:13.840
We meet together with you

10:13.840 --> 10:17.840
We meet together with you

10:17.840 --> 10:25.840
We meet together with you

10:25.840 --> 10:31.840
We meet together with you

10:31.840 --> 10:37.840
Thank you

10:37.840 --> 10:41.840
We've talked about consciousness

10:41.840 --> 10:45.840
We know it's important

10:45.840 --> 10:49.840
To think about consciousness

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
You know your conscious mind

10:53.840 --> 10:57.840
Is in there and says to you

10:57.840 --> 10:59.840
Damn why did I say that?

10:59.840 --> 11:03.840
I've got to stick to it now

11:03.840 --> 11:05.840
It's too late to backtrack

11:05.840 --> 11:09.840
I've got to stick to that thing

11:09.840 --> 11:13.840
The thoughts are coming out

11:13.840 --> 11:17.840
It's all about the things that

11:17.840 --> 11:21.840
We've been sitting on in our brain

11:21.840 --> 11:25.840
The Oracle knew this

11:25.840 --> 11:29.840
But he needed to school Socrates

11:29.840 --> 11:33.840
Because Socrates didn't realize he was the wisest man on earth

11:33.840 --> 11:36.840
And so he said, you know, if you wanted it, they're the

11:36.840 --> 11:41.840
Oracle said, if you wanted to know the truth, just got to look inside

11:41.840 --> 11:44.840
And the Oracle said, hey, I didn't say it was going to be easy

11:44.840 --> 11:48.840
You got to get in there and dig deep to find out what's going on in there

11:48.840 --> 11:53.840
So, you know, this takes us to two songs about digging deep into the unconscious

11:53.840 --> 12:00.840
But before we do that, Tyler's going to do a short reading on something that is relevant

12:00.840 --> 12:04.840
Yes, so I told Joe I'd find something from...

12:04.840 --> 12:08.840
This is from the kathau panna shad

12:08.840 --> 12:11.840
And I just want to say a few words after I read it

12:11.840 --> 12:16.840
Thus develop, this is a advice to everybody, thus develop a super conscious

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
Way of knowing

12:18.840 --> 12:23.840
Meditation enables you to go deeper and deeper into consciousness

12:23.840 --> 12:27.840
From the world of words to the world of thoughts

12:27.840 --> 12:30.840
Then beyond thoughts to wisdom in the self

12:30.840 --> 12:33.840
So what I take from that is that

12:33.840 --> 12:39.840
When you go beyond the stream, sort of typical stream of consciousness

12:39.840 --> 12:43.840
There can become a super consciousness because the stream of consciousness itself

12:43.840 --> 12:46.840
Is a certain unconscious aspect to it, we think it's conscious

12:46.840 --> 12:52.840
But in many ways when you start meditating you see that there's a lot of automaticity to the mind

12:52.840 --> 12:56.840
So that brings us to the song, the automatic mind

12:56.840 --> 13:04.840
This is a song by Tyler

13:27.840 --> 13:38.840
Welcome to the automatic mind

13:38.840 --> 13:46.840
Door is open to remember time

13:46.840 --> 13:53.840
Images are conjured like a dream

13:53.840 --> 14:00.840
Guiding actions on the waking screen

14:00.840 --> 14:20.840
Even though I realize that the light is so bright as I contemplate

14:20.840 --> 14:37.840
The automatic mind

14:37.840 --> 14:44.840
We live in the automatic mind

14:44.840 --> 14:51.840
In introspection opens in our eyes

14:51.840 --> 14:59.840
We seem advanced yet hardly in control

14:59.840 --> 15:03.840
Illusion of the will is comfort

15:03.840 --> 15:17.840
Even though I realize that the light is so light

15:17.840 --> 15:20.840
As I think about

15:20.840 --> 15:26.840
And can't live without the automatic mind

15:26.840 --> 15:42.840
Pop, blink, drink, think

15:42.840 --> 15:45.840
You think

16:15.840 --> 16:24.220
I'd love to vote.

16:24.220 --> 16:31.220
I love you.

16:31.220 --> 16:37.220
I love you.

16:37.220 --> 16:41.220
I love you.

16:41.220 --> 16:46.220
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind

16:46.220 --> 16:49.220
As I think about it.

16:49.220 --> 16:53.220
And can't give me back.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.220
The automatic mind.

16:55.220 --> 16:58.220
All right. Tyler Volkam guitar.

16:58.220 --> 17:00.220
Daniela Schiller on backup vocals.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.220
Thank you.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.220
Mandathar from base.

17:02.220 --> 17:08.220
Jonathan Kanan on Saxon flute and Hamas Madaras on cello.

17:08.220 --> 17:12.220
Okay. Well, we can't talk about the unconscious without, of course, mentioning

17:12.220 --> 17:17.220
Sigmund, especially here in the New York psychoanalytic Institute.

17:17.220 --> 17:21.220
You know, when many of you probably know this, but when Freud visited the US,

17:21.220 --> 17:26.220
one of the main people that he visited with was Abraham Brill, who was one of

17:26.220 --> 17:31.220
Freud's American devotees and disciples, and one of the founders of the New York

17:31.220 --> 17:33.220
psychoanalytic Institute.

17:33.220 --> 17:38.220
So when here being in this room and thinking about the unconscious mind,

17:38.220 --> 17:43.220
you know, as a neuroscientist, I think of the unconscious in terms of how the brain works

17:43.220 --> 17:47.220
and especially in terms of memory.

17:47.220 --> 17:51.220
So, you know, you've probably heard that there are different kinds of memory.

17:51.220 --> 17:55.220
For example, there's explicit memory, which is memory you can consciously retrieve

17:55.220 --> 17:56.220
at will.

17:56.220 --> 17:57.220
It's in your brain.

17:57.220 --> 18:00.220
It's stored in a part of the brain called the hippocampus.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.220
You want to remember what you had for breakfast.

18:02.220 --> 18:05.220
You can reach down in there and out comes the memory.

18:05.220 --> 18:09.220
Or maybe, you know, remember a birthday.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.220
Hi, Christina.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.220
All the way in the back.

18:12.220 --> 18:16.220
So you can remember these conscious things, and Christina Alberini is about to come in

18:16.220 --> 18:19.220
as an expert on these kinds of memories.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.220
But you can dig in and pull this stuff out.

18:22.220 --> 18:27.220
What you do is you retrieve those memories from explicit memory and explicit long-term memory.

18:27.220 --> 18:31.220
Put them into something called working memory, which involves the prefrontal cortex.

18:31.220 --> 18:35.220
And I think that's really what Freud had in mind when he talked about the preconscious.

18:35.220 --> 18:40.220
Memories that were, you know, that are available to be retrieved but aren't being retrieved right now.

18:40.220 --> 18:46.220
But more interesting is the, you know, the true unconscious, the dynamic unconscious.

18:46.220 --> 18:49.220
How can we understand that in terms of the brain?

18:49.220 --> 18:51.220
Well, that's a more complicated thing.

18:51.220 --> 19:00.220
But, you know, a lot of what may be thought of as repressed memories may not quite be like that.

19:00.220 --> 19:05.220
So we know that, for example, certain kinds of very stressful situations will release certain

19:05.220 --> 19:11.220
hormones like glucocorticoids, and these will be released from the adrenal gland, go into the brain,

19:11.220 --> 19:14.220
go to our friend the hippocampus and shut it down.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.220
And that takes about an hour to do the full thing.

19:17.220 --> 19:23.220
So during that hour, you might have some memories that will be kind of fragmentally or incompletely formed

19:23.220 --> 19:27.220
and could still be in there, but you won't have the full-blown memory.

19:27.220 --> 19:32.220
So in a situation like that, under severe trauma, you might have an amnesia for the event,

19:32.220 --> 19:38.220
not because you necessarily repressed it, which may happen, but I'm not going to talk about that.

19:38.220 --> 19:44.220
But because of the effects of purely the mechanical effects of the stress hormones on the hippocampus,

19:44.220 --> 19:47.220
preventing it from forming a fully-blown memory.

19:47.220 --> 19:53.220
Now the patient may then go to therapy and try to retrieve those memories, and in the process,

19:53.220 --> 19:59.220
may be able to dig out those features and fragments and put together some kind of memory.

19:59.220 --> 20:04.220
And that may be enough, but on the other hand, that opens up the possibility of a lot of false memories.

20:04.220 --> 20:09.220
So we just have to be aware that there are situations where memories can be unavailable,

20:09.220 --> 20:17.220
things that were conscious at the time, but become unavailable because of these mechanical effects of stress hormones,

20:17.220 --> 20:23.220
and that can maybe account biologically for some of what has been called repression.

20:23.220 --> 20:28.220
That's not to say repression does not exist, I would not say that, but it's not something we understand

20:28.220 --> 20:30.220
from the point of view of the brain.

20:30.220 --> 20:34.220
So now we're going to do a little tune about another aspect of the unconscious.

20:34.220 --> 20:37.220
You know, you can't always trust what you think you know.

20:37.220 --> 20:41.220
You think you have something in your mind and you understand it, you're so sure about it,

20:41.220 --> 20:44.220
but then your mind deceives you.

20:44.220 --> 20:48.220
Things that are in our mind's eye aren't necessarily accurate.

20:48.220 --> 20:52.220
They're just in our mind's eye, which is the name of the next song.

20:52.220 --> 20:59.220
Take it away Tyler.

21:22.220 --> 21:35.220
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cried.

21:35.220 --> 21:52.220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, we had love, it was good.

21:52.220 --> 21:58.220
You were there, you understood.

21:58.220 --> 22:06.220
Everything, yes everything.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.220
Here we go.

22:07.220 --> 22:11.220
You can't always trust what you think you know.

22:11.220 --> 22:14.220
You can't trust what you believe.

22:14.220 --> 22:22.220
Sometimes your mind just puts on the show, his silly disease.

22:22.220 --> 22:31.220
In my mind's eye you were mine, my mind's eye.

22:31.220 --> 22:45.220
If you look into my mind's eye, you would see the way that I cried.

22:45.220 --> 22:58.220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, you can't always trust what you think you know.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.220
You can't trust what you believe.

23:01.220 --> 23:16.220
Sometimes your mind just puts on the show, his silly disease.

23:31.220 --> 24:00.220
Deep inside in my mind's eye, you were mine, my mind's eye was blind, my mind's eye was blind,

24:00.220 --> 24:10.220
my mind's eye was blind, my mind's eye was blind.

24:10.220 --> 24:16.220
Okay, thank you.

24:16.220 --> 24:21.220
You know the Greeks had a dramatic device known as the Deus Ex Machina.

24:21.220 --> 24:35.220
This was a thing where the drama got at its worst where it seemed that the mortals couldn't figure out a god would descend from above and solve the problem.

24:35.220 --> 24:46.220
So a long time later a philosopher named Gilbert Ryle sort of rifed on this idea and talked about consciousness as the ghost in the machine.

24:46.220 --> 24:55.220
A bit later the cognitive science comes along and tries to understand the way the ghost, the machine underlying the ghost is working.

24:55.220 --> 25:01.220
And especially in the field of cognitive neuroscience we're trying to work out the way that machine does its thing.

25:01.220 --> 25:07.220
All right, now we're going to do one, another one about the mind and going deep inside.

25:07.220 --> 25:09.220
And this one is called Map of Your Mind.

25:09.220 --> 25:20.220
It's about how you know two people get together and you're trying to figure the other one out and look inside what's in the other's mind and try to find the way to work it all out and to be together.

25:20.220 --> 25:24.220
So this one's from our wife Nancy.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.220
All right.

25:27.220 --> 25:42.220
I've made a map of your mind.

25:42.220 --> 25:47.220
I've charted my course.

25:47.220 --> 25:59.220
Sailing deep inside.

25:59.220 --> 26:03.220
Got the heat of your heart.

26:03.220 --> 26:08.220
Keep me from the cold.

26:08.220 --> 26:13.220
Got the currents of will.

26:13.220 --> 26:19.220
Take me to your soul.

26:19.220 --> 26:29.220
I'm on a journey that I knew I'd made.

26:29.220 --> 26:44.220
It's a trip that I had to take.

26:44.220 --> 26:49.220
And excursion of need and design.

26:49.220 --> 27:00.220
So you're a source of art.

27:00.220 --> 27:07.220
You'll buy a fire.

27:07.220 --> 27:11.220
Made a map of your mind.

27:11.220 --> 27:21.220
I've charted my course.

27:21.220 --> 27:25.220
I've got the winds of horse.

27:25.220 --> 27:30.220
Got the heat of your heart.

27:30.220 --> 27:35.220
Keep me from the cold.

27:35.220 --> 27:39.220
Got the currents of will.

27:39.220 --> 27:44.220
Take me to your soul.

27:44.220 --> 27:49.220
I'm just loving that.

27:49.220 --> 27:54.220
My sails will be true.

27:54.220 --> 28:03.220
And they'll take me straight to you.

28:03.220 --> 28:12.220
Let the winds of strong but sweet.

28:12.220 --> 28:34.220
So when I land on my side, my homie.

28:42.220 --> 28:52.220
Got the heat of your heart.

28:52.220 --> 28:57.220
Keep me from the cold.

28:57.220 --> 29:02.220
Got the currents of will.

29:02.220 --> 29:07.220
Take me to your soul.

29:07.220 --> 29:11.220
Made a map of your mind.

29:11.220 --> 29:15.220
Take me to your soul.

29:15.220 --> 29:20.220
Made a map of your mind.

29:20.220 --> 29:25.220
Take me to your soul.

29:25.220 --> 29:29.220
To your soul.

29:29.220 --> 29:33.220
To your soul.

29:33.220 --> 29:40.220
To your soul.

29:40.220 --> 29:45.220
Okay, thank you very much.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.220
Okay, now we're going to do another one about memory.

29:48.220 --> 29:53.220
And this is about how hormones help sort of glue your memories together.

29:53.220 --> 29:56.220
It's called, in fact glue.

29:56.220 --> 30:01.220
I still have some crackling sounds there.

30:01.220 --> 30:06.220
Okay, Tyler?

30:06.220 --> 30:11.220
So here we go with glue.

30:11.220 --> 30:16.220
I saw you leaving.

30:16.220 --> 30:21.220
You saw me too.

30:21.220 --> 30:26.220
Smile at me.

30:26.220 --> 30:31.220
I saw you leaving.

30:31.220 --> 30:36.220
You saw me too.

30:36.220 --> 30:41.220
Smile at me.

30:41.220 --> 30:46.220
That's what you do.

30:46.220 --> 30:50.220
Tied to follow.

30:50.220 --> 30:54.220
But you are gone.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.220
Now you wait.

30:57.220 --> 31:02.220
Taking home alone.

31:02.220 --> 31:10.220
I can't think about your smile and eyes.

31:10.220 --> 31:18.220
I can't believe your words were lies.

31:18.220 --> 31:22.220
You make me happy.

31:22.220 --> 31:26.220
So very quiet.

31:26.220 --> 31:31.220
I can't forget those times we had.

31:31.220 --> 31:39.220
There must be something in my brain.

31:39.220 --> 31:46.220
There must be something in my veins.

31:46.220 --> 31:56.220
There must be some primal glue.

31:56.220 --> 32:05.220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

32:05.220 --> 32:13.220
When I saw you go, I didn't know.

32:13.220 --> 32:19.220
But you'd be back in a week or so.

32:19.220 --> 32:24.220
It's so hard.

32:24.220 --> 32:34.220
Realizing that, I wasn't really where you're at.

32:34.220 --> 32:42.220
I dream about you, most every night.

32:42.220 --> 32:47.220
I dream you're back.

32:47.220 --> 32:51.220
Everything's alright.

32:51.220 --> 32:59.220
I keep my dreams so come true.

32:59.220 --> 33:06.220
I'll wake up right next to you.

33:06.220 --> 33:14.220
There must be something in my brain.

33:14.220 --> 33:22.220
There must be something in my veins.

33:22.220 --> 33:29.220
There must be some primal glue.

33:29.220 --> 33:49.220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

33:59.220 --> 34:08.220
There must be something in my brain.

34:08.220 --> 34:28.220
There must be something in my brain.

34:28.220 --> 34:36.220
There must be something in my veins.

34:36.220 --> 34:44.220
There must be some primal glue.

34:44.220 --> 34:51.220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

34:51.220 --> 34:57.220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

34:57.220 --> 35:09.220
That needs my other wrist, I got you.

35:09.220 --> 35:15.220
Okay.

35:15.220 --> 35:21.220
And now we get to the part of the evening that Mark was talking about, the fear part.

35:21.220 --> 35:28.220
Fear is something that some of us are here were.

35:28.220 --> 35:31.220
John Moss.

35:31.220 --> 35:32.220
I just live in fear.

35:32.220 --> 35:36.220
The time works on the environment, that's a kind of fearful time.

35:36.220 --> 35:41.220
The first song we're going to do, Fear is called When the Night is Dark.

35:41.220 --> 35:46.220
When I was a kid, I used to really like vampire movies.

35:46.220 --> 35:51.220
The song was written about vampires, before vampires are really cool.

35:51.220 --> 35:55.220
I'm not like riding the bandwagon.

35:55.220 --> 36:02.220
Here we go, When the Night is Dark.

36:02.220 --> 36:21.220
When the night is dark, I lose my fear.

36:21.220 --> 36:29.220
When the night is dark, I never shed a tear.

36:29.220 --> 36:44.220
When the night is dark, I feel so free.

36:44.220 --> 36:57.220
When the night is dark, I feel so free.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.220
I feel the peace

37:01.220 --> 37:03.220
Then the day like that

37:05.220 --> 37:07.220
Scares me away

37:07.220 --> 37:09.220
Gives me away

37:09.220 --> 37:11.220
When the day like that

37:11.220 --> 37:13.220
Day like that

37:13.220 --> 37:15.220
Day like that

37:43.220 --> 37:45.220
Day like that

38:05.220 --> 38:07.220
When the night is dark

38:07.220 --> 38:09.220
Night is dark

38:09.220 --> 38:11.220
I come alive

38:11.220 --> 38:16.220
When the night is dark, night is dark

38:16.220 --> 38:20.220
I begin to thrive

38:20.220 --> 38:25.220
In the daylight sun, daylight sun

38:25.220 --> 38:29.220
Scares me away, wears me away

38:29.220 --> 38:34.220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

38:34.220 --> 38:40.220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

38:40.220 --> 38:44.220
Scares me away, wears me away

38:44.220 --> 38:48.220
When the daylight sun, daylight sun

38:48.220 --> 38:51.220
When the happy face

38:59.220 --> 39:01.220
Alright, thank you

39:01.220 --> 39:08.220
Thank you

39:08.220 --> 39:14.220
Alright, just in time, let's skip all the notes

39:14.220 --> 39:18.220
It's getting late, so we don't want to keep you too long

39:18.220 --> 39:24.220
So we drop one song at least and go on to a song that I wrote called Memory Pill

39:24.220 --> 39:32.220
This is moving into the topic, the last era general topic for the night, which is, is there a pill for that?

39:32.220 --> 39:37.220
I wrote a song called Memory Pill, which is about some work that some of us up here,

39:37.220 --> 39:41.220
Daniela's worked on, John's worked on it too, called a re-consolidation of memory

39:41.220 --> 39:44.220
Daniela's going to tell us a little bit about how that works

39:44.220 --> 39:47.220
No? No? No? No? Okay, that's that

39:47.220 --> 39:48.220
Alright, so...

39:48.220 --> 39:50.220
It's just Israeli accent

39:50.220 --> 39:52.220
No, no

39:52.220 --> 39:58.220
So, you remember how in 2004 there was this movie, Turnout Sanction of the Spotless Mind

39:58.220 --> 40:03.220
So that was such a great idea, you know, you want to get rid of a memory, you go to the doctor, zappigone

40:03.220 --> 40:09.220
So it turns out it was actually based on a true study that happened in Joe's lab in 2000

40:09.220 --> 40:14.220
Joe's student, Karim Nader

40:14.220 --> 40:21.220
What he found is that, actually, you don't have to target the memory just as it formed

40:21.220 --> 40:26.220
You can actually target old memory, so whenever you reactivate a memory, it's unstable in your brain

40:26.220 --> 40:30.220
And this is a window of opportunity to block it

40:30.220 --> 40:35.220
So he did this experiment in red, and the red's going to remember the fear, and he gave them a drug, a pill

40:35.220 --> 40:38.220
Not a pill, actually, an injection, and the memory was gone

40:38.220 --> 40:43.220
So another question is, can you do it in humans? Can you remember something, get a pill?

40:43.220 --> 40:47.220
And your memory will be gone? Well, we don't know yet

40:47.220 --> 40:50.220
But that's what we think, how memory works

40:50.220 --> 40:56.220
There's a twist, though, we can use pills to erase memories when we want to get rid of them

40:56.220 --> 40:58.220
Especially when they're traumatic and bad

40:58.220 --> 41:05.220
But what we discovered in the last few years is that you can actually use this mechanism of reconciliation to update memories

41:05.220 --> 41:12.220
So whenever you retrieve a memory, it's actually changing and you incorporate new information available at the time of retrieval

41:12.220 --> 41:18.220
So really, you don't remember the original event, you just remember your last retrieval of it

41:18.220 --> 41:22.220
And with that, Tyler, take us away on memory bill

41:22.220 --> 41:41.220
We're in C, right? Yup, great

41:41.220 --> 41:47.220
We're in C, right?

41:47.220 --> 41:54.220
We're in C, right?

41:54.220 --> 42:14.220
We're in C, right?

42:14.220 --> 42:27.220
Oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

42:27.220 --> 42:41.220
Yeah, yeah

42:41.220 --> 42:47.220
Birth trauma and childhood stress, chicken pox, what a mess

42:47.220 --> 43:00.220
Baby sitters and nuns and priests to whom I confess Oh, girlfriends and algebra, playground bullies and achievement tests

43:00.220 --> 43:06.220
Yeah, I want to get rid of them, yeah

43:06.220 --> 43:13.220
Each Tyler, I remember, I'll take a pill

43:13.220 --> 43:32.220
Block that storage, make my memory nil, just give me a pill, whoa, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

43:43.220 --> 43:51.220
I want to get rid of them, yeah

44:14.220 --> 44:26.220
Took a stroll through my brain, oh what a cluttered place, my old neurons, low on synaptic space

44:26.220 --> 44:55.220
Stop in the hell that I need, that I need to erase, just give me a pill, oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories, just give me a pill

44:56.220 --> 45:15.220
Oh, yes, oh, please, just give me a pill, wash away my memories

45:15.220 --> 45:21.220
Alright, memory nil

45:21.220 --> 45:27.220
Show the new song, okay, so we're gonna do two more songs

45:27.220 --> 45:56.220
One is called Brainstorm, and it's about something really bad happening in my life

46:27.220 --> 46:38.220
It's raining in my brain, I'm feeling okay

46:38.220 --> 46:49.220
Everybody thinks I'm insane, but I'm just on my game, I don't see the harm

46:49.220 --> 46:59.220
Just have a brain touch, walk the race and cause it's my magic's in the air

46:59.220 --> 47:27.220
Embers and flash, and legs are flashing, all I've again, don't have a cat

47:27.220 --> 47:41.220
Brain keeps coming out, thoughts are more profound, everybody's stand clear, hope I'll dissapear

47:41.220 --> 47:54.220
I'm not alone, it's just a brainstorm, heart to be, no more despair

47:54.220 --> 48:04.220
Muscles and grandmets are down, oh, I'm on a tear, oh, I'm on a tear

48:54.220 --> 49:23.220
Star's picking up steam

49:23.220 --> 49:33.220
There's a lot of times in the dream, there's tons of stand-in still

49:33.220 --> 49:38.220
I've got a chill, maybe that's just the norm

49:38.220 --> 49:47.220
When you're in a brainstorm, the foster is in, callers are flying, magic's in the air

49:47.220 --> 50:01.220
I'm not alone, I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

50:01.220 --> 50:12.220
Muscles and grandmets are down, I'm on a tear, I'm on a tear

50:12.220 --> 50:26.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

50:26.220 --> 50:45.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

50:45.220 --> 51:00.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

51:00.220 --> 51:15.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

51:15.220 --> 51:30.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

51:30.220 --> 51:45.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

51:45.220 --> 52:00.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

52:15.220 --> 52:30.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

52:30.220 --> 52:45.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more

52:45.220 --> 53:00.220
I'm on a tear, feeling so free, not to be, no more despair

53:00.220 --> 53:24.220
Muscles and grandmets are down, I'm on a tear, I'm on a tear

53:24.220 --> 53:32.220
Brainstorm! All right, we're gonna close it out with one last song

53:32.220 --> 53:55.220
This is called Fittingly the Mind Body Problem

54:02.220 --> 54:15.220
I've got a mind body problem, I don't know what to do

54:15.220 --> 54:24.220
I've got a problem, I don't know what to do

54:24.220 --> 54:32.220
My body wants you so, my mind's a no

54:32.220 --> 54:42.220
Is such an old love me, to me it'd be true

54:42.220 --> 54:51.220
Is such an old love me, to me it'd be true

54:51.220 --> 55:00.220
Oh now you're gone, I'm down and blue

55:00.220 --> 55:08.220
But now you're done, there won't be you again

55:08.220 --> 55:18.220
But now you're done, there won't be you again

55:18.220 --> 55:26.220
If I relent, I lose in the end

55:26.220 --> 55:34.220
I've got a mind body problem, he's got a problem, I don't know what to do

55:34.220 --> 55:43.220
He don't know what to do, I've got a problem, he's got a problem, I don't know what to do

55:43.220 --> 55:49.220
He don't know what to do, my body wants you so

55:49.220 --> 56:13.220
My mind's a no, no, no, no, no, no

56:13.220 --> 56:29.220

56:29.220 --> 56:38.220
I even tried religion to get over you

56:38.220 --> 56:43.220
Well, holy dualism

56:43.220 --> 56:48.220
Couldn't solve my schism

56:48.220 --> 56:52.220
Now you've got the truth and the shaking

56:52.220 --> 56:56.220
He's got a problem, I'm craving you

56:56.220 --> 57:01.220
Don't know what to do, I'm craving you

57:01.220 --> 57:05.220
He's got a problem, oh I don't know what to do

57:05.220 --> 57:10.220
He don't know what to do, oh I'm feeling the pain

57:10.220 --> 57:36.220
I miss the sound

57:41.220 --> 57:46.220
Oh, I've got a problem

57:46.220 --> 57:51.220
I don't know what to do

57:51.220 --> 57:55.220
I've got a problem

57:55.220 --> 58:00.220
I don't know what to do

58:00.220 --> 58:05.220
My body wants you so

58:05.220 --> 58:10.220
I'm on so no

58:10.220 --> 58:15.220
Good night

58:15.220 --> 58:18.220
