WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
I'm Ed Nursecien, I'm Director of the Centre.

00:04.840 --> 00:07.880
Today's program is on shame.

00:07.880 --> 00:13.240
Before I introduce the participants, I should tell you that the next program in June is

00:13.240 --> 00:22.240
on status, status, and then in September we have a program on a round table on lying,

00:22.240 --> 00:29.840
and then we are working on other round tables, including on the suicide.

00:29.840 --> 00:39.440
So, I'm going to be very brief with the introductions.

00:39.440 --> 00:46.040
The full biography of the participants is on the website, but I have a printed version

00:46.040 --> 00:52.640
here that I can send a round and you can just pass it a round if you want.

00:52.640 --> 00:59.040
Joseph Adamson is Professor Emeritus of English from McMaster University.

00:59.040 --> 01:04.920
Richard Schweider is the Harold Higgins Swift Distinguished Service Professor, Department

01:04.920 --> 01:10.880
of Comparative Human Development University of Chicago.

01:10.880 --> 01:17.000
Michael Lewis is the University Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Robert

01:17.000 --> 01:19.640
Wood Johnson Medical School.

01:19.640 --> 01:26.200
The program was suggested to me by Cathy O'Neill, who is there, and she is a mathematician

01:26.200 --> 01:29.440
and founder of ORCAA.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.040
So open for you to start.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.560
Well, thank you guys so much for coming.

01:35.560 --> 01:38.080
Can everyone hear me?

01:38.080 --> 01:40.920
I think it's very important to speak loudly and clearly.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.400
And I'm going to be kind of like the dumbest person here because I am a mathematician and

01:45.400 --> 01:47.080
an author and a data scientist.

01:47.080 --> 01:53.520
I wrote a book about how data science is fucking up democracy, and then I decided to

01:53.520 --> 01:58.680
write another book about shame, and I have really no right to do so.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.600
And I'm so grateful for these distinguished professors to come tell me what I've got

02:02.600 --> 02:04.560
it wrong about it.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.920
So I was just hoping that we could start by talking about what we mean by shame, the

02:07.920 --> 02:15.800
definition, and then I would love to jump in and say all the bad ideas I have about

02:15.800 --> 02:18.480
it so I could be corrected.

02:18.480 --> 02:25.600
But maybe we'll just start by, if you guys are into it, talk about what we mean by shame.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.120
And for me, it's probably the best to say that I think of shame as something I am rather

02:31.120 --> 02:32.720
than something I did.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.400
So it's not guilt, guilt is something I feel bad about.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.400
I could apologize and it would be over, potentially.

02:39.400 --> 02:45.240
Shame is something that is sort of a deeper meaning about my worthiness and my worthy

02:45.240 --> 02:46.800
of something.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.280
So for me, the sort of deep experience of shame probably came from my parents fat-shaming

02:53.280 --> 02:54.680
me.

02:54.680 --> 03:00.120
For years and years, I was told I was unattractive, would never get married, would never be worthy

03:00.120 --> 03:02.600
of attention from men.

03:02.600 --> 03:08.160
And that was sort of my first sort of inhabiting of shame, which I think of, I sort of think

03:08.160 --> 03:11.560
of there as being a sort of four stages of shame.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.760
The first stage is just inhabiting shame, feeling ashamed on a daily basis.

03:16.760 --> 03:20.160
It's not always terribly shame to like sometimes worse than others.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.000
But just sort of feeling, yes, I am unworthy.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.120
That is inhabiting shame, the first stage.

03:25.120 --> 03:31.360
The second stage happened when I was a teenager and I met people who didn't mind my body and

03:31.360 --> 03:34.720
thought actually I was attractive.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.760
And sort of like a different context, a different group of people around me that didn't have

03:39.760 --> 03:41.880
the norm that I was unattractive.

03:41.880 --> 03:46.800
And I went back to my family and to my high school friends and they shamed me again for

03:46.800 --> 03:48.440
my body.

03:48.440 --> 03:53.640
It provoked a different kind of experience for me, which I call outrage, outrage and

03:53.640 --> 03:54.640
denial.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.880
I was outraged by that.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.240
I was like, I don't deserve that.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.040
And yet it did make me feel ashamed.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.880
So it sort of both pushed me back into stage one and also gave me this new experience of

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
stage two.

04:04.880 --> 04:11.320
And I'll just briefly say for me, the stage three, which I call facing the facts, is

04:11.320 --> 04:17.480
we came much later when I was an adult, when I had three children and I had all the sex

04:17.480 --> 04:19.040
I wanted from all the men I wanted.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.880
And I was like, wait, hold on a second.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.840
They actually were lying to me.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.480
It was wrong on its face.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.680
The facts were wrong.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.760
So that's called stage three for me, like facing my personal facts saying, wait a second,

04:31.760 --> 04:37.760
turn off the noise, turn off the Weight Watchers, the industries trying to profit from me, the

04:37.760 --> 04:43.000
people trying to maintain power because I'm very attractive and I'm not, ignore all that.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.840
What are my actual facts at hand?

04:44.840 --> 04:47.520
And that's what I call stage three facing the facts.

04:47.520 --> 04:54.080
And then stage four for me is when I ultimately think, it's not about me anymore.

04:54.080 --> 04:59.520
It's about saying what the what the heck are we doing to people, to children, by shaming

04:59.520 --> 05:01.160
them for their bodies?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.040
That's when you sort of see it from the outside.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.720
And I'll stop there because I've already provoked, I'm sure you guys have all such

05:08.720 --> 05:10.360
a yeah, go.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.240
Can everyone hear me with this device on?

05:13.240 --> 05:16.960
Well let me try a definition that I think overlaps with yours and then I'd like to put

05:16.960 --> 05:20.400
out a proposition and give an illustration.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.800
And I also think we're going to have to introduce different kinds of societies because your

05:25.800 --> 05:30.760
description of your experience and relationship to it, I think comes from a particular kind

05:30.760 --> 05:38.680
of subculture in which creative individualism, liberation and a big focus on self is privileged

05:38.680 --> 05:41.880
over a lot of other ways of thinking about society.

05:41.880 --> 05:48.360
I take it your parents were actually trying to instruct you in success and status and

05:48.360 --> 05:51.680
the norms of society when they were doing that.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.680
And the capacity to actually reject it, it seems to me a separate issue from analysis

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
of shame per se.

05:57.680 --> 06:05.480
I would say shame is something like the fear of being seen as defective by others and it

06:05.480 --> 06:10.400
can take many variations and what the defects are can vary.

06:10.400 --> 06:16.840
I want to propose that shame and perhaps embarrassment are more powerful motivators of behavior

06:16.840 --> 06:18.960
than the fear of death.

06:18.960 --> 06:24.280
And the example I would give would be let's say, you know, if you go back to 1889, there

06:24.280 --> 06:30.800
were the Zulu wars in South Africa and the British had machine guns and knew how to fire

06:30.800 --> 06:34.320
rifles and they killed a lot of Zulu's.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.040
But those Zulu's who went on and fought them for six months would start with a group of

06:39.040 --> 06:42.360
five buddies in a village.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.880
They would create a bond between themselves.

06:44.880 --> 06:49.760
They actually would vomit into a pit, put the vomit, the collective vomit in a gourd which

06:49.760 --> 06:56.880
each of them wore around their necks and would run in beautiful coordinated ways into battle

06:56.880 --> 07:00.880
fifteen miles away to shore death.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.520
They knew they were going to be killed and the machine guns were there and mowed them

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
down.

07:06.520 --> 07:12.760
Gallipoli is another example in which I think the fear of shame or not showing courage or

07:12.760 --> 07:16.560
not being there with your buddies is more powerful than the fear of death.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.040
There are lots of social situations of course in which shaming is extremely powerful.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.400
Lois Peake who has studied preschools in Japan for example describes the classroom in a

07:26.400 --> 07:28.800
you know four and five year olds in Japan.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.840
The teacher walks in, the kids are sitting there and say, teacher we are ready to learn

07:32.840 --> 07:38.320
mathematics and the teacher could look around and say, but so and so doesn't have his book

07:38.320 --> 07:39.640
with him today.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.360
No one can learn mathematics today.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.760
And that night the mother or parents of that kid who didn't bring his book are going to

07:46.760 --> 07:53.720
hear from every other mother around and be powerfully shamed into making sure that they

07:53.720 --> 07:55.680
bring that book to school.

07:55.680 --> 08:00.840
And of course this is one of the ways in which the social order is carried forward.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.160
People have a sense of shame.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.000
We don't want someone to be shameless.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.200
In fact in the community I work in in India which is an orthodox Hindu temple town to be

08:13.200 --> 08:20.200
full of shame is to have propriety to be civilized to understand the rules.

08:20.200 --> 08:28.160
It's an extremely powerful and positive kind of cultivation of self restraint for example

08:28.160 --> 08:34.240
and an understanding of the state instructors that are there and a willingness to play the

08:34.240 --> 08:41.280
part within this choreography of a hierarchical interrelated set of statuses.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.920
And you're going to hear about it if you start deviating from that.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.240
But anyway that's my first pass.

08:48.240 --> 08:56.760
Yeah I'm very struck by what Catherine is saying because I'm working on The Mill and

08:56.760 --> 08:58.640
the Floss right, George Elliott.

08:58.640 --> 09:08.120
There's a little girl focused on the story, the novel, and she's relentlessly shamed

09:08.120 --> 09:11.800
a child because her complexion is the wrong color.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.040
Her hair is too dark.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.440
Her personality is too big.

09:16.440 --> 09:25.200
I mean she has very intense emotions and strong attachments.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.840
So she's breaking all the norms in that society.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.720
Richard Rick was saying.

09:33.720 --> 09:39.240
And it's become very crushing for her.

09:39.240 --> 09:45.280
It's actually an amazing novel in terms of how shame works and how destructive it can

09:45.280 --> 09:46.280
be.

09:46.280 --> 09:49.080
Although it can be a very positive effect too.

09:49.080 --> 09:55.160
It's a correct, it can be a correct situation.

09:55.160 --> 10:02.800
And then her family has an economic downfall, social disgrace.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.920
So it's a kind of piling on of shame.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.680
Because she's a girl, she's restricted.

10:08.680 --> 10:14.760
So she's constantly being shamed just for her gender.

10:14.760 --> 10:20.720
The novel ends very tragically because she finally experiences that kind of outrage you're

10:20.720 --> 10:30.880
talking about and acts on it impulsively and elopes with a young man who is, you know,

10:30.880 --> 10:32.720
she's from a lower class.

10:32.720 --> 10:42.280
She elopes with a higher class gentleman and basically the idea she disgraces her family.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.360
She's ostracized.

10:43.360 --> 10:48.960
She can find no way of getting out of this impasse in her society and the novel ends

10:48.960 --> 10:50.680
quite tragically.

10:50.680 --> 10:58.520
But there are more positive versions of that story in Elliot too where it is a motivator,

10:58.520 --> 11:06.880
very strong motivator for what Sylvan Tompkins calls, you know, restoring the good scene.

11:06.880 --> 11:16.080
I find his work quite interesting because he sees it as the least punishing of the negative

11:16.080 --> 11:22.640
effects as long as it's not magnified because it, you know, inherent in it is a desire to

11:22.640 --> 11:27.960
get back to those good feelings, though that there's sort of positive feelings in the positive

11:27.960 --> 11:29.520
scene.

11:29.520 --> 11:37.520
So it could be a remarkable motivating force in human life.

11:37.520 --> 11:45.360
I think the real problem is when it becomes toxic, when it's relentless and magnified

11:45.360 --> 11:52.400
when someone's growing up, then it becomes problematic because you internalize it and

11:52.400 --> 11:59.720
it's very difficult to break that internalization and to find a new way to be.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.640
So it struck me very much.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.760
You're the story you were telling there.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.560
It's very much like you might enjoy.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.160
I don't know if you've read it, Elliot, but I have.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.160
Yes.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
Yes.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.160
You know what I'm saying?

12:12.160 --> 12:16.160
Go ahead and go.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.960
These are tough.

12:17.960 --> 12:25.680
Well, it's, as Yogi Baris said, it's a deja vu all over again.

12:25.680 --> 12:33.200
I was in this room perhaps 25 years ago and the topic was shame.

12:33.200 --> 12:38.400
So it's a persistent and an important topic.

12:38.400 --> 12:43.120
Well, because, as I mentioned earlier, I think we're becoming a massive shame culture and

12:43.120 --> 12:44.440
that may be why it's back.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.080
Well, it's certainly the case.

12:47.080 --> 12:56.240
I had written a book called Shame the Exposed Self, which in the area of human development

12:56.240 --> 13:07.160
and psychology and emotion, not a work and it was of both a synthesis and an attempt

13:07.160 --> 13:20.560
to produce theory, a testable theory because the coinage that gets you ahead in my part

13:20.560 --> 13:25.960
of the world is you need to subject this to proof.

13:25.960 --> 13:31.320
It could be logical proof, but more in empirical.

13:31.320 --> 13:41.400
But it's a topic, an emotional development, which interestingly enough, Darwin, I just

13:41.400 --> 13:51.640
wrote a chapter for someone, on Darwin's treatment of shame, a new Sylvan well, and

13:51.640 --> 13:55.440
we spent the year having lunch together.

13:55.440 --> 14:01.880
Sylvan only ate two orders of coleslaw for the entire year.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.360
And I also tell you another thing about Sylvan.

14:05.360 --> 14:15.600
And Damian Uranian, the professor who goes to the horse races is Sylvan Tompkins, modeled

14:15.600 --> 14:16.600
after him.

14:16.600 --> 14:27.080
Sylvan was a wonderful creature, he wrote two of the most incomprehensible volumes that

14:27.080 --> 14:31.680
had read, but it generated a lot of thought and interest.

14:31.680 --> 14:37.320
But I really think if we want to, from an historical point of view, we should go back

14:37.320 --> 14:39.600
to Darwin and read Darwin.

14:39.600 --> 14:47.520
When King Close, the major problem Darwin had, is he could not create a theory of the

14:47.520 --> 14:49.880
mind cognition.

14:49.880 --> 14:58.720
So even in motion, he moved to the measurement of blushing, which he claimed was a good measure

14:58.720 --> 15:00.800
of it.

15:00.800 --> 15:08.240
Part of Darwin's problems, as we know, was he had trouble with a gradualism.

15:08.240 --> 15:14.080
He had trouble going from animals, for primates, to humans.

15:14.080 --> 15:23.280
And in fact, he toyed with, and it's in his time, was considered not inappropriate, but

15:23.280 --> 15:24.680
we do.

15:24.680 --> 15:35.240
Both people of color and people with an intellectual disability, he saw as a middle group between

15:35.240 --> 15:41.640
great apes and humans, and he toyed with that idea about the emotions.

15:41.640 --> 15:48.100
His major problem was he couldn't distinguish between what he called, and I call the self

15:48.100 --> 15:54.520
conscious emotions, which we've touched on, which includes guilt, which includes embarrassment,

15:54.520 --> 15:57.520
which includes shame.

15:57.520 --> 16:05.800
And if we like, we could also include a hubris, which turns out to be, you know, in the English

16:05.800 --> 16:09.920
language, we have one word for pride.

16:09.920 --> 16:17.920
And that's pride goeth before the fall, which is a negative attribute, and proud of one's

16:17.920 --> 16:22.360
accomplishments, which is consider a motivator and a positive.

16:22.360 --> 16:28.520
We only have one word for it, so hubris is probably an attempt of mind to try to move

16:28.520 --> 16:33.800
us away to have two words for the pride we're talking about.

16:33.800 --> 16:41.360
It turns out that within the fact, on a Linux tradition, the confusion between shame and

16:41.360 --> 16:48.360
guilt has been enormous, and it probably wasn't until the periods when I was writing

16:48.360 --> 16:55.600
and several analysts for writing, Nathan said it was a derivative or a think up, but he

16:55.600 --> 17:02.880
clearly was catching on to the idea that you had to make a distinction between them.

17:02.880 --> 17:13.480
In the meeting that I attended, I sort of sat back, unusual for me, and let the analyst

17:13.480 --> 17:18.560
talk about what they meant by shame and guilt.

17:18.560 --> 17:23.640
And of course, if we did this with what we mean by shame, we wouldn't come up with many

17:23.640 --> 17:24.640
definitions.

17:24.640 --> 17:31.920
So we know it's important, and we know more over that there's we have to take culture

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
into account.

17:33.920 --> 17:42.760
And Darwin had another idea, and he talked about things which he called action patterns.

17:42.760 --> 17:51.320
So I'm going to make a ridiculous proposal to suggest that we don't learn shame.

17:51.320 --> 18:02.360
Shame is an action pattern, and it's set off by the instigators or thoughts about the self.

18:02.360 --> 18:07.920
And thoughts about the self are called self attribution, and that self attributions of

18:07.920 --> 18:15.520
a certain kind are likely to lead to certain emotional states, motivators of action.

18:15.520 --> 18:28.400
And I think Rick picked up that the idea of shame as an extremely negative emotion is

18:28.400 --> 18:29.400
questionable.

18:29.400 --> 18:35.120
Shame has clearly a very definite function.

18:35.120 --> 18:40.480
Having one of the functions of shame is it stops you dead in your tracks.

18:40.480 --> 18:49.840
You suddenly became suddenly developed a damaged self, and you have to do something about that.

18:49.840 --> 18:57.120
Guilt on the other hand does not lead to a damaged self, it leads to reparation.

18:57.120 --> 19:03.560
And so if you wanted to measure it, and since I'm interested in how it starts, I look at

19:03.560 --> 19:12.040
the children, I can measure what a child does when they fail at something, they know they

19:12.040 --> 19:16.600
failed, and there's some children who try to repair the failure.

19:16.600 --> 19:24.000
There's some children who collapse, and there's some children who in fact don't show any of

19:24.000 --> 19:29.080
these self negative self conscious like emotions.

19:29.080 --> 19:34.520
And I want to tell you about the action pattern is specifically.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.320
Okay, what is the action pattern?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.480
I would have said it's hiding.

19:38.480 --> 19:43.200
Well, I think I think you're absolutely.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.760
But it's stopping.

19:44.760 --> 19:51.160
And they're so been had some idea he called it interruption, but it's not interrupting

19:51.160 --> 20:00.320
as the consequence of the act that's the consequence of the action pattern is to stop you hiding

20:00.320 --> 20:04.600
is another way is part of the stopping.

20:04.600 --> 20:12.920
So I would certainly agree that hiding we measure it by in fact the collapse of the body,

20:12.920 --> 20:17.000
which is an attempt to hide the self.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.800
The phenomenal logical experience is I want to die, hide and disappear or die.

20:26.800 --> 20:32.360
So it is clearly a self inhibit.

20:32.360 --> 20:42.320
But let me give you this example because one of the things that I discovered in 60 years

20:42.320 --> 20:49.680
of studying this is it's very, very tricky.

20:49.680 --> 20:56.560
And I've come to a much greater appreciation with people trying to think about it in a

20:56.560 --> 20:58.720
more dynamic way.

20:58.720 --> 21:03.280
When you're studying it, you have to stop it and look what just happened.

21:03.280 --> 21:11.720
So let me give you a story that years ago a patient told me is driving a car.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.720
It was at night.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.000
It was on a lonely road.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.120
It was raining and very hard to see anything.

21:20.120 --> 21:28.280
And as he's driving, he hits a door, runs in front of him and he hits that door.

21:28.280 --> 21:35.440
He slams on the brake and his first thoughts are what a horrible person I am.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.800
I've just killed a dog.

21:37.800 --> 21:44.600
Now he doesn't like to have that thought and the action pattern associated.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.040
So he says, how do I get out of this?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.480
I mean, it isn't safe, literally.

21:50.480 --> 22:00.360
But very quickly, he decides, one, he's not the cause of this mishab, this failure.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.520
Why?

22:01.520 --> 22:10.920
Because it's raining and it's dark and moreover, the owner let the dog run wild.

22:10.920 --> 22:20.520
So all of a sudden, he starts up with this powerful self-crunching action pattern.

22:20.520 --> 22:28.080
But given the flexibility that we humans have, we can change our mind.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.440
We can reinterpret it.

22:31.440 --> 22:35.240
And indeed, what he does is he blames another.

22:35.240 --> 22:41.800
Now the interesting thing, if it becomes a personality, namely, one constantly in a

22:41.800 --> 22:48.560
situation in which the self might be injured.

22:48.560 --> 22:55.440
Constantly, we interpret into other attributions.

22:55.440 --> 22:58.800
Essentially, it's either not my fault.

22:58.800 --> 23:04.880
By the way, males are much more likely to use it than females.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.240
The attribution is it's not my fault.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.800
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

23:09.800 --> 23:17.560
Females tend to use the attribution and is my fault more.

23:17.560 --> 23:29.360
But the fact of the matter is that I think the example characterizes that in front of

23:29.360 --> 23:33.720
us is what I call standards, rules, and goals.

23:33.720 --> 23:38.160
These are cultural events that are taught.

23:38.160 --> 23:42.040
These have no unique content.

23:42.040 --> 23:53.760
However, when one has in the self attribution the capacity to think about oneself.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.920
That's a whole other story on the development of that.

23:57.920 --> 24:08.680
But having that capacity, you enter into a chain, a process, and depending on the outcome

24:08.680 --> 24:16.040
of that process, you end up with the kind of action pattern that you're trying to describe.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.000
So, let me stop.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.480
I think this is going to be one of several cases where we're going to have to be very

24:21.480 --> 24:25.920
clear about the boundary conditions we put about any generalizations we make.

24:25.920 --> 24:31.680
Because the mode of control that you just described is not going to be readily available.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.920
For example, in that Hindu temple town where I've been working for several decades, because

24:36.920 --> 24:42.120
there's not going to be the capacity to blame others or to see yourself as a victim, the

24:42.120 --> 24:48.720
reasoning is going to be you always reap what you sow in life.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.880
And anything that happens is a consequence of your prior actions.

24:52.880 --> 24:55.560
And you come into the world with spiritual debts.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.840
And what you're doing constantly in life is trying to reduce the spiritual debts you

24:59.840 --> 25:04.120
have because the more spiritual debts you have, the more likely you're going to be in the

25:04.120 --> 25:05.880
kind of circumstance you describe.

25:05.880 --> 25:10.920
The very fact that it was a rainy day and someone let their thing happen to you, why

25:10.920 --> 25:12.400
did that happen to me?

25:12.400 --> 25:18.000
It happened to me because of my past behavior and the spiritual debts that I bring in.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
And so you're constantly trying to reduce those spiritual debts to various means that

25:24.000 --> 25:27.880
are available to you that could be living a righteous life, could be eating the correct

25:27.880 --> 25:28.880
food.

25:28.880 --> 25:34.560
But in any case, this whole mode of causal analysis of which you say, I'm not responsible,

25:34.560 --> 25:36.960
is not going to be available as a construal.

25:36.960 --> 25:41.360
There's mostly many problems with what I've said.

25:41.360 --> 25:49.000
One of them is a kind of a backward backtracking in cognitive science.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.040
They've caught on to backtracking.

25:51.040 --> 25:57.120
For those of you who don't know, a year ago, people wanted to discover how come an animal

25:57.120 --> 26:08.320
eat something and 24 hours later get sick from it and has learned not to eat that thing.

26:08.320 --> 26:15.600
And the argument is that we can move time, space, and an interesting way, forwards and

26:15.600 --> 26:23.040
backwards, our associative systems allow us to move backwards and forwards in time.

26:23.040 --> 26:29.080
So it is absolutely the case.

26:29.080 --> 26:36.840
If we could talk about religions as well, I want to step up a little bit because as

26:36.840 --> 26:40.240
a mathematician, I think very axiomatically.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.160
And I think we all are actually kind of agreeing.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.720
I want to go back to what you said.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.760
It's like there's a norm here, right?

26:47.760 --> 26:51.200
You shame someone with respect to a norm.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.840
I was shamed with respect to a body norm.

26:54.840 --> 26:59.640
What you're describing is when there is no other norm.

26:59.640 --> 27:05.480
Those people did not have access to a community where it was okay to be fat.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.480
It wasn't fatness.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.240
It was like this concept of a debt to the gods.

27:10.240 --> 27:15.840
If they had, let me imagine if some of them had gone on a study abroad program.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.320
It's actually not the gods.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Okay, the nature.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.520
My point is that they were ensconced in this norm group.

27:22.520 --> 27:26.680
So of course, they're not going to see a different way of thinking about it.

27:26.680 --> 27:34.400
And I just want to say, like to another point you made, we are living in a shaming culture.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.040
So I'm just going to throw on another layer here.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.880
I also had another experience of shame.

27:40.880 --> 27:46.000
When I worked in finance, I worked at a hedge fund during the crisis with Larry Summers.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.120
And I said, oh my God, we screwed up the world.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.440
I felt ashamed.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.520
I quit my job.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
I joined Occupy Wall Street.

27:53.520 --> 28:02.040
And I attempted to shame the government to improve financial regulation.

28:02.040 --> 28:03.120
And that was shame.

28:03.120 --> 28:05.000
I think shame is great.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.720
Shame is very, very useful.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.880
You were punching up.

28:07.880 --> 28:08.880
I was punching up.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.880
Right.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.280
So I like to think of shame in three categories.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.920
Punching up.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.240
Punching down.

28:15.240 --> 28:20.240
And I think shaming someone for their body, something that they can't control, is punching

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
down.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.800
What about the usefulness for shame just for the person, independent of, because you're

28:25.800 --> 28:29.920
only talking about being shamed or shaming.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.920
Yes.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.880
But what just feeling of having shame or feeling shame?

28:34.880 --> 28:40.480
I mean, shame, as you point out, it can be very useful for cohesion in a culture.

28:40.480 --> 28:45.680
I shame, for that matter, I shame my children when they don't do their chores.

28:45.680 --> 28:53.920
It's a lubrication to get people to follow the rules without having to explain the rules

28:53.920 --> 28:56.640
every single time and actually have to administer punishment when they don't.

28:56.640 --> 29:00.640
Let me just finish my framework and then I'll let you guys respond.

29:00.640 --> 29:05.360
I think there's a third type of shame that's getting more and more prevalent in this culture.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.560
There's punching up, shame, there's punching down shame.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.040
The third type I call punching nowhere, shame.

29:10.040 --> 29:14.960
And punching nowhere, shame, is when we try to, we sort of performatively shame people

29:14.960 --> 29:17.320
that will not care.

29:17.320 --> 29:22.280
And what I'm thinking here, emblematic example, is when people on the left, because I'm on

29:22.280 --> 29:30.040
the left, when I go to Twitter, I'm seeing my lefty friends, they are retweeting Trump

29:30.040 --> 29:36.200
or Trump's son and saying, and sort of saying something to him in their retweet to sort

29:36.200 --> 29:38.960
of try to shame Trump.

29:38.960 --> 29:39.960
It's ludicrous.

29:39.960 --> 29:40.960
It's ludicrous.

29:40.960 --> 29:45.600
Like, do you think they are going to care what you're saying?

29:45.600 --> 29:48.040
But it's definitely an attempt to shame.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.440
It's a failed attempt to shame.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.160
It's a performative thing.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.680
And my question is, what is the end result of that?

29:54.680 --> 29:58.440
And my feeling is it's not just a waste of time.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.280
It's actually a problem.

30:00.280 --> 30:04.480
And I think the anti-vaxxing movement is largely a product of that.

30:04.480 --> 30:11.080
And I think the incels, which are the young, mostly white men who are misogynistic online,

30:11.080 --> 30:15.800
talking to each other about how terrible women are, and actually going at sometimes and killing

30:15.800 --> 30:22.920
people, killing women, is a very direct reaction to this shaming, performative shaming punching

30:22.920 --> 30:23.920
nowhere called charity.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.720
People call this virtue signaling also.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.600
It's that's what I mean by performance.

30:27.600 --> 30:32.080
I'm performing righteousness by shaming Don Jr.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
Everyone retweet me.

30:33.080 --> 30:37.480
But, you know, it doesn't actually, in number one, it doesn't shame him.

30:37.480 --> 30:42.680
And number two, it just makes the other people more dehumanized.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.400
It dehumanizes them.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.600
It sort of focuses on us versus them.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.600
Right.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.720
Well, there's a sense in which, you know, I mean, I think there's a certain picture of

30:52.720 --> 30:58.360
shame as oppressive, which comes from people who don't like living in closed communities

30:58.360 --> 31:01.440
where there are these norms that everyone shares.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.800
And they feel oppressed by it, and they want out.

31:03.800 --> 31:09.880
It's sort of the creative individual who is willing to be transgressive with regard to

31:09.880 --> 31:15.200
the norms, and they go to New York City, okay, rather than live in the small community.

31:15.200 --> 31:19.760
Now it seems to me what's happened, however, is that the surveillance that goes on in small

31:19.760 --> 31:25.360
communities, which produces shaming of all kind, often to maintain social order, and often

31:25.360 --> 31:29.840
quite effectively, has now returned in the form of Twitter.

31:29.840 --> 31:35.640
It's now reformed in the terms of newspapers that are constantly looking to invade and

31:35.640 --> 31:38.680
get information that people think is private.

31:38.680 --> 31:43.040
And if they can expose it, it becomes now the equivalent on a much larger scale of these

31:43.040 --> 31:44.480
small communities.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.120
And ironically, that's what we're doing.

31:47.120 --> 31:50.680
The technologies have broken down the private public distinction.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.960
The idea that you could find an area where you couldn't be shamed because you could draw

31:54.960 --> 31:57.160
the shade, you could close the door.

31:57.160 --> 32:01.280
It was in a private realm where you could be experimental with transgressive behavior,

32:01.280 --> 32:04.120
and leave it there, is no longer possible.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.840
And that reaches the essentially, we found a way to have a technology that turns us into

32:08.840 --> 32:12.840
a small community again with all of these kinds of attempts you're describing.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.400
Well, to humiliate people.

32:14.400 --> 32:19.000
You can do a text on me of shame.

32:19.000 --> 32:32.760
But there are anything can shame you if you have a standard or rule, a goal, and you don't

32:32.760 --> 32:37.680
– and these are cultural determinant.

32:37.680 --> 32:46.240
Although there was some argument, historically, that shame or charm, the German for back or

32:46.240 --> 32:53.800
back side was in fact, and the early attempts at trying to address it was around toilet

32:53.800 --> 32:57.520
training and shame was there.

32:57.520 --> 33:06.000
Having lived a long life, when I was six or seven, I needed glasses.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.960
And it was shameful to wear glasses.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.080
You were called for eyes.

33:13.080 --> 33:17.640
Now we're not ashamed of wearing glasses.

33:17.640 --> 33:22.440
There's a – as you age, there's a hearing loss, okay?

33:22.440 --> 33:26.600
And I wear hearing aids.

33:26.600 --> 33:35.480
And hearing aids are designed, the technology, mostly that they should be hidden because

33:35.480 --> 33:38.800
wearing hearing aids is shameful.

33:38.800 --> 33:46.280
So we can change readily what is or isn't shameful.

33:46.280 --> 33:53.240
The idea to be helpful is there has to be some cultural standard or rule.

33:53.240 --> 33:59.680
Now interestingly enough, you could have a rule to be shameful.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.000
That is, it's good to be shameful.

34:02.000 --> 34:08.440
And so you could find many things that you might need to sweep away because you would

34:08.440 --> 34:09.440
step away.

34:09.440 --> 34:15.160
You can't eat a plant that's a root because there might be insects and destroy.

34:15.160 --> 34:20.360
So I don't know how useful it is.

34:20.360 --> 34:27.480
I think it is useful if we want to go contemporary to look at what's happening in not only our

34:27.480 --> 34:29.200
culture, but everywhere.

34:29.200 --> 34:36.440
To begin with, when I got a bad grade as the son of parents born in Europe turned to the

34:36.440 --> 34:44.160
century, but nonetheless, I was ashamed for their shame that I didn't get a good grade.

34:44.160 --> 34:51.800
I was not only ashamed for myself, I was ashamed that my parents' shame, well, that

34:51.800 --> 34:55.880
doesn't seem much the case anymore.

34:55.880 --> 35:07.560
But it seems to me that we need to not talk about the different kinds.

35:07.560 --> 35:14.360
Let me just tell you what the observation in these meta-analyses are.

35:14.360 --> 35:22.120
One, amount of narcissistic behavior has enormously increased.

35:22.120 --> 35:30.840
Any scale or the various scales that supposedly measure it show an increase in this country.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.440
Two, an increase in perfectionism.

35:34.440 --> 35:46.360
That is, being overwhelmed by the concern for making an error.

35:46.360 --> 35:52.080
Three, decrease in empathy.

35:52.080 --> 35:59.440
All of these are an emphasis.

35:59.440 --> 36:01.640
I think these things come about.

36:01.640 --> 36:05.600
Rick has hinted at it.

36:05.600 --> 36:14.840
These things come about because the self has become an increasing object to the self.

36:14.840 --> 36:27.040
So that selfies, tattoos, communication, it's a common knowledge especially in the age group

36:27.040 --> 36:34.320
in this room, that you watch a couple sitting, each taking a picture of their dish, sending

36:34.320 --> 36:38.400
it to other people.

36:38.400 --> 36:44.800
These are very technologically advanced, very complex behavior.

36:44.800 --> 36:51.200
The more you pay attention to yourself, the more trouble you ultimately get in.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.840
It's a pretty safe hypothesis.

36:53.840 --> 37:02.640
A baseball slump occurs because you start to think that you are in a slump and thus

37:02.640 --> 37:10.040
the kind of physical timing that you need to hit a ball, a swing at something before

37:10.040 --> 37:14.960
as it's leaving the hand of the pitcher gets disrupted.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.560
I have the problem when I have to shift.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.560
Do self-conscious.

37:18.560 --> 37:23.000
Well, I think the quote is, if you think you stink.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
That's right.

37:24.000 --> 37:32.440
So fundamentally, on a steep hill, when I'm driving a shift, which I learned to drove

37:32.440 --> 37:43.680
most of my life, I was in Berkeley on Cedar Avenue, which has some steep hills that, and

37:43.680 --> 37:48.880
now you have to put it in neutral, and there's a car behind you, and you've got to shift

37:48.880 --> 37:56.840
into first and very steep, and you just start to think about, I may have trouble shifting,

37:56.840 --> 37:59.160
you're going to have trouble shifting.

37:59.160 --> 38:07.280
The whole point in motor action is to get it out of the operating system because there

38:07.280 --> 38:10.880
are better things in your head to be doing with.

38:10.880 --> 38:19.680
The point is, if in fact it is the case that we have become more self-involved as a way

38:19.680 --> 38:26.440
to be happy, I don't know what the goals are, that fundamentally you would get an increase

38:26.440 --> 38:33.600
in shame because you're paying attention to yourself, and therefore you would need mechanisms

38:33.600 --> 38:40.080
to get away from it, which is narcissism, a very powerful mechanism.

38:40.080 --> 38:44.000
It's not my fault, or I didn't make a mistake.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.480
It's a defensive mechanism.

38:45.480 --> 38:51.920
Well, they're essentially, yes, they're defensive mechanisms for the increase.

38:51.920 --> 39:00.360
So the decrease in empathy is it's their fault, their poor, it's their fault to be poor.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.080
They are quite handsome.

39:02.080 --> 39:05.640
They should live all the way with Shamer and Chief in the country right now.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.200
That's what he's talking about.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.200
Well, Kathy, you are...

39:08.200 --> 39:09.200
I'm sorry, I disagree.

39:09.200 --> 39:13.740
I mean, we're wrong like Darwin thought that getting a red in the face was meant your

39:13.740 --> 39:14.740
shame.

39:14.740 --> 39:15.740
It's too easy.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.560
It's not about selfies.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.120
Selfies is narcissistic.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.600
I just, obviously, it's vain, obviously.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.920
I think people who do that are more vulnerable.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.400
They're more vulnerable to shame.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.960
People who take selfies, like just defining that way.

39:28.960 --> 39:36.520
They are more vulnerable to shame, but I think the worst aspect of modern social media is

39:36.520 --> 39:37.520
are not the selfies.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.200
They're just annoying.

39:39.200 --> 39:48.160
The worst aspect are the self-righteous shammers who are dehumanizing others and who are working

39:48.160 --> 39:50.800
actively to decrease our empathy.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.600
I think the empathy is the key.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.280
We are decreasing our empathy to people we don't agree with.

39:55.280 --> 39:58.400
We were like, if you think that, you must be a monster.

39:58.400 --> 40:03.680
And honestly, we say that about people with whom we agree, 85% of the time, but we found

40:03.680 --> 40:04.680
the 15%.

40:04.680 --> 40:06.600
Social media helped us find it.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.920
The 15% where we disagree and we're like, oh my God, I thought I liked you, but you're

40:10.920 --> 40:11.920
a monster.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.720
Now I know.

40:13.720 --> 40:17.520
That's the kind of performative self-righteous shaming that is a problem.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.080
Selfies is a small thing.

40:19.080 --> 40:23.120
It's an interesting difference between shame and guilt in this sense because you do need

40:23.120 --> 40:27.800
the cooperation of the other person to feel guilty if you try to, you might shame them

40:27.800 --> 40:30.640
and hope they feel guilty about something they've done.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.000
But to simply shame, you just need to leave a mark.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.880
It doesn't need to be reciprocated.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.800
Anyway, I think you need the cooperation of the other.

40:37.800 --> 40:42.120
I would have thought that guilt could be just between you and your ego ideal and if you

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
don't live.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.640
No, I mean, if you need the other to confess, if that's the way in which you're going to

40:45.640 --> 40:46.640
unload your guilt.

40:46.640 --> 40:51.760
If you're posting online and you want to leave a shame mark on someone, you don't need them

40:51.760 --> 40:52.760
to reciprocate.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.720
That's why it goes on and it goes on despite its utility.

40:55.720 --> 41:00.320
What do you think the response is when you're the receiver of that?

41:00.320 --> 41:05.360
If you know that you've 85% agree with the person and they're accusing you of being a

41:05.360 --> 41:06.360
monster.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
I personally feel terrible that happens, but I'm afraid.

41:07.360 --> 41:08.360
What else would you feel?

41:08.360 --> 41:09.360
What else would you feel?

41:09.360 --> 41:10.360
You'd feel angry.

41:10.360 --> 41:14.440
You'd feel outraged and you would say, no, you're the monster.

41:14.440 --> 41:19.440
And that's the point, it becomes a feedback loop, a dynamical system where I guess I was

41:19.440 --> 41:23.000
getting at the idea that it doesn't require as much empathy or back and forth for you

41:23.000 --> 41:28.720
to simply leave a mark that intends the shame versus to engage someone and to make them feel

41:28.720 --> 41:29.720
remorseful.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.720
It sounds infantile, right?

41:31.720 --> 41:34.800
I know you are, but what am I?

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
Yes.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
At that level.

41:36.800 --> 41:41.960
I'd like to pick up something you might go and just said, because I do have this sense

41:41.960 --> 41:48.520
that there are certain pre-potent areas that it's easier to shame than other areas, that

41:48.520 --> 41:51.840
it's just any arbitrary rule.

41:51.840 --> 41:55.280
And I'll get to this way.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.880
If you look at the explanations of illness around the world as an anthropologist, why

41:58.880 --> 42:02.960
people think they're suffering, there are very, there's a big three.

42:02.960 --> 42:07.360
The most frequent thing people do is point interpersonal influences on themselves, like

42:07.360 --> 42:13.080
witchcraft, evil eyes, sorcery, some things be friends and neighbors who envy me who are

42:13.080 --> 42:15.040
making me feel sick.

42:15.040 --> 42:19.880
And then there end up being moral explanations in which they blame themselves for their suffering

42:19.880 --> 42:22.720
and they think they've transgressed in some way.

42:22.720 --> 42:26.480
And then there are of course biochemical explanations, which it turns out are not the most frequent

42:26.480 --> 42:28.520
on a worldwide scale.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.440
The other two are an interpersonal or far and away the most common.

42:31.440 --> 42:37.000
But in the moral domain, when you look at what transgressions lead people to think,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.240
I did that and that's why I'm suffering right now.

42:40.240 --> 42:47.880
There's a small number and they end up being sexual, food and authority relationships.

42:47.880 --> 42:53.560
So if you kick your father and six months later you go blind, you're not going to fail

42:53.560 --> 42:57.080
to wonder whether you're blind because you kicked your father.

42:57.080 --> 43:02.440
There's something about those areas of experience in life that somehow are pre-potent and I

43:02.440 --> 43:04.720
wouldn't be surprised shaming could work that way.

43:04.720 --> 43:13.880
I think it's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis indeed that there may be pre-potent, that

43:13.880 --> 43:24.560
is failures or evaluations of one's behavior vis-a-vis some kind of standards, unique ones

43:24.560 --> 43:30.160
may be pre-potent in fact.

43:30.160 --> 43:37.360
And there would be good reason to suggest that these should be very important and frequent

43:37.360 --> 43:47.360
enough events so that you protect against violating the rules because it really is going

43:47.360 --> 43:48.720
to hurt you.

43:48.720 --> 43:54.280
One of the problems is now we're going to introduce embarrassment.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.200
Let me say a word about it.

43:56.200 --> 44:01.760
If I sat down with anyone in this room and said, tell me about things that embarrass

44:01.760 --> 44:08.960
you, you would, if you knew me for a while, you would tell me about embarrassing things.

44:08.960 --> 44:13.600
If I said, tell me about the things that shame you, you don't.

44:13.600 --> 44:20.200
And so it's been said that shame gets you into therapy but prevents you from getting

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
better.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.640
There's no comparison because the lesson tends to operate.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.760
We know that there's two kinds of embarrassment.

44:26.760 --> 44:30.680
There's embarrassment of being the object of others' attention.

44:30.680 --> 44:34.440
Darwin talked about it and it is certainly the case.

44:34.440 --> 44:43.080
I could show you if for example the group around the table decided we would all simply

44:43.080 --> 44:46.280
point at another person in unison.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.320
For no reason we randomly selected it.

44:49.320 --> 44:53.800
That person being pointed to would get embarrassing.

44:53.800 --> 45:00.160
For example when you're introduced and the introducer says very nice things about you,

45:00.160 --> 45:03.640
you certainly enjoy it but you are certainly embarrassed.

45:03.640 --> 45:11.720
Now you could argue you should be embarrassed but I can show you in 18-month-olds, to 24-month-olds

45:11.720 --> 45:15.040
when this embarrassment comes in.

45:15.040 --> 45:20.000
People play a game of pointing to each other and they tend to embarrass.

45:20.000 --> 45:28.200
The object of attention turns out to be a very early form of embarrassment.

45:28.200 --> 45:35.160
It also starts to involve body because the early forms is may he.

45:35.160 --> 45:43.480
So if you point to a child at 20 hertz who recognizes itself in a mirror by touching its

45:43.480 --> 45:50.360
nose and you point to it, the child will show you embarrassment.

45:50.360 --> 45:57.720
If you ask children, how many of you have children, grandchildren and the parent says

45:57.720 --> 46:04.800
show grandfather or grandmother the new thing you do and the child shows embarrassment.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.200
Why isn't that just changed, the mild form of shame?

46:07.200 --> 46:14.160
Well because it seems by the reporter not to be shameful.

46:14.160 --> 46:21.880
People have trouble interpreting this because it also turns out to be an individual difference.

46:21.880 --> 46:33.040
Shy people are in fact those people who over respond to being the object of others' attention.

46:33.040 --> 46:40.920
So there seems to be a distribution in the population of people who when they have the

46:40.920 --> 46:45.000
object of attention show embarrassment.

46:45.000 --> 46:53.200
This is a fair thing that people have different thresholds for shame, lower hires.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.520
Yes, they're wired that way.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.440
It's a way, we're wired that way.

46:58.440 --> 47:01.760
Yeah and so there must be a usefulness to shame.

47:01.760 --> 47:07.760
Most of the conversation has been about shame as a problem that you can shame.

47:07.760 --> 47:12.380
You gave the example of your school, they shamed you and you felt ashamed about your

47:12.380 --> 47:13.380
parents.

47:13.380 --> 47:17.120
But there must be some reason why we have this emotion of shame.

47:17.120 --> 47:20.480
It's absolutely very important socially for one thing.

47:20.480 --> 47:32.520
You know if you do something let's say you're at a dinner party and your host is going on,

47:32.520 --> 47:37.040
this won't happen tonight.

47:37.040 --> 47:44.200
And you're irritated about something, maybe not even something to do with him.

47:44.200 --> 47:48.280
And you lose it, you lose your temper.

47:48.280 --> 47:53.040
And you insult it.

47:53.040 --> 47:57.120
Exactly and you're right.

47:57.120 --> 48:05.880
Now you know, I think a lot of us have done something like that.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.160
And you feel terrible, right?

48:07.160 --> 48:13.560
The feeling is you just feel like you're, like there's this sort of sickness sinking, right?

48:13.560 --> 48:19.280
You just feel so ashamed of what you've done.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.440
Because you have shamed him.

48:22.440 --> 48:27.720
Well I think more you've, yeah, more you've acted in an entirely inappropriate way.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.120
It draws attention to you.

48:30.120 --> 48:37.320
And you there, and so you, you know, we've all done this, I've done it.

48:37.320 --> 48:42.720
You know, you go away, you feel terrible, the next day you go over and you want to make

48:42.720 --> 48:43.720
it right.

48:43.720 --> 48:48.000
I think this is what Tomkins is talking about when he says that shame and here it in shame

48:48.000 --> 48:51.600
is a desire to restore the positive feeling, right?

48:51.600 --> 48:54.280
To restore what he calls the good seed.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.840
And you apologize.

48:55.840 --> 49:02.600
And you say, I don't, you know, I behaved so inappropriately, I'm very sorry, you know.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.600
So look at the way.

49:03.600 --> 49:09.040
And so that's highly functional because it's a highly functional.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.640
Well it's more functionally if it prevented you from doing what you did.

49:12.640 --> 49:14.000
Well it often does, right?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.400
I mean it often prevents you from it.

49:16.400 --> 49:21.440
You know, let's say the person is, and they correct themselves before they do it, right?

49:21.440 --> 49:22.440
They control themselves.

49:22.440 --> 49:29.800
It's a very important mechanism to reduce shame, confession.

49:29.800 --> 49:35.760
You say, just as you indicated, I'm sorry I did that.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.240
Forgive me.

49:37.240 --> 49:42.520
So clearly there are mechanisms to reduce it.

49:42.520 --> 49:47.640
One of them is displacement to blame the other and become angry.

49:47.640 --> 49:51.920
And other is to internalize it and move toward depression.

49:51.920 --> 49:56.800
I am a worthless creature now and in the future.

49:56.800 --> 50:03.960
And the other one is to make fun of yourself, interestingly enough, especially in embarrassment.

50:03.960 --> 50:09.040
So Michael, what you make of socialization techniques designed in some subcultures to

50:09.040 --> 50:10.040
induce them.

50:10.040 --> 50:17.360
So for example, Heidi Fung has done observations of children and families in Taipei, in Taiwan.

50:17.360 --> 50:25.400
And the mother when she's around other associates or relatives or friends will bring in her

50:25.400 --> 50:33.560
young child who has transgressed in some way like you was describing and has them narrate.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.200
Their transgression.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.280
Tell them how bad you were.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.960
And it's not a confession.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.960
It's not really there to get rid of some feeling.

50:42.960 --> 50:49.880
It's there to recapitulate it and to have this child essentially cultivate a sense of

50:49.880 --> 50:53.800
shame by inducing it in a very public way.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.680
Presumably that's going to be relatively effective in having it not happen.

50:58.680 --> 51:06.560
And when she shows the video tapes at an American Psychological Association meeting, everyone

51:06.560 --> 51:08.400
views it as child abuse.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.400
And she has to stop showing it because it provokes such a discussion.

51:11.400 --> 51:15.720
So public shaming was a thing in this country.

51:15.720 --> 51:20.680
There was a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed Written by John Ronson recently.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.680
Or maybe Ron Johnson.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.360
I can't remember how he says his name.

51:24.360 --> 51:32.880
But he did a study about this, a sort of New England early America, sort of scarlet letter

51:32.880 --> 51:34.760
type stuff.

51:34.760 --> 51:37.520
And he researched sort of the history of it.

51:37.520 --> 51:46.840
And it stopped eventually, not because it became less useful, but because it was so harsh.

51:46.840 --> 51:53.000
Like the public view, the people who came to see the public shaming were so into it that

51:53.000 --> 51:55.320
it was embarrassing to the authorities.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.520
That's why they stopped doing it, not because it didn't work.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.400
So I have a mini example of this.

51:59.400 --> 52:04.760
I lived with a six year old daughter and 10 year old son in rural India for a year and

52:04.760 --> 52:08.280
they went to a local convent school.

52:08.280 --> 52:14.440
And one day my son said to my wife, I don't want to go to school today.

52:14.440 --> 52:15.440
And she explored it.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.680
Why didn't you want to go to school today?

52:17.680 --> 52:22.760
Because he had seen when you didn't do well on a math exam in that school, they pinned

52:22.760 --> 52:26.640
it to your back and you wore it all day long around the school.

52:26.640 --> 52:29.560
That was their technique for public shaming.

52:29.560 --> 52:32.120
Which, you know, it's a complicated thing.

52:32.120 --> 52:33.560
We can view that as harsh.

52:33.560 --> 52:37.880
He obviously was, we come from a subculture where we weren't going to let that happen.

52:37.880 --> 52:42.440
Nevertheless, internally, I'll bet those kids are all over the world doing really good math

52:42.440 --> 52:43.440
down.

52:43.440 --> 52:58.440
And Zimla has several books that are 25 years old that documents very clearly spare the

52:58.440 --> 53:02.160
rights, spare the rights for the child.

53:02.160 --> 53:07.160
Fundamentally, the theme to teach moral behavior.

53:07.160 --> 53:11.880
You teach, you will forgive me, that you were born in sin.

53:11.880 --> 53:21.240
Okay, and that's what we have in Christianity, the belief you are born in sin.

53:21.240 --> 53:28.080
It's a different form, but you come into the world with a long history of transgressions

53:28.080 --> 53:29.080
and friar lives.

53:29.080 --> 53:33.360
You're not innocent, blank slate.

53:33.360 --> 53:41.440
There will be there are techniques which, for the most part, we've given up as publicly

53:41.440 --> 53:44.800
acceptable, but in fact are employed.

53:44.800 --> 53:51.520
How many parents, if you watch them with their children and the child does something, switches

53:51.520 --> 53:59.240
up their nose, for those of you who can see my face, which is a semi-discussed face.

53:59.240 --> 54:02.240
That's disgusting.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.240
You're disgusting.

54:04.240 --> 54:10.680
Discussed is a very, very powerful shame-a-listener.

54:10.680 --> 54:14.400
And so we were talking about, and I wanted to hear you tie together what you believe is

54:14.400 --> 54:17.400
the connection between embarrassment and shame before you do.

54:17.400 --> 54:25.280
I just wanted to add this extra ingredient, which is these do all have biological rudiments.

54:25.280 --> 54:30.600
Like disgust, expression, the early stages of which embarrassment can be elicited in

54:30.600 --> 54:37.360
children, etc., suggest to me that these potential, I would say, components of shame start even

54:37.360 --> 54:39.160
on a very biological basis.

54:39.160 --> 54:43.680
Before they're co-opted by society and form shame.

54:43.680 --> 54:54.400
The study divorce in couples in trouble has pointed out that when one member of the couple

54:54.400 --> 55:01.320
exhibits a shame faced toward the other for some action or some statement, the consequence

55:01.320 --> 55:10.200
of that is either the one receiving the disgust face shows a depressive reaction or, in fact,

55:10.200 --> 55:14.960
gets angry back, you know, how dare you shame me.

55:14.960 --> 55:25.800
So clearly, we're going to have to worry about shame publicly, but also shame privately.

55:25.800 --> 55:33.800
But there's a shame between the same, which I'll, that's disgusting, and that's, you

55:33.800 --> 55:37.000
know, that's shameful or shaming the child.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.080
I think there's a significant difference between the two.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
Well, okay.

55:41.080 --> 55:46.720
You know, I think we have an issue with shame which says fear of being perceived as disgusting.

55:46.720 --> 55:47.720
That's actually what we'll be.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.720
Well, it depends on what we say.

55:49.720 --> 55:50.720
It's certainly.

55:50.720 --> 55:51.720
Don't eat that.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.720
That's disgusting.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.720
That's different from your disgusting.

55:53.720 --> 55:54.720
Yeah.

55:54.720 --> 56:00.200
It's a question of whether you should be ashamed of yourself.

56:00.200 --> 56:05.120
It doesn't seem to me to be as toxic as saying that you're disgusting.

56:05.120 --> 56:09.640
You're a disgusting person because a disgusting, that's very rejecting.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.640
Yes.

56:10.640 --> 56:11.640
Right.

56:11.640 --> 56:13.880
That's like, that's very distancing.

56:13.880 --> 56:17.640
Where in shame, there's always a bridge back.

56:17.640 --> 56:22.920
But how it's heard may defend may depend on the child to a degree.

56:22.920 --> 56:26.960
I would like to add something a bit different.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.200
I would like to add something a bit different because it is, from everything you are saying,

56:32.200 --> 56:39.800
the implication is that you become frequently ashamed because you have been shamed off

56:39.800 --> 56:42.520
and growing up.

56:42.520 --> 56:47.400
That's not necessarily, I don't think it's the experience of psychoanalysts and generally,

56:47.400 --> 56:49.600
certainly not my experience.

56:49.600 --> 56:54.480
Some people have more shame, some people have less shame and it's not based on to what

56:54.480 --> 56:59.480
degree their parents or their teachers or the school shamed them.

56:59.480 --> 57:04.920
Well, it seems to do and the psychoanalytic idea that has a lot more to do.

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
Sorry.

57:05.920 --> 57:11.800
You become victimized if you are repeatedly ashamed and becoming victimized means you

57:11.800 --> 57:13.000
become the victim.

57:13.000 --> 57:20.680
And so the report was that I really was shameful, not that my parent necessarily did that to

57:20.680 --> 57:21.680
me.

57:21.680 --> 57:29.680
Indeed, what I would like to say if we could do such an experiment is to say in a high

57:29.680 --> 57:37.120
shaming family, what does the child do when the child finally becomes in charge and the

57:37.120 --> 57:39.240
parents are now old?

57:39.240 --> 57:48.720
They don't talk about old people being abused but a sweet revenge to a lifetime of being

57:48.720 --> 57:51.080
ashamed.

57:51.080 --> 57:57.760
So I wanted to get back to Kathy's observation about the historical change that took place,

57:57.760 --> 58:03.000
let's say from the Massachusetts Bay Colony or 17th century Puritanism and its morality.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.800
Because I do think in some sense the cyber stocks are back right now and we're very much

58:08.800 --> 58:13.080
like that period once again given the technologies that we have.

58:13.080 --> 58:20.080
But I do feel that it's important to think about societies that liberate individuals

58:20.080 --> 58:24.520
from communal ethics of community type structures.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.920
And when that happens I think they begin to see those techniques as harsh even though

58:27.920 --> 58:29.360
they were effective.

58:29.360 --> 58:33.960
But here's a triad that think about the following three emotions.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.720
Happiness, shame and anger.

58:36.720 --> 58:40.200
And if I ask you which is most different from the other two?

58:40.200 --> 58:43.040
Happiness, shame, anger, which is the odd one out?

58:43.040 --> 58:49.120
If I do that in a University of Chicago class the response is either going to be happiness

58:49.120 --> 58:56.080
is the odd one out is most different or some people will say shame is the odd one out.

58:56.080 --> 59:00.440
And it's largely based on a hedonic view of the emotions.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.720
Does it feel good or doesn't?

59:01.720 --> 59:02.720
It feels good.

59:02.720 --> 59:09.920
It feels good to be happy, doesn't feel good to be shamed or angry.

59:09.920 --> 59:11.840
Let me finish.

59:11.840 --> 59:19.360
Some people say shame because they think that means the ego has been diminished whereas

59:19.360 --> 59:22.080
if you're happy and angry you're full of yourself.

59:22.080 --> 59:26.880
If I do this in the Indian community I work in the overwhelming response is anger is

59:26.880 --> 59:29.240
the most different from the other two.

59:29.240 --> 59:32.960
Which is a very rare response in our subculture.

59:32.960 --> 59:39.280
And for them shame and happiness are the glue of social relationships and anger is destructive

59:39.280 --> 59:41.400
of social relationships.

59:41.400 --> 59:44.000
And that's a totally different way of viewing it.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.120
And I think it has correlates in the way in which their society is organized on the

59:48.120 --> 59:54.520
degree to which individualism versus some form of collectivism is a part of the organization

59:54.520 --> 59:56.800
of social life.

59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.720
And that puts boundaries on a lot of the generalizations we make about whether something's useful

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.240
or not what our own evaluative reactions are to it and so forth.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:16.560
Let's come back to what's broadened if we can to bring in the other kinds of self-conscious

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:19.800
emotions which you were starting to do.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.880
Such as I've claimed that there are two kinds of embarrassment one is a very basic early

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.040
does not require elaborate cognition.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:37.840
The child shows it soon after it's thought using personal pronouns like me and mine and

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.480
that is an individual difference in their reaction to being the object of attention.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.320
That's easy to do an elaborate story setting.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:55.440
You bring the kid in and you start complimenting the child on how pretty they look or how handsome

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:03.120
the look or whatever you ask the child to do things like dance to or banging the tumeric

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:11.000
and what you see in the children being the object of attention they show embarrassment.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.440
About a year and a half later when you now start to incorporate the standards the rules

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:25.640
of the goals of your family and the society at large you now have another embarrassment

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.920
which is embarrassment against some kind of standard.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:41.160
I mean that starts to move us toward shame but I put to you that least in the sculpture

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:47.040
where we have two words if I ask you to tell me something that abasses you you would have

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:53.600
more readily willing to do it than if I asked you about something that changed you.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:59.440
This is not just intensity we also have the word humiliation which is a very intense form

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.960
of shame.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:10.720
Or mortification which as you mentioned earlier you're dying of shame.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.440
I mean I think people experience embarrassment of some kind or another every day on a mild

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.440
form.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.640
Sure but there are certain things that really define you okay so if someone says Michael

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.400
your parallel parking is really atrocious.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:36.240
I may not like it I may feel yeah you're right I'm going backwards it's become more

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.400
difficult as I've aged.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:55.840
But if they said Gee your last book is absolutely horrible it would elicit more embarrassment

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.240
of shame with a bad reveal.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.520
So clearly there are different aspects of ourselves which are more important.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:10.560
I'm going to if you guys don't mind layer on one more layer to this conversation which

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.440
I'm fascinated thinking about because I we've talked a lot about the individual experience

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:19.680
of shame you've talked a little bit about norms within a culture and how that changes

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.680
it.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.200
I want to talk about group shame.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:30.240
Group shame and I'll just throw out an example the Catholic church.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.640
You know remember I talked about the phases of shame.

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.880
You're sitting in the shame there is outrage and denial of the shame then there's facing

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:43.920
the facts and then they're saying stepping outside and saying this is this is what happens.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.280
You know I'm just going to throw that out the pope came out and he started talking about

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.480
oh you know sexual abuse of children is a terrible thing it's really terrible isn't

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.080
a terrible.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:58.120
He didn't actually say this is what happened in the church this is what we're going to

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.120
do about it.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.560
He never really cleaned house.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.040
He never really went through stage three.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:09.320
He kind of jumped to stage four like you can all forgive me this is an apology quote unquote

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.040
of course I'm putting my take on it.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:18.440
But my point is that I want to talk about how groups inhabit shame how they get outraged

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.840
by accusations and how they come to see the truth see face their own facts clean their

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:24.840
own house.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:29.760
How do they how do they navigate shame as groups.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.360
Well did they navigate shame was only when we told them you should have felt shame about

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.600
this then they thought oh yes we did something shameful and possibly didn't.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:44.720
See individual let me give you another example there's a very widespread habit in this country

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.720
of shaming children when they don't have enough school lunch money and what will happen is

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.840
that the children will either not be fed they will just be not fed at school or their lunch

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.480
will be thrown away in front of them and they sometimes even get branded on their arm.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.080
I don't have enough lunch money.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:07.880
The individuals who work at the lunchrooms sometimes refuse to do this policy and they

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.760
get fired.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:16.680
So I'm not claiming that I think of that as a sort of systemic shame if you will it is

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.160
created as a policy and it is perpetrated by groups not every single individual in the

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.240
group has to agree with it as a policy because they might actually find it to shaming.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.120
But for that matter I mean obviously lots of priests were doing terrible things but not

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.720
every priest thought that was a good idea.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:40.360
Like we can't assume that it was like a unified attempt right but at the same time it is a

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.560
group thing.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.760
It is a sort of a group navigation led by the Pope perhaps but like what is happening

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.000
there and when are we going to actually see them get to stage three cleaning house tell

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.760
us what the consequences are cleaning up their act.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.920
And who is it the same process as for an individual?

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920
That's what I'm saying.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920
Yes.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:10.120
I mean you know the thing about it that is it's good news and bad news is good news because

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.720
we kind of understand it.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:18.900
It's bad news because well I feel like I'm in stage four with gay shit bashing or fat

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.360
shaming or race shaming.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:27.280
But I can't be in charge of everyone like how do we get the rest of you know how do

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.120
we pull people in this direction?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.800
This is why you're moving toward something.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800
Yeah.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.120
What are you moving toward?

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120
An understanding.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.920
Understanding of what?

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.760
Well see the examples I just gave are all in the first category.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.440
You were talking about stages.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.440
Yeah.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.560
Tell me about stages because I don't know what that means.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:57.320
Stages reflect a sequence where either accommodation, biology, culture or culture or biology.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:04.080
So are you talking about a level of notion?

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.800
I don't think so.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.800
But maybe you are.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.960
What progress amount to and what is the difference?

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.480
I have all chapter in the shame book on this problem of progress.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.160
What is progress?

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.000
What is progress?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.480
So what is the ideal?

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.080
Let me put it this way.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.920
Tell me from your perspective what the ideal society would be.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.160
Wouldn't there be shame in it?

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.920
There would not be punching down shame.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:39.880
So I was going to say that the examples I gave sexual abuse shaming people for being

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.440
poor, shaming children for being not having school lunch money, gay bashing.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:51.400
Those examples are examples of punching down shame which I claim exist quite a lot.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.000
There's a lot of power being maintained around punching down shame.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.080
There's a lot of profit being made from punching down shame and I would call it invalid shame.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:03.440
And the idea of progress would be to get past it.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.240
And that would require that people who are shame by it say no.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240
No, it's not acceptable.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.080
When you do those things.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:16.120
If you get those things that people are doing, just punch down.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:21.600
I characterize punching down shame as when you are shaming someone who has no choice,

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.400
who has either no choice or no voice.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.480
So they either have no choice to conform to the norm or they have no power to explain

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:29.480
themselves.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:31.040
So how's the lunch money work?

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.240
I don't quite have a picture of that as a shame.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.240
Yeah.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.720
You've never heard of that?

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720
No.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.520
It happens in more than half the school districts in this country.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520
Really?

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.080
I mean, why is it shaming?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.560
What form does it take?

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560
What's said?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560
What?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.560
You are refused.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.040
You did not give in food?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.720
Okay, that's the number one.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.720
You're not given food.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720
You're deprived of food.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.440
You're considered, you're basically labeled as unworthy of food.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.040
It is the most basic form of shaming.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.320
And they are branded and you are, it's public.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:02.000
It is like, hey, your parents didn't pay for food.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.400
You're not going to get food.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.040
Everybody knows it in the school lunch.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.920
Even if they can't afford to give the money.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.280
Of course, it's their children.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.440
I mean, just to be clear, this is children.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.120
It's their parents that are supposed to pay.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.560
Do they have no power?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560
Yes, right.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.560
Yes, exactly.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.760
I would love to know a source for half the school system.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.600
Okay, I'll give it to you.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.600
Well, that's hard to believe.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.080
It is hard to believe.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.880
It's outrageous, actually.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:46.160
The optimist, the terrible man that people are capable of perpetuating is not surprising.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:54.200
So whether we want to call it up or down, punching, which is fine, it's a way of attacks

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.960
out of me.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.360
He applied, there's a good shame or a bad shame.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:10.400
If my child comes back with a paper or something they've done and they've not done well, what

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:17.080
are you going to tell parents or the tiger moms as they're called?

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.520
You shouldn't be doing that.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:28.080
I mean, how can we disagree with people doing these things to children?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.960
I mean, this can't be a New York.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.560
There are laws against the child abuse.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.120
So I think we can disagree about certain things.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.160
But specifically about shame.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.000
You mentioned that you were fat-chained.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Yeah.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:50.320
Does that mean that you are more prone to shame as a result of that?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.320
Or does that mean that you are no more prone to shame than anybody else?

01:10:55.320 --> 01:11:02.120
In other words, is the implication that that kind of shaming leaves rather serious marks

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:05.600
on the person that is indelible?

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.800
Or is it that some people react one way, some people, kids react one way, some kids react

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.640
the other way and some grow up without much shaming by anybody and they have more prone

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.840
to shame and some don't?

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840
That's a good question.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.600
I mean, my parents shame me, I think, because they were fat.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.600
So they were sort of propagating a certain type of shame onto me.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.720
I have not done that to my children.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.560
But that's because I've thought a lot about it.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.440
You know, like I went through these stages I'm trying to describe.

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:42.400
That's one of the reasons I came up with this taxonomy of shame is to understand when is

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.480
it unfair, when is it possible to ask for it?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.760
Are you yourself more prone to shame than, let's say, your husband or your kids?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.640
I think I'm more aware of my shame.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640
More aware.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640
But not more prone.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.200
In other words, you don't more easily than somebody else.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.680
I would like to hear what instead of a, I'm going to put it back to you.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:00.680
I don't know.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:09.360
I'm only asking because it seems to me from my perspective and my experience, the kind

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:18.480
of outside shaming is not what often or necessarily leads to a promise to shame later.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:25.120
But rather certain developments in the strength of the person's self, in their self-esteem,

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.760
in their view of themselves is what contributes to how they feel later.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760
Interesting.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.760
Let me support that.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:38.640
It's another life work in pediatrics.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.360
And we've been doing a study, the Fellows.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.960
We have a fellowship program and I'm in charge of the research.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:54.400
And there is a fellow who is studying the siblings of children who have ASD, who are

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.120
autistic on the spectrum.

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:09.080
And the idea being what does a sibling feel about having a sibling who is demonstrably

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:12.280
different?

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:21.400
And the interesting fondness so far is that there are a good number of the people who

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:29.760
end up taking care of handicapped kids or kids with disabilities are, in fact, from

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:38.440
families from which they had a close number, as well as just the opposite.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:47.240
So that indeed supporting what you're saying, that in fact an experience can have very different

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240
consequence.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.440
One is a social good.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:56.560
There are people committed to working with these children who, until now, we don't have

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:05.560
much resource to improve, but they are working with them versus those who probably develop

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:11.040
a, I get it and if you don't do what you are, you know.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040
This is temperamental difference.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.600
People are born with different, comfortable or more resilient.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.480
I think they're born out of it, right?

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.360
Other people are more fragile.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:30.920
But you know, after spending 40 years at a medical school, my thoughts about the biology

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.920
of our bodies.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:38.200
You know, we're not all the same temperament, however we may conceive of it.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.040
There are different things.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:48.160
My son and daughter are 50 years old when they were babies and I would, you know, toss

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.400
them up and prove them in the air.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:57.480
But you know, just the girl baby, the younger, she loved it.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:05.320
And she loves the rough and tumble, she goes in short cages and in cages protecting you

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:11.840
from my son who was in terror of it.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:21.000
In fact, I want to try to get my mind around you are questioned about groups and how do

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
they react.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.320
And I guess I need some clarification because when you say how does a group deal with its

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320
own shame?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.320
Yes.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.200
Do you mean they have in fact done something which everyone would agree is shameful or

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.840
do you mean they have been shamed by some powerful group telling them to do what they're

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.840
doing is shameful.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.680
So for example, we have many examples in colonial domination situations.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.040
Let's say you believe the West is best and its view of gender relations, its view of

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.520
XYZ is closer to the truth than those primitives or backward peoples of the world.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.920
And you start going and dominating those groups and telling them that what they're doing with

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.640
regard to gender relations, how they raise their children, all this is shameful.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.640
Now is that the kind of question we're dealing with?

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.040
How do those groups then react?

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:14.480
As we know that some groups identify with the colonials and quickly become colonialized.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.280
We know other groups have rebellions against it and have all sorts of resistance.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.800
We have revival movements that go on.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.240
But these are power dynamics that are very different from the way you framed it.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.200
We framed it with examples in which you're inviting us all to agree that's shameful what

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.200
they did.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.000
Not that some group is shaming another group from its power position and those are very

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.920
different situations.

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.960
And I'm just wondering what you would have.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.760
After you answer, we will go to questions.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.760
Okay, great.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.960
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a great question.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:52.200
And I'm not sure I was scrupulously careful about the examples, but what I really want

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.800
to focus on is changing norms, probably is the best way of saying it.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.920
And maybe a good example in that context is the Me Too movement.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.160
So the Me Too movement is a movement because we are changing our norms.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.160
We never actually thought it was okay to assault women.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.440
We never thought that.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.000
But the norm was that the women kept quiet.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.880
The norm has changed.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:23.000
And now there's a lot of group shame among the men who now feel like, oh, what I used

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
to be doing was inappropriate.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.360
That's an example of group shame.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.960
And I'm not saying they're all actually feeling like I should feel ashamed.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.360
Some of them are outraged that these norms have changed under their feet.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.520
And how dare that norm changed?

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.840
I was perfectly comfortable and now I'm a bad guy.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.840
So that is, but it's a group, nor a group shaming.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.120
And my theory is that it goes through the stages of shame similar to the way I laid

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120
them out.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.760
And I might be wrong about that.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.400
I don't mind being wrong.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.960
Just because I'm a mathematician, I'm trained to just be happy to be wrong.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.960
I love shame.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.640
If you can explain, yeah, it's actually one of those one of those freeing things as a

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.680
mathematician is that you say something and someone says you're wrong.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.280
You're like, thanks for not like I won't waste my time on it.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.440
But it's useful even if it's wrong, I believe, to understand group shame as an evolution

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.800
through stages similar to the individual.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.320
Okay, we'll go for questions.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.720
So there is the mic and go to it.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.880
The mic works now?

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:29.960
I hope it works now.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:45.360
It was very, very interesting here today listening to everybody.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:52.280
Some of the things that we did not talk about today, what about people like we, everybody

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:58.040
knows Martha Stewart, who was incarcerated for a period of time.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:05.880
She was shamed and then she was released from jail and Martha Stewart just picked up right

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:10.800
from where she left off and she's on TV and she's selling her merchandise.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:19.000
And just recently we have Anthony Wiener, who was in some sort of a halfway house for

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.480
pornography and all that.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:27.920
Now he was just, Anthony Wiener was released and he's thinking about going into politics

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.840
again so I'm just using a couple of extreme examples that we did not talk about today.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840
Thank you.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:35.840
Who wants to respond?

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:38.440
Sounds like you're proposing banishment.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:57.080
I mean part of the problem is that shame is I think it fits with the change in empathy.

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:05.040
By the way, a rules manner is, we haven't gotten to which would be a very important part of

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.920
the discussion.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:16.720
The idea of letting it all hang out as opposed to a rules governing our behavior.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.360
So you write a thank you note for dinner whether you liked it or not.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:31.080
And now that it would be called lying and so the whole issue and the change in social

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:39.400
protecting the feelings of others have given way to be authentic and indeed the election

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:45.280
really hinged on the fact that even though he was a terrible man, he was at least authentic

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.320
where she was inauthentic and so is.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:21:01.120
So the fact is that we're allowed, we have no shame about being shame is in fact what's

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120
occurring.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120
Okay.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:10.680
Yeah, I just wanted to comment on individual versus institutional shame.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:16.240
You brought up the example of the Catholic church and why hasn't the pope felt more

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.440
shame.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:22.120
Questions make political and financial decisions.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.960
They can't be shamed the way individuals are.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.320
But my question is to the professor, I see some agreement here.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:37.240
My question is to the professional psychologists among you.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:44.360
And this concerns the most prominent shamer, the shamer in chief.

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:52.480
You feel that this is more strategic and purposeful than he's given credit for or on the other

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.560
end of the spectrum.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.560
Does he suffer from a pathology?

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:10.000
Well, 40, 45, 40% of the people believe that he has done nothing wrong.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.880
That is to say we're back to facts, even though you can demonstrate that he says he

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:23.840
hasn't said something and you have a tape of him saying that he would just call it fake

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.000
news.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.960
So one of the things that narcissists can do is that they change the rules, the normative

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.080
behavior.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:42.280
So while on you're having now a man who did things that they shouldn't have done and

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:49.680
now feel a movement to get them to feel there is also this movement and there's nothing

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.240
to be ashamed about.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.640
You can make norms.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.880
You can go any way you want.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:07.080
You know, under or behind masked by his behaviors, which are defensive mechanisms, is toxic

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080
shame.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080
Right?

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:16.040
If you read anything about his upbringing, his background, he has massive shame, humiliation.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:20.120
These are all as narcissism almost always is.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.080
I have a paper that says defense of mechanism.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080
He is wanting a band.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.560
He avoids, he attacks.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560
Those are his two.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.760
Well, the device in my studio.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.400
Shame is so intolerable to him.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:33.400
Absolutely.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.120
That changes the laws.

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.120
No changes, facts.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.120
He changes the laws.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.040
But you mentioned earlier, it claims others.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.560
You know, both of you had talked about the idea, the idea of, I don't think he's aware

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.560
that he has, I don't think he'd ever admit or is aware that that's why he's doing it.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.560
So then it's a pathology.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.560
It's a pathology.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.560
Yeah.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.560
Exactly.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.560
It's a pathology.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:01.080
You both talked about anger as being a reaction to be accused, to be shamed by others to respond

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.080
with anger.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:09.320
And I think you very wisely, Kathy, especially mentioned that in this purposeless shaming,

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.400
I think one of the reactions of the parties that are shamed is they get angry.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.760
And unfortunately they get mobilized.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:21.240
This is what this shame, shame, or in chief relies on that if you try to shame me and

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.080
I don't want to accept it, I'm going to get angry with you out there, you try to shame

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:26.080
me.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.120
And that mobilizes a lot of the populace.

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.320
I think I'm going to go back to that.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.320
Okay.

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320
Next question.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.240
So I just want to get back to, it's not my fault, first of all my question, but to you

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:47.960
would be to please elaborate on why you stated that men usually say it's not my fault more

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.200
than women.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.520
But before you answer that, in terms of it's not my fault, I've always been under the

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:03.520
impression that a person that cannot take criticism or it's not my fault, they say that

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:11.240
because they've been criticized quite a lot either by their parents or so I don't know

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:17.800
if that has anything to do with it's not my fault, that defensive mechanism, but that

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.680
goes into not being able to even take criticism.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:28.160
I didn't do it, it's not my fault and it's very pathological if you, so the question

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.560
though really is why men were than women.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560
Okay.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.720
I understand why that's important.

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:41.720
If you win the lottery, you don't feel proud, you feel very happy because it's a chance

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.200
you didn't cause it.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.120
Although some people will say I went to a particular store and I knew that that was,

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:55.200
so they give themselves causality and they can feel pride because it's negotiable here.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:06.360
So winning the lottery and event, you don't, most people do not feel proud of winning

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.240
the lottery because it's a chance it has nothing to do with you causing it.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:20.000
So believing that you cause it or not cause it is a very good mechanism to move you around

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.200
the self-conscious emotion.

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:30.440
If it's not my fault, then I can feel anything I want that's appropriate and so you can manipulate

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.960
it's not my fault so I'll do some manipulation.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.840
Now the sex difference.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:44.280
There are many explanations, there are data in which you can look at when parents are teaching

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:51.600
children in the laboratory tasks to do and the child doesn't succeed.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.520
What does the parent say?

01:26:54.520 --> 01:27:02.680
And it turns out that parents make these performance or global attributions more to girls than they

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.600
do to boys.

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.280
That is to say when the child is supposed to be able to do a puzzle and the child can't

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:18.320
do it and you listen to what the child says.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.440
A parent could say on the extremes, oh you're so stupid.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.440
Why don't you get that?

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.200
Parents say these things.

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:29.880
Or they could say it's a very hard problem.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.400
Why don't you try and get and give them a strategy.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:41.280
It turns out that giving strategies rather than making global attributions are more likely

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:48.560
for mothers now to give this to the boy child than to give it to the girl child.

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.560
Why?

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:56.040
I don't know why it is but I can only tell you what we think may be going on.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.200
But let me give you another one.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.080
I really think it's another reason.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:08.120
I think girls are much more, that is the woman kind, are much more concerned about their

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.480
bodies than men.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.600
I don't know how broad it is.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:19.920
I can say that in most cultures that I've been to, if it's a more formal occasion, the

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.440
women are better dressed than the men.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.760
The only place that might not be true is Italy.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.760
In India it's certainly my...

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760
I don't get them aside.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.400
It's not always true.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.880
It is not always true.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:45.200
But indeed the attending to the body is a necessity given that menstruation, which an

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.760
adolescent starts with, you have to be concerned with your body.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.920
Men don't go, don't have that concern.

01:28:52.920 --> 01:29:01.560
In the research of pre-attolescent, you ask boys, what do you feel about the fleshiness

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.120
under your arm or the thickness of your thighs?

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.720
And a nine-year-old boy, they don't have anything to say about it.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.240
They never thought about it.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:18.680
And nine-year-old girls are already telling you, oh, I think this is too much and so there

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.720
is a concern for the body.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:23.160
So the question is why is that?

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.480
One solution women have said that the object, sexual objects, for men, and so they become

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:29.480
objectified.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:32.680
That's a reasonable hypothesis.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680
But an alternative one...

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.040
Where does that stop my fault, Link?

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.240
How's that link to that?

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.240
Okay.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.240
It's...

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:45.480
If you attend more to yourself and that's where temperament would come in, if there's

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:52.480
more information that you are deriving out of your body sense, that information is more

01:29:52.480 --> 01:30:01.800
likely to make you think about yourself and therefore more likely to move toward the attributions.

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:06.000
If something went wrong, I'd like to comment just on your question.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.600
I would like to add to this a little bit.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.000
Martha Stewart, was that your example?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
No.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Whose example is that?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.560
Martha Stewart, she never would have been prosecuted if she were a man doing exactly

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.760
what she did.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.680
It's the expectations of society that villainized her in the first place.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:24.320
Good for her for going back to work.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.760
That's what I say.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:32.920
I would also like to keep an eye on the Trump officials that get blamed for their terrible

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:39.040
behavior as Trump officials like Kirsten Nielsen and Sarah Sanders.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.120
What about all the guys?

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:50.400
When we accuse women and we shame women, it much more often and much more than we ashamed

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.400
men.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:58.440
I say that as a person who's written journalistic essays for Bloomberg, I get unbelievable

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:02.160
hate from the commenters as a woman.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.000
Just unbelievable.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It is completely documented.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.880
I'm just saying it is socialized to a large extent.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.000
And of course, one last thing, dieting.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Guess who diets?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Girls.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Guess why?

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
They're told to diet.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.240
It's by their parents.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.840
So it's very, very good data that this is socialized.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.400
The Justice Department doesn't like it when people lie to public officials.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:32.800
And Martha Stewart was not sent to jail because of the inside of trading accusation.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:38.240
Inside of trading itself is a very complicated area and it's gone through lots of changes.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:44.080
But when you lie, when you're being interrogated by the FBI, they don't look at your gender.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.080
That's like a fundamental principle for them, whether you like it or not.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.280
I don't like it.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.280
I don't like it.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.720
I agree with you about Martha Stewart good for you.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.560
And I think it was unfair to just nail her on the procedural thing.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.200
But they do that all the time and they do it to men and women.

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.720
I have a somewhat different view than Mike.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:07.400
I would be really skeptical of a generalization of that gender in this area because I think

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:14.520
a really fundamental principle of action is the premise that all human beings have is

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:19.080
that there's a relationship between action and outcome.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.680
I might.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.280
I swing an axe.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.960
Something happens.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:28.720
Everyday life is built on the fundamental premise of a relationship between action and

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.720
outcome.

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.280
And that's the default.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280
That's where you start.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.880
If you're going to move away from it, there are special cases in which you might have a

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.120
conception of something, the world being simply a lottery.

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:41.120
It's a horrible notion.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.640
If you really think about it that way because you're losing control of your life.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.000
It's if it's that way.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.160
And the relationship of action and outcome has all sorts of manifestations for men and

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160
women.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.280
And I would bet you can find areas where men might be one way and women and other and

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.760
just the opposite in some other domain.

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:02.280
But I'd really be surprised if the most fundamental premise was what you're at.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.240
What you do has consequences and you're responsible for it.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:13.120
In my limited experience, because it's only from within my office, it's not based on

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.600
extensive research.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:20.320
But in my experience, I do not see a distinction.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:27.840
But what I do see is that the harder the person is on themselves, the more they're tempted

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:32.000
to say it's not my fault when they're confronted with something.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.880
The more the person is willing to accept that they've done something wrong, the less they

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.560
are willing, they need to say, oh no, it's not my fault.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:52.360
That's a complicated question because it involves all sorts of developmental issues.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360
Yeah.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:54.360
Yeah.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.320
Thank you.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.760
I'm overcoming my public speaking shame by doing this.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.240
That's what I hear of something.

01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.240
Thank you.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.240
Good job.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.400
Thank you.

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:10.600
My question is I always thought of guilt as being almost like the introjected parental

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:17.520
figure telling us what to do and shame more as being part of the death drive as aggression

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.240
towards ourselves.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:24.600
So I think that in my own opinion, to get over shame, we can sublimate that aggression

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:33.560
outwards into more socially acceptable and positive ways, what are your views on that?

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:39.040
I would recommend that everyone go back and see the movie Four Feathers Done by Corda.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:46.000
And the movie Four Feathers Done in the 1930s in which you were in a military family in England

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.760
and they're going off to the Sudan to fight.

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.800
And one of the buddies decides he's not going to go.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.320
And the Four Feathers are the feathers that you receive being accused of being a coward.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:04.560
In this case by his fiance and his buddies and the rest of the movie is about his attempt

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:13.040
to do incredible things of courage to be accepted back into this, having been shamed so powerfully.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:19.960
And that seems to me as a kind of typification of how shame works in a society that has statuses,

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.600
has clear goals, has notions of the good.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:30.080
And when you fall out of it and you are called on it, it's an incredibly powerful set of

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.280
motivations that go on.

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:38.920
And the movie is well worth seeing if you want to see, let's call it the pre-modern view

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.960
of how this whole thing operates.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.880
And it doesn't fit that definition.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:54.000
A friend of mine last night told me, which has some truth in it, that guilt is an afterthought.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.040
Guilt is an afterthought.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.400
Is that you commit the act and then you say, oh, I feel terrible about it.

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:03.520
It rarely starts you from committing the act.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.880
It seems to me shame is a basic, is one of the emotions we have.

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:11.160
We have love, we have shame, we have all those things.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.200
So I don't think that's anything to do with that drive or anything.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.560
It's just an emotion that humans have.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.120
And I guess some animals are.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:27.320
Which I tend to think of guilt and regret as having some spatial connection because the

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:43.840
focus is on how to correct the wrong, whereas in shame, the self is attacked, thus very powerful.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:54.720
So I think that definition, that distinction is probably one from a behavioral point of

01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.160
view and also from a general theoretical point of view, that kind of distinction is worth

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.160
having.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:08.200
But isn't guilt simply moral shame, immorality shame, plus fear because guilt involves fear

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.000
of punishment too.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Well, I guess so.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.360
I mean, there's a lot of words.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.840
I'm not quite sure what they mean.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:19.640
I think in fact that-

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.800
It means that you've made moral transgressions.

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:32.080
There is a vast literature of which I'm not much of a part of, which in fact looks at whether

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:44.360
when it's around achievement, but it's very relevant, is you can look at your performance

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:57.080
or you can look at the task, for example, Carol Dweck has made a very big, a whole career

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.160
based on this distinction.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.800
I can focus and say, gee, I'll give you a perfect example.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.480
You write a paper and you send the paper into a journal.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.240
These are the kind of activities I do.

01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:21.000
And back comes the paper and it's rejected and there's a whole set of criticisms.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:29.240
I can do one of two things depending on what it elicits in me, this failure.

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:36.400
I can look at what they criticized and focus upon that.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:43.280
This will cause me a set of actions to try to repair or save the paper.

01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:53.080
If in fact the result is a damaged self, I put it in a drawer and I forget about it.

01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:59.840
And when you work with graduate students and fellows in medicine, one of the things to

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:06.320
try to teach them and is teachable, that's interesting, from a therapeutic point of view

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:12.880
is in fact, I don't want to hear about you, what allows you, scientist, you are, I want

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:20.920
you to go home and I want you to list each criticism separately and write some response.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.320
Do I have to do another analysis?

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.680
Do I need to read more?

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:34.920
Focusing them on the task gets them to stay in the game and try to correct the failure.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:41.640
If in turn you think you're a lousy scientist, you won't want to forget it.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:51.200
One way of coping with that shape is to forget it and so you put it in a drawer and exactly

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:52.200
what you say then.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:59.160
And in fact, you want a mechanism that stops you in your tracks.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:08.000
It is sufficient that you can't do this except a great cost to yourself, a steam if you like.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:17.400
Whereas in guilt, you fundamentally want to repair it and you can actually see it in

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.400
behavior.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.160
You can see that these children.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.080
But you want to repair it in shame too.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.120
The example I gave of doing something in a program.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.120
If you do something in a social context, it's inappropriate.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.120
No, you don't.

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.680
You shame yourself.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:34.680
In fact, one of the problems.

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:35.920
And you want to repair it.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:41.640
You want to go and say, I'm so sorry, I behaved so, I don't know.

01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640
Anytime.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.640
That's also representative.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:47.480
Okay, let's go to the next question.

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:51.400
I'm also facing my public shame here.

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.920
But my question is something that hasn't been discussed here.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.920
So I read in this book that shame is one of the main pillars of loneliness.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.040
So what do you guys think about that?

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.840
I just want to understand from your loneliness.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.760
You know, I'm going to jump in and tell you how I understand shame and this is through

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.920
a lot of reading.

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:14.920
It's not my definition.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.440
And I'm trying to remember the person's name whose book is from.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:23.200
But it's this idea of a disintegration of self that you basically have this connection with

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.920
your caretaker, when you're a child.

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:28.560
And it's a good feeling.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.080
And then at some point they are disappointed in you.

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:32.280
They shame you.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.600
And it feels like you do not have a self.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:42.440
And you're so desperate to get back into that connection that you literally do anything.

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:46.440
And if you can't get back into that connection, you feel completely floating.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.440
You feel disintegrated.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:51.600
Like you do not have a connection to your mother or whatever.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.880
And that, I mean, of course, that elicits loneliness.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:57.720
So I think there's a very strong connection with that definition of shame, which might

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:02.520
not maybe isn't the only one, but that definition of shame is is loneliness.

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:07.160
It is in fact the definition of being alone when you're disconnected from everything else.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:14.160
Some feelings are shameful.

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:21.240
And so you can be ashamed of being guilty, but you can't be guilty about being ashamed.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:24.680
And you can be ashamed about being lonely.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.080
Now the question is, if you feel lonely, can you be ashamed?

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:30.680
Thank you.

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:41.920
So clearly, if you are believed that you should be part of a social group, there are people

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:49.240
who are interestingly, who don't have a lot of social interaction, much prefer to be on

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.360
their computer than to go to a party.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:59.360
So on that loneliness may not be shameful because they don't have a value that they

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.360
should be socially integrated.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:10.960
And Asperger is a perfect indication because part of the Asperger personality is in fact

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.040
they're interested in things more than people.

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:19.640
Okay, last question.

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:26.520
I am wondering about the relationship between shame and the stability of a society.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:32.320
Because it seems to me that in very, very stable societies, whether it's a family or

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:42.080
a larger society like our nation, shame is sometimes weaponized when the society changes.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:47.200
And perhaps it's a function of fear, of the change.

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:56.520
And shame is used whether to put down a racial group or women or to impose certain standards.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:03.280
These things really ramp up when the society is changing, really to maintain the stability

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.720
of the society.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.600
So it's almost a political weapon.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:13.280
Yeah, I'm going to echo you that I think we can look at our society and see that norms

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.040
are changing very, very quickly.

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.320
And I would even argue that people think they're changing faster than they actually are changing

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.680
because we have this artificial sense of accomplishment on social media when it looks like in our

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:31.400
tiny little corner of Facebook that we all agree that such and such is true.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.640
And in fact, it's a very small corner of Facebook.

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:39.760
I think we actually are being misled by our intuitions around social norms.

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.120
And we think things are changing faster.

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:49.120
But that goes to your point, which is that if some people think the norm is now, you

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:53.960
have to ask three times before having sex with someone and other people think, no, you

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.040
don't even have to ask.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:00.040
It's not surprising that conflict emerges.

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:06.280
And when conflict about what we thought we already knew about norms, that is right for

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.280
shame.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.560
That is what shame is for.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.440
Shame is for coercing people into the norm.

01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.440
So if they got it wrong, actually 95% of people are getting it wrong.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.400
What the fuck is wrong with these people?

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.720
It's because we actually think we've accomplished more norm changing than we have.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.840
And that's what's happening right now.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:29.800
And we have, I think you made the point, one of the norms that we're seeing change is the

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.240
idea of being authentic rather than factual, right?

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.640
Or honest.

01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:40.560
That is itself a norm that is ripe for shaming, because it's exactly the point.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.840
The point of that norm is that people who follow that norm, who are in that norm group,

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.760
are exactly the people that are going to be shamed by people who are like, no, we haven't

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.840
agreed to that change in the norms, right?

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.040
You are actually supposed to be an honest person, not a shameless person.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.920
So there's so much going on right now.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.680
It's chaos, honestly, with respect to changing norms.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:08.840
When there's chaos with changing norms, there is an uptick, if not an explosion of shame.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.840
Yeah.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.360
Yeah, well, this is off the top of my head, but I think it makes sense to think about the

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:19.320
balance between the private and the public in societies.

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.520
And when you're thinking about social change, there needs to be some kind of balance between

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.680
those two.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:29.840
The domain of the private is a way in which you can't be shamed, because what you're

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:35.480
doing with people who you're close to or intimate with, or you know trust you, is not

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:38.520
something you would necessarily do with anybody.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:44.200
And now what's happened is the anybodies of the world are in that private domain, exposing

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.200
it.

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.640
And now your reputation, your career is affected because of something you happen to say in

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:54.280
private that someone was able to eavesdrop on or leak.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.840
So basically our leaks, and this is with the irony of our free press, because our free

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.720
press are a bunch of snoops.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.440
They're trying to dig into the private realm all the time.

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:08.200
They're encouraging people to leak information, which would normally be in an insula area

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.840
where you couldn't be shamed and they're shaming all sorts of people.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:19.360
And I think the MeToo movement, in fact, has brought us back to the 17th century.

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:21.080
For stocks, that's why I use that notion.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.040
We have the stocks going all the time now.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.800
I don't think it's healthy for our society.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:31.040
And to the extent we continue to erode the private domain, it's an area where creativity

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.960
can go on, transgressive experimentation can take place in miniature.

01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:38.800
Some of that stuff is truly loathsome.

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.520
Others ends up being creative stuff that then filters out more broadly into the society.

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:46.320
I think that's a correct.

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.280
I think that's a commonality and that idea.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.960
But I think there's another thing.

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:55.000
There is the idea of happiness.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.960
We haven't gotten to happiness.

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.640
It was interesting that you brought it up as one of the best.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.280
I have to tell you the story.

01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.800
So I think I mentioned my father was born in the 19th century.

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:13.360
So I mean in the 20th century, at the beginning of the 20th century.

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:20.040
And he believed that if you did something well, you would be happy.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:27.480
And we now believe if you are happy, you will do something well.

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:34.080
Focus has moved, which is part of the self-focus on our happiness.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:44.080
So in another round table, the discussion of happiness, and there's some wonderful books

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:52.240
of how searching for happiness is made as miserable is really the theme.

01:48:52.240 --> 01:49:04.000
So not only are some of the changes in technology, which supports some of this, namely, I want

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.600
to walk down, I live in the village.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.960
I walk down the streets and I'm a little old man.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:17.360
And a big towering person is walking toward me, reading their phone.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.080
And I have to say, excuse me, or he's going to run me down.

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:28.840
And if we said, oh, well, we used to have people walk down the street reading books.

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.280
That was not the case.

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.880
People didn't walk down the street reading books.

01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:33.880
What?

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:36.720
Making a joke.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:49.840
So I think there is a shift to this happiness, to this idea that the self deserves certain

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.840
things.

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:59.080
And I think it's in part why there's a decline in empathy and indeed a rise in narcissism.

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.720
We have done, by the way, a round table on happiness.

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.160
But thank you very much.

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:12.560
We'd be happy to do it again.

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:38.640
Alludeah33.
