00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Hey everyone, this is our last roundtable of the day, but it is by no means the least exciting,

00:06.400 --> 00:10.320
because STEAM education encapsulates so much of what we're talking about.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.200
And we started talking about STEAM this morning. I know that feels like a long time ago, it does to me.

00:16.480 --> 00:22.720
This morning we talked about polymathi, we talked about transdisciplinary groups as the kind of

00:22.720 --> 00:29.280
new version of Leonardo. What are we trying to do when we teach people STEAM? What are the ways

00:29.280 --> 00:36.720
that STEAM gets realized either in the nonprofit sector or in education in K through 12 versus

00:36.720 --> 00:41.920
college? What are these people going to grow up to be like? So these are the questions that we

00:41.920 --> 00:47.520
start talking about this morning. We have a very good group of people here who have very vastly

00:47.520 --> 00:53.600
different experience from teaching for a couple of years to teaching for 45 years. So there's a

00:53.600 --> 00:59.360
lot of wisdom to be found here. I will let Zach as usual introduce the panel and then we'll get started.

01:04.400 --> 01:14.240
Harvey Seifter. Harvey is founder and director of the art of science learning AOSL. He has taught

01:14.240 --> 01:20.320
innovation at GE's Croughtonville Global Leadership Development Center. He is also a classically

01:20.320 --> 01:26.480
trained musician and has provided his leadership in works with numerous award-winning musical

01:26.480 --> 01:35.040
productions. Jill Barganetti. Jill is a professor at Hunter College and CUNY Graduate Center.

01:35.040 --> 01:41.200
She has received an NSF Career Award and Presidential Early Career Award for scientists.

01:41.200 --> 01:49.680
She is also a standing member on the NIH Tumor Cell Biology Study section. She also is a choreographer

01:49.680 --> 01:56.640
who has developed a class choreographing genomics which focuses on teaching genome information flow

01:56.640 --> 02:05.440
through postmodern dance. Paul Fry. Paul is the William Lampson Professor of English and is taught

02:05.440 --> 02:13.840
at Yale since 1971. His primary areas of specialization are British Romanticism, the history of literary

02:13.840 --> 02:21.440
criticism, contemporary literary theory and literature in relation to the visual arts. He is also an

02:21.440 --> 02:31.920
award-winning author. Cynthia Panucci. Cynthia is the founder of ASCI, or ASCII, and is responsible

02:31.920 --> 02:38.560
for creating much of the pioneering art science programming. She has a background in fine arts

02:38.560 --> 02:45.360
and as a professional artist worked with printmaking, textiles, mixed media, and photography.

02:47.040 --> 02:53.680
Daniel Groschkin is co-founder and executive director of GenSpace. He is also the founder

02:53.680 --> 03:00.160
of the Bio Design Challenge. Daniel is a fellow at Data and Society. Additionally,

03:00.160 --> 03:06.240
he has done journalistic work reporting on the intersection of biotechnology, culture,

03:06.240 --> 03:12.800
and business for Bloomberg, Business Week, Scientific American, and other publications.

03:14.800 --> 03:22.720
Ellen Levy. Ellen is a New York based artist and writer and a past president of the College

03:22.720 --> 03:31.600
Art Association. With Patricia Olnick, she co-directs the New York based laser, which is Leonardo art

03:31.600 --> 03:39.600
and science evening rendezvous, as I mentioned earlier. She was a special IDSVA advisor on the

03:39.600 --> 03:47.600
Arts and Sciences at the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the visual arts and has been a numerous

03:47.600 --> 03:55.200
group and solo exhibitions have featured her art here and abroad, including at the National

03:55.200 --> 04:02.560
Academy of Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the like. With that, let's begin the round table.

04:04.800 --> 04:11.840
All right, thank you, Zach. So, the question on my mind right now is for Paul, and you can get us

04:11.840 --> 04:18.400
started by maybe framing us a little bit, having been in education for 45 years. I'd love to hear

04:18.400 --> 04:24.720
about how you think things have changed, your experience good or bad through changes and either

04:24.720 --> 04:28.400
ideas about what the institutions want or ideas about what the students want.

04:28.960 --> 04:35.840
Yes, thanks, Julia. That's a good sequence of questioning because it puts me in the role of

04:35.840 --> 04:46.000
reporter, which I think is probably the safest role to have me in. Today, the effort to create

04:46.000 --> 04:53.200
interactions between literary and science study is quite lively. In the academy, it certainly was

04:53.200 --> 05:00.400
not when I began teaching. Today, I suppose the most visible, it's been mentioned already,

05:01.440 --> 05:08.800
form of collaboration is ecological studies, which is a lively field in the literary world.

05:08.800 --> 05:16.080
Ursula Heiser was mentioned earlier as one important figure in that field. There are also

05:16.080 --> 05:25.760
quite serious efforts at the neurological understanding of aesthetics. Some years back,

05:25.760 --> 05:33.360
there was a book of essays called Beauty and the Brain, which was interestingly experimental.

05:33.360 --> 05:41.840
It showed, for example, that dogs and monkeys were as excited about the golden section as we are,

05:41.840 --> 05:50.480
and that perhaps four reasons having to do with shelter theory, some of you may know Jay Appleton's

05:50.480 --> 05:58.400
book, shelter theory. In any case, there have been efforts to understand the aesthetic, which

05:58.400 --> 06:05.280
always seems somehow or another to be completely in agreement with Kant's aesthetics and how and

06:05.280 --> 06:12.000
why the scientific approach to aesthetics gives you that result. I don't think I'm qualified to say,

06:12.800 --> 06:18.560
but it's interesting. There are now also interesting neurological efforts to understand what was

06:18.560 --> 06:25.920
earlier referred to as the importance of telling stories. Not so much the anthropological question,

06:25.920 --> 06:30.960
why do we tell stories, but the neurological question, why do the stories take the shape that

06:30.960 --> 06:37.440
they do? A person called Lisa Zunshin is well known in this field, and there are a number of other

06:37.440 --> 06:46.800
people working in that field as well. There have been lots of efforts to correlate the relationship

06:46.800 --> 06:53.280
between literary hermeneutics, the art and science of interpretation, something that interests me,

06:53.280 --> 06:58.880
especially because I really simply think of myself as a teacher of interpretation. If I'm

06:58.880 --> 07:04.720
either or transdisciplinary, it's plainly that one needs to interpret and about any undertaking one

07:04.720 --> 07:11.200
can think of. But there are, there are, there have been efforts by Edie Hirsch and others

07:12.000 --> 07:17.360
to make a correlation between hermeneutics and the scientific method in the argument,

07:17.360 --> 07:24.000
under the umbrella of arguing that there's a kind of unified field theory of interpretation.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.720
This is met with widespread skepticism, and I'd be interested to hear the views of many of you

07:30.720 --> 07:36.880
on a subject of that sort. I certainly share the skepticism myself, and I think that it's partly

07:37.520 --> 07:45.040
the skepticism we heard earlier about the scientific method itself that drives that, in large degree,

07:45.680 --> 07:51.120
and but in any case, this is another field in which there's quite lively interest within

07:51.120 --> 07:58.960
literary study. I think I should stop there for the moment and come back to other aspects of the

07:58.960 --> 08:05.120
issue. I would only add that when somebody said recently that, well, you know, we're all the same

08:05.120 --> 08:16.960
here. There's not much diversity in this group. I feel quite diverse. I, as our children say,

08:16.960 --> 08:26.560
I suck at science, and I can't pretend otherwise, but I nevertheless do, at the abstract level,

08:26.560 --> 08:31.040
take a lively interest in these things. It's really just the hands-on part of it I can't do. I

08:31.040 --> 08:36.480
could never see anything in a microscope. I just, you know, I would look and I would see nothing,

08:36.480 --> 08:41.520
and I would call the lab assistant over, and the lab assistant would say, look there, don't you see

08:41.520 --> 08:48.560
those things crawling around? No, I don't see them. So this was a kind of visual inhibition on my

08:48.560 --> 08:54.640
part, which I've never overcome. I suppose another remote qualification I have to be here is that I

08:54.640 --> 08:59.760
do paint. I was an art major in college, and I seriously considered a career in painting,

08:59.760 --> 09:04.240
but it's only been intermittent. I've done some exhibiting, but not much. So in effect, I think

09:04.240 --> 09:13.120
I'm in the category of that person who dissected those frogs. And I also have a very different

09:13.120 --> 09:19.360
attitude toward the kind of creativity that goes into my own painting, and the kind of creativity

09:19.360 --> 09:25.360
that I admire in my literary studies. It would be very hard for me to talk about a bridge

09:26.000 --> 09:31.440
really between those two activities. Yeah, it's interesting when we're talking about

09:31.440 --> 09:35.280
integrating disciplines, but then we have to recognize and we have been doing this, you know,

09:35.280 --> 09:41.760
that they're different. They feel different, and that's not a bad thing either. So,

09:43.600 --> 09:48.960
Jill, I'd love to hear a bit from you about your experience in your class choreographing

09:48.960 --> 09:53.040
genomics, because I think that'll also really set the stage for this theme.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.840
Yeah, I'd love to share it. I just want to say thank you to you, Julia, and thank you to the

09:57.840 --> 10:03.840
Helix Center, and thank you to SciArt, because it's really been an amazing day, and yesterday

10:03.840 --> 10:10.720
helping me to think about how I integrate art and science and all the discussions that have

10:10.720 --> 10:17.120
been going on here. So in my class, choreographing genomics is what I'd like to focus on, and this

10:17.120 --> 10:24.800
idea of this collaboration, but collaboration within each human being themselves. I've come to

10:24.800 --> 10:31.680
feel today that really I need to describe myself as a scientist and an artist, and that that is

10:31.680 --> 10:38.720
what I'm working to do with my students in the classroom, is to make sure that every student

10:38.720 --> 10:46.960
is describing themselves as a scientist and an artist, and that they are not at odds with each

10:46.960 --> 10:51.840
other, and I think that that's why we're all here because we recognize that they're not at odds

10:51.840 --> 11:00.080
with each other, and that the process of discovery in science is similar to the process of discovery

11:00.080 --> 11:07.680
in the arts, and that allowing young adults, you know, 19-year-olds who are at that process of

11:07.680 --> 11:14.800
discovery to discover in that way in the classroom and get joy out of discovery through art for

11:14.800 --> 11:22.160
science, and science understanding is an important thing. So what I do in the class is to have the

11:22.160 --> 11:30.960
students have two texts, one which is about art and postmodern dance called Terpsichore and Sneakers,

11:30.960 --> 11:38.800
which describes to them a lot of what happened at Black Mountain College, and the process where

11:38.800 --> 11:47.120
many postmodern dance choreographers were learning or thinking about moving out of the realm of

11:47.840 --> 11:54.000
classical dance training in order to give the process of what is art, that process of art,

11:54.000 --> 12:01.440
what is experiencing art, and allowing each student to recognize that their experience will help them

12:01.440 --> 12:09.280
to experience the visual learning of science, because all true scientists are very visual thinkers,

12:09.280 --> 12:14.400
kinesthetic thinkers, didactic thinkers, they're having all these different thinking processes

12:14.400 --> 12:20.400
brought to the table. So to teach students in this forum, or we're talking about education,

12:21.040 --> 12:25.520
I think that it's really important to allow students to learn through what's called VARC,

12:25.520 --> 12:32.240
which is visual learning, auditory learning, reading and writing, and then kinesthetic process,

12:32.240 --> 12:37.520
and so that the students are bringing all of those processes to the learning table. So they're

12:37.520 --> 12:43.440
learning about these different postmodern choreographers, so they can learn about Ivan Reiner and

12:43.440 --> 12:47.920
Merse Cunningham, and they know they can run, and they can jump, and they're all dancers, and all

12:47.920 --> 12:52.560
these different choreographers, so they're learning all these things through the lens and voice of

12:52.560 --> 12:58.400
Sally Baines, who wrote this amazing book, and then they're learning about DNA through somebody

12:58.400 --> 13:06.720
who I don't particularly care for, but James Watson's book, where they get to learn even that lens of

13:06.720 --> 13:14.480
somebody who speaks in such terrible words about people, and you see his lens, and you see his

13:14.480 --> 13:23.200
racism and his sexism through his lens, but you do also get the brilliance of the DNA molecule and

13:23.200 --> 13:29.600
information flow, and so that's the text they have for that, so they can see how you can have both

13:29.600 --> 13:33.920
together, and we're talking about all of these things, and then they're bringing them to the

13:33.920 --> 13:42.720
table to choreograph genome information flow, DNA to RNA to protein, and earlier today it was like,

13:42.720 --> 13:49.600
what is the new icon, our iconic symbol, and it is DNA, and we talk about DNA as the heart of things,

13:49.600 --> 13:56.480
people use it now in language, and the language of science and biology is often couched in language

13:56.480 --> 14:01.600
of choreography and movement and motion and synergism, and all these words we use in science that are

14:01.600 --> 14:06.080
also used in choreography, so the students are using all of this, bringing it to the table,

14:06.080 --> 14:12.000
choreographing, and then picking genes on different chromosomes that associate with cancer and

14:12.000 --> 14:17.760
exploring those in movement, and they all have to be the choreographer, they all use all the students

14:17.760 --> 14:25.120
in the class as their dancers, and they all are being audience, so they're learning the active art,

14:25.120 --> 14:31.520
art formation, art audience, science, conceptual, and I think that's a great way to teach, and I

14:31.520 --> 14:35.520
think it's a great way to learn, and I was lucky enough to have it, and I try to give that to others.

14:35.520 --> 14:46.240
Can I ask a question? You're saying that you're teaching, for example, DNA yields for RNA yields

14:46.240 --> 14:53.200
protein, which was the mantra for many years, certainly when I was growing up, but no longer is.

14:53.200 --> 15:01.440
Correct. So do you also update these series? So this class, in the class that I teach,

15:01.440 --> 15:06.400
so this is Biology 175, the one that I'm telling you about, I teach many different levels, I also

15:06.400 --> 15:12.480
teach PhD students, but in this class right now, I have people who, it's their first semester

15:13.520 --> 15:20.320
in college, and so, you know, I may talk a little bit about microRNAs and all these other complex

15:20.320 --> 15:26.320
things, but these students actually, just having them understand five prime to three prime, and

15:26.320 --> 15:34.000
using their bodies to understand directionality and anti-parallel, and this old to central dogma,

15:34.000 --> 15:40.560
it's enough kind of, you have to decide what you can add on when, when they walked into the class,

15:40.560 --> 15:44.720
so you also have to deal with assessment in education, so when they walked into the class,

15:44.720 --> 15:49.760
the first piece is to do assessment, and to assess, do they know the name of any gene?

15:49.760 --> 15:53.760
Do they know how many chromosomes would you have? Do they know how many nucleotides there are?

15:53.760 --> 15:58.480
Do they know how many miles this would stretch for? And none of them knew any of this, okay?

15:58.480 --> 16:04.080
So you begin with the assessment, and then have to take it from there, okay, now they know how

16:04.080 --> 16:09.760
many chromosomes, they know many genes, they know what those products do, they know enzymatically

16:09.760 --> 16:16.800
where activities are happening in the nucleus, and so, yes, a little, but this is a class to try to

16:16.800 --> 16:23.280
help them determine what your major gonna be, and some of them are going to, they want to become,

16:23.280 --> 16:28.720
they're going to theater, and they want to do puppetry, and others want to become chemistry

16:28.720 --> 16:34.720
majors, and some want to become doctors, and so it's, it's to begin that vocabulary, so the person

16:34.720 --> 16:40.080
who goes into puppetry, who's the one who actually made our flyer, who's so excited to share the

16:40.080 --> 16:44.320
performance, it's taught in a black box theater, there are no deaths, there are no chairs, you know,

16:44.320 --> 16:50.960
they're moving, but he's the most excited to share what they've learned in their final exam,

16:50.960 --> 16:56.960
which is performance-based, so we can't do everything beyond where we were with Central Dogma at the

16:56.960 --> 17:02.640
beginning, but I think it's a beginning of how do you set the stage as opposed to when students

17:02.640 --> 17:07.200
come in and they take general biology, they think they're going to med school, and maybe they get

17:07.200 --> 17:13.600
a C, and all of their dreams are squashed, and they're just like, what do I do? And this, and they've

17:13.600 --> 17:19.360
sat in this classroom with 500 students in the back, really, on their phone half the time,

17:19.360 --> 17:24.080
as opposed to in this classroom where their phone can't come out because they're moving,

17:24.080 --> 17:28.320
and if they don't get five-prime to three-prime, they haven't joined hands with the right person,

17:28.320 --> 17:33.280
and I'm asking them, where are you? Why'd you go there? So we can't do everything.

17:38.960 --> 17:45.920
So what it sounds like for your class is that you're describing a dance class in the service of

17:45.920 --> 17:50.880
teaching science, basic DNA science. Am I in misunderstanding? You are misunderstanding.

17:50.880 --> 18:00.000
This is not a dance class. This is a science class. The class is Biology 175, and it's utilizing

18:03.360 --> 18:09.760
all different kinds of learning possibilities to teach people in many different ways. So they

18:09.760 --> 18:15.840
have to come to class, having read two different chapters. They have to already understand, I'm not

18:15.840 --> 18:20.240
going to stand there and tell them all the things that should have read in the text, so it's almost

18:20.240 --> 18:26.880
of what we call a flipped classroom. So they have to have come in prepared to be ready to go where

18:26.880 --> 18:31.600
they're supposed to go, and it's very evident if they don't understand the concepts where I can

18:31.600 --> 18:38.320
help them, I can help them to feel it in their body, I can help them to articulate it with their

18:38.320 --> 18:44.080
voice, because postmodern dance and performance art, you're articulating, so they're speaking,

18:44.080 --> 18:50.400
they're moving, there are times I'll do a PowerPoint to show them the, like when we're dealing with

18:50.400 --> 18:55.520
five prime and three prime and really getting them to understand the molecule and where the sugar is.

18:55.520 --> 19:00.560
So they're also doing chemistry. Everything is there. They see the chemistry of the molecule,

19:00.560 --> 19:05.200
they have to understand where the sugar is, the nucleotide is. So this is a beginning,

19:05.200 --> 19:11.200
but I think it's a great beginning because much of our vocabulary and science now is based on the

19:11.200 --> 19:17.040
genome. So it sets them up, the next semester they might be going to general biology or they're in

19:17.040 --> 19:23.360
chemistry, it sets them up, but it is not dance. They don't have to point their toe, but they do

19:23.360 --> 19:30.880
have to run, or maybe if they can't run, they have to sit and speak. Whatever's going to work,

19:30.880 --> 19:38.480
I'm just working for what will work. I would agree that this is an essential part of STEAM

19:38.480 --> 19:46.080
education to bring these different things together, but it also reminds me in 2015,

19:46.080 --> 19:54.880
I opened up The New York Times, and I read a fascinating article on trying to decipher the

19:54.880 --> 20:04.320
Herculaneum scrolls. It couldn't be done. This was 2015, or some of it could be done, but not all of

20:04.320 --> 20:13.440
it. A little bit later in the paper, there was another article about the connectome and some from

20:13.440 --> 20:26.800
Columbia, his effort to decipher the neuronal connections in the brain. When you read the article

20:26.800 --> 20:34.320
a little bit further, which realized is that they shared a common solution, but didn't really

20:34.320 --> 20:46.240
realize it, which had to do with tomographic imaging, that they could unfurl the scrolls using

20:46.240 --> 20:55.680
tomography without having to actually invasively destroy them. That was true also for the neurons.

20:55.680 --> 21:02.320
So it would have been interesting if there had been somebody there representing STEAMs that,

21:02.320 --> 21:07.680
what do you guys collaborate and see what happens? I love that idea. That's so funny.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.360
I want to switch a little bit to STEAM outside of the classroom, because there is plenty of

21:13.360 --> 21:17.040
that to go around. Harvey, do you want to start us off? Because you have a lot to say in this.

21:17.040 --> 21:25.840
Sure. So just a little bit of background. I started off as a musician. I learned to read music before

21:25.840 --> 21:32.640
English. I did a lot of sciences again, working in renal immunology. In college, I hung out with

21:32.640 --> 21:39.920
a rougher crowd, so I did theater. And theater was my kind of core professional activity for the first

21:40.560 --> 21:50.960
half of my career. I also kept a toehold in music, and when I became director of the Orpheus Chamber

21:50.960 --> 21:56.960
Orchestra, I had this opportunity to work with this amazing conductorless orchestra. And I became

21:56.960 --> 22:03.040
really fascinated with how the orchestra did that, how they were able to perform that way. And that

22:03.040 --> 22:07.440
actually led me into some broader questions. Not only about what could you learn about

22:07.440 --> 22:13.920
collaboration from a conductorless orchestra, but more broadly, what can we learn from artistic

22:13.920 --> 22:19.520
skills, processes, experiences, in what realms and what domains and how we could apply them.

22:19.520 --> 22:26.640
And it was really growing out of that, and the things that I learned in doing all of that work

22:27.680 --> 22:32.320
led me to believe that there were these, as we looked at the application of these things in

22:32.320 --> 22:38.320
business and research and academia, that the world was filled with these really intractable and

22:38.320 --> 22:43.280
wicked problems that were effectively failures of the imagination and failures of collaboration,

22:43.280 --> 22:49.120
that the fault lines of those failures tended to be where the disciplines were a worn meeting,

22:49.120 --> 22:56.800
and that there might be ways to work with the arts and with arts-based learning to help bridge

22:56.800 --> 23:03.280
those gaps and begin to build new things in the space in between to use the phrase that's been

23:03.280 --> 23:09.040
used a lot here today. So that led me to start the art of science learning. And with the art

23:09.040 --> 23:14.160
of science learning, we've really done three kind of big things over the last decade. The first is

23:14.160 --> 23:19.520
we've developed and we, because there are 40 artists involved with this, and there are artists

23:19.520 --> 23:27.040
that are visual artists and sculptors and painters, poets, filmmakers, choreographers,

23:27.040 --> 23:32.960
improv theater artists, other types of theater artists, musicians. So we work with lots and lots

23:32.960 --> 23:40.640
of different ways that you can experience and explore the arts. We turn that all into a curriculum,

23:40.640 --> 23:48.000
a curriculum that was really designed pretty much for anybody. So not for really little kids,

23:48.000 --> 23:53.200
we have other things that we do with really little kids, but really from for adolescents

23:53.200 --> 23:59.280
and adults from all kinds of different backgrounds and interests and approaches. And it focuses

23:59.280 --> 24:06.320
on how you can use the arts to help you learn and help you become an innovator and innovating

24:06.320 --> 24:11.600
in many, many different domains. So we kind of built that body of work and those best practices

24:11.600 --> 24:16.880
that this is as we were able to find them and put them together in a curriculum. The second thing is

24:16.880 --> 24:22.480
we realize of course that we've designed a curriculum for which no institutions existed that can ever

24:22.480 --> 24:33.200
be taught. So we essentially spent several years creating a large work around as a model. And that

24:33.200 --> 24:38.800
took the form of incubators for innovation, which we set up in a number of cities around the country

24:39.360 --> 24:45.040
in partnership with museums and other kinds of informal learning centers. We brought together

24:45.040 --> 24:50.400
hundreds of people, artists and scientists and business leaders and researchers and high school

24:50.400 --> 24:57.840
students, college students and so forth. And working around specific STEM challenges, exploring them

24:57.840 --> 25:04.080
through the arts and through arts based learning and then innovating and actually developing new

25:04.080 --> 25:12.080
ideas into products, processes, services, curriculum to address civic challenges like water resources

25:12.080 --> 25:21.520
and urban nutrition and transportation alternatives. And then the third thing that we did is we kind

25:21.520 --> 25:30.880
of focused a lot on impact and data because we had a strong sense that for all the power that we've

25:30.880 --> 25:36.640
all experienced at this intersection of art science and learning, we have relatively little

25:36.640 --> 25:43.520
proof that we impact it and so that it was important to try to address that. So we've kind of spent

25:43.520 --> 25:52.080
this these years working outside the formal education system, but I think increasingly coming up with

25:52.080 --> 26:01.120
things that are impacting and creating opportunities. I feel like you have some good input here about

26:01.120 --> 26:06.240
outside of the classroom or growing from the classroom out into the real world. So let me tell

26:06.240 --> 26:14.880
you about my background before I jump into it. I'm sorry, your mic's not on. Can you hear me now

26:15.600 --> 26:20.960
better? Yeah, sure. All right, I'll just keep my finger here and it'll make me look very intelligent.

26:23.680 --> 26:32.240
So my background is as a journalist. I neither have a degree in the sciences nor particularly in

26:32.240 --> 26:41.520
the arts. I fell into it because as a journalist I found that access to the sciences specifically

26:41.520 --> 26:47.280
biotech was incredibly hard once you left the university setting. Meaning I was reporting on

26:47.280 --> 26:51.520
all these wonderful scientists and all the wonderful work they were doing and the second that I wanted

26:51.520 --> 26:56.160
to actually try any of the work that they did themselves, it became immediately clear that it

26:56.160 --> 27:00.960
would take me another decade to get back into the lab and actually try anything of my own. And that

27:00.960 --> 27:08.000
was not acceptable to me personally. And so lo and behold we created something called GenSpace

27:09.040 --> 27:14.880
which is the first community biology lab where anyone regardless of background, regardless of

27:15.600 --> 27:20.240
you know what stage of life they're in and what you know what they're doing with their time can

27:20.240 --> 27:27.040
come into our space and do at least their first genetic transformation and then move on from there

27:27.040 --> 27:34.960
to more sophisticated things like CRISPR or we're about to offer a grow your own lamp using my

27:34.960 --> 27:45.120
celium. So you know historically for me and I've been doing this for the last 10 years I haven't been

27:46.320 --> 27:51.360
sort of addressing these issues within the institution. It was only later that we created the bio

27:51.360 --> 27:58.480
design challenge and that's largely because artists and designers were finding their way to us. Being

27:58.480 --> 28:03.760
New York based that shouldn't be a surprise but it was and what they were looking to do with use

28:03.760 --> 28:11.360
our space as a platform for them to explore the technology. And as someone as a science journalist

28:11.360 --> 28:17.520
who wasn't you know didn't know much about the practice it became very clear that they were

28:17.520 --> 28:22.080
contributing something very very important to the dialogue that was going in on our lab

28:22.960 --> 28:27.520
and I actually think contributing something very important to a larger dialogue about

28:28.720 --> 28:34.800
what this technology what this science actually means for us as a society. So they were asking

28:34.800 --> 28:40.960
well what can I do with this stuff and how will it affect the future of us as a civic society,

28:40.960 --> 28:46.320
us as individuals, us as a collective. And these questions were really really important to me.

28:46.320 --> 28:52.880
So one of the things that I haven't heard today was anything about social justice environmental

28:52.880 --> 29:00.880
justice and it has surprised me and I think largely this collaboration these are the things

29:00.880 --> 29:07.600
that will unfurl uncover sorry going back to being intelligent. Will unfurl and uncover

29:09.120 --> 29:16.240
some of the challenges in social and environmental justice. To make a long story short we created

29:16.240 --> 29:21.600
a program called the bio design challenge where we took classrooms of artists and designers we

29:21.600 --> 29:27.520
partnered them with biologists who would act as kind of guides and mentors offering up office

29:27.520 --> 29:33.600
hours and we asked them to imagine the future and what is the future of biotechnology look like

29:33.600 --> 29:38.080
out in the world. How would you use some of the papers that you've read some of the

29:38.960 --> 29:45.040
new advances in research how would that actually turn out in our society how would that turn out

29:45.040 --> 29:52.960
in the products that we use. And the students then were able to either innovate and show us some

29:52.960 --> 29:59.600
amazing visions but also critique and that became very important and so for the last three years

29:59.600 --> 30:06.480
we've had these students on stage at MoMA presenting their ideas and as much as they are a celebration

30:06.480 --> 30:13.760
of the learning of the science through this novel means it's also a critique of the of what happened

30:13.760 --> 30:20.800
when you take science and technology and you cross it with capitalism and I think that's actually where

30:21.360 --> 30:30.960
where the the power of this begins for me personally. I want to go back to the classroom but first.

30:34.240 --> 30:40.320
Well my background is as a fine artist you know we often have to have a day job to support our

30:40.320 --> 30:48.960
art habits so for 10 years as an artist in New York before I started ASCII I worked with kids

30:48.960 --> 30:56.160
in community settings so I did a quilt project with pregnant teenage girls with a theme of

30:56.160 --> 31:03.440
your hopes and fears of being a pregnant teenager. I did environmental murals with kids at a

31:03.440 --> 31:12.720
religious after school project where you know it was about they got down on the floor and they put

31:12.720 --> 31:20.400
their bodies and traced around their bodies and then those paper patterns went into the big 13 foot

31:20.400 --> 31:28.320
by 8 foot mural but through working with kids in children's museum settings and designing art

31:28.320 --> 31:40.080
workshops and and also interactive sculpture where kids could could accessorize with pattern texture

31:40.080 --> 31:46.400
and form so interactivity became important to me and going into science museums and seeing how

31:46.400 --> 31:51.520
kids were like pretty much programmed to be pressing pressing buttons and I didn't see that they were

31:51.520 --> 32:02.720
getting very much out of that in terms of learning. So I just personally became involved in ocean

32:02.720 --> 32:10.880
conservation from my first snorkeling experience in 98 and when I learned you know that they before

32:10.880 --> 32:16.640
we could go down in the water they said you can't touch the reef because there's a protective film

32:16.640 --> 32:23.280
and it will kill the reef gradually. Anyway I started to get I just read all I could on the internet.

32:24.000 --> 32:32.320
I started to realize that when you when I saw this fantastic agoracal setting with all these

32:32.320 --> 32:37.040
fishes and then I and then we got out of the boat and he said well you know two-thirds of the ocean

32:37.040 --> 32:43.680
reefs are dead or endangered and I thought I was like outraged like I didn't know that and I couldn't

32:43.680 --> 32:50.480
figure out well why in our society I watch National Geographic and like all of you do and I couldn't

32:50.480 --> 32:56.720
figure out you know why why didn't really know but so I started studying about well so what is the

32:56.720 --> 33:04.080
significance of artificial reefs why should we care? Well now my passion is ecology because I've

33:04.080 --> 33:11.760
learned that the phytoplankton floating around in the global ocean is responsible for 80 percent of

33:11.760 --> 33:18.320
the oxygen that we breathe and all the fresh water that grows our plants and that we drink and so my

33:18.320 --> 33:27.520
my pursuit has has kind of gone along this path so I took my interest to NOAA in Washington DC and

33:27.520 --> 33:32.960
I had this project that would was about the ocean health of the ocean and there was a photography

33:32.960 --> 33:38.640
project and a fashion project and all these different components and they said well where's your

33:38.640 --> 33:46.320
where's your youth education project and I hadn't done that so I went back to the drawing boards and

33:46.320 --> 33:58.720
I a year later I came up with this project about collapsing ocean fisheries and there so I reached

33:58.720 --> 34:10.960
out to the oceanography community and got people from the Southeast Asian countries and the Philippines

34:10.960 --> 34:21.360
and other countries to put their children together on a blog and to be talking about for instance in

34:21.360 --> 34:29.520
the Philippines children often can't go to school anymore because they have to take all day fishing

34:29.520 --> 34:40.160
to catch minnow size fish because the industry size fishing industry from the Baltic countries

34:40.160 --> 34:46.800
that is totally subsidized by their governments comes in to the Philippines and you know raids all

34:46.800 --> 34:52.560
of the endemic fish that they can give their hands on so anyway well so friends were telling me

34:52.560 --> 34:58.800
Cynthia don't do a project about collapsing fisheries with kids that are eight nine and ten

34:58.800 --> 35:05.280
what do they care about fish so you know I don't really normally listen to people so I kind of

35:05.280 --> 35:13.040
went on with this project but something amazing happened the project was with fourth graders at

35:13.040 --> 35:20.640
a school in Chinatown because the principal was a very advanced adventuresome principal and she

35:20.640 --> 35:32.720
took it on so we so we had these children blogging to these other countries and they were they were

35:32.720 --> 35:41.120
either acting or speaking for the fish like don't throw dynamite on my reef because you know they're

35:41.120 --> 35:46.240
going to kill me and you're going to destroy the whole reef as well which is what they do in Malaysia

35:47.520 --> 35:56.160
so and then so the kids were to speak to give voice to the fish and also to give voice to the

35:56.160 --> 36:00.880
children in the other countries that were the people their parents were having to move away

36:00.880 --> 36:06.560
from the shoreline because there were no more fish so they had to go and do agricultural things

36:06.560 --> 36:14.560
well anyway it's it started me on this whole journey and when it was over we had this blog

36:14.560 --> 36:23.440
conversation that was supported by this Philippine ocean management fishery management

36:24.880 --> 36:30.720
organization and it was online and it wasn't live but the questions were posed

36:30.720 --> 36:38.000
so in the end I hired a choreographer and I made these fish cutouts as just

36:38.000 --> 36:44.960
Objes dart that the students would the choreographer just designed this movement

36:44.960 --> 36:51.600
some were ocean and chobis some were sea bass so there was a movement and then the music stopped

36:51.600 --> 36:57.920
and the kids would go to the microphone one at a time and they would do this monologue that came

36:57.920 --> 37:03.680
out of the blog that happened so there was a performance that was sponsored by the United

37:03.680 --> 37:11.840
Nations environment program for the world environment day in 2007 and at the end of this wonderful

37:11.840 --> 37:19.520
little performance that the kids did they ran up to me and they said well we have to write a

37:19.520 --> 37:25.920
letter to the president doesn't he know what's going on this was George Bush's administration

37:25.920 --> 37:35.120
but it's I had never talked to them anything politically I showed them a picture of this

37:35.120 --> 37:42.480
the young children in the Philippines on stilts fishing and I told them that they you know these

37:42.480 --> 37:48.800
kids could not go to school anymore well I didn't realize of kids that I was working with in Chinatown

37:49.360 --> 37:55.280
you know that that culture is very interested in education so much so that that's the most

37:55.280 --> 38:04.480
important thing to them and these kids were coming up with these concerns like the children in the

38:04.480 --> 38:11.280
Philippines need to be able to go to school you know anyway it was a totally in terms of outcomes

38:11.280 --> 38:19.600
of projects I had kind of created framework but I had no idea that these children would have been

38:19.600 --> 38:27.680
had a reaction but it was of empathy I think for their fellow fellows in a different part of the country

38:27.680 --> 38:32.320
kind of we've touched upon this before but when you give people the opportunity to have a kind of

38:32.320 --> 38:36.560
cross-disciplinary experience whether they know they're having it or not there's this kind of thrill

38:36.560 --> 38:42.160
which which is it you know relayed at the end and because students are wide-eyed that's that's

38:42.160 --> 38:47.120
why they're wonderful they're open to learning so I just wanted to point out we have kind of

38:47.120 --> 38:55.200
independent artist nonprofit academia nonprofit academia nonprofit academia slash nonprofit

38:56.400 --> 39:02.960
how do we enact steam across these platforms what's easy for you and what's hard for you

39:04.640 --> 39:10.320
first of all I think that there are many more opportunities for art science

39:10.320 --> 39:21.120
insights and maybe in terms of teaching what's important is to not only draw connections

39:21.120 --> 39:33.280
but think how you could impart it I spoke with a woman who is an educator Susan I believe it's

39:33.280 --> 39:43.040
where she said Hogarth and what is word that that's her name and she told me something very

39:43.040 --> 39:54.000
interesting many of you probably realize that both Golgi and Kahal received a Nobel Prize together

39:54.800 --> 40:01.440
but what I had not realized until I spoke with her was that they both used the same staining method

40:01.440 --> 40:12.720
and Kahal came up with Noron theory whereas Golgi came up with a theory that was I think it was

40:12.720 --> 40:20.720
called a particular theory it was discarded and considered incorrect and what she looked at

40:21.520 --> 40:29.840
with her class were the differences even using the same methodology which allowed one to see

40:29.840 --> 40:35.760
something differently from the other this had to do with looking through the microscope

40:35.760 --> 40:46.720
adjusting it using extra resources after applying stains evidently Kahal went and used various

40:46.720 --> 40:55.040
kinds of pigments and coloring on it to bring out certain characteristics then this is just one

40:55.040 --> 41:02.720
this is the tip of the iceberg another really prevalent thing is it wasn't just Galileo who

41:02.720 --> 41:12.320
looked through telescope I mean this happened in at the same year with a man from England named

41:12.320 --> 41:21.520
Hinton but what allowed Galileo to see this was his fine arts education and his relationship

41:21.520 --> 41:32.320
with an man named Chiggling so I think then in terms of teaching having symposium these extra

41:33.680 --> 41:41.280
things need to be brought out where you have creativity on the part of two people and yet

41:41.280 --> 41:49.840
one is able to make even further observations this is something all of you here can use

41:49.840 --> 42:00.720
in your teaching and your communication with others well the future of education is part of our

42:00.720 --> 42:07.760
topic and I suppose I should say that another thing I do is co-chair something called the

42:08.480 --> 42:14.640
started as the Yale New Haven Teachers Institute and now it's a national program called Yale

42:14.640 --> 42:22.960
National Initiative for public school teachers K through 12 in underrepresented schools in collaboration

42:22.960 --> 42:32.400
with university faculty who teach content based seminars for those public school teachers and

42:32.400 --> 42:41.040
what's of interest perhaps in our context is the question how to approach the trans and

42:41.040 --> 42:46.080
interdisciplinary in this setting because of course as other people have said speaking of

42:46.880 --> 42:56.240
school teaching one is beset by codes and standards and above all by test scores and which is still

42:56.240 --> 43:02.960
for us as for others who have spoken the only available form of evaluation that convinces funders

43:02.960 --> 43:12.640
so there's a lot that one's up against here but a lot of us have nevertheless I've talked 15 of

43:12.640 --> 43:22.480
these seminars and a lot of us have experimented with with tiptoeing around the interdisciplinary

43:22.480 --> 43:29.040
they write long curriculum units as opposed to lesson plans so that it's partly an exercise in

43:29.040 --> 43:41.120
brushing off their prose and so I for example teach seminars sometimes concerning poems on pictures

43:42.160 --> 43:49.360
and introduce the idea that actually visual arts and verbal arts have rival agendas and in some

43:49.360 --> 43:56.800
ways envy each other and that there's a kind of a dramatic force field that run encounters in an

43:56.800 --> 44:05.520
eight-phrastic poem as they're called and I try to interest teachers who are English teachers or in

44:05.520 --> 44:12.400
some cases art teachers in the possibility of thinking within the humanities of a variety of

44:12.400 --> 44:20.800
disciplines and it's in that way that we feel we can approach the problem even for the K through 12

44:20.800 --> 44:31.520
teachers whose lives are so scripted and regimented as as we all know it's a it's a small step as we

44:31.520 --> 44:39.680
say on the moon but it is something at least we can do to enliven the prospect of teaching for

44:40.400 --> 44:47.040
public school teachers in the future if I could just hold the floor for another minute to talk about

44:47.040 --> 44:53.680
um something I do myself as a undergraduate graduate teacher teaches seminar quite often called

44:53.680 --> 45:00.560
defenses of poetry which once again has to do with the rival read among disciplines you know Plato

45:01.840 --> 45:09.200
in the tenth book of the republic unceremoniously banished the poets from his ideal republic and

45:09.200 --> 45:17.760
based his whole argument in favor of a just life under the philosopher king on the idea that poets

45:17.760 --> 45:23.120
really have no idea what they're talking about they live in a state of delusion three times removed

45:23.120 --> 45:30.160
from reality and much as we like them we simply can't afford to have them in our ideal republic and

45:30.160 --> 45:37.280
so we begin with a text like this and then we go on attempting to find ways to rehabilitate

45:37.280 --> 45:46.560
uh poetry uh and and bring it back into even a republic that has um ambitions something like those

45:46.560 --> 45:54.160
of Plato uh to me the high watermark um in this effort uh is a wonderful text by Shelley the

45:54.160 --> 46:01.600
ronatic poet Shelley called a defense of poetry and Shelley argues in the defense of poetry that

46:01.600 --> 46:09.440
science in its imaginative moment just is poetry in other words he commandeers the entire field of

46:09.440 --> 46:18.400
thought for poetry understood as the capacity to metaphorize uh he then argues that metaphor

46:18.400 --> 46:25.360
degenerates into equation or law or whatever it might be in the field and always needs the

46:25.360 --> 46:32.080
resuscitation of rethinking so that um he believed for example that the americans revised their

46:32.080 --> 46:37.600
constitution every five years i mean who you know he liked the americans uh naturally they

46:37.600 --> 46:43.280
must revise their constitution every five years otherwise to live under law would be intolerable

46:43.280 --> 46:51.520
because law in other words perpetually needs to be rethought as metaphor uh so this is a good

46:51.520 --> 46:58.160
instance of a unified field approach uh to the disciplines which is which which i celebrate in

46:58.160 --> 47:04.480
this in this setting quasi facetiously because we all know the problems with an argument of this kind

47:05.280 --> 47:09.120
but it's nevertheless it seems to me in some ways an exhilarating one

47:09.120 --> 47:17.120
Matthew Arnold then gives the whole show away he says science is true but it's also hateful

47:17.120 --> 47:24.800
Darwin has told us that we are no longer the signisher of the universe we're descended from some

47:24.800 --> 47:32.400
horrible arboreal creature with prehensile paws uh you know and and and and how can we possibly live

47:32.400 --> 47:38.480
with this well says Arnold what we need is poetry which tells us pleasing lies right i mean i'm

47:38.480 --> 47:45.040
boiling the argument down but as you can see everything Shelley won Arnold gave away in other

47:45.040 --> 47:52.000
words this is in a nutshell uh the drama that i try to communicate in a course of this kind

47:52.720 --> 47:57.520
and of course it tells you nothing about science and in fact in that setting precious little about

47:57.520 --> 48:05.280
poetry uh but it does it does uh oblige you to rethink the questions of the relation among the

48:05.280 --> 48:10.560
disciplines and i and we do spend a lot of time in this setting thinking about that sorry to

48:10.560 --> 48:22.320
have kept you so long so if if we're actually gonna translate steam uh i actually have always hated

48:22.320 --> 48:28.000
that but i and i fought it for i think we can all agree on that if we fought it for a long time but

48:28.000 --> 48:34.640
i've actually decided you know it's out there let's just go with it so okay so um the word yeah yeah

48:34.640 --> 48:42.000
so if if um if we're actually going to translate it from the not-for-profit from the informal learning

48:42.880 --> 48:49.120
into the formal system um we're going to have to tackle this question of of how we measure impact

48:49.680 --> 48:56.240
and i think that if we stick to the traditional measures we're kind of missing the point and

48:56.240 --> 49:02.160
playing out of losing playing field you also not just how to measure the impact but define what

49:02.160 --> 49:06.480
well yes i was just going there so in order in order to measure at first we have to define what

49:06.480 --> 49:13.680
we mean by it and what it is that we're trying to impact so we have all of these wonderful 21st

49:13.680 --> 49:21.200
century learning standards and we all think that collaboration is really important um we don't

49:21.200 --> 49:29.120
really measure that very much um we don't integrate that very much into how we think about these things

49:29.120 --> 49:35.280
and yet we now have actual data that proves that relatively small amounts of art space learning

49:36.080 --> 49:46.080
leads directly to better collaboration among both adolescents and adult scientists um we think

49:46.080 --> 49:52.720
that creative thinking is really important we don't always know how we want to define that but um

49:52.720 --> 50:01.120
um we have good data that we've developed that shows that art space learning actually impacts

50:01.120 --> 50:06.800
specific creative thinking skills ranging from the ability to generate ideas to the ability to

50:06.800 --> 50:14.240
form heuristics we think that innovation is very important but we don't actually focus on that

50:14.240 --> 50:19.120
and yet there are two we have powerful compelling data now and more being developed all the time

50:19.120 --> 50:29.760
uh that shows the direct impact of art space learning on the innovation outcomes of teams so

50:29.760 --> 50:42.680
I think that there's a real opportunity there to work across the the not-for-profit world the K12

50:42.680 --> 50:49.480
world and also to work across art and science because after all if we're actually going to

50:49.480 --> 50:55.080
to change things and move the needle on how we think about this we need compelling narratives

50:55.080 --> 51:01.800
and compelling data we actually have what it takes to do both of those but without the application

51:01.800 --> 51:06.680
of that to to these questions we're going to be spinning on the margins of a system which is

51:06.680 --> 51:12.040
designed to drive other outcomes altogether which are actually as we all know not the outcomes

51:12.040 --> 51:19.800
that we want to be driving as a society can can i can we step a little bit back because I think

51:19.800 --> 51:26.920
we all have different perspectives here what is the positive benefit of steam from your perspective

51:26.920 --> 51:32.040
meaning you're you're talking about all the ways in which it makes us better collaborators more

51:32.040 --> 51:36.360
creative more innovative that would be goals for you but I think all of us have different

51:36.360 --> 51:41.880
understandings of what that might what those goals might be yeah absolutely and and I only spoke

51:41.880 --> 51:48.440
about a few of them for me and ones that I happen to have some data on but I think that they're a

51:48.440 --> 51:55.880
pretty broad and rich set of things that can be accomplished through steam I like to give an

51:55.880 --> 52:09.880
example more exact you mentioned things before but they weren't really examples that one could or I could put my yeah so

52:11.080 --> 52:16.680
and I'm grappling for what will be a helpful type of example when you say an example an example of

52:16.680 --> 52:26.760
an example of what the collaboration led to yeah okay sure could not have happened without it yeah so in

52:26.760 --> 52:33.720
in our project we brought together 28 teams of people these people were artists there were

52:33.720 --> 52:39.240
scientists they were students they were researchers people from very very different kinds of backgrounds

52:39.240 --> 52:46.840
they worked together for a year and in these on these projects which they selected themselves in broad

52:46.840 --> 52:56.680
challenge areas they developed things that I cannot imagine have coming out of any other

52:56.680 --> 53:05.080
process things that were really strikingly original social innovations we had a we had a team that

53:05.080 --> 53:13.240
that started out trying to reinvent the technology behind how people pay for transportation but ended up

53:13.240 --> 53:22.600
with a novel social innovation and sharing economy innovation that has led today to a thriving

53:22.600 --> 53:29.400
nonprofit which has people going to work for nonprofits banking their hours converting them into bus passes

53:29.400 --> 53:38.760
being sponsored and sending about 500 rather 5,000 immigrants to their first job interviews so I mean

53:38.760 --> 53:44.040
these things are coming out in in in lots of different domains they would not have happened if they hadn't

53:44.040 --> 53:49.560
been artists and scientists and students and business leaders people from coming from very different

53:49.560 --> 53:56.120
perspectives and using the arts as a common language and a set of tools to help them collaborate and

53:56.120 --> 54:04.840
generate ideas and develop them. I'd like to talk about what what it means to me and what I think

54:04.840 --> 54:12.760
how it can impact learning and so this morning there was this this term steamy and how steamy

54:12.760 --> 54:22.280
you know steamy has a much more kind of rich thought for for young people like the kids saying wow

54:22.280 --> 54:29.960
that's so steamy so when you think about how it can affect yeah it's hot you know that's like it's

54:29.960 --> 54:41.800
lit it is so when you think about how arts transpires and it hits everybody and and just you can use

54:41.800 --> 54:51.320
it as a way to empower all the learners just for an example from from my perspective when I was in

54:51.320 --> 54:57.480
college even when I started to know I was a scientist I would not tell people I would always say I was a

54:57.480 --> 55:03.640
dancer and even when I was going for my PhD I would go to parties and I would say I was a dancer

55:04.360 --> 55:09.800
so and so now I now then I got to a place where I don't always say I was a scientist but now in

55:09.800 --> 55:15.720
both the scientists in a dancer and the point is that I think steam this idea of putting it all

55:15.720 --> 55:22.920
together allows you to reach audiences you ask this question about social justice and and dealing

55:22.920 --> 55:31.400
with steam as a mechanism to affect social justice to be able to diversify the people that you can

55:31.400 --> 55:39.880
speak to about science to allow science to be accessible to the broader public because the broader

55:39.880 --> 55:46.440
public often when you begin to speak about science becomes glassy I we talked about elitism so in

55:46.440 --> 55:52.520
an elite audience of this type here yes science seems so big and wonderful but in your normal

55:53.480 --> 55:58.360
walk a day world you want to do a party and you talk about being a scientist this is my world

55:58.360 --> 56:05.880
you know my family I don't speak about my work with my family I can speak about dance I can see

56:05.880 --> 56:12.760
so you need to be able to have these conversations and to have young people it's not just students

56:12.760 --> 56:18.840
these students are the the future scientists and to have them think something is steamy

56:18.840 --> 56:24.520
and them to be able to make the new discoveries because it is young minds that make the new

56:24.520 --> 56:30.760
discoveries it is young minds that shift paradigms it is young minds who are able to think differently

56:30.760 --> 56:35.000
just as you're talking about staining something differently seeing something differently being

56:35.000 --> 56:41.960
able to open their minds and not be lost in the paradigms we have now but be able to have paradigm

56:41.960 --> 56:47.720
shifts because they see things differently and I think that steamy will allow us to affect those

56:47.720 --> 56:53.320
kind of paradigm shifts and it's important to be able for people to not see things in this

56:53.320 --> 56:58.440
didactic way that we approach science and that is the beauty of this putting together a part in

56:58.440 --> 57:05.960
science that takes us past this didactic approach I'd like to also take it from there to point out

57:05.960 --> 57:14.440
that we've had some new programs developing and there's some examples here one that particularly

57:14.440 --> 57:24.280
impressed me was and was mentioned earlier was David Edwards program in in Boston I think he

57:24.280 --> 57:34.600
injected it now 100k for high school students and I was part of the group of people who were

57:35.800 --> 57:45.880
brainstorming about neuroscience and art there was the use they these high school students

57:45.880 --> 57:56.200
after hearing 30 different ideas selected what excited them and what motivated them to develop

57:56.200 --> 58:03.960
a project they were given a technologist to work with they were given an artist to work with and

58:03.960 --> 58:12.360
these are people who when I first met them were for the most part fairly in articulate at the end

58:12.360 --> 58:19.800
of six months they were so articulate they were excited they could develop a budget that could

58:19.800 --> 58:29.080
support what they wanted to do I thought it was really quite a transformation and it's not anywhere

58:29.080 --> 58:37.480
on that scale but these lasers that have developed they're all over now they're in other countries

58:37.480 --> 58:48.360
Patricia Olinik who you heard before and I set this up late in 2008 when it wasn't officially

58:48.360 --> 58:56.040
called a laser and we've had people every five or six weeks except for during the summer months

58:56.760 --> 59:04.600
since then three and four people present their ideas and the beauty of it is not just that it's

59:04.600 --> 59:12.600
largely unscripted which is true here also which is really quite wonderful but that at the end of

59:12.600 --> 59:20.600
it we put these people together to talk and see what themes emerge from sometimes quite disparate

59:21.160 --> 59:30.280
approaches and that's really where the excitement for me is is seeing how a theme and understanding

59:30.280 --> 59:38.200
can emerge that had not been there before and I would say this is true of everyone here talking

59:38.760 --> 59:46.520
about their programs both in this group and also in the earlier groups so I think that's what we're

59:46.520 --> 59:54.840
trying to get at I think it's kind of ironic that in our culture here in this country you have to

59:54.840 --> 01:00:02.120
sneak up on citizens when you talk about science I mean you can't just be blatant about it I can't

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:08.920
with my family either and then you know science is heavily funded of course scientists wouldn't say

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:17.480
so but art is totally almost not funded so here we have two groups you know the underappreciated

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:27.160
and the underfunded but you know somehow we got from our whatever I love for art and science so

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:37.080
how do we put these together in ways that really relate to the the student the young person so

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:43.960
so that they're turned on and they ask questions to me that's the most important thing is how do

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:50.120
you turn on the brain how do you provoke the questioning mind because the answers are all out

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:56.040
there you just look on your phone pretty much so that's what's so exciting in in the impacts that

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:02.040
we've seen the data that we've developed and that we've studied it has this tremendous capacity to

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:09.240
spark engagement curiosity enthusiasm a sense of optimism about learning a sense of agency and that

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:15.240
you can apply things that you learn in your own life and and and change the world around you

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:27.320
impact it we we're dealing with educational systems that by and large are not set up or designed

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:35.640
to do those things so something that you said that you do the seminars with teachers so maybe

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:45.160
we should reach out and do short term or summer session for teachers teaching the teachers so

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:50.840
because then they can if they fall in love with the teachers need the space to do it in so some

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.840
some schools are doing that already I'm blanking on the school it might be fisc but we published

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.160
about them in August and yeah they host sessions about how to teach in a more steam-like manner

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.120
for teachers and where they hosted they hosted it in the school's gallery because I don't know if

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:15.480
there's room there and it's nice to be in a gallery um so uh we're gonna open it up for questions now

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:23.800
right after Ed asks a question if I understand it if I understand it correctly

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:35.400
uh if you have somebody who is going to go into a lab and study the microtubules inside the neuron

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:46.280
the advantage of that person having gone through steam education during his

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:57.480
whole education period is that that person would hopefully look at the problem in a different way

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:06.040
more enriched way than if somebody hadn't gone through that education is that the claim that is

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:12.760
one of them yes and they'll think out of the box creatively because they don't have these

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:21.640
preconceived ideas of what the outcome should be I think well partly what we're describing is the

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.120
societal need for people who are both fluent in both and I'm going to add design to this as well

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:39.240
because it's an important one yes so design as well as the technology what or the science

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:48.680
whatever it is uh for for several reasons one reason is simply that when scientists do their work

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:54.760
they are particularly focused on what is going on in the mechanisms under the microscope or whatever

01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:01.960
it is um when the designer takes that finding or works with that finding they're thinking about

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:07.400
the people who are going to use that in their daily lives and so they're acting almost as a

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:14.200
translator of the science that's being discovered into the product that will eventually be the

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:21.400
whatever it is we use and I think that person needs to be able to understand both what the

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.120
scientist is talking about understand the technology itself and then be able to understand people's

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:35.240
desires and so there needs to be that translational role in society I don't know about the internals

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.520
of apple but I will say that you know what we're trying to do is we're trying to create a generation

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:48.280
of bio designers which are people who are fluent in the language of design and also at the same time

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.880
can speak to a scientist and understand what they're saying and the hope just like now we have in

01:04:53.880 --> 01:05:01.640
computing groups of designers who are working on things that uh basically designing with with

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:07.000
computation there will be a time in the near future probably already happening now we just

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.560
don't identify it as such people who are designing with biotechnology with biology you know when we

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.640
think about GMOs you know you know Monsanto crops and things like that these are bio designs these

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:27.240
are designs to be used in the context of human civilization human uh the human endeavor human

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:32.600
experiments well I hope they're not doing human experiment well they are well that's what Monsanto

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:39.240
is all about well fair enough anyway my point is that if you have a generation of designers who are

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:44.120
fluent in that language but also into in the social understand the social context hopefully

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:50.200
we'll avoid some of the environmental maybe humanitarian catastrophes that we've had in the past

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:57.080
hello I'm Len Steinbeck I teach in the museum graduate program at Johns Hopkins

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.600
I will do terminology has come up if popped up a few times yesterday and today and I was wondering

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:09.720
if you could share what you know about neurological plasticity and the thinking and ways of thinking

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:18.120
that benefit scientists and artists and whether these have these projects have any

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:30.280
lasting effect to your knowledge I can talk oh please um I was going to say that plasticity

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:38.200
appears to be a proven fact that this there is development that it's ongoing but that's not what

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:44.920
you really are asking is it I want to apply it and I want to apply it in both directions because

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:52.360
for a moment before it seemed like you were talking about um there's science artists impacting science

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:57.880
or science impacting artists one way or the other and not as mutually as I hope the conversation

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:05.160
would go especially when you talk about certain outcomes but so but I am interested in knowing

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:13.720
what we might know about how an intensive artistic orientation new to a scientist and you

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:21.480
scientific orientation to an artist changes in a lasting manner the way they see the world

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:28.600
there's a wonderful there's several wonderful books but one I particularly liked is by Warren

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:37.960
Nieden who is both an artist and an ophthalmologist it was written in 2003 and was devoted to how

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:47.320
an art for namely the cinema was sculpting people's brains and I think it's a very compelling

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:55.160
um explanation of work by people like Gerald Ailman yes and I know there there is a lot of work done

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:03.480
about art in the brain more ternering or kind of many have but I'm interested in what science does

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:09.800
with the art oriented brain and what art does with a science oriented brain or my being too specific

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.680
and please will read the tell me because I'm not well I can only comment a little bit on one side

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:23.560
of that and that is that um I don't know if you know the late James Catarols work at all um but

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:31.960
but he he did a did a meta study that looked at I think it was 40 neuro imaging studies over a

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:40.280
long period of time and he found a lot of shared neural substrates between artistic process experience

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:49.320
and empathy actually to come back to there's that work is incomplete but um there's certainly

01:08:49.320 --> 01:09:00.520
some strong suggestions of things there um can I just say um one influence of um art on science is

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:08.920
Ned Seaman who's at NYU um he is known as the grandfather of DNA nanotechnology he came up with

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:18.600
the idea because he loves art and collects art and it was MC Escher's work and tiling that gave him

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:29.880
the idea for his whole field of DNA nanotechnology so I mean there I'm I think Leonardo is starting

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:37.400
to collect these exemplars and I think we could really benefit our field by having a compilat

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:44.600
compilation such an example I've been hugely impressed by the number of stunning examples of

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.640
collaborative success I've been hearing about in the last day and a half

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:57.080
uh and still perhaps a little skeptical about how they translate into the classroom it's the the

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:05.960
uh uh what we're what we're talking about is the um uh mutual insemination of great scientists and

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:13.480
great artists or at least very good scientists and very good artists and uh the uh and in the

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.960
future of education this has to give us uh an optimistic sense that more of this kind of thing

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:28.440
if possible perhaps uh not quite at such an advanced level uh but but but still I mean the way the

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:35.400
the instances of these sorts of success that you all have given is extremely impressive to an

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:40.680
outsider I just want to say that well it's uh I'm glad you brought that up because I just want to

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:47.640
note before we move on to the next question steam officially starred in 2008 all of us in this

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:54.920
room found it before then on our own whatever we called it um it's it's only been nine years you

01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:01.320
know for a movement that's that's pretty short right so we are now educating the people that in

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:06.920
ten years will be getting those jobs that will start dictating different things that will happen

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:14.200
in institutions so so it's a bit of a a long uh study in terms of what's working right but but I

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:23.160
think uh there are already a lot of good stories hi my name is Jessica Beals I'm an artist from

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:32.840
Washington DC um I work primarily with themes related to science and math um but I'm particularly

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.200
interested in one aspect of this particular discussion today I'm related to education because

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:45.160
um I was I was once and I for the last four years have been invited to bring an interactive art

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:51.000
project I have to an annual summer institute for teachers at the Washington International School

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.480
where they're focusing on teaching for global learning so not so much about science or art

01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.080
specifically but um they brought my project in which is a language-based interactive project with

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:08.520
rocks um about identity and community building just as a diversion mostly for the teachers to have

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:15.960
something to um do in between sessions and explore whatever was sparked by my project and of course I

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:22.440
had an underhanded idea about what I was going to do when they turned into my my space um and I

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.040
would have conversations with these teachers about what my work wasn't what they thought it was and

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.600
if they were told it was an art project in the gallery and they were welcome to look at it they

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:35.800
go oh this is interesting um can I touch it can I do anything with it and say of course it's interactive

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:40.680
do whatever you want with it and then tell me what you think about what you're doing um and they

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.680
would go oh wow this is really interesting it's bringing out memories and I'm interacting and

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.360
what's this thing there's sort of a seesaw over here what am I supposed to do with that and I'd say

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.080
way out way out the rocks way out the words on both sides tell me what you think see see what

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:58.440
happens I was encouraging teachers to explore using a scientific method on a very basic level

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:04.520
um language and another level interact with each other and they're just doesn't really feel like an

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:09.000
art project anymore and I'd say well it isn't they just decided to call it an art project because

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.360
it's a diversion um it's actually there's a lot of science here when I use this with kids I'm

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.040
teaching them about levers um it's a way to to edge into to physics without telling them that

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.840
that's what it is because they might be afraid of it so one of the things that is sparked in me

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.000
with all these conversations is that we keep on talking about artists and scientists and how we

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.720
have to bring them together as though they're intrinsically separate things and steam itself

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.200
is just an expression of the fact that we're all doing all these things all the time and

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:43.000
and our institutions perhaps have separated us um unnecessarily and we're just trying to figure

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.320
out how to get back to where we all are which is we're all doing all these things all the time we

01:13:47.320 --> 01:14:00.680
just have to stop being afraid to do them at the same time amen to that um that was actually

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:07.320
going to be exactly what I wanted to say was that thank you it was it was good to comment on that

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.360
because I mean to please invite you to comment on that because we we are saying art and science and

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:22.920
when you say that you bring a lot with you like you bring a lot of um generalities scientists do

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:30.120
this and artists do this and we think like this and they think like that and um you know in science

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.360
communication we it's you know we're trying to we there are a lot of great conversations about this

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:41.080
like we're trying to give you something and and tell and like you you know you must take this in and

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:51.640
um what this whole thing is about is really opening your mind to um allowing whatever insights are

01:14:51.640 --> 01:15:00.040
are being sparked by either seeing science and art and things like that um and the fact that you

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:07.160
know there's like all this um fractal consequence that you never really know what the impact of what

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:19.240
you show someone or tell someone or um give someone uh will be and so I um I was just hoping you could

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.520
comment on exactly what she was saying you know in this as we're trying to build a future of

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:31.080
education calling it science and calling it art um to start with as opposed to just saying we're

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:41.240
learning about inquiry um and what all can you you know you as an individual now that you have

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:48.040
made insights and connections what can you bring to this um something that has been in my did anyone

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.480
else ought to see of the mind is ought to see of the mind something that was so that is exactly

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.640
what I've been thinking about all day you know because that's a kind of an area where

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:04.440
in terms of what you want out of a collaboration maybe it's not an end goal or product maybe it's

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:11.720
just to to let people figure out what they're good at and and people are going to be good at

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.040
different things so you don't have to take an artist and make them a scientist you know what

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:20.840
I'm just gonna take a scientist to make them an artist you just have to allow them to um really

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:28.120
figure out what they now see the world differently so that was more a comment but I was hoping that

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.960
the question of it would be if there was any feedback on that I'd give one and that is that

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.080
so we've talked about the institutions and the challenge of the institutions pose there's also

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:45.240
us and the challenge that we pose and by that I mean all of us um because all of us are

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:52.040
expert at something we have our domain expertise and I don't think we want to get rid of domain

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:58.920
expertise I think domain expertise is really valuable um and if you think about really high

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.720
performing teams in lots of aspects of life one of the things that's really characteristic of of

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:09.160
of really effective collaboration is that you can leverage domain expertise people can go back

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:18.200
and forth between being an expert at in their particular specialty their domain and have this

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.400
generalist knowledge of what we're trying to accomplish together and and to sort of fluidly

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.080
integrate those things so our institutions are are definitely not set up to do that and maybe

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.040
we're not as set up to do that as we'd like to be and maybe that's a very important thing for us

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.960
to think about and develop how do we actually nurture that without sacrificing that expertise

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:45.960
but also recognizing that we all have a tendency sometimes to use that expertise as a kind of

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:53.000
leverage that makes it harder to collaborate I think we should think more about um you know

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.920
infants and and really really young children how do they explore the world I mean they put it in

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:06.280
their mouth they smell it they feel it they taste it they hear it all of these senses that Howard

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:13.400
Gardner talks about Harvard education so this this sort of tactile world is even what artificial

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:20.440
intelligence is grappling with now how do we put that into computers and into the computer mind

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:29.240
so artists have a lot to offer because these are the tools that we learn in art school and so um

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:36.200
perhaps we have to go back and unlearn things when I was a student I wanted to draw like Matisse

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:43.960
and my professor said first you have to draw like Leonardo before you can draw like Matisse

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:52.920
so we can't reduce until we know what the reality is we have to train our vision and observation in

01:18:52.920 --> 01:19:00.440
the eastern society really knows about observing we don't observe enough we don't slow down enough

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:06.360
especially in our digital world but anyway I think playfulness going back to childhood would be a

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:13.160
really really good starting point for education for art and science and attention is relevant to

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.440
it was brought up earlier there I mean there are two forms there's depth of attention and there's

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:26.920
the attention span that gets so much attention and we need to think about the best ways to capture

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:35.080
both forms I just want to make a comment about the the not separating the artist and the scientist

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:42.440
and when people are going to go for the PhD or they're they're applying for things there's always

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:50.680
this piece where they ask you to rate the person's creativity you always have to rate the person's

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:57.080
creativity but in our education system we're not always you know we're separating these things and

01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:03.160
I think we need to not separate we need to be teaching in a way where maybe we're not always

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:10.760
on this art or calling it science because the the person who goes on to become a formal scientist

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:18.280
needs to have those moments of creative exploration to set up their hypothesis and that hypothesis

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:25.880
comes from this intrinsic hypothesis place that's this creative place that's the artistic space

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:34.760
so yeah so so there really isn't the dichotomy the way it's been set up because

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:41.800
this actively working scientists are very artistic as was brought up earlier in one of the questions

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:47.640
and talking about Einstein and his violin scientists even if they don't think they're artistic or

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:53.320
somewhere if they're practicing being artistic when they're sitting there they get that free time

01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:00.440
that freedom that room of their own should I say for for females but yeah we shouldn't separate

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:17.080
I'm nearly an artist I would say a hacker of technology a citizen hacker so to speak I've worked on a lot of

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:26.840
collaborations on art science art technology teams and one thing in the discussion that I'm hearing

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:32.520
you know it's interesting to be talking about this and to learning about other people's perspectives

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:40.680
about how does one teach people to collaborate how do you best open them up like take this

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:48.840
you know flower and just completely open it well from my experience the most interesting teams

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:57.720
and most interesting productions that we've created have come from listening to them listening to

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:08.520
other there I there's no one way to teach this isn't a linear discourse it's taking for example

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:18.600
a hyperactive kid taking putting building a community of collaboration from all different kinds of

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:25.800
challenges different cultures different interests a kid who's totally interested in music or another

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.760
who's interested in the sounds of silence then another another another kid who's like moving so

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:38.360
fast they can feel that they can they can feel the algorithms between their arms you know like moving

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:46.360
them there there's so many things that you can learn from the people that you're putting together

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:54.920
and how and and new and seeing how they create together one thing that I found really interesting

01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:02.360
for myself and on some teams were different concepts like reading different articles depending upon

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:09.720
the age groups of course that we're talking about reading different articles about scientific

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:21.320
discovery and thinking really in terms of synchronicity not in terms of disparate movement you know like

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:29.800
there's the past and there's the future and there's this line outliers are are incredibly

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:35.800
interesting and ed edify so much of what's going on in the world and I have found that

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.360
when there are groups that are that are put together and people are reading different material

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:49.480
and they're not embarrassed or made to feel uncomfortable to come up with their interpretations

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:55.320
which may be very much out of the box but they may be very brilliant after his i'm in

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:01.000
Einstein would not have been one of your your people how you could have collected that data

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.680
he didn't do that hit Malayva his wife did much better university than he did and he collaborated

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:13.000
with her on projects so it's you know on the theory of relativity they work together on it so you

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.800
you know i i just think it's important to listen to the groups that you put together

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:28.840
and from that their discussions of things you know i believe some really interesting

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:35.400
collaborations will come about for the teachers to then be able to learn from two because it's

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:42.840
all about learning from each other i'd like to add to that uh one of the things that we found

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:50.200
is that if you create the incentive structure for these collaborations you get a lot of you get a

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:55.880
better result so in the early days of Genspace when artists and designers started to show up and we

01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:01.480
had other folks who were with science backgrounds there was a real tension between these two these

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:11.240
groups uh the scientist would feel that the artist is you would be using them for their own artistic

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:16.840
purposes and they'd be feeling taken advantage of on the reverse side when the artist was when the

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:25.800
when the scientist was um more quote unquote in charge the artist would feel as though uh they

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:33.160
are being used to do PR for for the scientist and what i found uh over the last couple of years was

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:39.400
that scientists have found that the the publicity that comes from that collaboration uh ends up

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.280
being quite useful for their careers and what i've seen is that they there's been a proliferation

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:51.160
similar literally for the artist it has helped them as well after the scientist all of everyone

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:56.760
seems to benefit at least in some cases and so the more of that we see that the more we'll see

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:02.040
these collaborations i think the single most important thing we can do actually is to create

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:11.400
spaces and environments that foster collaboration maybe offers some some resources some models some

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:18.840
freedom to experience residencies and i think the culture has been changing in a way to promote this

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:27.560
um just some extent to some extent i think i i haven't seen great evidence that the culture

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:33.800
within formal education is deeply changing to support that although i do see examples of it

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:40.360
happening all over the place i would say the new Minerva institute relatively new in california

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:47.960
part of the clearmont system barred the changes they've made to introduce science into what was

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:58.040
previously an arts curriculum um and again i don't think we can give too much praise to the role

01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:06.120
that leonardo has played in fostering a lot of this and and but k12 is a tough yeah

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:20.200
great um i'm going to try to keep this brief um first off okay thank you for doing this um i'm

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:26.200
as many of you probably are i don't think i ever had a choice in where i was going to fall in a

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:32.360
career path my undergrad experiences medical illustration my grad experiences museum exhibition

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:37.080
design in between i've done a little bit of everything else and when you are an interdisciplinary and

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:44.920
and when you don't feel like you fit anywhere life can get a little scary can't it so to hear

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:51.000
that you've been uh working on these projects these collaborations these foundations you're doing

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.920
this outreach it's really heartwarming but you need to keep doing it

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:08.520
because uh a lot of people want to do this i've been teaching high schoolers for quite a few years now

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.600
in fine arts and trying to rope in as much chemistry into my dye lessons as i can

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:24.840
so you keep keep just doing it but um remember that doing this being able to go out on a limb

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:31.160
and chase your dream and exist in an interstitial space where you may not have a safety net is a

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:38.360
privilege and if we want to bring more people into this not just a marriage of arts and sciences

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:43.880
but every single identity that we can possibly rope in because every identity brings its own

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:53.880
perspective to any given question and who knows which one's going to be useful which one's going

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.160
to crack the code and which one's going to blow everything out of the water

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:08.760
so how do you think you want to grow and maintain a support network not just for kids to bring them

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:13.800
up and not just for students to feed them while they're in school but for the adults they'll become

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:22.600
thank you for your comment i think um i wanted to let you know a nice sentiment uh which is good

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:28.920
for everyone to know so in the in august of uh last or this year rather uh sire magazine published

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.000
a steam issue and this was the first collection of a bunch of steam articles many people in this

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.360
room contributed to it um and there were a lot of different viewpoints a lot of different approaches

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.240
etc but it was just kind of a general roundup and uh the one thing that everyone agreed on is that

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:50.120
we did steam because we thought it was the right thing to do and we we didn't have to explain why

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.800
i was just like yeah of course it's the right thing to do so don't worry people keep doing it

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:07.480
hello again everyone um i am really interested in the the future of steam education as it applies

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:13.560
and you know k-12 but also bringing it into the university and something i've been thinking about

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:21.080
is how we're disseminating what we've learned from these projects that that we're working on so

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:28.760
how are you guys putting out um some of the results that you talked about you know we have

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:35.720
data or your course sounds absolutely amazing you know how would how would someone else you know is

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:43.960
there is there a model um that someone can would be able to take or access um because when i i hear

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:50.120
about the things i'm usually in a room with the person and um on the big wide world of the of

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:57.160
the internet it's it's harder to find and it's not so much um covered in a lot of the scholarly

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:03.640
articles yet so how are you guys um working to to get that information out in the arabore journal

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:11.400
yeah there's um roger what is the name of the woman who is putting together the collection of steam

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:20.040
approaches you know i'm talking about can you give him that microphone

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.920
because this is good information to her and her name is kathryn evans um we're working on the

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:34.840
idea of a cloud curriculum project so anybody who's been developing a syllabus shares it with other

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:42.120
people um i call it kind of like a gated commons you can only get in by contributing your attempts

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:50.920
um and it's it's got an acronym c dash curriculum development in art science and humanities

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:56.840
so if you google it you'll find the website we're about to announce it and invite people to do

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:04.440
curriculum sharing online because one of the problems is as you were just saying it's so

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:10.600
difficult to find the other people who've maybe taught for a couple years and have some best

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:17.880
practices or new practices there's a couple of other major places to look one one is informal

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:26.120
science.org um and that's a tremendous resource uh we certainly publish all of our major data on

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:32.440
there and so do many other people and you can find a vast amount on there um the innovation

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:38.760
collaborative and if you can google them and they've developed a lot of best practices and have

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.760
materials around that and with a lot more coming certainly our website also has even more detailed

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:49.560
data and information on our work and also a fair amount of other things that we're able to find

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:54.760
out and post that we think are of interest to to that work and to people who are interested in

01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:02.440
in in this domain uh and so artofsciencelearning.org lots you can find there uh just to add to that

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:08.600
biodesignchallenge.org uh so we've been working with i think we've we've hit the hundred mark hundred

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:17.240
plus uh university educators who have been working at the intersection of biology and art and design

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:25.480
uh i have their sample i have samples of their curricula online as well as a library of resources

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:33.080
uh of reading materials from all from Foucault all the way to um you know complicated articles on

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:39.320
uh science articles on CRISPR uh which are which is a fantastic resource for anyone who's developing

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:45.960
their own curriculum. Speaking of Foucault uh anyone interested in data mining from my point of view

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:53.880
uh might be interested in following the work of the Stanford literary lab which has uh convincingly

01:33:53.880 --> 01:34:03.320
found new ways to think about uh making sense of vast quantities of literary data so. I think we

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:11.800
need we need something that's more centralized so I so i'm an academic and you know i do my work

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:17.720
my own little cloud earth so I think what we're hearing here it's bringing all these people together

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:21.160
and each person saying oh I have this I have this and then you'll sit and you'll google and you'll

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:27.000
search for it but in bringing us all together here the beauty of today is that we're all in this

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.920
room and it sounds to me like we need some place where we can all be together in a virtual room

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:39.240
that's where all of these pieces that people are you know saying now are available and

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:47.000
I'm it's easy to to find these things I would love to share but as we've talked about earlier

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.440
in the day when we write our grants and we're talking about our broader impacts you know I've

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:58.520
applied to try to get money to be able to share my approach to be able to teach teachers what I've

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:04.920
done I've taught it four times I'll share my my syllabus but it's hard to get money for being

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:11.400
able to to share these things and teach people what you think you've learned and I don't know how

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.800
we're going to begin to do that and this is where we say we have academia we have you know not-for-profit

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:24.120
academia not-for-profit I think the not-for-profits have to try to bring in us who are in academia

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:28.680
because we're always going to not-for-profits to try to get money to be able to do our things

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:34.840
and disseminate but unless we get that money and we have that free time to disseminate we can't do it

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:41.640
the way we might want to. Okay we yeah we have time for one last quick question.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:48.200
We will make the two quick questions and let's order night.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:57.320
Do we have no profit and academic media in the round table do you think we are seeing the

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:04.600
birth of a new field a new interdisciplinary field called art science or called science art

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:11.960
that is not much separated art and science just like biochemistry doesn't appear it doesn't split

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:20.040
biology and chemistry and is biochemists and astrophysics astrophysics is not more astronomy

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:27.240
nor physics do you think we are seeing the birds of this new field in an environment like this

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.920
the second question is do you think the academy will

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:42.600
grill will help to grow up this field because for instance in our academy in Brazil we have a

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:51.480
master in PhD course since 2004 called education for bioscience and health in which we have

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.920
a line of research of science and art and we have 10 teases PhD teases on science and art

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:04.360
but I don't know other academies on the world that that give this liberty this freedom to

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.640
think out of the box like this like we are doing here so this question before the night.

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:17.400
I just want to make a plug first off for Pearl Premis who was one of the first people to dance

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:26.760
her PhD and yeah I think we need a new a new academy that will begin to look at this today I

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:32.120
began to wonder what happened to Black Mountain College what happened to this kind of place where

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:39.960
people want to work this way where people come together like this in scholarship to to have these

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:46.360
conversations and and it's not silos but I don't know how that would happen and where the money is

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:53.240
for that kind of scholarship to occur. Okay well I think your questions are good ones to also

01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:02.360
revisit tomorrow so thank you guys so much for this wonderful panel this concludes our day together

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:10.840
two quick announcements tomorrow morning we're starting at 10 a.m. we'll open the doors at 9.30

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:17.000
number two you are all invited to an art exhibit opening tonight that Syart Center is hosting

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.920
10 blocks from here the address is 208 73rd street there's a flyer on the table out there

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:33.960
art reception wine amazing science based art please join us from seven to nine 30
