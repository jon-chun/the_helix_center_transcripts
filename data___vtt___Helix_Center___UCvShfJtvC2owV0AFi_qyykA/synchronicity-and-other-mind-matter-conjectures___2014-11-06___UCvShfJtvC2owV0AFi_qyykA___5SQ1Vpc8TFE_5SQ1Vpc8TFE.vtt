WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
I am Edner Sesien, I'm Director of the Helix Center, which is an inter-decip- center which

00:09.520 --> 00:16.960
organizes interdisciplinary round tables and is located on 82nd circuit between 3rd Avenue

00:16.960 --> 00:19.160
and 2nd Avenue.

00:19.160 --> 00:25.200
We have a number of programs coming up that I just mentioned to you, but you have probably

00:25.200 --> 00:27.680
picked up the flyers out there.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.720
We have Complexity and Emergence on November 15th.

00:31.720 --> 00:39.880
We have French Surrealism on December 6th and Immortality on December 13th.

00:39.880 --> 00:47.840
The program tonight, Synchronicity and Other Mind, Matter, Conjecture, were sponsored by

00:47.840 --> 00:53.480
the Young Encyclopedia Association and Helix.

00:53.480 --> 00:58.680
As some of you may know, this is the second in the series on synchronicity, both of which

00:58.680 --> 01:02.320
were organized by Beverly Zabrizki.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.600
I just want to take this opportunity to tell her how appreciative we are for all her help

01:08.600 --> 01:16.320
to Helix and to express my wish that we can continue to be a beneficiary of her knowledge

01:16.320 --> 01:18.760
and wisdom moving into the future.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
Thank you.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.760
Good evening.

01:24.760 --> 01:35.680
I'm Donald Krasing, President of the Union Psychoanalytic Association.

01:35.680 --> 01:41.240
We too have flyers and I hope you get information on the way in.

01:41.240 --> 01:47.760
I really want to say before we get started what it's delighted is to be participating

01:47.760 --> 01:56.360
in the second collaborative effort with the Helix Center and capitalizing on the excitement

01:56.360 --> 01:58.760
that we generate in the spring.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.760
And with that, I'll turn you over to our moderator, Beverly Zabrizki.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Good evening.

02:03.760 --> 02:11.760
So, I'm glad you came to leave with us tonight as we discuss this very difficult topic.

02:11.760 --> 02:18.760
And as was mentioned, it's the second time we tried to address the speech.

02:18.760 --> 02:26.760
It's especially, I think, in the spirit of the Jungian tradition and particularly the

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
J.K.A.

02:27.760 --> 02:38.560
my organization that we do such an event with Helix at a certain point in his career, Jung

02:38.560 --> 02:43.200
stopped going to just analytic conferences.

02:43.200 --> 02:52.240
And instead, he converged a group called the Aeronos Roundtable, which was held in Switzerland

02:52.240 --> 02:55.680
with scholars from all the different disciplines.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.520
And the pathologist, endologist, scientist, poets.

03:01.520 --> 03:10.960
And he felt that he was looking for analogies from whatever field existed because he saw

03:10.960 --> 03:14.760
it all as expressions of the psyche.

03:14.760 --> 03:23.560
That art, religion, science, itself, philosophy all emerged from the human psyche.

03:23.560 --> 03:30.520
And so everything is relevant to its experience and to the way it manifests.

03:30.520 --> 03:38.520
And so I think we've been particularly drawn to Helix because it picks up that same model

03:38.520 --> 03:41.520
and brings people together.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.520
The one big difference between Aeronos and the Roundtable format here is that these

03:48.520 --> 03:54.520
were all scholars who wrote very scholarly papers and read them and presented them.

03:54.520 --> 04:01.520
And we come together on the Helix model, which is a little bit more like a free-for-all.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.520
And people don't really know each other ahead of time.

04:04.520 --> 04:10.520
And one of the objects is that the speakers learned a great deal from each other.

04:10.520 --> 04:14.520
And I think that happened the last time.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.520
And I thought that happens again tonight.

04:17.520 --> 04:25.520
I'm just going to give a couple of quotes and then I'm going to ask my colleagues here

04:25.520 --> 04:28.520
to introduce themselves.

04:28.520 --> 04:34.520
And then we will start the discussion and see where it goes.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.520
And I'll say if they're too modest, I'll say a few things about them.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.520
So please be as cold as possible.

04:41.520 --> 04:48.520
I'm just so proud of myself.

04:48.520 --> 04:53.520
Yoke was especially influenced by William James.

04:53.520 --> 05:00.520
And William James's notions of the margins of consciousness and the varieties of experience.

05:00.520 --> 05:07.520
And so following that idea, he tended to go toward the margins of consciousness and study

05:07.520 --> 05:18.520
and one of the issues that he noticed was how very often he himself initiated a whole new

05:18.520 --> 05:25.520
process in his life and how often his patients did because they had an experience that seemed

05:25.520 --> 05:27.520
to them quite uncanny.

05:27.520 --> 05:35.520
A variety of themes that came together somewhat simultaneously.

05:35.520 --> 05:42.520
And so for instance, there would be an inner image or a dream image and then one would meet

05:42.520 --> 05:45.520
that figure in life.

05:45.520 --> 05:54.520
And that started him off on a whole exploration of what he called meaningful but eight causal

05:54.520 --> 05:58.520
coincidences, which he terms in ethnicity.

05:58.520 --> 06:05.520
And he called it synchronicity because there was a factor in time where the person would

06:05.520 --> 06:12.520
have an inner experience or there'd be an outer event, there'd be a certain convergence of

06:12.520 --> 06:15.520
seeing these similarities or dissimilarities.

06:15.520 --> 06:24.520
But there was no way to explain why there was this convergence of something that was experienced

06:24.520 --> 06:28.520
by an individual who was very meaningful.

06:28.520 --> 06:33.520
And I'd just like to give you a couple of quotes here.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.520
As someone who was trying to deal with the whole question of mind and matter, I had my

06:38.520 --> 06:44.520
comeuppance before I came to that because I had all my notes in my printer and there was

06:44.520 --> 06:47.520
a paper jam and no matter what I did, I couldn't get them out.

06:47.520 --> 06:53.520
So I'm reading this off and I've had which I'm not quite used to, so bear with me.

06:53.520 --> 07:00.520
You wrote, the problem with synchronicity has puzzled me for a long time ever since the

07:00.520 --> 07:01.520
middle 1920s.

07:01.520 --> 07:07.520
When I was investigating the phenomena of the collective unconscious and kept on coming

07:07.520 --> 07:15.520
across connections, which I simply could not explain as chance groupings or runs.

07:15.520 --> 07:21.520
What I found were coincidences which were connected so meaningfully that their chance

07:21.520 --> 07:26.520
of concurrence would represent a degree of improbability.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.520
So I hope you're able to follow that.

07:30.520 --> 07:38.520
And then he writes 30 years later, 30 years later, Pauli, both found Pauli, the local

07:38.520 --> 07:43.520
Laura, Gloria, and quantitative physicist, has prompted me to write my thoughts on the

07:43.520 --> 07:45.520
concept of synchronicity.

07:45.520 --> 07:52.520
Since physicists are the only people nowadays who would be able to deal with such a concept

07:52.520 --> 07:58.520
successfully, it is from a physicist that I hope to meet with a critical understanding.

07:58.520 --> 08:05.520
Although, as you will see, the empirical basis, the experience seems to lie wholly in the

08:05.520 --> 08:07.520
realm of the psyche.

08:07.520 --> 08:14.520
So it's on that basis that we sit here tonight, two Jungian analysts, two physicists, and

08:14.520 --> 08:21.520
philosopher of science, that's the correct way to describe personod.

08:21.520 --> 08:27.520
And now I would just like them to tell you about themselves and why they are drawn to

08:27.520 --> 08:34.520
the subject and their entry point to myself.

08:34.520 --> 08:44.520
My background is in philosophy and chemistry, kept hopping back and forth between those two

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
fields.

08:45.520 --> 08:51.520
Currently I teach at New York University in the School of Liberal Studies, and I teach

08:51.520 --> 08:56.520
both the science requirement and the humanities requirement.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.520
And I'm very happy to be here.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.520
This is one of those few places where, as you said, we can actually mix it up and do many

09:02.520 --> 09:04.520
things at the same time.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.520
Harold, I'm Harold.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.520
I'm Harold.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.520
At once, my mind, you said we shouldn't be too humble.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.520
So I'm known as the Summit of Humility.

09:14.520 --> 09:23.520
And I have been educated as a physicist.

09:23.520 --> 09:30.520
I'm now working at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, which is very close

09:30.520 --> 09:35.520
to the place where you, together with the partly developed ideas.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.520
And the partly young dialogue, as we called it previously, now we call it a little bit

09:40.520 --> 09:43.520
more viciously, the partly human conjecture.

09:43.520 --> 09:51.520
Land has been a topic of concern for me since more than 20 years.

09:51.520 --> 09:57.520
And I don't want to make the story too long, but we can, maybe in the discussion, we can

09:57.520 --> 10:01.520
go into more details of how this path actually developed.

10:01.520 --> 10:06.520
But, yeah, here I am, and I'm really looking forward to this.

10:06.520 --> 10:11.520
So Harold is the author of numerous scholarly articles.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.520
He is the editor of Journal.

10:14.520 --> 10:20.520
He conducts a research as a psychological institute in Germany.

10:20.520 --> 10:28.520
And he has exposed himself to Congress's immune aid analysts, which I think is incredibly brave.

10:28.520 --> 10:33.520
And he's been very generous in sharing his knowledge.

10:33.520 --> 10:37.520
And Joe, Harold, my colleague.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.520
Hello, I know some of you.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.520
It's good to see you here.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.520
In terms of my background that brings me to this, I actually, like far as I've trained

10:48.520 --> 10:53.520
a person to chemistry, that's why I'm being a student, a lot of chemistry.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.520
I have some shared interests across these two disciplines as well.

10:58.520 --> 11:05.520
However, as a topic of scholarly interest, it really emerged out of my clinical work,

11:05.520 --> 11:10.520
out of a number of trauma cases that I had in the late 80s and early 90s, where a number

11:10.520 --> 11:13.520
of rather extraordinary events started to happen.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.520
And the question was how to clinically understand them.

11:17.520 --> 11:24.520
Probably back to a revision of going support, where did he give his ideas, how did he articulate these ideas.

11:24.520 --> 11:29.520
And itself is an ongoing story, as many of us know, because with the vet book,

11:29.520 --> 11:35.520
he got metal pieces of his narrative that we didn't have on the start of all these stories.

11:35.520 --> 11:42.520
So I find myself being drawn into a little hole in my call, spiritual ancestry,

11:42.520 --> 11:47.520
and where the problem is about these.

11:47.520 --> 11:54.520
Not just somebody who has looked backwards, but also with a gender space way to look forward.

11:54.520 --> 11:59.520
I think this is a question of art, I'm sure, in our culture.

11:59.520 --> 12:04.520
The way that this conjecture, I think that's the way they're right, the main point of this point,

12:04.520 --> 12:09.520
has something that points us, not backwards, but forwards.

12:09.520 --> 12:18.520
Hi, my name is Eker Schuwery, and without a shadow of immunity, I am the least qualified psychologist in this room.

12:18.520 --> 12:24.520
I'm competing outside of the psychology, but I have interest in this field, I should say why.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.520
I'm a professor of applied physics at Princeton University.

12:27.520 --> 12:34.520
My interests have to do with the space production, new concepts for a protonic space practice space.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.520
The process I come to psychology is I have also a research area called

12:39.520 --> 12:45.520
Psycho-Acoistics, how humans perceive sound, and how sound and music, especially music, can be recorded,

12:45.520 --> 12:49.520
or produced in 3D to approach virtual reality.

12:49.520 --> 12:57.520
My interest in this topic stems from my being intrigued by any time a people's psychology psychologist

12:57.520 --> 13:04.520
applied physics to the concepts or try to combine psychology and physics.

13:04.520 --> 13:11.520
In the case of the topic tonight, this started as early as the first probably,

13:11.520 --> 13:17.520
maybe even before, I'll start with any high-style of dinners in the early part of the century.

13:17.520 --> 13:26.520
The idea of developing a system, a worldview that combines minor matter in one construct,

13:26.520 --> 13:33.520
is to take them both, and can you attempt to marry physics into it, make my attention.

13:33.520 --> 13:40.520
As an outsider, I've been reading papers by our panelists today, and I have a person's questions.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.520
My role, as I see it myself, is not as much a skeptic,

13:45.520 --> 13:50.520
or if I am as a tech advisor as I can be, and I think I will be.

13:50.520 --> 13:58.520
But I am asking questions to go, so I stand to learn most from today's discussion.

13:58.520 --> 14:09.520
Paulie was a brilliant young man who I think he was still very young when he developed one of the major theories,

14:09.520 --> 14:13.520
physics, the exclusion principle.

14:13.520 --> 14:20.520
And he was very exacting, and he was called the scourge of physics, or the conscience of physics.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.520
And so we have Edgar here tonight.

14:24.520 --> 14:35.520
But that's an integral to the scourge of any obfuscation that we might go into.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.520
So, the borrowing was the Paulie effect, you know, Paulie, but whatever you want in the room,

14:40.520 --> 14:45.520
I make me stop working, so hopefully the microphones won't be able to stay with us.

14:45.520 --> 14:52.520
Yes, but yes, every place Paulie entered something broke.

14:52.520 --> 15:01.520
So he was very dangerous to have a laboratory, which was one reason he was not invited to the production of the I Am Bomb.

15:01.520 --> 15:09.520
And I think that was possible to fix so much of a difficult phenomenon in this past year,

15:09.520 --> 15:12.520
because he had this reputation.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.520
That was another exclusion principle.

15:14.520 --> 15:20.520
Joe, Joe is written the most cutting edge bull-penseachronicity,

15:20.520 --> 15:24.520
which is available online, Texas A&M.

15:24.520 --> 15:29.520
He was president of the International Association of Analytical Psychology,

15:29.520 --> 15:33.520
which is the International Food Surprising and Analyst.

15:33.520 --> 15:40.520
Again, this taught and lectured a great deal and has been a very good friend.

15:40.520 --> 15:44.520
And Edgar is head of the aerospace department at Princeton.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.520
He has one laboratory that is an airplane hangar.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.520
And another one that is a sound studio.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.520
So that gives you a sense.

15:54.520 --> 16:00.520
And one of the great questions that comes up about this mind-matter correlation

16:00.520 --> 16:09.520
is it's not only what does the mind perceive and take in about what's going on in the material world,

16:09.520 --> 16:17.520
it's also how is the human mind able to penetrate the material world?

16:17.520 --> 16:26.520
So how is it that a mind inside someone's head can penetrate how to send the rocket into space?

16:26.520 --> 16:31.520
You know, that is one of the great, I think, questions.

16:31.520 --> 16:40.520
There's a wonder of scientists in the Chalmers who talks about the great problem of consciousness,

16:40.520 --> 16:48.520
but I think this idea of synchronicity extends it a bit to what is the place of consciousness in the world?

16:48.520 --> 16:51.520
What is the place of consciousness in the universe?

16:51.520 --> 16:55.520
And how does it function? And why is it here?

16:55.520 --> 16:59.520
And so I hope these are all topics that we can cover.

16:59.520 --> 17:06.520
Just to get a little historical background and then we'll just get going on some of the topics.

17:06.520 --> 17:12.520
Jung was a professor at the A. Taehah where Harold is now.

17:12.520 --> 17:18.520
And at the same time there was a young professor named Albert Einstein who didn't have much money.

17:18.520 --> 17:25.520
So Jung kept inviting him to his house for dinner to feed him and to learn what he could.

17:25.520 --> 17:34.520
And I think that these conversations with Albert Einstein had a huge effect on Jung's whole trajectory

17:34.520 --> 17:43.520
because it was in the summer of 1911 and 1912 when he wrote to Freud that he was having these conversations

17:43.520 --> 17:48.520
with the young physicist about the nature of light.

17:48.520 --> 17:54.520
And why not to describe Einstein's theory at the quantum of energy?

17:54.520 --> 18:05.520
Shortly after that Jung separated from Freud mostly around the topic of how all psychic energy could not be considered sexual.

18:05.520 --> 18:18.520
That you know this sense of the magnitude of how this young physicist was dealing with energy made it impossible for Jung to reduce it all

18:18.520 --> 18:28.520
to sexuality being the source of all forms of psychic energy in sort of hidden or obvious ways.

18:28.520 --> 18:32.520
And so he threw out his life.

18:32.520 --> 18:40.520
Thankfully, Jung thinks he felt that Einstein and then he got involved with this young physicist again.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.520
Jung was 55. Wilfmann Pauli was 30.

18:44.520 --> 18:49.520
He already was recognized as the brilliant but very disturbed.

18:49.520 --> 18:56.520
And so he came to Jung to ask for help with his psyche.

18:56.520 --> 19:07.520
And Jung said him to someone else to do analysis with but then Pauli gave Jung 1400 of his dreams that he had carefully worked on

19:07.520 --> 19:15.520
and made all sorts of associations and applications.

19:15.520 --> 19:23.520
And that became the material for a book that Jung then wrote called Psychology in Alchemy.

19:23.520 --> 19:31.520
And then after that he and Pauli started a correspondence which is then published by Princeton Press while Adam and Architite.

19:31.520 --> 19:40.520
And they worked out in this correspondence and in their meetings the theory of synchronicity that we're going to talk about tonight.

19:40.520 --> 19:48.520
So, Joe, do you want to start off with it in terms of how to do it from a psychological issue?

19:48.520 --> 19:56.520
And then Harold, would you give something about your entry to it?

19:56.520 --> 20:01.520
I guess where I like to start is that it was experiential freedom.

20:01.520 --> 20:06.520
This was not an abstract concept for him as part of his lived experience.

20:06.520 --> 20:18.520
And it started with some of the things that began to happen to him around the break with Freud and his own psychological struggles with that.

20:18.520 --> 20:24.520
He underwent a very intense process that's chronicled in the red book.

20:24.520 --> 20:46.520
But it's really when he is able to come through that and simultaneously World War I breaks up that he realizes that the struggle that he's undergone is mirrored in some way in the world and that's a problem for him because he neither believes himself to be a prophet, nor does he really think he's a mad man.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.520
And so the question of how does this influence?

20:49.520 --> 20:54.520
I guess in another 15 years before he's able to make an exit from that.

20:54.520 --> 21:04.520
The way he exits from that is that he is working a very deep way drawing these mandala images on a regular basis.

21:04.520 --> 21:17.520
And in the midst of a particularly gripping one, he received a manuscript from a close friend in China, Richard Wilhelm, which ultimately becomes the secret of the Golden Blower.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.520
And Wilhelm was writing him and asking him to do a commentary on this.

21:21.520 --> 21:31.520
And you'll look at the Vajramandala that's in there and he was stunned because for him it was a rather close replication of the material that he was working on.

21:31.520 --> 21:39.520
And after that, he's heard of this as a phenomenon that I can stop this red book business and return to the world of science.

21:39.520 --> 21:58.520
And it's an interesting conundrum. What does he mean by that? Part of the way I would understand it to enter from a psychological sense is that he has now realized that his dilemma of neither prophecy or madness as a solution comes with the notion that there may be a level of objective meaning

21:58.520 --> 22:15.520
that is part of human experience. And how we enter that is key. Clinically this is what comes up over and over again. Anyone who does depth work, I won't do it now to take the time, but I've got some work from some psychoanalysts who are not at all influenced by doing it.

22:15.520 --> 22:28.520
But when they present some of their clinical material, strikingly working at a deep level, these kinds of events, this correlation between what's happening internally and what's happening externally show up again and again.

22:28.520 --> 22:48.520
So this correlation that can't be easily ignored, that has great emotional impact and often is transformative for people, it comes for me a extremely important psychological tool. I don't think we can control it and manipulate it, but we do have to work with the levels of reality

22:48.520 --> 22:58.520
that the mind is able to penetrate into from a psychological side. And then I think it's our colleagues on the matter side that we're interested in being in dialogue with.

22:58.520 --> 23:08.520
Just to ground that, do you get any sample of the kind of synchronicity that either patients report or do you experience in the classroom?

23:08.520 --> 23:21.520
My own argument here, which is a little different than Jung's, is I think there's a spectrum that that is there are varying levels of intensity. And in fact, the model that he puts forward in this probably Jung conjecture

23:21.520 --> 23:35.520
actually gives us some tools to talk about that spectrum of these things because Jung as a pioneer looked for the largest examples, and I can give you one, you know, I was working with someone who would have very severe trauma history.

23:35.520 --> 23:45.520
Every time I would leave for more than a week, we would have to put her in the hospital so that self-destructive behaviors would get out of control.

23:45.520 --> 23:53.520
And finally, after about a year and a half of this rather continued work, she asked if she could have a phone call between...

23:53.520 --> 24:01.520
Well, I was awake. That's a course of breach of normal analytic protocol, but after some consultation, I decided to do this.

24:01.520 --> 24:11.520
And when I got on the phone with her, the first thing she said, I'm in Germany, asked her why she was asking me how that was. That was in the Caribbean, frankly.

24:11.520 --> 24:16.520
And she said, well, I haven't dreamed last night, you were in the black forest and I couldn't find you.

24:16.520 --> 24:22.520
And it obviously spoke to a level of disorganization and distress of this person in the cell phone.

24:22.520 --> 24:32.520
And I worked for the remainder of the time on the phone, helping contend that. And in fact, the woman was able to stay out of the hospital during that period.

24:32.520 --> 24:45.520
The next day, I was beginning a course in diving, well, we were in the Caribbean, and I was asked to go out for my maiden dive, the first dive in open water.

24:45.520 --> 24:53.520
And I, with some trepidation, agreed, and then the dive master said he would be my dive buddy.

24:53.520 --> 25:00.520
And as we got out there, he'd pull us around and say, let me tell you about the site today, it's called the black forest.

25:00.520 --> 25:04.520
And so there's this moment of crisis, obviously, you know, what am I jumping into?

25:04.520 --> 25:11.520
It's psychologically what's happened between the patient and myself as a pre-cognitive dream?

25:11.520 --> 25:15.520
What is the quality of this field of interaction between us?

25:15.520 --> 25:26.520
And one of the things, I won't go into a long detail, I won't close it quickly, but one of the things that I would be most impressed with is that we were both in an image that we shared that is the black forest.

25:26.520 --> 25:39.520
Hers was one of a sort of world of Grimm's fairy tales, childhood monsters, mine turned out to be black coral, which was an exquisite dive, that was one of the more transcendent moments in my life.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.520
And yet here we are both in the same image.

25:42.520 --> 26:02.520
I obviously had been overly rational with her, and I'd been hit by her irrationality, and together we have been brought into what I would call an emergent space, this edge of order and chaos, where this image of the black forest was manifesting in both of our lives in different ways, but in very parallel and meaningful ways.

26:02.520 --> 26:24.520
Yeah, I think it's important to say that there is one really essential commonality between the entry points of no, as is an image before, and power into this whole issue of what we would call the might matter for relations or like a physical correlation.

26:24.520 --> 26:33.520
And so, conicities are special cases, in a way, and this commonality is personal experience, really.

26:33.520 --> 26:41.520
You mentioned that you have these experiences, and it has therapeutic practice over and over again.

26:41.520 --> 26:53.520
How do you have them in his personal crisis in his life very much in the 1930s, 31, 32, which was actually the reason why he went to you and met him.

26:53.520 --> 26:59.520
And then also, I mean, I can mention these, how they affect things.

26:59.520 --> 27:05.520
Things would break when he entered laboratories of colleagues and stuff like that.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.520
So he had these experiences.

27:07.520 --> 27:23.520
But now the difference between a psychologist like Jung and the physicist like Pauli in how they confront themselves with these experiences is that Pauli would never tell people about his anecdotal experiences.

27:23.520 --> 27:28.520
He would try to find the systematic way to understand him.

27:28.520 --> 27:41.520
And he would enter into a public discussion only at the level of when he had a theoretical framework, at least an idea, how to talk about these things in a scientifically coherent fashion, like you say.

27:41.520 --> 27:47.520
And of course, we all know this is a very significant problem for these things.

27:47.520 --> 27:59.520
But that also makes the topic so interesting for us today.

27:59.520 --> 28:15.520
And what we now have from the Pauli EU correspondence and also from publications that you published and also with Pauli published in Jones and books, we have sort of fragments of something that might one day become a theory.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.520
It's not one in fragments, but we look at the material.

28:18.520 --> 28:33.520
And I think the real work that people like me and many others have been trying to do is reconstruct from these scattered remarks and fragments reconstruct what I would call a coherent framework of thinking.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.520
It's not near the theory.

28:35.520 --> 28:50.520
I really try to do it a long way, but it's a kind of attempt to reconstruct a historically existing material and bring it into a form that may allow us to understand these experiences in a better way.

28:50.520 --> 29:07.520
And for a physicist, it's a huge step to go outside physics, to go to experiences which are obviously not physically experiments or something like that.

29:07.520 --> 29:26.520
And we're really talking about the meaning of two spirits, two minds, two of the greatest minds of the 20th century, which try to approach this revolutionary thing, which we might call relationships between the mental and material.

29:26.520 --> 29:30.520
And you haven't mentioned Dave Thomas.

29:30.520 --> 29:36.520
You know Dave Thomas is since a few weeks, he's a member of the faculty here at New York University.

29:36.520 --> 29:56.520
And he has coined the notion of the heart problem of consciousness and I think this is very much related to the Pauli Jung debate, to the Pauli Jung conjecture I should say, as many other themes that are now discussed in the philosophy of mind and philosophy of science are related to this.

29:56.520 --> 30:09.520
And let me just finish with one remark, which was one observation that I actually am making since one or two years on conferences and also discussions with colleagues.

30:09.520 --> 30:20.520
The program that for a long time was considered the program in the philosophy of science, the physicalist program to reduce everything to physics.

30:20.520 --> 30:44.520
That has created now a lot of disappointment. There were huge promises in the 1990s, everybody was talking about the decade of the brain, right? And the decade of the brain is still somehow there, but people get more and more frustrated because the big problems could not be solved after 20, 25, 30 years by this, what I call the physicalist approach.

30:44.520 --> 30:52.520
And now people are looking for alternatives more and more at big conferences, this is really a theme which is discussed very openly.

30:52.520 --> 31:13.520
And I think the Pauli Jung stuff is one of the really viable alternatives, the physicalist, and that's why it has a very good chance to go beyond the psychoanalyst societies and beyond the people who know Pauli from the history of science point of view, it really becomes a research talk.

31:13.520 --> 31:18.520
And that's great.

31:18.520 --> 31:36.520
Thank you. One fact that is implicit and becoming more explicit is inside deep that the human mind can not only relate to the world around it, but decipher it.

31:36.520 --> 31:49.520
And also that it's the mind that notices unusual connections that cannot be explained with our understanding of what causality is.

31:49.520 --> 32:08.520
Is this whole idea of what is now called the mind, brain, or the mind, body continuum or the psychophysical world implicit in that is that the whole of the world's interconnected.

32:08.520 --> 32:22.520
And that the human mind is in an interconnected relationship with the world that now from the psychological point of view we register both unconsciously and consciously.

32:22.520 --> 32:32.520
Synchronicities are experienced as a kind of shock, as a kind of surprise, they seem anomalous.

32:32.520 --> 32:51.520
And what I have seen both in my own life and in the life of patients is that it's very often asking for very particular embodiment and coming into the presence and relating to the world from that.

32:51.520 --> 33:07.520
A further implication is that we are not just a hoot but a what. And that through our whatness that we are related to the whatness of the world.

33:07.520 --> 33:33.520
And from that sense of that experience that here we are somehow in some juncture where we are observing connections that we then are in this relation to the world that needs to have a responsiveness and responsibility that comes with it, the whatness of the world.

33:33.520 --> 33:45.520
So it develops I think into a very large kind of environmental sensitivity and a sense of relationship to the planet.

33:45.520 --> 33:53.520
That is why Jung talked about a certain kind of conscience coming along with experiences of sacredness.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.520
I just wanted to play that out a bit.

33:56.520 --> 34:03.520
I could continue both of these lines.

34:03.520 --> 34:08.520
The philosophy of science did has come to an impasse.

34:08.520 --> 34:17.520
It's been long coming since about the 50s and 60s when the whole program will have a positiveism and physicalism is questioned.

34:17.520 --> 34:27.520
And the expectations didn't come to fruition as dreamed up.

34:27.520 --> 34:34.520
In the meantime, a different program in philosophy of science came up that really addresses this issue of responsibility and conscience.

34:34.520 --> 34:51.520
The branch of it has different names but essentially looking at the sociology of science looking at the philosophy of science in practice as it's actually carried out within its social political context within its cultural context.

34:51.520 --> 35:15.520
Studies that have been done in that area tend to raise the awareness of scientists, well a certain general public, but the scientists themselves, that what they're doing has impact in a broad sense far beyond the theoretical frameworks that they're trying to perfect.

35:15.520 --> 35:24.520
Okay, so I will now zoom back into the pairing of Pauli and Jung.

35:24.520 --> 35:34.520
Here you have a physicist and a psychologist who in our framework of Western science as we have it are as far apart as you can get.

35:34.520 --> 35:39.520
They're about far enough that they would meet if this were a circle, which they in fact did.

35:39.520 --> 35:51.520
And the conjecture really is that they're not apart. There's one world of which these are dual aspects, the Pauli Jung conjecture that Harold's been talking about.

35:51.520 --> 35:57.520
So was that an exception?

35:57.520 --> 36:17.520
It sounds like one and it reminds me that there's a couple of ways of talking about synchronicity at least, one, two extremes maybe. One is that synchronicities are these extreme events of high emotional intensity that practically break a person down or shock a person into a moment of awareness.

36:17.520 --> 36:43.520
Then as Joseph mentioned tonight, there is a spectrum. There's an intensity that you can get stronger and stronger and weaker and weaker senses of synchronicity, where the meaningful coincidences are not just once in a lifetime or once a year or once a generation, but sort of a current because this is the nature of reality.

36:43.520 --> 37:09.520
Well, along those lines, if the philosophy of science is coming to a consciousness of its role in shaping both science and society, it would be ideal if the ethical awareness or the moral awareness would not have to be brought in externally to science the way it has been in the past with

37:09.520 --> 37:23.520
the Council on Ethics for the genome, another Council for the bomb, another Council. It should come up from within science itself. How would that happen?

37:23.520 --> 37:36.520
So, a recent set of studies within the last 10 years or less taking place with funding from the National Science Foundation and taking place in a number of universities across the country.

37:36.520 --> 37:53.520
So, we do this very simple thing of putting a humanist or social scientist within a lab, within a natural science lab, to basically be with the physical scientists.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.520
Why?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.520
That's technology.

37:57.520 --> 38:13.520
They're performing technology. They're acting like anthropologists. You could say in this foreign tribe, etc. The way that this was done in the early 60s and 70s by a brilliant Frenchman whose name escapes me at the moment.

38:13.520 --> 38:27.520
Anyone starts with a B, Bruno Littur, of course. So, this is sort of since the 70s when he did this laboratory life, I think, was the first study.

38:27.520 --> 38:42.520
This is now 2003, 4, 5, 10. What happens? Now, this is the part where I've become interested in science. I was not involved in any of these, but I was part of the team who looked at the results and tried to put together frameworks.

38:42.520 --> 39:00.520
What happens is something very similar as what happens in therapy situation or in this pairing of young and poly. They start to think alike. They start to essentially constellate something together that neither of them could do separately.

39:00.520 --> 39:21.520
By exposure of over 12 period or so, the questions of the social scientists or the humans become the questions of the physical scientists and vice versa. And this is not by virtue of the one asking ethics questions of the other, but sort of indirectly.

39:21.520 --> 39:35.520
The idea was to ask indirect questions of the scientist, what are you doing? How's it going? Sort of the way therapists are supposed to do when they're not being directed, not being a therapist. I'm not sure if that's the moment.

39:35.520 --> 39:58.520
Anyway, in the course of just being together and so forth, this thing emerges and at some point the frequency of interaction, the intensity of the conversation, and then the flipping where one dynamic of one way of thinking sort of is entrained by the dynamic of the other begins to happen.

39:58.520 --> 40:09.520
And not as intensely as we have with two geniuses, young poly, but sort of spread out widespread.

40:09.520 --> 40:26.520
So that's what I bring to the table, witnessing this thing and trying to see if there's some generality here, some sense of dynamic that is not restricted to the very exceptional case.

40:26.520 --> 40:37.520
It's not restricted to the very high level theory of how matter in mind could possibly be linked in some exotic mathematical format.

40:37.520 --> 40:50.520
It would include that, but also sort of spread further than that into these larger and larger and more general contexts of interaction between people across the spectrum.

40:50.520 --> 41:00.520
Could you give an example of what you've seen when you've gone into a laboratory and how your presence affects the experimental experiment?

41:00.520 --> 41:10.520
Well, I was not involved in doing these studies myself. I have worked in a lab with scientists as a chemist and all that, so I'm kind of an impure sample right here.

41:10.520 --> 41:20.520
But I can tell you the accounts of the PhD students who I did talk with and interviewed after they did their work.

41:20.520 --> 41:33.520
And essentially, what happened was, I think to put it in very brief form, the political scientist who was assigned to a fertility lab, so they're doing genomics.

41:33.520 --> 41:43.520
Basically, after some time, she went trial, or native. I guess that's the term, she went native.

41:43.520 --> 41:50.520
And what that means is that she became a member of the lab. She was trained in the techniques of preparing samples and so forth.

41:50.520 --> 41:56.520
So she was asking questions, questions, questions. They said, all right, listen, let's just show you how it's done.

41:56.520 --> 42:17.520
And then so she embodied the activity, the work of these people. In the process of doing that, sympathetically listening and then becoming actually quite good at sample prep, this changed their attitude about who she was.

42:17.520 --> 42:34.520
And they started to wonder more about her and think along her lines, to bring the story short, this is in an article, it's in a book coming out about Young's 100th anniversary, I forget the title of this book at the Ford and Lectures.

42:34.520 --> 42:48.520
But essentially the chart version and the story is that by the end of this, the lab director began to think along the lines of what does our lab look like from the outside?

42:48.520 --> 42:56.520
What is the impact we're having on the community that we're in? If we're having this effect on this moment, these are questions that she's having for us.

42:56.520 --> 43:11.520
Essentially, shifted his thinking and rearranged some of the activities of the lab, some of the communications of the lab, and actually asked to co-author some papers with her about the activity going on in the lab.

43:11.520 --> 43:27.520
One other thing that happened that I have to relate is that there had been persistent questions, questions both of procedure and of ethics about taking blood from the actual researchers. They were using their own blood in the research.

43:27.520 --> 43:41.520
And they weren't sure whether this was what the status of this was morally. And scientifically, they kind of worked it out, but they weren't really sure about the status of the morality of this. And they didn't know how to think about this.

43:41.520 --> 44:03.520
But that was just sort of sitting there below the surface, continuing and continuing, but never really reaching the surface to become a decision. And as with the case with the other social scientists and humanists, I know, in almost every case, something comes out from the depths and becomes a decision.

44:03.520 --> 44:14.520
Whereas before it was not even acknowledged as something that required decision in action. And that's the beginning really of responsibility.

44:14.520 --> 44:38.520
I'm still trying to figure out myself. But first, I should say that I'm very intrigued, but Harold and Frasza both said, and I want to pick up on it to the question.

44:38.520 --> 45:00.520
And I'll come back to the question of creativity and enthusiasm space research, if I can speculate on that. But mostly, I think what Harold told us, and also Frasza explained also more, that there is a consensus at least in the community of the strongness of science and also other communities,

45:00.520 --> 45:14.520
that the positivism and physicalism has failed in reaching both the world of the sciences of the mind and the sciences of the matter.

45:14.520 --> 45:31.520
And Harold talks about the young public conjecture as a starting point for a hopefully more successful description. But Harold didn't tell you because he's humble, but he has done a major headway in that direction.

45:31.520 --> 45:46.520
And in some seminal papers he actually, because of his background in physics, he was able to find really fundamental important relationship and properties, and I'm going to try to describe them in a simple fashion,

45:46.520 --> 46:05.520
and then he applied on this conjecture as being a very promising head point, a starting point. So what I'd like to do is describe to you from my understanding of what some of the world that Harold has done, and give it towards a question which I would like to ask.

46:05.520 --> 46:19.520
And basically, and this is really at the heart of the discussion today, the relevance of the hourly young conjecture. So basically, in physics, we do measurements, of course.

46:19.520 --> 46:27.520
The measurements take us from a realm of the properties of material, to the realm of knowledge of how materials behave.

46:27.520 --> 46:44.520
So using nomenclature, using in the field where Harold works, who talks, they talk about an empty reality, or ontology is the realm basically, a particle has mass, has momentum, has energy, thinks one could measure.

46:44.520 --> 46:54.520
We call that an empty, the realm of the reality. And a measurement takes us from that realm to an epistemic reality where we can know something about how the particles behave.

46:54.520 --> 47:05.520
So what scientists do, they take a measurement, it takes us from the onto-creality to a epistemic reality, the realm of epistemology, the science of knowledge.

47:05.520 --> 47:20.520
What's incredible about quantum physics, what the revolution that happens in the early part of that century, is that physicists discover, and partly play the major role in that, that the mere act of making the measurement has a back reaction, so to speak.

47:20.520 --> 47:29.520
It has an influence on the onto-creality itself. So that took a while to absorb. And now today there's no doubt that this is the case.

47:29.520 --> 47:45.520
There have been numerous experiments establishing this seemingly non-intuitive fact, a purely physics experiment, where people show how particles, the property of particles, by the mere observation, and the observation has to be done by a conscious observer, it could be done even by an instrument,

47:45.520 --> 48:01.520
or influence the property itself, or some of the properties of the particles. So this influence of the observer as its own quantum mechanics is a fundamental prediction and veryifiable and verified aspect of quantum mechanics.

48:01.520 --> 48:20.520
So what I found you did is, he was very much involved in this, he actually found a parallel, and in many ways convinced, I wouldn't say convinced, because Jung has already the people's position to take all that and run with it, basically that there's a parallel in the case of mind.

48:20.520 --> 48:41.520
So the parallel is that as we have onto-creality, which is the properties of the state particles, similarly there's an objective reality in the unconscious. These are, we talk about the local mental objects, which are states, mental states that can be defined in a Boolean fashion, zero, one, sad, for example, happy.

48:41.520 --> 48:58.520
These are things that we can talk about unconscious. And then awareness, which is the equivalent in a way the analog of measurement, takes us from this unconscious to the epistemic reality, which is consciousness, so to become conscious of a certain feeling, let's say.

48:58.520 --> 49:12.520
And like Pauli conjectures, so to speak, that there is same way as quantum physics, same way as we discovered that time in physics, there is a back reaction, there is an influence.

49:12.520 --> 49:37.520
So awareness, well, similar as in physics, the awareness of the unconscious as it becomes conscious reflects back on the unconscious and changes it. So this parallelism was stated as early as in 1954, I was already trying in a book, but it can be traced back even earlier.

49:37.520 --> 49:50.520
Now what Harold forgot to tell you, because of his humility, is that he did actually major discovery in that section. What I'm going to try to do is summarize very much in what he did.

49:50.520 --> 49:58.520
So the problem is that this is a mathematical trick or mathematical discovery that is hard to describe to one mathematician, so I'm going to do my best.

49:58.520 --> 50:04.520
Remember I talked about not only unconscious, which is the object to the epistemic.

50:04.520 --> 50:28.520
Now, an example, for example, you take a survey or do a questionnaire, and you have to report on some states, on mental states, the say of some, and the mere act of doing so will make you, which will put down in writing this epistemic realization has an influence on the actual states.

50:28.520 --> 50:55.520
Now what Harold did, he was able with a classic paper, which was, I think, already recognized to be classic paper at this background in Bomer 2012, that these mental states, or these, the realm of the ontic in this analogy, has some mathematical properties.

50:55.520 --> 51:16.520
And they are to use a technical term that can be described as non-commodative structures, which happens to be exactly the proper mathematical system with the mathematical properties that quantum mechanical systems in the realm of the ontic level possess, that can be described also as non-commodative structures.

51:16.520 --> 51:26.520
This is probably seems too technical, but actually is very stark, because it shows that there is indeed more than just an analogy between these two powers.

51:26.520 --> 51:31.520
It shows that there is actually a fundamental relationship.

51:31.520 --> 51:37.520
He talks about constitutive joint principle, combining what the mental and the physical.

51:37.520 --> 51:47.520
So now, this is my explanation of my interpretation of Thal's work. Thank God he is with us, so he can correct the mistakes I've done.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.520
But now I'm going to pose my question.

51:50.520 --> 52:03.520
And to understand the question, and again, stems from my intrigue, my being intrigued by this relationship between physics and that psychology, and wanting to talk more than just learn.

52:03.520 --> 52:07.520
So far, by poking I hope to learn more.

52:07.520 --> 52:14.520
So, the question I'm going to pose comes from my own work, I'll give you an example of my own work.

52:14.520 --> 52:27.520
So I work in a film of plasma rockets, where that point of detail is that rockets use plasma, which is a gas that is ionized to produce thrust for space breath.

52:27.520 --> 52:37.520
So, the rockets can become unstable, they can start to oscillate, and they can turn on and off, they use electrical power, and they have their own behavior.

52:37.520 --> 52:45.520
One particular behavior, one oscillation has been observed, and then has been successfully modeled and tested.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.520
And it's called the predator-praise study.

52:48.520 --> 52:56.520
Now, this study is interesting, it's like what happens when you have in a forest, characters and crayons.

52:56.520 --> 53:11.520
So, if the predators eat all the crayons, eventually the predators start to die, and then when the prey is out-compered with the predators, and we have a cycle that can keep feeding itself and go on oscillation.

53:11.520 --> 53:15.520
It turns out the oscillation happens in these clusters are exactly similar to this.

53:15.520 --> 53:21.520
And we use an equation to describe this oscillation, called the Lokka-Vortera equation.

53:21.520 --> 53:37.520
Lokka is an American mathematician, an ikrotlokka, and Pito-Vortera is an e-tanya mathematician who described the fish in the areaic sea by this equation, showing how the certain fish are predator, other fish that are prey.

53:37.520 --> 53:43.520
The population goes up and down and oscillates, exactly in the same way we see in the thrust.

53:43.520 --> 54:04.520
So, here is a mirror, I'm mirroring the fishes in the sea and my rocket in my lab, the same way in analogy here, as Harold is currently mirrored the backtracking that happens between the atomic reality and the epistemic reality in physics, the quantum physics, and one that happens in consciousness.

54:04.520 --> 54:06.520
So, you can add that to my question.

54:06.520 --> 54:14.520
So, basically, that success of not only both phenomena in the same equation has a limit in my opinion.

54:14.520 --> 54:24.520
The limit is we get to a point where in the rocket it turns out that the voltage that you apply to the rocket influences this instability.

54:24.520 --> 54:28.520
Not only this, the instability influences the voltage.

54:28.520 --> 54:38.520
This is the back reaction that I would like to find in the fishes. However, if I go down to the sea, the geoceses look at the fishes, I don't find them back.

54:38.520 --> 54:47.520
For example, I know that the predators in the sea, the fish predators, are in their concentration also influenced by the weather in the seasons.

54:47.520 --> 54:53.520
But the fishes themselves cannot influence the weather, not at least to zero, but in fact.

54:53.520 --> 55:04.520
So, we have this breakdown, which shows you that finding these beautiful analogies, these beautiful commonalities, can be very promising, can shed the light.

55:04.520 --> 55:15.520
But then pushes me to ask the question, is this beautiful, not only analogy, but beautiful mathematical similarity that you were able to find elegantly?

55:15.520 --> 55:32.520
Are they more, can one say that they are more than just analogy? Can we really expect them to materialize into an worldview that's very concise and very powerful of my matter interactions?

55:32.520 --> 55:45.520
Yeah, let me start with the following remark. I have always, I mean, not all my life, but for a long time I've waited for someone who can't explain these things so well as we were. Thank you very much.

55:45.520 --> 55:54.520
Now the, let me start with a quick answer to your kind of question, and then elaborate on this a little bit.

55:54.520 --> 56:07.520
I would think that there's one big difference between the log-comotero or predo the frame model and what we have in mind when we talk about these mind-brain relationships.

56:07.520 --> 56:15.520
And that big difference is rooted in the notion of causation. In the log-comotero cycle, you always have common interactions.

56:15.520 --> 56:29.520
While I would insist, I mean, Pauli and you also insisted that point in the circumstances like interrelations between the material, the material, the physical, are just free of causal interactions.

56:29.520 --> 56:39.520
And the, you know, we insist that we must not think about these correlations as causal relations. And then I think it's a big difference.

56:39.520 --> 56:50.520
Now, to, your question that follows from this, how seriously are we actually, or should we, should we take these analogies?

56:50.520 --> 57:07.520
And I would say, you know, just from developing a model or developing an interesting framework, this is not, I mean, this can maybe make us think that this might be an interesting way to go.

57:07.520 --> 57:24.520
But the point where we really can believe that this has something to do with reality is the point where we can derive empirical implications and then test whether these implications hold, whether the system behave like that.

57:24.520 --> 57:33.520
And with respect to that question, let me just make one additional remark to what he was saying about these non-communitive mental observables.

57:33.520 --> 57:40.520
And you realize, you know, if I ask you to just only to express the notion of non-communitivity, you will have problems.

57:40.520 --> 57:49.520
We are very much used to this because it's a concept that is, that is pervasive in quantum mechanics and in other areas of physics as well.

57:49.520 --> 58:00.520
But one important consequence of everything that behaves non-communitively is that the sequence in which you make measurements makes the difference.

58:00.520 --> 58:22.520
And I think that's not the case in classical systems. And the interesting thing is when you think about what happens when you make a measurement on a human mind, on a human measure state, it's, I think it's a fascinating observation that you will make, namely that such measurements, actually for such measurements, non-communativity is the rule rather than exception.

58:22.520 --> 58:39.520
So, because when I ask, you have a question for instance, right, you will output an answer and I hear the answer, I read out the value that you give me, but at the same moment, at the same moment, it's very clear to everybody that this also changes your state, so that that's the back reaction.

58:39.520 --> 59:03.520
Now, if you ask your second question on the change state, then of course, the answer that you give has to do with the change state, not with the original one. Now, when I exchange the sequence of the questions, then the change state after the first question is of course different from the change state after the first question, the first realization of the experiment.

59:03.520 --> 59:16.520
And that means at the final result, after the second question, will in general be difficult, that this can be tested. You can test this in questionnaires and we have the paper that you mentioned, thank you very much for your compliments.

59:16.520 --> 59:26.520
In that paper, we even give a classification of four different types of such order effects. They are well-known in the psychological literature, but very poorly understood.

59:26.520 --> 59:36.520
We have a career in frame of to predict these effects and even predict the effects that have never been observed in psychology, like uncertainty relations, products of variance, and all this kind of stuff.

59:36.520 --> 59:52.520
This can all be tested now. It can all be put to test, be put to test, and then it, I mean once the test is not already around in these directions, and once you see that the results fit the predictions, like this is what we do in sizes of five.

59:52.520 --> 01:00:01.520
When this happens, then our trust in the models that we have increases. And then we would say this is more than few and only.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:20.520
Yes, yes. Well, I think I'll follow up with the question. If that's the case, since you're talking about this good to hear of people in the field talking about testing and having a prediction, which as you know, in some circles, it's a bad word.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:28.520
And so it's here to hear that's good to hear that you think that. So how do you then formulate that you've reached a successful theory?

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:39.520
I mean, physics is very clear, reproducibility is, but there is an inherent, I mean both the only, how we talked about this correlation is to be inherently non reproducible.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:52.520
And so how do you have dilemma? On one hand, you're hoping to get to a producer of experiments that are predicted. On the other hand, fundamentally, these collaborations are not predictable and not a producer.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.520
Right, good point. I have something to say about that too.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:10.520
Yeah, and I think that is one of the great differences between psychology and the heart sciences and the material sciences that we always have the individuals who object to the factor.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:20.520
And most often the individual emotional factor. And you can't really reproduce that. I mean, you can't go into a rabbit and make it happen.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:32.520
So I have to give a couple of examples of why I got interested in synchronicity and just hear your senses of it and how we're meant to think of it.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:44.520
And I just want to give a couple of examples out of my practice. The preamble that the last science class I took was dissecting the frog and freshman year of biology.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:50.520
This is a huge stretch for me and I'm sure it is for many of you too.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:02:05.520
One thing that frequently happens in the consulting room for me or even in the hallway when I open the door in my office, as that as the person is coming toward me, I have an image that comes.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:24.520
And it has got nothing to do with anything. I was thinking before or anything that I'm going to think after that session is over. For instance, in one case I opened the door and I saw a woman, a very lovely attractive woman I've worked with for a long time, and I thought lobster.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:43.520
Now she doesn't look at all like the lobster. And she came in and she described to me that in halfway through the session, the adjust come from canal street and when she went to take a car out of the parking slot, a lobster came right in front of the car.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:49.520
Canal street, the lobster came up from the canal and was there on the street.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:03:10.520
All right, so that's one kind of thing. Another is that it's extremely frequent that I will suddenly have an image of something in a session or we will be discussing something and an interpretation will come out that I hardly recognize.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:29.520
I mean, it's like it comes through. And then the patient tells me their dream from the night before and that image was in the dream and we have already interpreted the dream, even though the dream was not all communicated and shared.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:41.520
So that's correspondence on a level that is not an ego, an ego, and certainly not a rational to rational level.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:50.520
But the experience that really got me going in terms of exploring what these different synchronicities of unusual correspondences are.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:04:16.520
That's another way to think of it was that in the spring and summer of 2001, patient after patient was bringing in dreams of blackbirds or writing poetry about blackbirds and ravens or, you know, having and everything I read had blackbirds and ravens in them.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:32.520
And then when 9-11 happened, there was all this image of these black bird birds coming around the World Trade Center and many children in our classes.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:48.520
And then the woman who was working with children in school in New Jersey actually said that the primary imagery that the children in the schools were painting were blackbirds.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:58.520
And that was just this sense of this ominous quality that it was as if the psyche of these patients were picking them up.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:07.520
Now I was the only person who knew that there was this sort of critical mass of these images.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:19.520
So it's the human observer who's making the connections. It's not that they're there in the white universe as far as we can tell.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:29.520
But that's not an unusual kind of situation. On one day last week, every single patient had something to say about shoes or socks.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:41.520
You know, why were people referring to their shoes or socks? So then I have to start thinking about shoes and socks and what's the symbolic meaning of that and what's the communication around them.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:06:01.520
So we better call the team.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:28.520
So in any case, I just wanted to give that as a whole different point of view of what Jung was talking about in terms of synchronicities, which is a kind of nonverbal, non rational communication of a build up of different images or shared images or you think of someone and they call you the next day, that kind of thing.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:42.520
And does that at all fit into your realm? What you look at when you worked in this clinic and project what kind of anomalous situations are there?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:59.520
Oh, don't do that.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:13.520
So that happened because none of us really believe in all of it. So that had to happen. So we are sort of alert for responses.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:32.520
So we are not going to be able to talk about the topic. It's not right.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:45.520
Sometimes reproducibility is different than physics. It's psychology thinks that are not reproducible will not become a part of the established knowledge.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:08:04.520
So these events are completely different story. These are not psychological events. They are not physical events. You can think about how one called them. At some point, I call them psychophysically events, something like that.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:19.520
And I think in that respect, then we really come to what you are addressing in terms of some kind of synchronicities, but I think there are also other interesting psychophysically events which all into this kind of general.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:35.520
And again, we really hear the issue of reproducing the reading observation because obviously we know correlations between the physical, for instance, our body or our brain, and the mental, what do you think?

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:48.520
And these correlations are pretty stable. For instance, when you look into cognitive neuroscience, then people know that certain mental states, you know, I let you ask, I let you do a kind of math task or something like that.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:09:05.260
And the brain activity that is correlated with that magic task is pretty much the same in all these cross-in-grid fields. So this is a very stable reproducible, mind-

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:20.260
material. We call these ordinary or baseline correlations. Now, do you think that you are addressing? Do you want to talk a little bit more about that, I guess?

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:39.260
Well, a couple of different things. I think it's important to say a little bit more about what you mean about structural correlations, these fundamental things, such as the relationship of mind and matter. When you reveal that synchronicity, he's queried by CA and lighter in several places where lighter is pushing on.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:52.260
And he says, you know, this question of causality in a 20-body relationship is possibly to be considered as a synchronicity problem, whatever that might be.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:10:03.260
And Jung said, well, if that's actually correct, then I have to rethink the whole notion, because then it's not just the real event. It is then something that's part of our reality.

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:10.260
And so you have this problem that we've had no way to talk about these two different categories of experience, as if they were all one and the same.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:26.260
And I think what's particularly interesting about this conjecture is you begin to titrate that out a little bit. You have a structural interaction and on top of that, you have a sort of personal weight as it were.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:41.260
You have these induced correlations that can be a varying intensity there, positive or negative, positive reflect the moment we've been telling where the unexpected links come together, but then also negative whether dissociations, where things you expected to be there, but just simply aren't.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:11:00.260
There's one question I lead to from myself. I think this clinically could be extremely useful to begin to use this kind of model to look at the range of phenomena that we're talking about with these kinds of experiences, where I'd also like to give us a pick up a point that Edgar was talking about.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:17.260
And the difference between the two models, you can't add the whole notion of the ecological and the idea of systems that have holistic properties that are extremely difficult to catch into one simple description.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:36.260
And when Young says these are A-causal connections, if you're spending with his causality, it's a very 19th century thermodynamic form of causality. It's about thermodynamics systems that are equilibrium. It has very little to do with systems that are actually like human beings that are open that have all of these transformations possible in them.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:50.260
So, if we start to begin to think about an ecological model here, then I think we're at the edge of what, I don't think we know this as a community yet, how do ecological systems manifest their holistic features?

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:58.260
And is there causality operating a fat model that we think about as a sub-set about?

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:09.260
I think if you put it within another context, you can begin to see. And to be honest, if you follow where Young Anne probably got some of their ideas, this was part of the idea.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.260
I mean, James was one of the people that they do heavily on. And where did James get some of his ideas?

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:27.260
Well, in the 1870s, he's reading James Quirk Maxwell on field theory. He's looking at fields that fill the universe and beginning to think of the mind as a field rather than as a localized substance.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:36.260
So I think that that kind of model, this is the same problem of 50 years of chemistry where we know all the ingredients of life and we can't self-assessive why.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:46.260
What's missing? That's a fascinating question there. There's another level to that question that has not yet been solved. And I think that's where in some way.

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:58.260
Yes, actually that brings me to a question having to do with how one filters or how one calls a simplistic event, a simplistic event.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:14.260
Some rigorous has to be applied to some extent. I mean, I think how we talked as a simplistic event in the limit of meaningless correspondence become like pure chance.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:29.260
And that pushes me to ask, I believe especially going back to the 9-11, there are many times at 9-11 nothing luminous is happening. Nothing potential is being said.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:40.260
We don't register those. We talked about a degree about an emotional impact. Emotional impact will allow us when these things happen, we all become emotional.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:49.260
We forget about all the times 9-11 passes by on the clock and nobody said anything. So one has to normalize this event that happened tonight.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:59.260
By all the 9-11 times the clock said 9-11 nothing incredibly happened. And we find that it's to be very small numbers which we call statistical noise.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:13.260
So one has to, we're going to power, it has to be a limit where the meaningless correspondence takes us to a 9-chance. So how would you come up with this filter that would say this is a simplistic event and this is not?

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:20.260
Every time I feel somebody looks like a lobster or somebody that comes to that course, when, why are there quite too yet?

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:30.260
And how do you filter the emotional impact part? Because emotional impact will keep us, will all become clergymen and the scientists every time it happens.

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.260
So we have to watch out against that. How do you watch out against that?

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:57.260
I just like to respond to the clergy bit. Actually, Jung was exploring the idea of synchronicity to get away from magical thinking. Because up until the more scientific era, if something happened that had an uncanny quality, it was thought to be a message for God to God.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:15.260
And he wanted to find how we could understand things that we could not explain causally. So it was really an attempt to at least open the door to other ways that things connect that are not messages from the beyond in that sense.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:17.260
So it was very, it wasn't a time to...

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:29.260
That thing's got out of the picture, which is fine. But still, the question is how do you filter out, not attribute them to this only small... to this realm of the architects and so much poverty fine.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:42.260
But the question is that when you put a threshold, how do you consider and what kind of statistic meaningful threshold you put on what is a simplistic event and what's the pure chance that's amplified by emotional impact?

01:15:42.260 --> 01:16:02.260
And that's where it's very individual, because it keeps not saying that there's, you know, that the whole world is a synchronicity, but rather that if a person perceives certain kinds of connections or experiences, based on these sort of networks of meaning, that that's for them.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:12.260
It's not that then you go out and start a religion of synchronicity and you have to come and confess that you have that kind of synchronicity.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:22.260
The act of creation, that the person is making for themselves and they have to figure out then why they've noticed it and added a little bit of reaction.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:32.260
I think that's really hard to keep away from the idea that they have to be universal and not enough.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:38.260
But I agree with Enco that this is a very important question. Maybe it's only too difficult for now.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:44.260
You know, we have to approach that question, maybe not we, maybe our grandchild or our young.

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:53.260
But I think nevertheless, it's possible to make, you know, better than other sides of progress, progress in small steps.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:17:02.260
So what we can do, but the part of your picture, and maybe somewhat generally speaking with the school aspect of the work thinking,

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:11.260
what we can predict the classification of what we call exceptional experiences, a classification of exceptional experiences.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:20.260
And this classification, again, can have it tested because we have a lot of material that's the beginning of studies that we mentioned from my work time.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:27.260
We have about 2,200 people now who are seeking help at this counseling unit there.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:38.260
And they have been, their cases have been documented since 1996 very carefully and particularly, and we can, so we can try to use this material, the period of material,

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.260
in order to test whether the classification is correct or not.

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:51.260
And what we found is the classification is perfect. It's not even perfect. It also applies, I mean, I was talking about client seeking advice now.

01:17:51.260 --> 01:18:00.260
But we also did the same study with samples from the general population. We find it, we do not only find the same classification patterns,

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:09.260
we also find the same percentage over the different patterns. And we find that's plausible, we find less intensity and less frequency.

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:18.260
Because this is also population, right? And now this is very interesting because now we have a, so this is already something that can be reproduced.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:24.260
It's not a value of a observable course. It's a different kind of reproducibility.

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:33.260
But then, and this is something very interesting, I think, we did, this is a test, it's called a moony test.

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:41.260
A moony test is you have a screen that you present on the screen, a random distribution of black and white pixels.

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:50.260
Right? And then once in a while you manipulate the pixels in such a way that you see an indication of the face or an object or something like that.

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:56.260
And then the subject is asked, do you see an object or do you see an object or a random distribution?

01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:07.260
And now one of the classes of exceptional experiences that we have does significantly correlate with false positives in the moony test.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:19.260
So what does that mean? This means when you show these people random distribution of points, they have a significant overabundance of telling you it's not random, there's a face or there's an object.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:26.260
So what they do, they attribute meaning to a pair of them, actually is blind chance, you know what I'm saying.

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:32.260
And this is precisely the coincidence type, one of the four types in this classification.

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:43.260
So now we have a psychophysical test, really, to select, I mean, a filter if you want, to select these people out of the whole bunch of all exceptional experiences.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:48.260
And that, you know, these are small steps, I completely ignore that, how size?

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:50.260
Definitely the odd direction.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.260
Yeah, I don't know, this is the way to go.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:56.260
And I think now I will open up questions from the audience.

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.260
Yeah, go ahead.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.260
Well, I have a couple of them. I'd like to take a start, a couple of them, this question.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:05.260
Can you hear me out there?

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.260
Yes?

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:10.260
Yeah, I should want to take a break.

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.260
I'll bring it back.

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:22.260
So about ecology, it reminded me that J. J. Gibson is ecological, or Givesonian psychology.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:31.260
He was attempting, as some may well know, to construct our representationless, the realism.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:40.260
So that there would be a seamless continuity between the ecological stimulus and the perception of that stimulus.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.260
There was no differentiation.

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:51.260
So without just throwing that out there, if that would be something that would be of interest to that question about ecological circumstances.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.260
But I'll just throw them all out now.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:21:01.260
The second one that you raised, that was just answered about the differentiation between coincidence and synchronicity.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:08.260
Since one of the defined characteristics of synchronicity is the personal meaning that the individual experiences,

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:15.260
that would imply, as per your most, you did the experiment you described, how I'll describe,

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:24.260
suggest that there's going to be some neural activity that might be related to our previous position, to seeing, let's say, an arc,

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:28.260
but to see a circle, or to fill in an incomplete letter of the alphabet.

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:31.260
On the other hand, that's not necessarily meaningful.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:41.260
But one extension of that kind of experiment could be to have volunteers, and they'd have to be very dedicated volunteers.

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:52.260
And if they did happen to have a synchronicity, and they were willing to have some type of fMRI at first at least,

01:21:52.260 --> 01:22:02.260
so we got down to more precise measurements of neural activity.

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:09.260
And then gradually zone in on that area of the brain that was lighting up, if you will, when there was meaningful synchronicity,

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:15.260
that would be the beginning of a start to have a mathematical structure when there was activity related to a synchronicity.

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:17.260
That's just an observation.

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.260
The question that I have though for Harold has to do with a lot of research, some of the quite recent,

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:30.260
it seems to decouple causality from the direction of time at a quantum level, such that the effect, the experiment that's carried out in a normal direction of time,

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:35.260
but the effect actually occurs, or can be detected or measured prior to the cause.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:41.260
And if that might have been a good deal with, some of you are talking about in terms of correlation or hyper correlation,

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:50.260
not in time with a mass sense, but the a-temporal as related to a causal nature of some of these experiences.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:58.260
That's it.

01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.260
Anybody?

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:09.260
Yeah, this last issue is really, I think it's pretty complicated because that touches on several fundamental research topics

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:18.260
in basic theoretical physics. I don't know whether this is something I should go into much detail.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:26.260
It's correct that there are people who think that at the fundamental level, time doesn't play a role anymore in some sense,

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:32.260
and then causation in the sense of something happening before something else is of course meaningless,

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:35.260
because then the notion of time is not there.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:43.260
But maybe I can expand this into an issue which I think is rather an broader sense,

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:49.260
and that's the issue that in many of the sciences, not necessarily in fundamental physics,

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.260
but people are completely over-obsessed with causation.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:59.260
I think there's no experiment in the world in which you see causation.

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:05.260
What you see is always correlations between observed, between observed, about variables or something.

01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:10.260
And then when you bring in causation, this is always based on the model that you have.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.260
And so this is already, if you want, this is a bias.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:15.260
Correct.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:22.260
And I would always, I mean, in the Paul Jung discussion, it shows in a very nice way

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:30.260
that correlations can theoretically be more important than immediately ascribing causal relations to them.

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:33.260
I think that would be my point in that direction.

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:45.260
I'm going to take a stab at the ecological one and then ask a critic to, you're getting the same term about to get.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:56.260
And it's with regard to causality and one respects sort of other models of causality than the land.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:25:06.260
One could, I'm exploring the idea of whether synchronicity could be looked at as a sort of a cross-scale, cross-scale,

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:16.260
a coupling, a phenomenon. And you would know this unless you were tracking all the different scales at which you've answered the current.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:20.260
And then you could see a line connecting these things.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:26.260
And then if something happens that is not expected, if you're just looking at that now,

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:31.260
but then when you have a coupling across there on the scales, then you get something occurring.

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:40.260
And I wonder whether in the case of the thrusters, things like the volume of the chamber makes a lot of difference to what kind of oscillations you get.

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:47.260
Among other things that could be measured at various scales, much, much smaller than what's larger.

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:54.260
But if you don't know, if you're not tracking all these different cycles, it just looks like magic.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:26:05.260
Yeah, no, I definitely see your point and tracking these cross-tails can present a total different picture than what you would see at the surface.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:13.260
By the way, just as a footnote to what all three of you have said regarding my invoking ecological model of the fish,

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:20.260
I was only bringing that as an analogy between an instability as a truster and there.

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:30.260
And then I was bringing the analogy of that mirror, that parallelism, with the parallelism that probably drew between the back reaction that happens in quantum physics

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:35.260
and the one that was conjecturing also happens in my manner.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:40.260
So I wasn't trying to draw too many parallels between the ecology itself.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:45.260
But I'm intrigued by something you said early on, which I find very interesting.

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:54.260
So you talked about planning and young at the end of the circle, so far from each other in the field that they are almost there in the circle.

01:26:54.260 --> 01:27:00.260
I think that's correct today, unfortunately, with exceptional people like Harold and also Joe who come from the background,

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:05.260
and you who come from a background, I mean, three exceptions, and my fourth.

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:15.260
But still, most physics physicists today do not involve 99.9% do not involve thinking about what humans do.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:21.260
They think about the physics. Of course, they are humans that are thinking, but they don't indulge in that science.

01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:26.260
And the other thing, the same thing most psychologists do indulge in the physics, is about particle.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:35.260
So today they are very far. However, Joe spent a lot of his recent writings showing how the atmosphere, especially the tradition,

01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:43.260
which was only talking about the 19th century German romantic tradition, had a huge impact on scientists at that time.

01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:48.260
So the German romantic scientists, so to speak, were poets in many ways.

01:27:48.260 --> 01:27:55.260
They actually were striving to combine the experimental and the aesthetic.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:28:00.260
And the young and partly with the direct product of that.

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.260
And as a matter of fact, they can be traced.

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:14.260
Harold Jung talks about the anxiety of influence, and talks about Freud having anxiously heightened the influence of Shakespeare.

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:23.260
As Tim Jove, we read that Jung was probably anxiously hiding the influence of Spinoza,

01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:29.260
that went all the way down to Pomegerte, to Humboldt, to Hursted, to William James, too young and partly.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:39.260
Now, that makes people from that time, and physicists and the psychologists very equal to talk to each other.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:44.260
And very natural, especially when psychology is being born on science. It was nothing shocking.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:51.260
Einstein has been hosted by a psychologist. It's far less shocking than today I'm even invited to a psychologist's house for dinner.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:56.260
Very few psychologists would invite me, especially after tonight.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:29:05.260
But nonetheless, what I'm trying to say is that, could it be that this affinity with physics and chemistry,

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:09.260
and physics and psychology, is a part of a tradition?

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:14.260
And here I want to quote something that Beverly quoted Jung saying one of our articles.

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:20.260
And Jung said, archetypes seem to belong as much to society as to individuals.

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.260
They are therefore luminous and contagious in their effects.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:33.260
So could it be that the archetype of a psychologist's physicist was particular to German rheumecticism?

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:39.260
And contagious? And that Jung and Paul just caught above.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.260
That's the question I have.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:45.260
It seems to be, there's always crime.

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.260
That psychology works there particularly beautifully.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:51.260
But in the past 62 years, it has flourished.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:59.260
But the underpinning in the physics of mind matter based on any type of psychology has not, is still tenuous in the oligarchy,

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:04.260
despite Harold's recent work. I mean, not that was standing.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:11.260
So I still have a tenuous system that tells me that, you know, I wonder whether this relationship with physics and psychology

01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:19.260
is kind of forced and is a part of this tradition more than intrinsically, you know, a reality.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:24.260
I mean, four years don't talk much about physics, but Jung is due.

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:29.260
So I wonder if you think this is this archetype that's contagious.

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:32.260
In fact, so this archetype.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:35.260
Okay, another question.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:39.260
I'll second throw out something that's a little bit different here.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.260
I've been studying vision because you basically see with your brain.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:48.260
So you can't see without moving your eyes and our ancestors are brainsy, Bob,

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:51.260
from a state of nature. It's called a samurai vision.

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:59.260
So human brain in a state of nature is actually capable of being aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously.

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:03.260
Sometimes it's given a situation of awareness today.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:07.260
But we lack of our eyes on static letters and we atrophy that ability.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:14.260
So with some of these things about synchronicity, if we live in this world of seven streams of awareness simultaneously,

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:23.260
you might never ask this before. Think that synchronicity might possibly have something to do with that seven point awareness.

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:27.260
That's across here, Bob.

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:35.260
Yeah, exactly. I was going to ask what those streams they have certain, I guess, some cycling times or something like that.

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:37.260
I have no idea.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:43.260
The Da Vinci Coa, you can see up and down left, right, you know, foreground.

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:47.260
When I'm talking, you can also see at the same time.

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:50.260
And I'm just saying, you know, that's a fact.

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:55.260
I'm just curious because of what we ever looked at, what you think.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.260
It's really intriguing. It's really intriguing possibility.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:09.260
I mean, it does correspond to the idea that we're very focused on very little most of the time that we know of.

01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:15.260
Consciously. And we don't cultivate samurai awareness.

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:27.260
I'm not sure some of this, I mean, I would really defer to these folks who've tracked these experiences more to see if it's something within the perceptual field or not.

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:35.260
What you're suggesting is that it would be something that could be included in the perceptual field, that we're not tracking, something even small.

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:41.260
It's quite cold. You know, in India, I, yoga, has been doing this for 3,000 years.

01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:48.260
So they have programs that are astounding that, you know, they used to practice this 2,000 years ago, but I was in the round back.

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:51.260
But I used to wear it.

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:57.260
We had just a few more minutes. Are there any other questions?

01:32:57.260 --> 01:33:00.260
Oh, I'm sorry, Margaret.

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:04.260
Yes, you have one.

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.260
Okay.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:16.260
Coming from an analyst point of view, I, then at first, Joe, you said something about their really clinical implications for all of this.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:24.260
And the one that struck me, and I'd like you to talk about it, see if this makes sense.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:29.260
Harold said, this is not about causality. It's not correlation.

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:34.260
That sounds to be like a very serious analytic statement because we're not looking for the cause.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.260
We're looking for the patterns.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:43.260
That's what analysts do, and that's what heals. The cause is not the point.

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:47.260
That's the end of the understanding of trauma theory. That's the new understanding of all of it.

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:58.260
Is that what you were talking about about the implications of this, or what were you thinking of, Joe, when you talked about the implications of the emergence and synchronicity?

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:11.260
Well, when I was particularly interested in this, actually it's a kind of background question I'm comparing, and that is when you start to look at, if you can take those structural things and you could study those alone,

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:15.260
that would be more in the realm of physics in the mind matter relationship.

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:27.260
What we've been talking about clinically, these examples above and below the baseline, because you get a spectrum there, I think it starts to go to the question that Edgar's raising about, how do you filter emotional?

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:36.260
Do you filter emotional? That is these very large, numinous, kind of synchronicity experiences that are always charged, very highly charged with affect.

01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:45.260
What we don't do then is to scale that back. We start to look at experiences with less affect immediately in them.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:51.260
We now know that affect is part of cognition. You can't think of it as your affect.

01:34:51.260 --> 01:35:02.260
I wouldn't throw affect out, but I think you can say what happens asymptotically as you move back, as you begin to titrate the affect down to lower and lower levels.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:07.260
One of the things in science one can talk a lot about nowadays is serendipity.

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:16.260
More and more of the biographies of science reveal how much accident is involved in so many key discoveries that people are looking at.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:25.260
It's looking very intently with a very well organized mind and finding something very that's curiously other than what you look for.

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:33.260
If that becomes the place of breakthrough, that seems to be an extremely important correlation thing. You can say the same thing for analysis.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.260
So that's, yeah.

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:41.260
Exactly. It's mostly serendipitous. I mean, these things about the law study that comes to mind, the field that you're in, have a serendipitous quality.

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:48.260
I would say, every interpretation you make, you can't make an interpretation that isn't somehow part of this.

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:52.260
There's a serendipitous field quality to what you're saying, especially if it's right.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:58.260
Yes, and that would bring in the question of the sequence of questions.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:35:59.260
Yes, yes, exactly.

01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:07.260
Every theory has a different way of thinking about how you come to approaching something, and that's sort of like a difference.

01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:10.260
And I'm very pleased to hear that.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:13.260
Yeah, that's part of the training.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.260
Yes.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:16.260
I'm not doing on a computer.

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:18.260
You're a question.

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.260
We have one nice question.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:33.260
It's interesting. I find it in my work as an analyst that, depending on a patient's state of mind, for example, I'm working with somebody who tends to be more disorganized.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:41.260
Or somebody who has sort of experienced the archetypal mythological realm that's less mitigated.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:53.260
Or with the archetypal realm that's asserting itself more forcefully in the field within the session, there seem to be more asynchronous events.

01:36:53.260 --> 01:37:05.260
I will want to say words that I usually don't say in fact and never say come to me and seem in those words seem to somehow match the patient's experience or something they've gone through that day.

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:19.260
It seems to go back and forth and back and forth. Again, it often happens when I'm working with patients where the ego, let's say, is more permeable to the archetypal contents.

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:26.260
And I'm wondering if you can, if anybody, if you notice that or if you can comment on that.

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:42.260
I think that the weird field phenomenon and the kind of transmission that happens through body language to facial expression, to the whole near neuron system.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:58.260
I mean, we now know that how your face is arranged, you've got 10,000 different facial muscles combinations. And however your face is arranged to send the neural signals to different parts of the brain.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:24.260
If you smile, you're soothing and cooling the brain. And if you've rivisic, you're heating up the brain. And if you're with someone who is in a very tense and strange and stressed state, there's a certain facial expression that we all, since it's just analysts and analysts and it's also other kinds of connections.

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:35.260
We are living in mirroring and sending the same signals and getting into something of the same brain state that used to be thought of as psychic contagion.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:46.260
We now know much more about how our whole emotional physical cognitive system works. So I would think of that more as their field, which is a dream with that.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:53.260
But in a way that can be so precise that the language is a choice of language is a choice of language.

01:38:53.260 --> 01:39:09.260
You know, someone like Joe to do, the NYU neuroscientist, thinks that these kind of communications are much more accurate and precise than any kind of verbal communication.

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:20.260
So you've been wonderful to stay with us. You've been wonderful to come and to risk these kinds of discussions. So appreciate it.

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:41.260
I've always learned a great deal. And I thank you for your presence and I thank you for your patience and perseverance.
