05:45.200 --> 05:55.840
Thank you so much Rob and I especially want to thank Ed Nasserian and Rob Penzer and

05:55.840 --> 06:03.200
Henry Levine who were open to this proposal and to me it proves that Helix is really one

06:03.200 --> 06:09.320
of the major centers for intellectual and all other kinds of discourse in New York and

06:09.320 --> 06:16.960
I'm just thrilled to be here. I think we are here because we all believe that conversation

06:16.960 --> 06:23.240
among the sciences and among all the disciplines is real in that interaction is where the most

06:23.240 --> 06:30.040
fruit is going to be born and you've been just wonderful in keeping this alive and making

06:30.040 --> 06:34.720
this alive.

06:34.720 --> 06:46.200
Because this is not a space where there has been too much talk of Jung, I've spent a lot

06:46.200 --> 06:51.960
of time in this space, many different programs. I'm going to take just a few minutes to fill

06:51.960 --> 06:58.840
in what you might not know in terms of the background through which we even are having

06:58.840 --> 07:06.120
this conversation about synchronicity. Jung counted among his primary influences William

07:06.120 --> 07:13.800
James first, then Freud and at the same time as he and Freud were separating Einstein was

07:13.800 --> 07:19.640
a major force in his life. They were on the faculty together at the Pauli Technic in

07:19.640 --> 07:25.840
Zurich and in the summer before Jung came to New York to give the Fordham lectures where

07:25.840 --> 07:33.280
he differentiated his idea of what psychic energy was from the traditional one. He wrote

07:33.280 --> 07:41.200
Freud a series of letters in which he described having dinners at his home with Bloiler and

07:41.200 --> 07:47.720
others and a young physicist who talked about the theory of light and then he repeated to

07:47.720 --> 07:54.200
Freud what this young Einstein was saying about energy. Then when he came to New York

07:54.200 --> 08:01.640
and he gave his definition of energy clearly see Einstein's effect on Jung. Jung was 20

08:01.640 --> 08:10.160
years younger than Freud and so he was exposed to a different generation of science. Many

08:10.160 --> 08:19.680
years later in 1930 he met Wolfgang Pauli who was a quantum physicist in the Niels Bohr

08:19.680 --> 08:28.640
School and who had been the man who established the exclusion principle. Excuse me I'm very

08:28.640 --> 08:42.920
dry here. Which was the basis for the periodic table in chemistry and he and Pauli then

08:42.920 --> 08:52.400
worked together over 20, 30 years and they corresponded and although my science education

08:52.400 --> 08:58.480
stopped with dissecting frogs in my freshman year in college and I'm surrounded by these

08:58.480 --> 09:06.080
eminent scientists here I was asked to write the preface to this correspondence of Jung

09:06.080 --> 09:11.720
and Pauli which took me two and a half years to read enough about physics so that I could

09:11.720 --> 09:20.600
do that. I've had friends vet it since though. And I found their correspondence just thrilling

09:20.600 --> 09:27.400
because they were each attempting to come from their own disciplines and really lovingly

09:27.400 --> 09:35.600
heartfully communicate with each other. Pauli took such effort he was 30 years younger than

09:35.600 --> 09:45.720
even more. Younger than Jung took so much time writing back to him about his dreams and a

09:45.720 --> 09:55.840
true exchange of information and it was Pauli who convinced Jung to write about synchronicity

09:55.840 --> 10:07.360
and then Pauli also wrote about it. So then when I met Harold and as you will hear he

10:07.360 --> 10:13.160
knows everything there is to know about the subject I met Harold a few years ago at a

10:13.160 --> 10:19.800
conference he gave just of physicists and a philosopher and a few analysts and Joe Cambra

10:19.800 --> 10:26.280
and I have worked for years on the topic of synchronicity and then I met at a dinner

10:26.280 --> 10:31.920
party I met Edgar and the first thing he mentioned in our conversation which doesn't happen so

10:31.920 --> 10:41.920
often is he mentioned Pauli as one of his heroes and then farzade I met at a conference

10:41.920 --> 10:51.680
we had at Fordham on Jung's 100 year long ago lectures and I just finished editing a

10:51.680 --> 10:57.200
chapter that first is done about going into the laboratory he did it with his wife T.

10:57.200 --> 11:04.800
Marie and the effect of the observer on the experiment who is being observed and therefore

11:04.800 --> 11:11.240
on the experiment. So it's been a great pleasure for me to know these men I'm so glad to share

11:11.240 --> 11:16.760
their company with you they most of them just met each other last night and I can tell

11:16.760 --> 11:21.600
from what happened around the dinner table this is going to be an exciting day and I

11:21.600 --> 11:30.080
want to turn first the platform over to Harold who's come here from Zurich. Thank you Beverly

11:30.080 --> 11:36.720
thank you all for coming here and for making this a success I guess let me let me start

11:36.720 --> 11:41.160
with some because you were Beverly you were talking about the road which which it took

11:41.160 --> 11:48.520
Jung to get to this for Pauli it was a little bit different of course and you know Pauli

11:48.520 --> 11:58.680
was had a chair for theoretical physics at the ETH the polytechnic at Zurich since 1928

11:58.680 --> 12:06.560
and that was the time also among other other things in which the new theory of quantum

12:06.560 --> 12:11.560
mechanics was proposed and worked out and this was so to speak the pioneering phase

12:11.560 --> 12:19.360
of the new quantum physics physics of atoms and you know all this this small particles

12:19.360 --> 12:26.000
and so on and in this time actually it's interesting to know that many of these physicists who

12:26.000 --> 12:32.240
were contributing Bohr, Heisenberg, Diorak and others they were all very much interested

12:32.240 --> 12:38.640
also in the philosophical foundations but almost none of them was interested in making

12:38.640 --> 12:43.720
contact with psychology there's only one except I mean Pauli is one exception second

12:43.720 --> 12:52.040
exception is Pascal Jordan Jordan Jordan and Jordan went the Freudian way in a sense and

12:52.040 --> 13:00.960
Pauli went the Jungian way so now now we have this Wolfgang Pauli writing up his dreams

13:00.960 --> 13:07.920
he was for a short time he was even in analysis with Jung and there's this rich dream material

13:07.920 --> 13:14.160
by Pauli which is some of the dreams have been used by Jung in psychology and alchemy

13:14.160 --> 13:19.360
but there is a huge body of dreams which have not even been seen by anybody except

13:19.360 --> 13:25.920
very few people and so this collection of dreams about 2000 pages and two volumes is

13:25.920 --> 13:31.400
just sitting on the table of the main editor at Springer-Fahlach in Heidelberg waiting

13:31.400 --> 13:38.640
to be published so the manuscript is completely ready and it should be out this year maybe

13:38.640 --> 13:45.240
next year we don't know we don't know for sure but this will be out so Pauli then had

13:45.240 --> 13:52.120
to go into exile because he was of Austrian origin then Austria was enacted by the by

13:52.120 --> 13:57.880
a Nazi Germany Pauli was living in Zurich but he didn't have a Swiss passport so whenever

13:57.880 --> 14:02.580
he would leave Switzerland then he would be there was the risk that he would would be

14:02.580 --> 14:08.760
captured by the by the Germans so he went into exile to Princeton actually and had an invitation

14:08.760 --> 14:16.680
from Einstein there and that was in 1939 he went to Princeton 45 he got the Nobel Prize

14:16.680 --> 14:22.640
couldn't pick it up because he didn't have a passport then then then the US government

14:22.640 --> 14:28.160
reacted very quickly they gave him a passport in in a few months so he could at least go

14:28.160 --> 14:35.280
one year later and get his Nobel Prize from Stockholm and in the same year 1946 he returned

14:35.280 --> 14:44.240
to Switzerland and now this is the period now from 1946 until Pauli's death in 1958 in

14:44.240 --> 14:51.800
which the scientific and philosophical correspondence and collaboration with with CG Jung really

14:51.800 --> 14:57.760
reached its climax and that's also the time when the synchronicity principle was actually

14:57.760 --> 15:02.800
formulated by the two together Jung published it but if you look into the correspondence

15:02.800 --> 15:08.120
you will see that there was a huge amount of discussion and refinement of the paper and

15:08.120 --> 15:12.560
going forth and back and then Pauli said no you can't do it you can you can say this

15:12.560 --> 15:16.880
simply you know and then Jung would would refine and would revise it was a period of

15:16.880 --> 15:24.680
almost one and a half years over which this this paper was developed so you you probably

15:24.680 --> 15:30.560
all know what synchronicity is about it's a synchronicity experience very briefly and

15:30.560 --> 15:39.080
maybe superficially is a kind of is an experience of a meaningful coincidence between the mental

15:39.080 --> 15:47.840
state of an experiencing subject can be a patient can be any human being between the

15:47.840 --> 15:55.760
mental state of an experiencing human subject and physical state of matter kind of apparatus

15:55.760 --> 16:00.920
it can be a kind of can be a piece of rock can be everything out there in the material

16:00.920 --> 16:10.520
world so what we're talking about here is an instantiation of the mind body problem

16:10.520 --> 16:17.040
ultimately and that's why this why this issue of synchronicity moves so many people because

16:17.040 --> 16:26.160
it touches on an issue which is as old as human human cultures are already the Greeks talked

16:26.160 --> 16:31.320
about this and of course in in other parts of the world the mind body problem has been

16:31.320 --> 16:37.960
treated as well though in different terms but that's that's why this this issue of synchronicity

16:37.960 --> 16:43.080
I think is so important because it's a it's a very interesting nucleus for talking about

16:43.080 --> 16:47.640
the mind matter of the mind body problem in general and I think there are three at least

16:47.640 --> 16:55.760
three and that's my then I then I come to an end here at least three roots which are

16:55.760 --> 17:01.760
I think important to study and develop to do research and development on the mind body

17:01.760 --> 17:08.520
problem exemplified by by the principle of synchronicity the first one is we need to

17:08.520 --> 17:14.280
understand better in terms of in terms of scientific research really what's what's going

17:14.280 --> 17:19.760
on in synchronicity events you know we're talking about in relationship between actually

17:19.760 --> 17:27.440
some two two very different realms of reality the the the mental and the material and Harold

17:27.440 --> 17:33.480
my understanding is a causal is a major factor that's that's an important point which we

17:33.480 --> 17:38.520
might come into when we come to when we go into details just give me these these are

17:38.520 --> 17:44.640
the two broad things which I think are important you know interdisciplinarity of course is

17:44.640 --> 17:50.240
a key issue and you see when you see that already when I said a party as a physicist

17:50.240 --> 17:56.200
and and Jung as a psychologist tried to go into that together this is this is the highest

17:56.200 --> 18:03.080
tension of interdisciplinarity that you can actually have in research almost nothing is

18:03.080 --> 18:09.000
done in this in this area then we have the second point is synchronicity is also a kind

18:09.000 --> 18:16.760
of I think it comes down to a world view issue we want to if we want to understand synchronicity

18:16.760 --> 18:23.600
then this this touches on the world view that people really have and for instance when you

18:23.600 --> 18:29.560
go to a standard neuroscientist who in the standard lab neuroscientists what would say

18:29.560 --> 18:34.080
I mean what the mind body problem and actually everything is in the body and every in the

18:34.080 --> 18:40.400
brain and the and we understand the mental the mind when we understand the brain and

18:40.400 --> 18:46.640
for me this is too cheap for many other people too but this is something of course with this

18:46.640 --> 18:52.760
has world view quality at the third point which is also important maybe even more important

18:52.760 --> 18:58.920
than the other two is what are the practical implications of understanding synchronicity

18:58.920 --> 19:05.920
and this might be another issue which we can discuss as as this session develops.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.120
Okay thank you.

19:09.120 --> 19:18.200
One just one point that I'm sure Joe will pick up is that you in his essay on synchronicity

19:18.200 --> 19:25.120
Jung makes it quite clear that he's looking at the kind of phenomena that come together

19:25.120 --> 19:32.480
for which there's no perceivable cause and one of the reasons he's doing this is to try

19:32.480 --> 19:42.120
to get us away from magical thinking that very often if one cannot see a cause or source

19:42.120 --> 19:47.160
that's the reason for something to happen we leap into magical thinking.

19:47.160 --> 19:54.000
So he's asking us to open our minds and not look for strict efficient cause of one thing

19:54.000 --> 20:00.280
therefore making another happen so that if I fall off my horse for instance it isn't

20:00.280 --> 20:07.200
necessarily because God looked down down and saw me there may be some other reason I was

20:07.200 --> 20:09.320
meant to fall off the horse.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.800
There might be some beautiful plant on the ground.

20:12.800 --> 20:17.800
Just gravitation.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.920
No but if something else happens that is enacted but not cause so I just want to stick that

20:20.920 --> 20:26.520
and do you want to say anything more about that piece or another?

20:26.520 --> 20:31.640
What I would just add to the historical discourse I think it's important to see how the idea

20:31.640 --> 20:37.640
emerged in Jung's thought and when I first wrote a book on this it was prior to when the

20:37.640 --> 20:43.160
red book had come out and since then I would rewrite the book considerably because after

20:43.160 --> 20:48.360
studying the red book you can see the emergence of this notion in its early forms.

20:48.360 --> 20:54.920
Basically what happens as many of you probably know in 1913 as Freud and Jung have a real

20:54.920 --> 21:01.160
falling out Jung has a terrible set of personal experiences it's really catastrophic multiple

21:01.160 --> 21:06.400
things are going on in his life but he has a set of visions waking visions on a trip to

21:06.400 --> 21:07.560
see his mother-in-law.

21:07.560 --> 21:11.920
I don't think she was the immediate cause.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.560
One never knows.

21:13.560 --> 21:18.840
In any way more seriously he sees Europe filling up with blood and he's horrified because as

21:18.840 --> 21:24.120
a psychiatrist he understands what these kinds of mental states are apt to indicate.

21:24.120 --> 21:30.200
However instead of trying to seal it over and move away from it he decides to go on an

21:30.200 --> 21:35.960
interior exploration of this state of mind and this leads him to the raw material that

21:35.960 --> 21:39.040
becomes the red book.

21:39.040 --> 21:45.920
He emerges out of that in April of 1914 just about a hundred years ago today.

21:45.920 --> 21:53.520
We're almost smack on when he stops that work and he resigns his presidency from the IPA

21:53.520 --> 21:58.600
he resigns his position in the psychiatry department at the University of Zurich and

21:58.600 --> 22:04.560
he really is sort of in a free fall but he has a series of dreams that he finds rather

22:04.560 --> 22:09.320
helpful and potentially transformative although if you look at them they're healing juices

22:09.320 --> 22:12.040
and grapes but it's frozen and so forth.

22:12.040 --> 22:17.400
The real change for him comes of course in August of 1914 when the guns go off and he

22:17.400 --> 22:23.320
has a sense of oh maybe this wasn't just personal madness maybe there was a prophetic dimension

22:23.320 --> 22:26.840
but the truth of the matter is that the horns of that dilemma are not very appealing to

22:26.840 --> 22:29.400
him either.

22:29.400 --> 22:36.040
In fact he stays with this for about 15 years struggling with how to find a resolution for

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
that.

22:37.040 --> 22:43.200
For him he said the resolution came in 1928 when he received from Richard Wilhelm the

22:43.200 --> 22:48.560
synologist and close friend of his a Chinese alchemical text called the secret of the

22:48.560 --> 22:54.760
golden flower and why that was the ending point was he was in the middle of doing a

22:54.760 --> 22:59.640
set of mandalas for the red book he was working on these kind of elaborate paintings of his

22:59.640 --> 23:05.680
own personal expression and he was doing one that he felt had a very Chinese feel to

23:05.680 --> 23:10.600
it and it had a particularly yellow color to it and so he was stunned just as he had

23:10.600 --> 23:16.480
completed that he received this manuscript and it linked directly to the missing piece

23:16.480 --> 23:22.560
and within a couple of months of that he's giving a dream seminar private dream seminar

23:22.560 --> 23:27.760
and there turns out there's a whole cluster of phenomena that begin to be activated around

23:27.760 --> 23:32.840
a patient's dream and the students in the class ask him how does he understand that

23:32.840 --> 23:36.800
and he said well you know in the west our prejudice is for causality in the east it's

23:36.800 --> 23:42.880
for pattern formation basically it's for this kind of coming together or synchronicity it's

23:42.880 --> 23:45.200
the very first time he uses the term.

23:45.200 --> 23:52.800
In 1930 he uses it once publicly at Wilhelm's memorial service and then he's fairly silent

23:52.800 --> 24:00.600
on it until the poly letters go on but I think that that transitional moment there where he

24:00.600 --> 24:06.920
gets the secret of the golden flower one way to conceive of that is that he has a realization

24:06.920 --> 24:15.960
in the post-year point Beverly that he's that the prophecy madman dilemma is a false dilemma

24:15.960 --> 24:20.280
that there may be something about the quality of the universe we live in it's he's a proto

24:20.280 --> 24:26.040
anthropic universe kind of guy he's suggesting that mind and meaning are somehow inherent

24:26.040 --> 24:32.080
in the very fundamental quality of our universe and so he's starting to make a move into cosmology

24:32.080 --> 24:37.040
or cosmogany quite frankly and when you look at the writing of the synchronous city essay

24:37.040 --> 24:42.720
in the late 40s I'm sure Polly is feeding him some of this he starts to talk about places

24:42.720 --> 24:48.720
where space and time collapsed in year zero about his new idea of a psychoid archetype

24:48.720 --> 24:57.160
that links matter and mind as being a world constituting factor so what we have in that

24:57.160 --> 25:06.560
is basically a cosmogonic hypothesis that's mixing the best of contemporary cosmology

25:06.560 --> 25:11.440
with a kind of new psychological approach and once you put the idea against that background

25:11.440 --> 25:17.680
it inserts to look quite different one final comment taking it forward for myself as a clinician

25:17.680 --> 25:22.240
I got interested in this topic because in the late 80s and early 90s I had a lot of trauma

25:22.240 --> 25:27.400
patients referred and there were a number of them that some rather strange elliptical

25:27.400 --> 25:32.320
communications to say the least anomalous phenomena started to occur and so I went back

25:32.320 --> 25:37.960
and reread Jung's essays to see if it would give me any insight on those cases and I found

25:37.960 --> 25:42.000
there were problems with his argument for example he makes an energy argument but it

25:42.000 --> 25:47.680
uses classical 19th century thermodynamics for closed systems near equilibrium well what

25:47.680 --> 25:52.200
we're talking about with this phenomenon are open systems very far from equilibrium so

25:52.200 --> 25:56.280
in fact my good fortune at the time when I started thinking about this is the people

25:56.280 --> 26:02.720
of the Santa Fe Institute were studying complex adaptive systems and they began to speak about

26:02.720 --> 26:07.760
exactly those kind of systems that might be occurring at the origins of life at the origins

26:07.760 --> 26:13.120
of mind and so forth and so when you cast a recast this hypothesis within that kind of

26:13.120 --> 26:17.720
metaphor you get a different understanding that I think actually has a lot of clinical

26:17.720 --> 26:23.720
utility as well as some applications for physics but I'll stop there.

26:23.720 --> 26:30.400
And Farzad you came into this from a completely different angle and how did you why were you

26:30.400 --> 26:34.320
drawn to this?

26:34.320 --> 26:40.480
Well my first response please said that was it's pretty much how I do everything some

26:40.480 --> 26:46.800
other angle coming in and I think if I think the first time I heard about this I was studying

26:46.800 --> 26:54.960
chemistry and I started to get interested in the history of chemistry because I noticed

26:54.960 --> 27:01.680
that there were different phenomena could be explained by two different mathematical

27:01.680 --> 27:06.640
formalisms explaining the same phenomena and then on the other hand sometimes you had

27:06.640 --> 27:11.920
one mathematical formalism explaining two really widely different phenomena and so this got

27:11.920 --> 27:17.040
me to think about alternatives to what I was being taught I was taking physical chemistry

27:17.040 --> 27:22.040
which as anyone knows who's taking chemistry when you start to look for alternatives because

27:22.040 --> 27:30.080
it's hard to do but I realized at that point there's many ways to go do this after I looked

27:30.080 --> 27:35.600
at the history of chemistry I thought how many ideas have kind of not made it for one reason

27:35.600 --> 27:41.480
or another like all the different technologies that for internal combustion engines there's

27:41.480 --> 27:44.840
several but we were kind of stuck with one for a long time.

27:44.840 --> 27:49.600
In any case I started looking in the history and I came across young in the history of

27:49.600 --> 27:57.040
chemistry with alchemy and then from there I basically got lost for a while wandering

27:57.040 --> 28:06.800
around trying to figure out why he's writing so much about alchemy and as a psychologist

28:06.800 --> 28:13.000
and it was in there when I started looking at his other works and found synchronicity

28:13.000 --> 28:18.760
that I saw the cross between the two fields as you were saying the physics the study of

28:18.760 --> 28:24.120
matter and the study of mind at the same time and that got me very interested.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.480
So it was from science that really drove me to it I didn't really know much psychology

28:27.480 --> 28:34.040
or I didn't even started doing philosophy yet which is what I ended up doing.

28:34.040 --> 28:40.720
One of the themes that came out when we were talking last night is the degree to which

28:40.720 --> 28:48.520
serendipity in scientific discovery or in laboratory work is sometimes experienced as

28:48.520 --> 28:54.600
what we would call the synchronicity something we didn't really set out it seems to come

28:54.600 --> 29:04.360
to us in a nonlinear way and so I'd like to turn to Edgar about this.

29:04.360 --> 29:10.920
Edgar really stepped into this I mean he's able to figure out how to send a rocket into

29:10.920 --> 29:17.640
space and the interval of 12 minutes that it takes to get into space and so that sort

29:17.640 --> 29:25.800
of the spirit with which he agreed to participate today to just step into this room and into

29:25.800 --> 29:31.720
this discussion which is extremely different from what he does in his aerospace lab.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.200
So Edgar could you?

29:33.200 --> 29:39.840
Yes I should start by saying that coming to your credentials in science limited to dissecting

29:39.840 --> 29:47.160
frogs I should say my experience in psychology is limited to dissecting the mind of my girlfriend

29:47.160 --> 29:48.160
in college.

29:48.160 --> 29:56.600
It's a attempt that I miserably failed of course but so my as someone who works only

29:56.600 --> 30:01.560
on the matter on the mindless matter part of the equation here since we have eminent

30:01.560 --> 30:06.440
psychologists and people who work on the mind and in the case of Harold both mind and matter

30:06.440 --> 30:08.440
I work only on matter.

30:08.440 --> 30:15.600
Perhaps the role I could play is that of a pro-poke a little bit and maybe reflect a

30:15.600 --> 30:21.760
little bit of the some of the skepticism that I hear in the more prosaic community of applied

30:21.760 --> 30:25.160
physics when somebody mentions synchronicity.

30:25.160 --> 30:32.480
Specifically at least of course there's no doubt that there's some very interesting aspects

30:32.480 --> 30:37.720
of context in which synchronicity can be talked in the realm of physics.

30:37.720 --> 30:42.840
I'm sure Harold will tell us more about it especially in quantum mechanics itself in

30:42.840 --> 30:48.280
the theory and experiments having to do with quantum entanglement but when it comes to

30:48.280 --> 30:53.760
prosaic research in everyday physics and applied physics we actually teach our graduate students

30:53.760 --> 31:02.000
to avoid specifically some activities or some habits that synchronicity seems to imply

31:02.000 --> 31:06.720
as central to our human existence.

31:06.720 --> 31:11.840
Specifically the idea of asking causality.

31:11.840 --> 31:17.800
One has to be fair Jung himself did not say that synchronicity is a replacement for causality

31:17.800 --> 31:19.640
and coincidence.

31:19.640 --> 31:24.560
He said it's another option so to speak.

31:24.560 --> 31:31.400
One that of course he also implied extends more to a general framework.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.920
Let me give you an example for it to become more concrete.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.640
For example let's say you are going to see a friend.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.120
You seek to see a certain friend who you know where he lives.

31:41.120 --> 31:45.200
You know he lives on 82nd and next in the morning.

31:45.200 --> 31:49.800
You walk to the block, you turn the corner and he's in front of you.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.880
Now there's a causality involved.

31:51.880 --> 31:55.400
You're not going to be terribly surprised because when you turn the corner and see your

31:55.400 --> 31:57.280
friend you know it's the time to work.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.160
You actually sought him.

31:59.160 --> 32:03.560
His being there is not terribly surprising.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.000
There's a coincidence of seeing him.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
You're not expecting to see him but the coincidence has a causal you know relation.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.200
Now imagine going walking around the city, turning a block and as you turn the block you

32:18.200 --> 32:21.640
think of a friend you haven't thought of in 20 years.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.800
John.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.560
And suddenly John is right in front of your face.

32:26.560 --> 32:32.320
Now of course depending on how spiritual you are or how skeptical you are you might make

32:32.320 --> 32:35.360
a big deal of the situation.

32:35.360 --> 32:39.960
Most of that situation seems to me and again please correct me later on if I'm wrong.

32:39.960 --> 32:45.120
To satisfy more what John had in mind when he talked about a single city.

32:45.120 --> 32:51.400
Specifically John talked about a situation where he was constantly talking to a patient

32:51.400 --> 32:56.160
and when she mentioned in the middle of her talking about her dreams a golden scarab being

32:56.160 --> 33:03.120
given a present in her dream of a golden scarab and at that exact moment, John said there was

33:03.120 --> 33:09.480
a little tap on the window behind him and I'm sure he's very correct in fact as they were.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.520
Turn around, there was a bug on the window, opened the window, grabbed the bug in the middle

33:13.520 --> 33:18.120
air and it wasn't as close as his scarab as you can find in Zurich at that time.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.000
So and he made a big deal of it and that was an example that he cited in I think in his

33:22.000 --> 33:24.280
book in 1952.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.920
So that to my mind resembles very much what happens when you turn the corner and suddenly

33:28.920 --> 33:30.680
you see your friend you thought of.

33:30.680 --> 33:37.360
Now the question is we teach our students in the lab, graduate students to think about

33:37.360 --> 33:38.560
it this way.

33:38.560 --> 33:45.720
Now how often do you go around the city thinking of people, which you do quite often, and you

33:45.720 --> 33:48.640
turn around and they're not there.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.800
And so we teach them what we call normalization.

33:50.800 --> 33:55.960
You have to divide the number of certain events by the large number of other events.

33:55.960 --> 34:00.560
So there's a huge number of times you go around the city thinking of people and there's

34:00.560 --> 34:03.560
a huge number of times you turn corners and not there.

34:03.560 --> 34:08.200
When you normalize them you get a small number that will be caused statistical noise and

34:08.200 --> 34:10.240
we tell them to look at it this way.

34:10.240 --> 34:14.440
So of course we get a little bit edgy, I'm not talking about myself, but when somebody

34:14.440 --> 34:18.760
comes and say wait a minute there is a grander more and your students should be aware of

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
this.

34:19.760 --> 34:24.760
Now I'm not saying this is what Jung didn't say, but this is how sometimes it's perceived

34:24.760 --> 34:29.600
in the prosaic community of applied physics, simplicity might be manifested.

34:29.600 --> 34:36.400
So I'm here to poke starting with this argument and hopefully get some conversation.

34:36.400 --> 34:43.760
Also I would like to be educated more on how the concept simplicity can interface with

34:43.760 --> 34:50.080
physical science and ask how come in 62 years hasn't yet settled on something we can teach

34:50.080 --> 34:51.080
in textbooks.

34:51.080 --> 34:58.040
For example quantum mechanics is now an 80 year old science, we teach it in schools, but

34:58.040 --> 35:05.160
seldom we get to talk about these issues that directly relate to Jung and even what

35:05.160 --> 35:10.520
Pali were talking about is not very well accepted by the mainstream physics community.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.320
So hopefully I can play that a bit of skeptical podium.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.120
You're playing Pali's role.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.840
That's why actually you look a little bit like Pali's too.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.520
That's very flattering considering how much I have.

35:21.520 --> 35:27.120
You know the history of early quantum mechanics, he was seen as something like a demon George

35:27.120 --> 35:31.920
Gamov actually has a picture of him with horns on because every time he'd go to a lab to

35:31.920 --> 35:36.800
see what was going on and this cutting edge lab everyone would tremble in fear because

35:36.800 --> 35:39.680
things would break down.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.680
And if you know-

35:40.680 --> 35:41.680
It's the Pali effect.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.240
Exactly, hasn't it?

35:43.240 --> 35:51.200
And so the thing is that instruments that deal with observing atomic phenomena or basically

35:51.200 --> 35:59.320
phenomena that are at a certain scale or in a certain level of metastability are sensitive.

35:59.320 --> 36:04.960
Sensitive enough to have a really grumpy, very sort of skeptical, poke a hole kind of guy

36:04.960 --> 36:08.160
in the lab who was also brilliant in a Nobel Prize winner.

36:08.160 --> 36:10.960
And so that happened quite a lot.

36:10.960 --> 36:17.640
But he in fact the same person was the one that stimulated Jung to actually consider

36:17.640 --> 36:23.320
the possibilities of psyche and matter somehow not being two things but being two aspects

36:23.320 --> 36:30.520
of one thing or essentially not treating synchronicity as a mental phenomenon only.

36:30.520 --> 36:36.760
If we do just look at it as instance, instance, instance and then what I think about what

36:36.760 --> 36:40.440
meaning I put on one instance or another, it gets tricky.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.880
You can't do any statistics on it.

36:42.880 --> 36:48.640
And so one of the things that is interesting in trying to take a scientific view on synchronicity

36:48.640 --> 36:55.280
is you have to revise your idea of what a scientific view is because on the one hand

36:55.280 --> 36:57.200
you can't do the statistics.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.520
On the other hand you have phenomena.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.840
And then you have people who habitually are making meaning seeing patterns.

37:04.840 --> 37:15.560
And so for people to basically naturally think about a coincidence as more than a coincidence

37:15.560 --> 37:18.120
is something that happens all the time.

37:18.120 --> 37:24.360
So it's a common phenomenon therefore one that would fall in the domain of science that

37:24.360 --> 37:25.680
needs to be studied.

37:25.680 --> 37:28.840
But then the normal way of doing it won't do it so we have to rethink.

37:28.840 --> 37:35.360
I'll just add one thing here, something I learned from going into lab and actually I

37:35.360 --> 37:41.600
probably learned it before that but I really saw it crystallize in laboratory settings.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.640
And it has to do with a poly effect very much.

37:44.640 --> 37:49.840
What we saw in quantum theory early on and the lesson that was learned there I think

37:49.840 --> 37:54.560
has not yet had an effect on how science is done.

37:54.560 --> 37:59.480
I think it's changed science and it's created a lot of technologies.

37:59.480 --> 38:04.480
But the idea of what quantum theory did to science has not yet made it.

38:04.480 --> 38:09.080
And I think that's where synchronicity and physics hit.

38:09.080 --> 38:15.720
And it's precisely just one point and that is that there is an effect when you observe

38:15.720 --> 38:19.120
something at an atomic scale you become part of that.

38:19.120 --> 38:25.800
So in other words the observation becomes constitutive of the thing you're observing.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.960
And I'll put it in more general terms.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.360
This was the beginning of seeing the world as relational.

38:32.360 --> 38:39.960
So what a thing is is not something just in itself closed and totally self-defined.

38:39.960 --> 38:45.760
What anything is in this relational world view is it's made up of its relations to

38:45.760 --> 38:47.000
everything else.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.400
Also the properties of this cup or this table are not properties just purely inherent.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.360
They're properties that are dispositional.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.600
They will emerge upon interaction.

38:57.600 --> 39:02.000
In this kind of large scale world interaction with the world doesn't really change the

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
chair.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.320
Am I sitting in the chair, change it a little bit but not significantly.

39:05.320 --> 39:10.680
It's when you get to the atomic level that's simply the act of observation of that actually

39:10.680 --> 39:14.760
changes what it is so you can access while you're looking at certain aspects of it, other

39:14.760 --> 39:21.560
aspects of it are invisible, not accessible, unobservable.

39:21.560 --> 39:30.080
This is what Bohr and Pauli effect agreed quite strongly with him is called complementarity.

39:30.080 --> 39:37.760
And at the root of complementarity is this idea of which is the same as the relational

39:37.760 --> 39:39.920
world view of a coupling.

39:39.920 --> 39:45.080
So what Bohr said it all, complementarity boils down to, and I think this is what synchronicity

39:45.080 --> 39:50.480
boils down to as well, is that when you observe something there's a coupling between the observing

39:50.480 --> 39:52.880
device and the thing being observed.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.840
And at that point there's a wholeness.

39:54.840 --> 39:56.160
There's one thing.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.320
And any dividing line you put between them is going to be arbitrary.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.760
It's going to be theory dependent.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.600
It's going to be instrument dependent.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.760
It's going to be context dependent.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.600
And that was not part of science up till this time.

40:08.600 --> 40:14.120
It was after that that Bohr kind of formulated conceptually as complementarity.

40:14.120 --> 40:18.960
Heisenberg then came up with a mathematics that showed precisely to what extent something

40:18.960 --> 40:27.160
becomes imprecise, that we start to have this idea that the properties are relational in

40:27.160 --> 40:29.360
the physical world.

40:29.360 --> 40:35.680
And I'll just say this last thing and then pull back to the larger world and see where

40:35.680 --> 40:38.320
this goes.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.800
So, basically we're dealing with pairs, dyads.

40:40.800 --> 40:44.920
Anytime we have two things overlapping, becoming one thing.

40:44.920 --> 40:49.160
So there's a causal interaction between the observing device and the thing observed.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.320
You have one thing, you have a wholeness there.

40:51.320 --> 40:55.520
At that point you have a co-constitution of one thing by the other thing.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.320
Now, as I said, this is not observable in science, but any of you who are married or

40:59.320 --> 41:06.760
in relationship right now know that what you are, how you feel, has a lot to do with is

41:06.760 --> 41:10.160
dependent on the other person that's significant in your life.

41:10.160 --> 41:15.440
You co-constitute one another, there's no defining you without the other.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.160
And family relationships are like that, ecosystems are like that.

41:19.160 --> 41:23.360
So we have a lot of macro-scale things that are, but we didn't really do science that

41:23.360 --> 41:26.680
way until quantum theory sort of forced it on us.

41:26.680 --> 41:32.520
And I'll pull back from that for now.

41:32.520 --> 41:38.040
One issue that is relevant to synchronicity, that I would imagine would drive a scientist

41:38.040 --> 41:45.520
mad, which I don't want to have happen to you, is that in fact there is no statistic,

41:45.520 --> 41:49.600
and it's a highly subjective experience.

41:49.600 --> 41:56.520
In so far as it's only one person in that instance, sometimes it's villages who has

41:56.520 --> 42:02.360
the image, and at that time it's not that, oh, there's been many times I didn't see my

42:02.360 --> 42:03.360
friend.

42:03.360 --> 42:10.840
It's, you, if the person asks why, what in particular, why was I thinking of this person,

42:10.840 --> 42:17.200
what do they mean to me, what do they represent to me, and why is that being reinforced, and

42:17.200 --> 42:24.840
can I register it with surprise, which is one of the survival emotions, then it should

42:24.840 --> 42:30.120
take me to some part of myself that is the reason from the inside I was thinking that

42:30.120 --> 42:37.880
person, about that person, that would allow me to make it meaningful that I met that person.

42:37.880 --> 42:44.120
So it's highly subjective, it's not reproducible, and you can't set it up in the lab.

42:44.120 --> 42:53.360
It includes coming seemingly out of the blue in terms of that kind of coupling.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.560
So maybe you can pick up the graph.

42:54.560 --> 42:58.800
Yeah, I actually wanted to address some of the issues, Edgar, that you brought up, because

42:58.800 --> 43:05.760
I think it's really important to take these objections seriously, because if you don't

43:05.760 --> 43:12.560
do that, then you don't have any chance to talk about this scandalous frontier between

43:12.560 --> 43:14.960
the mantle and the material, right?

43:14.960 --> 43:20.680
And I think you described very well how the reaction of a typical, not only physicist,

43:20.680 --> 43:27.040
typical scientist to this principle of synchronicity would look like, because whenever you see

43:27.040 --> 43:34.680
a correlation in the sciences, and you don't have a causal model that describes it, then

43:34.680 --> 43:38.200
the reflexes, this must be chance.

43:38.200 --> 43:45.960
Not only, I would even say, not only if the number of incidences versus the noise is so

43:45.960 --> 43:52.160
low, but even for the conceptual reason that once you don't have any causal model, then

43:52.160 --> 43:54.360
it must be noise, right?

43:54.360 --> 43:59.120
And if you have sometimes in high energy physics or in cosmology, if you have signals which

43:59.120 --> 44:05.800
stand out of the noise by many standard deviations, some people would say, no, this is not enough,

44:05.800 --> 44:09.800
because we don't have a model, we don't know how this comes up.

44:09.800 --> 44:18.600
Now Jung, actually in his definition of synchronicity, wanted to, he implemented something with

44:18.600 --> 44:24.760
which he wanted to react against the noise argument, the chance argument, and that was

44:24.760 --> 44:33.480
the idea that not as a replacement, as you said, but as a complement to the causal explanation,

44:33.480 --> 44:39.680
there is another possible explanation, and that he called meaning, meaning, that's why

44:39.680 --> 44:43.320
synchronicities are called meaningful coincidences.

44:43.320 --> 44:48.960
And not only the meaning just blah, blah, blah for a banal thing, but at least for a

44:48.960 --> 44:55.560
long time, Jung was convinced that this meaning must have, he used to notion, luminous dimensions.

44:55.560 --> 45:00.080
So something like, people must be touched existentially.

45:00.080 --> 45:08.160
And the scarab example that you, of course, properly told us, of course, had a luminous

45:08.160 --> 45:15.520
dimension for the client, and for Jung himself, because it's important to see that it's not

45:15.520 --> 45:21.400
only for the client, it's a kind of, it goes on in both, because it's a diet, even in that

45:21.400 --> 45:24.200
relationship, right?

45:24.200 --> 45:31.440
So for the client, a whole new world of realizing emotional components and his, well, Bob Antone

45:31.440 --> 45:37.000
came up, and for Jung, I mean, Jung, of course, he knew about this idea of synchronicity,

45:37.000 --> 45:43.680
he was deeply touched by the way in which he saw that this just worked in that instant.

45:43.680 --> 45:48.920
So this notion of meaning, now, of course, when you come to a scientist and tell him,

45:48.920 --> 45:54.840
you know, now we causal explanations don't work for these correlations, so I'm not allowed

45:54.840 --> 45:58.640
to do chance, then these guys tell me I should do meaning.

45:58.640 --> 46:03.160
This is even a greater scandal, because meaning is not at all a topic in science.

46:03.160 --> 46:07.600
It's not what it's about.

46:07.600 --> 46:11.480
Of course, every scientist would insist that he does meaningful work, and so on and so.

46:11.480 --> 46:17.400
What I'm saying is the issue of meaning itself is not an explicit object of the study, that's

46:17.400 --> 46:19.400
what I'm saying.

46:19.400 --> 46:25.800
And now, of course, we are sitting here and are confronting the question, how can we,

46:25.800 --> 46:33.040
in a reasonable way, in a way which other people can understand, how can we talk about

46:33.040 --> 46:36.400
meaning?

46:36.400 --> 46:40.760
And that is, of course, this can be a research topic, of course.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.720
This is also a topic for individual experiences.

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
Yeah.

46:44.720 --> 46:54.680
And of course, meaning is most often something that one experiences the desire to grant if

46:54.680 --> 47:03.040
it has an emotional charge to one, and if it takes one out of one's usual orientation.

47:03.040 --> 47:10.320
For me, as an analyst, one of the most stunning aspects of synchronicity is the degree to

47:10.320 --> 47:19.120
which it brings an aspect of surprise to me that often has to shake up a certain fixed

47:19.120 --> 47:26.640
element of my counter-transference onto a patient that I haven't really noticed has

47:26.640 --> 47:34.360
somehow slipped into some kind of embedded state and is not sufficiently fluid.

47:34.360 --> 47:36.480
And then very often something will happen.

47:36.480 --> 47:42.560
For instance, I'll open the door, I'll see a patient, and I'll suddenly think of a lobster

47:42.560 --> 47:48.080
for absolutely no reason, and the person doesn't look remotely like a lobster.

47:48.080 --> 47:53.960
And then she'll sit down in the chair and say that she was just on Canal Street and

47:53.960 --> 48:01.600
a little lobster ran between the cars because Canal Street still has things coming up from

48:01.600 --> 48:03.160
the canal.

48:03.160 --> 48:08.800
Or I will have a thought, and for some, you know, we're all trained to really pay attention

48:08.800 --> 48:12.680
to what are the images that come up in us.

48:12.680 --> 48:20.920
And very often it turns out to be an image that a patient's dream will contain.

48:20.920 --> 48:26.840
And I don't see that, and I don't understand it, but I don't see it as just mirror neuron

48:26.840 --> 48:28.240
phenomena.

48:28.240 --> 48:34.760
I don't see it as just echmin-like expressions where I'm imitating the expression on my

48:34.760 --> 48:38.280
patient's face, so I come up with the same images.

48:38.280 --> 48:43.920
There's some way that element of surprise is asking me to wake up to something with

48:43.920 --> 48:48.360
that patient that maybe I've become a little bit dulled out toward.

48:48.360 --> 48:53.440
Now, I don't know how that works in terms of serendipity and laboratories.

48:53.440 --> 49:00.080
I'm not sure I can go right to serendipity, but I wanted to, for a moment, return to

49:00.080 --> 49:06.520
the misattribution because I think that's an extremely important piece of the discussion.

49:06.520 --> 49:10.920
And from another place I'll start with something that Winnicott said that one of the roles of

49:10.920 --> 49:14.080
the mother is to protect the infant from too much coincidence.

49:14.080 --> 49:15.760
It's a fascinating statement.

49:15.760 --> 49:19.520
Tom Ogden picked it up and put it into one of his books.

49:19.520 --> 49:22.840
And I thought, well, what is that telling us about our structures of the understanding

49:22.840 --> 49:23.840
of the world?

49:23.840 --> 49:27.880
You know, that I think there's something about the way we formulated science that we're in

49:27.880 --> 49:29.840
the midst of a paradigm change.

49:29.840 --> 49:34.200
And the whole question, of course, as you know, is how do you get from statistical

49:34.200 --> 49:37.520
understandings up to the actual observed phenomena?

49:37.520 --> 49:39.840
You have a gap there, as we all do.

49:39.840 --> 49:44.360
And this is where things like emergence, we've needed a complex enough science.

49:44.360 --> 49:50.040
So the question would be, for me then, if we reframe this again in terms of interactive

49:50.040 --> 49:55.760
fields, we might have a more interesting discussion about what is coming up between myself and

49:55.760 --> 49:57.320
the other.

49:57.320 --> 50:01.640
We've all been talking about co-constructed fields in the analytic world for quite a while.

50:01.640 --> 50:07.040
And I go back now to the 19th century when, starting with Hans Christian Orsted, when

50:07.040 --> 50:13.640
he was running, showing his students how to do a voltaic pile, you know, and he accidentally

50:13.640 --> 50:20.600
serendipitously, I'll put it in now, serendipitously, there was a compass on the table and the needle

50:20.600 --> 50:21.920
fluctuated.

50:21.920 --> 50:27.040
This was the very first experimental observation of a link between electricity and magnetism,

50:27.040 --> 50:31.360
that those phenomena that had prior to that seemed completely unrelated.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.360
Now had a link.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.960
He didn't know much what to do with it, quite honestly.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.920
That was in the 1820s.

50:36.920 --> 50:41.720
And by the way, a friend of his predicted in the 1820s this would be discovered.

50:41.720 --> 50:45.200
That's a whole other story.

50:45.200 --> 50:52.240
However, we have to go to Michael Faraday in the 1850s before we get the experimental

50:52.240 --> 50:54.360
evidence for what fields are like.

50:54.360 --> 51:00.120
And you know, when Faraday finally articulates his field theory to the British, the Royal

51:00.120 --> 51:05.920
Society of Science, people are stunned because he's overthrowing Newton.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.680
The space is no longer empty.

51:08.680 --> 51:12.840
And that things are not, that there's no action at a distance.

51:12.840 --> 51:18.160
That suddenly the things that seemed magical in science were now being retransformed.

51:18.160 --> 51:23.720
Enough that James Clerk Maxwell, when he does his equations, he's a very young man at this

51:23.720 --> 51:29.440
point, he writes to Faraday, a rather amazing letter saying about what this is done to his

51:29.440 --> 51:30.800
understanding of the universe.

51:30.800 --> 51:36.560
It's opened up an interconnected web that he sees the heavens in this kind of, what I

51:36.560 --> 51:40.760
would call an archetypal image that grabs him with great power.

51:40.760 --> 51:43.120
And of course that leads to Einstein.

51:43.120 --> 51:47.400
But we know in the 1870s that William James is reading Maxwell.

51:47.400 --> 51:53.960
And he's incorporating that when he gives his Gifford lectures in 1904, 1905, these are

51:53.960 --> 52:00.000
the variety of religious experiences, he talks about the margins of consciousness acting

52:00.000 --> 52:01.560
like a magnetic field.

52:01.560 --> 52:06.440
He uses that metaphor very, very explicitly in those lectures.

52:06.440 --> 52:12.720
And so what we have then is the kind of introduction of a field theory, a theory of mine being

52:12.720 --> 52:15.720
introduced, borrowed from physics, creating a new paradigm.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.720
And I think this is the model that Jung himself was starting to develop.

52:19.720 --> 52:26.240
Because by say 1934, he writes, James Kirsch wrote him a supervisory letter asking for

52:26.240 --> 52:30.400
his advice about an explicit transference dream that a patient had.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.880
And Jung gives him some support and advice on this.

52:32.880 --> 52:37.760
And he says, but you know really, at the deepest level, we don't dream out of ourselves or

52:37.760 --> 52:39.880
the other, but it's what lies between.

52:39.880 --> 52:45.520
In an analytic process, he saw the dreams as being out of a co-created matrix that was

52:45.520 --> 52:46.520
coming out of that.

52:46.520 --> 52:51.520
What kind of scientific discussions do we have for the besides going into field theory?

52:51.520 --> 52:55.520
Well, maybe I can poke a little bit further.

52:55.520 --> 53:01.600
And first of all, what I try to describe in my earlier comment is the unease that practicing

53:01.600 --> 53:07.800
researchers at these physical science, I'm sure, is a lot like this in their life sciences,

53:07.800 --> 53:15.200
have when you can encourage people to draw a conclusion as to a correlation, a space on

53:15.200 --> 53:18.480
meaning as opposed to only base on causality.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.680
But now let me turn the table.

53:19.680 --> 53:29.200
So let me turn the argument around and ask, in the realm of Jungian analysis, there is

53:29.200 --> 53:35.760
a tendency to use some simplicity, of course, and to interpret the example that Beverly just

53:35.760 --> 53:38.560
did with a patient.

53:38.560 --> 53:47.240
The question I have is there should be to some extent a questioning of how much personal

53:47.240 --> 53:48.760
bias is at stake.

53:48.760 --> 53:54.480
So when you go around the corner and you think of a friend and you see him after 20 years

53:54.480 --> 53:59.360
for the first time, because you thought of him, you have a tendency to amplify because

53:59.360 --> 54:05.920
of your own experiences, maybe because of your own belief, Christian beliefs, religious beliefs,

54:05.920 --> 54:09.480
maybe Jesus was behind it and so on, things that we do all the time.

54:09.480 --> 54:17.440
So there seems to be, for it to be a universal, tenet or universal concept for simplicity

54:17.440 --> 54:23.960
to be such a concept, there ought to be some more scrupulous analysis of when it is based

54:23.960 --> 54:28.600
on meaning or when it is caused by amplification of personal bias.

54:28.600 --> 54:32.880
We call that, when we teach our students, to do statistical analysis and find a correlation

54:32.880 --> 54:40.840
that could be based on their bias, it is caused an error, one type, one of the worst things

54:40.840 --> 54:44.280
you could do, number one, make sure it is not because you want to believe in the theory

54:44.280 --> 54:45.880
that you saw this coincidence.

54:45.880 --> 54:52.560
So is there such a burden that you guys uphold and how do you do it?

54:52.560 --> 54:57.560
And how do you make sure that you are not saying, this is really meaning, this is really what

54:57.560 --> 55:02.240
Jung had in mind, and not simply because I wanted to see a lobster.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.240
Yes, of course.

55:03.240 --> 55:05.600
I'll make a brief comment.

55:05.600 --> 55:13.680
Yeah, and just that it was precisely so that we didn't create all magical levels of thinking

55:13.680 --> 55:18.600
and the gods and goddesses are coming down and giving us a message when something unexpected

55:18.600 --> 55:24.960
happens is to leave our minds sufficiently open, that we are the person who is perceiving

55:24.960 --> 55:32.320
things, we are making the connections that just because we don't see the efficient cause

55:32.320 --> 55:37.960
and effect aspect of it doesn't mean it's magical, it is something that has happened

55:37.960 --> 55:39.440
to us.

55:39.440 --> 55:43.840
If it hits us, if it affects us, then we grant it meaning.

55:43.840 --> 55:48.640
It's not that there is meaning in my friend coming.

55:48.640 --> 55:58.160
It's the surprise aspect and as I said, of the recognized universal survival emotion,

55:58.160 --> 56:00.000
surprise is one of them.

56:00.000 --> 56:08.200
So I sort of have always taken it that it's like a call to just be more alert and alive

56:08.200 --> 56:14.240
and connected to certain levels of connection that I've not been so observant of.

56:14.240 --> 56:16.440
But it's quite subjective in there.

56:16.440 --> 56:22.320
But I also think that part of the answer is to not immediately jump to the fact, aha,

56:22.320 --> 56:25.720
this is meaningful because I think you're absolutely right there, a ways in which our

56:25.720 --> 56:31.880
bias will unconsciously, I mean the unconscious bias is obviously the most difficult to eliminate

56:31.880 --> 56:32.880
from that.

56:32.880 --> 56:39.840
And one of the things that one tries to do, I think, with this we might call Jungian neutrality

56:39.840 --> 56:44.960
would be to hold the phenomena and watch what else happens, watch what else comes from the

56:44.960 --> 56:46.680
field itself.

56:46.680 --> 56:52.320
That I think rather than taking one event and taking that as a kind of definitive answer

56:52.320 --> 56:56.360
to this kind of question, one sees what begins to follow.

56:56.360 --> 57:01.680
So for example, I can give you some cases where I have had a synchronicity or something

57:01.680 --> 57:07.280
that might be defined in that way with a patient and I've not particularly commented on it.

57:07.280 --> 57:11.840
I've just held it in watched because I felt that it was an elliptical communication.

57:11.840 --> 57:16.760
For example, with trauma patients, we can go to the brain neuroscience for just a second.

57:16.760 --> 57:20.840
We know that when the amygdala is really active and there's a lot of fear and anxiety, there

57:20.840 --> 57:24.320
are parts of the frontal lobe system that are going to shut down.

57:24.320 --> 57:28.280
So they're putting things into language and probably even images are not going to happen

57:28.280 --> 57:30.960
very readily with that sort of patient.

57:30.960 --> 57:36.440
And under those conditions, the normal avenues of communication are blocked off.

57:36.440 --> 57:41.880
The question is, are there more archaic forms of communication that might be possible, that

57:41.880 --> 57:47.200
one has interactions that amplify that field that I was talking about, the interactive field,

57:47.200 --> 57:51.160
gets charged effectively even though there isn't a verbal component.

57:51.160 --> 57:55.880
And so then the question is to do a trajectory, to follow this over time.

57:55.880 --> 58:01.440
So with a patient where I had a really striking, new manous kind of synchronicity where she

58:01.440 --> 58:06.080
had a effectively a precognitive dream that it was only two days later that something happened

58:06.080 --> 58:12.160
to me that precipitated the identical event at the level of image.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.760
She had a dream that I was lost in the black forest.

58:15.760 --> 58:20.920
I started to dive and it was in a site called the Black Forest.

58:20.920 --> 58:21.920
Choral site.

58:21.920 --> 58:24.200
Choral site, yeah, it's a black coral.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.200
It was called the black forest.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.120
That was the dive site name.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.160
And I was just learning to dive.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.160
So there was that kind of confluence.

58:30.160 --> 58:33.080
I never disclosed this to the patient.

58:33.080 --> 58:38.200
But what happened, and she had no idea where I was.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.760
And there was no dive equipment.

58:39.760 --> 58:44.880
I was rather scrupulous about making sure that piece of the communication wasn't involved.

58:44.880 --> 58:51.000
She then had a series of dreams for example in which she was in great difficulty underwater

58:51.000 --> 58:54.240
and I would show up and help her with what's called buddy breathing.

58:54.240 --> 58:57.360
That is, you take the regulator and share it.

58:57.360 --> 59:01.520
And this had to do with the kind of psychological rescue.

59:01.520 --> 59:07.960
That felt to me like it was a reinforcement that the unconscious of the patient was interacting

59:07.960 --> 59:13.600
in the field communicating back that what was synchronistically occurring between us

59:13.600 --> 59:21.800
was in fact finding verification in her communicative system that was outside conscious ability.

59:21.800 --> 59:26.640
And so it's following that over a period of a year or two that seems to me starts to

59:26.640 --> 59:31.640
create a more evidential base that this is something other than just my personal bias

59:31.640 --> 59:32.800
that's doing that.

59:32.800 --> 59:37.240
Even though I must admit my personal bias got me very interested to start paying attention

59:37.240 --> 59:39.040
to these details.

59:39.040 --> 59:46.000
If I may draw out the microscopic examination, if I may draw out the microscopic examination

59:46.000 --> 59:51.840
of synchronicity and talk about it from a macro scale.

59:51.840 --> 59:57.640
What I mean by that is we've been talking as if so we have this phenomenon that people

59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.320
seem to observe in psychology.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.520
If they're young, young analysts, they see this and other people say.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:10.240
So let's scrutinize that and see how we can examine this thing and what criteria count.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.880
That's kind of a normal procedure of kind of going down to smaller and smaller levels

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.600
to try to find some verification that we can then replicate and so forth.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.280
I want to draw back from that for a moment and then take some of the characteristics

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.480
that we've heard about about how do you tell if it's a synchronicity.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.640
You follow the meaning.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.680
You basically look for some larger context.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:37.680
You're not just verifying one fact about the person but you're alerted to pay attention

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.320
now to see what else might be coming along that's meaningful in a broader sense than

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.960
that one instance.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:44.960
Okay.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:50.280
So essentially it comes down for example as we were just saying in a transference, counter

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.640
transference kind of situation where you're trying to figure out who's mind we're talking

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.080
about right now.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:01.440
Is this something I'm projecting on the therapist or vice versa and sorting that out is very

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.280
important in therapy.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:08.280
It's analogous to sorting out whether you're creating an effect by your instrument or whether

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:15.880
the phenomenon is actually responding naturally as it does.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.320
Okay.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:25.200
So what's missing I think from science as a whole has been is a degree of self-consciousness.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:30.000
It's conscious but it's not self-conscious as it should be.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.960
And what I mean by that for one example we had early on was just in this discussion.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.440
Science doesn't talk about meaning.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.440
It's a scientist who meaningful work but they don't study meaning.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.200
What does that tell you?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.560
That's a bizarre statement to make.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:51.960
Back up from that we have scientists being so objective that they will essentially deem

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:55.000
themselves neutral on an ethical field.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.320
My work is ethically neutral.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.680
This is purely objective.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.920
It has no subjective dimension whatsoever.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.640
It doesn't matter whether I like it.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640
Don't like it.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.920
I'm not surprised, find it meaningful, not meaningful.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.880
I just took a measurement and I took a whole bunch of them.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.400
And we know that there's no error.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.680
One coming in here which is the data.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.920
These are all good characteristics of science.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.920
But when you pan back to a larger scale you see that science does have tremendous ethical

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.160
impact.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.600
Scientists are not trained to see it as a matter of their discipline nor is society

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:38.760
prepared to do anything internally with the development of science until recently.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.000
Sort of you let the thing roll along.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Something horrible happens.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.840
There's a government committee that tries to figure out what are the ethical implications.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.840
What should we do?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.840
But recently now we see that in fact there's a good recognition at least from the 60s on

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:59.280
that science does have tremendous aesthetic and ethical impact sort of inherent in it.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.400
And I'll take you to a little bit of research now from observing scientists that work in

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
the lab.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.520
And then maybe you've seen something like this yourselves.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.280
So this goes to study in Arizona State University.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:22.640
They're putting non-scientists in with scientists to observe them and to learn what science

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.120
in practice actually is.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.800
They spend 12 weeks with them.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:35.800
And so one of the first pilot studies of that the observer who was a social scientist

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:45.440
was asking the scientist how do you decide whether to do A or B. And for a good while

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:50.960
the scientist in question is the bench scientist chemistry nanotechnology.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.320
I'm not making decisions.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.200
I'm just carrying out the experiment.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.560
And it took a while for the scientists to admit, well, I guess I did decide to do this

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560
instead of that.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.400
So there was a little bit, well, why did you do this instead of that?

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.680
So there was a gradual penetration of self-consciousness stimulated by the other, but

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.120
actually all going on internally in the mind of the scientist.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.520
That particular story just to wind it up they had some problems with a particular material

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.360
they were using, some iron compound.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.080
They couldn't get it in time.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:31.160
It was the first time that this particular researcher had to sort of think about alternatives.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:37.880
And he was prepared to do that rapidly because he had been questioning everything that normally

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.480
does not get questioned.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.600
And so going to an alternative, iron compound turned out to be a great idea.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:49.800
And suddenly you had a much more efficient, cleaner product coming out of this particular

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.400
line of nanochemistry.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:59.640
Now not to say that that caused it, but the point is that the normal operating procedure

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:06.520
is not to ask questions that are self-reflexive, that would create a self-reflexive process

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.960
within science, kind of interferes because you have a procedure you carried out.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:16.520
And doing too much of that seems to be sort of enhancing the subjective dimension which

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.920
we spent hundreds of years getting rid of in order to have a good scientific revolution.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.240
So how is it that is coming back and what form can it come back that it now does not

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.600
interfere but enhances it?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:34.840
That's related to this question of synchronicity but from a way out here and not near earth

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.480
orbit at this point.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.840
So that's your orbit.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.480
I think that's...

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:46.800
This is precisely one of the explosive aspects of talking about synchronicity and these meaning

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.760
related issues within the sciences.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:56.480
I think this is explosive because the sociology of science tells us this scientist themselves

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.360
is exactly as you say.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.280
They avoid this topic.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.440
But at some point this needs to be brought in I think.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.200
Another interesting issue which you may have read in the papers, some of you may read Nature,

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:16.040
some of you may read the Wall Street Journal, the issue of reproducibility, which is in

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.320
the basic sciences.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:23.520
It's clear if something cannot be reproduced independently in another lab at another time

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.240
by other people and so on, this is not considered a scientific result.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:34.200
Now we know when we go from physics to chemistry to other sciences to psychology for instance,

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:40.560
also to sociology and in between biomedical science is very important, right?

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.280
Where we have many problems with reproducing for instance results of preclinical studies

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.920
and not simply because the research is bad.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.360
There are systematic reasons.

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.200
There are reasons in principle.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.960
This tells us something too.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:00.000
This tells us that there is a whole spectrum I would say when you start from the basic

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.160
sciences going, let's say upward or downward, I don't know, to the social sciences, then

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:13.720
the criteria which are the cornerstones for science, the methodology changes somehow.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.840
I mean, for instance, in social sciences often what you never want to reproduce a single

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:26.000
number in an experiment, you want to reproduce pattern identification, something like that,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000
which is completely different, very qualitative and yet it's science, right?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.560
So now where is the border where we go from the reproducibility of numbers, for instance

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.840
to the reproducibility of patterns?

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:47.840
Where is it precisely?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:55.840
We don't know.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:09.220
The guy just named Reed

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.220
the instantiation of the mind, the body mind.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.660
Yeah.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.580
I would like you to say if you could go further into that.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.660
That was maybe a little bit bigger.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.260
Yeah, that'd be great.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.700
Yeah, I think so.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:26.580
That has to do with, so why is the question,

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.220
if I may repeat it very quickly,

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.860
the question is why is synchronicity,

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:34.820
or why do I think that synchronicity is a kind of paradigm

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.540
example for the mind-body problem,

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.220
and how can we approach it?

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:44.980
I think two important topics have already been mentioned,

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:47.380
which are related to this question.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.180
One of the topics is quantum holism.

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.180
You talked about this a lot.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:56.500
The holism, the completely different holism

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.860
that we know in quantum mechanics

01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.580
as compared to holistic features like

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:01.860
in system theory and so on.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:06.060
I will lose some more words about this in a minute.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.340
And the other one is that,

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.260
I think that's also why Pauli became so interested in it.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.940
Meaning is not an issue that you can't ascribe to a state.

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:17.780
Meaning is an intrinsically relational issue.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.700
The meaning is always something, consider a sign.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.900
A sign is not the thing that has the meaning.

01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.860
The sign indicates something, it refers to something

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:33.060
out there, and this reference relation,

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.060
that's why I'm saying it's a relational.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:37.340
The reference relation of the sign,

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.820
that's where the meaning is.

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.300
So you cannot locate it here or there.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.820
And Pauli immediately saw this,

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.220
that meaning might be an interesting concept

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.780
to relate the mental, as the state

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.820
that, for instance, the mental representation.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.260
If it means something, then it refers to something

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:58.780
out there in the material world.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.860
So the meaning, you think of an apple, or whatever it is.

01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.420
Now then, what you refer to with this representation

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:08.100
is what you represent, namely the apple.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:12.420
So that relation is, as I said,

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.420
it's an intrinsically relational notion.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:18.780
It's also, in some sense, it has this appeal to holism,

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.100
because it connects two different things.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.700
And so that's, I think, that is important with respect

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.820
to the notion of meaning, that we cannot localize it,

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.380
neither in the mental state of the subject,

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.500
nor in the stone, or in the apple,

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.460
or in the rock, which is outside there.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:41.540
Now, how does that bend back to this quantum holism?

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:45.020
Now this is Pauli's other idea, because Pauli was,

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.220
I mean, if anybody at that time,

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.940
Pauli knew what quantum holism was about, namely.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.020
To put it really radically, I mean,

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.940
we can discuss this, of course.

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.300
Systems in out there in nature, quantum systems,

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:03.380
do not present themselves as collections of parts.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.820
They present themselves as holes to begin with,

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.620
and parts have to be created by interactions

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.500
with the system, for instance, by measurement,

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.540
for instance, something like that.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.620
So the part, and then what happens is,

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.060
when you sort of destroy the wholeness,

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.300
by making an interaction with the system,

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:25.620
you generate the parts, but not only you generate the parts,

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.340
you also generate correlations between the parts.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:31.540
And these are the remnants of the lost holness,

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:32.380
so to speak.

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.900
Now, in this idea together with this

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.980
intrinsically relational aspect of meaning,

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:44.340
was for Pauli something that he saw,

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.100
and the idea is the following.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:49.940
He said, we have a, and this is the aspect of cosmology,

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.260
which Joe brought up half an hour ago.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.460
Cosmology that is behind this picture is we have a kind of

01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.380
psychophysically neutral domain of reality,

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.420
a basic reality, like in Spinoza.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.900
A basic reality that doesn't know the matter

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.980
distinction at all.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.780
And now, if this is considered in the analog

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.380
to quantum holism, if this is the hole,

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.580
you can separate it, you can make a distinction,

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.620
for instance, for the purpose of gaining knowledge

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.700
to be able to talk about things,

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.380
for the purpose of analysis,

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:29.300
and then you distinguish the psychic and the physical.

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.980
Once you do that, I mean,

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:35.500
staying in the analogy to quantum mechanics,

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.220
once you do that, you're not only making the distinction

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.540
between the two things, you also generate correlations.

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:46.060
So this analogy was what drove Pauli to believe

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.260
in this picture.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.980
Of course, it's a conjecture, I mean this book, you know?

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.460
We called it the Pauli Jung conjecture,

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:55.860
because a conjecture is a hypothesis

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.260
which is unproven, but maybe plausible.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.780
Okay?

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.460
That's why we called it that way.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.300
So we have this idea of a psychophysically neutral

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.100
background reality which needs to be explored.

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.660
We don't know much about it.

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:16.220
I mean, for Jung, the archetypes and this kind of material

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:18.140
would be there somehow.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.980
And then we make the distinction,

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.140
we generate, so to speak, the parts,

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.740
the mental and the material sub-domains.

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.580
And by making the distinction,

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.620
we also generate correlations.

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.020
In physics, we know how these correlations are,

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.180
can be studied, these are the EPR correlations,

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.860
you don't want to know this.

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:41.860
But the analog, the analog of these correlations,

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.260
now in a much broader picture, of course,

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.180
because now we are transcending physics,

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:50.100
are meaningful coincidences.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.980
So that meaning is in some sense already implicit

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:57.580
in the undistinguished domain, but of course not explicated.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:02.380
And it unfolds by making the distinction,

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.620
and then you see it in the correlation,

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:06.460
as a relational notion.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.300
I think that's basically the picture.

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:11.380
And of course, I need to add,

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:14.740
this is just a sketch.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.260
And it's an hypothesis.

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.940
But I think it's really worthwhile to study this

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:23.420
in more detail, and there are many aspects I can tell you.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.340
I mentioned how, you know,

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.100
it's interesting how can research be done on this?

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.820
And what would be the practical implications?

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:35.140
So this is something we may still talk about,

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.300
but I just wanted, I think this picture is already

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.820
the core of the whole thing.

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.820
May I ask if people would prefer to have the air conditioning on again?

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:47.820
All right, so...

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:48.820
Quite.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.820
I kept hearing the word physical and psychophysical.

01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.820
It reminded me I'm hot.

01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:02.820
So, break.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.820
Yes, absolutely.

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:10.820
So, Joe?

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.820
I just wanted to come back to your question about more clinical information,

01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:18.820
because I didn't try here to unpack that.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.820
But let me say a little bit more.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.820
I have to start with the value of the conjecture

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.820
that Harold's just put across.

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:32.820
It opened my eyes to something I couldn't see before I had this articulation.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.820
That is the clinical observations we're making are epistemic,

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.820
and this is an ontological question.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.820
And that's part of where we get...

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.820
I find myself confused at times with Jung's hypothesis,

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.820
because he doesn't make that distinction.

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.820
And so, if you don't know that ahead of time,

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.820
then you think the clinical observations are the explanation,

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.820
and that falls short.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.820
That's part of the problem.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:00.820
But one of the questions I had in starting this is also to add,

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.820
or about the way contemporary science would think about

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.820
different qualities of time.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.820
Because I think when you look into this systemic approach,

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:11.820
one of the things you start to talk about,

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.820
Dan Stern, for example,

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.820
and the Boston Process of Change Study Group started to talk about

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:20.820
chyros, particular moments, that had a kind of analytic density to them.

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.820
And in those dense moments,

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.820
that's when these kinds of transformative,

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:28.820
phase transitions sort of experiences come about.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.820
So, to go back to the Black Forest case,

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.820
and try to make it a little bit more understandable

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.820
in terms of clinical relevance,

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:40.820
in this situation, this was somebody who was highly traumatized,

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.820
who every time I went on any kind of travel,

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.820
I needed to hospitalize.

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.820
And in fact, we came to a complex agreement

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.820
that I would make a call when I was away,

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.820
and took a lot of supervision before I'd break that boundary to do that.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:01.820
But nevertheless, this is where the Black Forest business came out.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:07.820
And what happened is, in the phone interaction with her,

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:09.820
it was quite stabilizing.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.820
I used a lot of reality testing and settled her down.

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:18.820
It was only the next day when I had the rather uncanny experience of this,

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:21.820
you know, dive into the Black Forest,

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.820
and how I processed that experience that I emerged from that

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.820
with a kind of new understanding.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.820
If you look, for example, at the people who study

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:35.820
self-organizing systems that create emergent, you know, phenomena

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.820
that are more than the sum of the parts of these global things,

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:46.820
one of the observations is that those things are best looked for

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:49.820
at the edge of order and chaos.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:51.820
Now, that's a very interesting notion.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:55.820
If you say that emergent forms are most likely to occur,

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.820
if it's too organized, if it's too dense, too concentrated,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.820
then things, in terms of forming life, everything polymerizes.

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:08.820
If it's too dilute and too chaotic, then nothing forms for long enough.

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.820
And so it's only at that particular emergent edge that you get these kind of phenomena.

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:16.820
Well, what happened in that case is that I provided a kind of reality testing

01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:21.820
for my patient that was rather, you know, sort of order inducing for her.

01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:25.820
What I hadn't seen was the chaos induction in myself.

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:30.820
And so that I had to adapt my analytic stance with regard to this patient

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.820
in terms of the way the field itself was embracing the two of us.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.820
And that allowed me, once I could do that, is to truly see the black forest

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:45.820
as the image we were both in, rather than her dream image or my dive experience.

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:50.820
It was a larger holistic emergent form that was operative

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.820
in the clinical practice.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:55.820
And so then I could begin to keep my counter-transference eye

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.820
on those kinds of forms as they were emerging.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.820
In the shorthand of what Beverly was saying about some of these things,

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:05.820
one might note in one's counter-transference reveries, let's say.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:10.820
But one accumulates those in such a way that they begin to provide a reading of the field.

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.820
And I think they do then give supervision to the clinician back.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.820
That would be my argument.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.820
You wanted to ask Edgar something?

01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:25.820
Well, I was asking about the whole question of the different qualities of time

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.820
and how that might be thought about in contemporary science.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:36.820
Well, first I should say that by nature, I admit the way academic science is practiced

01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.820
is inherently conservative.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.820
And I think this is what Frasad was criticizing in some ways.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:52.820
So associating anthropological attributes or epithets to quality,

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:57.820
to a quantity is one of the, there's a knee-jerk reaction against them.

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:00.820
However, that doesn't mean that in the practice of science,

01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.820
people can be extremely creative and can break boundaries.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:09.820
But at the end of the day, a theory or an experiment is just very conservatively.

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.820
Now, I thought, well, I'm learning to just summarize to the honest,

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.820
at least what I'm learning from this.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:21.820
First, I started with a knee-jerk classical science critique of simplicity.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:28.820
And you responded, Frasad, for example, gave a very nice eloquent critique of science practice

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:36.820
that lacks an element that he claimed very nicely that could enrich and enhance the practice of science.

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:46.820
And Harald also added, first he explained that there's a spectrum of how science is practiced.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:53.820
And meaning, and the use of meaning in correlation, can be different from going from left to right.

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.820
It's a spectrum, it's not either or.

01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:59.820
And I really think that's a wonderful thing I just learned tonight.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.820
But I have a question, actually mostly to Harald,

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:11.820
given the fact that, originally, the concept of simplicity and quantum mechanics

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:20.820
were to use a term entangled at birth because Paoli and Jung worked it out together,

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.820
actually Jung did not contribute to quantum mechanics, of course,

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.820
but Paoli, I think, did contribute to Jung's ideas, and he felt that there was an entanglement.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:37.820
After 62 years, there is a feeling, at least, that people who do not work on minor problems,

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:51.820
that still know concrete scientific or explanation of physical phenomena

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.820
that can be unambiguously attributed to simplicity.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.820
Is that the case, still the case, if so, why, and if that is the case,

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:05.820
can you give us an example of how you think a direct contribution to understanding physical phenomena

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.820
from that principle has come through?

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:11.820
We need to respond to this right now.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.820
Yes.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:13.820
Yeah, I know.

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:14.820
We'll start with questions.

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.820
Yeah, I think we should open it also to the public, I guess.

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:24.820
So there are several levels of answer to this question.

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:25.820
I mean, for Paoli?

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.820
Yes, we're going to do it.

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:27.820
Himself.

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:33.820
I think a large part of his own interest in this question was due to his own experiences,

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:38.820
which you mentioned, the Paoli effect, because what does this tell us?

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:43.820
I mean, you become sensitive to these ideas, not just because someone else tells you this might be interesting

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:50.820
or study it, go into the lab, and so on, but I think the easiest way to really get involved with these issues

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.820
is own experiences.

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:58.820
That's level one, which is maybe almost trivial, but not quite.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:06.820
Then, of course, there have been quite a number of research labs which tried, really, in the lab,

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:14.820
to set up paradigms or scenarios in which human subjects, with their mental intentions,

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:18.820
can change what's going on out there in nature.

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.820
I mean, for instance, of course, a radical example would be levitation.

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:30.820
If I want you to lift off, right, and want it strong enough, at some point it should work, right?

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:37.820
Unfortunately, in the lab, it didn't work so far.

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:43.820
I mean, 700 years ago, there were these anecdotal evidences about Joseph of Copartino,

01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:53.820
I don't know how trustworthy these sources are, but I mean, there are so many, it's almost just Joseph of Copartino.

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:59.820
He was shooting up, you know, not only like this, and then he was staying there,

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.820
and at some point he can't.

01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:07.820
Anyway, so this is about violating a law of nature which we call the law of gravity, right?

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:12.820
So this is a deterministic law, and then people realize in the lab we can't do it.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:20.820
So, maybe a good alternative is not really violating deterministic law, but violating statistical laws.

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:25.820
And since you're, for Princeton, we know that in Princeton there was such a group, a group of Bob John,

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:26.820
and they, what they tried is...

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:31.820
By the way, my own advisor, even though he advised me in physics, but he was pericycology.

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.820
What did you mention? I didn't want to mention it.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.820
He was my own advisor, right? And I'm very proud of that.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:36.820
No.

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:37.820
It's an wonderful physicist.

01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:39.820
Yes, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:46.820
And so what did they do? They did, they also had these human subjects with mental intentions,

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:52.820
but it was not, the purpose was not violating deterministic laws of nature, like gravitational.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:58.820
The purpose was violating statistical laws, like when you have radioactive decay,

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:05.820
you have no idea whatsoever what the individual particle does, but you know the statistical distribution of the lifetimes, right?

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.820
That's what physics tells you.

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:18.820
Now, of course, when you do the experiment often enough and long enough, then the hope was that you could change the average lifetime of, for instance,

01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:25.820
radioactivity decaying particles. They didn't do it with radioactive decay, but other groups did it with radioactive decay.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:34.820
And this is interesting now because there were many reports, which were, first of all, in the first instantiation,

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.820
when the paper was published, they published an effect.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:48.820
Sometimes, sometimes immensely small, but statistically, if you do enough bits, then at some point you get statistical significance.

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:53.820
Now, that was the first publication. The second publication, people tried to replicate this.

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:58.820
Zero effect. Third publication, small effect, and so on and so on.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:04.820
So then some people came up with the idea, we do a meta-analysis of all these analyses,

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:11.820
published in a prestigious journal, Foundation of Physics in 1989 or something like that.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:18.820
This meta-analysis showed that there was an effect averaged over all the studies that were published,

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:25.820
but then additional points of criticism come up like publication bias, because all the studies that have no effect have not been published,

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.820
so they could not go into the meta-analysis and on and on and on.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:39.820
So, you see, because if you have a decent journal and have no effect, I mean, what should they do?

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:48.820
They don't publish it simply. But nevertheless, in a reasonable meta-analysis, all the materials should be included.

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:57.820
So, this, I think, this is only one example. There are many more examples like remote viewing and others.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:10.820
I think so far up to now, in the lab, this kind of mental influence on physical processes has not been convincingly demonstrated.

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:16.820
And with that, we're going to open for the audience. Thank you, Carol.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:21.820
So, anyone who would like to ask a question, please do so here at the mic.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:27.820
Please, follow us who you are and limit it to one question.

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:30.820
Through my bed.

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:36.820
This is something that you help with this. Thank you. Thank you.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:43.820
Okay. So, I'm trying to put forth a proposition I'd like you to respond to, specifically this gentleman,

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:57.820
Anne Harald, that attempts to correlate two things you spoke of. In terms of field theory, it has to do with the weak electromagnetic field generated by neocortical activity.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:11.820
And the other has to do with holism. And is it valid to say that within that sketch, that entanglement can be viewed as a hypercorrelative state?

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:24.820
Okay. So, my question is, would it be an explanation for the individual person A, thinking of person B, going around the corner there as person B?

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:37.820
So, if they had known each other before, and the weak link here is that entanglement is subject to subtle entanglement death from noise.

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:50.820
But if they knew each other from before, then the interaction of the two electromagnetic neocortical electromagnetic fields could reactivate the neural activation pattern,

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:54.820
which is how memories are stored of person B and person A's mind.

01:28:54.820 --> 01:29:00.820
And so, it would not be, in fact, surprising that that person was around the corner when he turned that corner, but actually expected.

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:10.820
And the experience of surprise would be because all of that kind of activity, as FRMR studies show, in well-constructed experiments,

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:23.820
that the scientists conducting the experiment can determine what decision and decision experiment will be made by the activity in the limbic system prior to conscious choice,

01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:27.820
as if conscious choice is an after story.

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:37.820
So, I'm suggesting that this kind of meaning and surprise is an after story caused by the interaction of these neocortical fields,

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.820
where there is a hyper-correlative state between the two individuals in this particular example.

01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:46.820
And I'd like to respond to both of you for that, if you don't mind.

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:52.820
Okay. So, experiments, am I, yes.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:57.820
Again, there are some experiments which have been made along similar lines, not precisely the same.

01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.820
Yeah, the flashing light in one hand.

01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:00.820
Yes, exactly.

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:09.820
And then, exactly. So, and what happened is, you had the subjects were selected like one subset of the subject,

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:18.820
whereas people who were in some sense bonding to each other, exactly, to make sure that they know enough about themselves and so on and so on.

01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:23.820
And then there was a control group, right, with randomly selected subjects here and there.

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:31.820
And the same happened as before, sometimes there are results, then people try to replicate, nothing and so on.

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:36.820
Again, I mean, I'm not saying that this is completely hopeless.

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:43.820
Maybe we have to think about this issue of reproducibility in novel ways, right? This may be possible.

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:50.820
Now, the other aspect, I think, is much, is even more interesting than you mentioned, because what you say is,

01:30:50.820 --> 01:31:01.820
we are not necessarily talking about conscious state, which generates these kinds of correlations, but unconscious states.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.820
And this is...

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.820
Pre-conscious.

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:08.820
Pre-conscious, oh, yeah, I mean, but not conscious yet, right?

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:16.820
So, and I think this is the basic idea in this kind of proposal is very much in line with Jungian thought, I think,

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:22.820
because for Jung, as I tried to indicate before, you know, the common...

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:30.820
Let me call it the common cause, the holistic picture behind the correlations is, of course, in the unconscious.

01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:38.820
I mean, from Jung's point of view, you come to the psychophysically neutral reality through the unconscious, from Pauli's point of view,

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:43.820
you come to the psychophysically neutral reality through quantum holism.

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:52.820
But at the end, if the picture has something to it, at the end, the distinction between the mental and the material that solves.

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:58.820
But it has to do with going deeper into the pre or unconscious, whatever.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.820
Well, this is, I think...

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:01.820
Thank you.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:02.820
This is very interesting.

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:07.820
As JJ Gibson said, he showed his psychology as not what is inside the head, but what the head is inside of.

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:08.820
Inside, yeah.

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.820
Collogical psychology, right, yeah.

01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:18.820
I'm hoping everyone can hear the speakers, and you're all still able to hear the speakers, so speak into the... into your mics.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.820
Just very briefly about the electrical...

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:29.820
...electro-magnetic fields and so forth. I don't think we've got a whole understanding or description of the field yet.

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.820
I think that's a contribution.

01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:40.820
Just think about what's come out in the last couple of years on the human microbiome, that you've got 90% of the cells in you on you are non-human.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.820
That you've got 23,000 genes, human genes.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:47.820
If you take the whole of you, you've got 8 million genes on you.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.820
So what are the communicative systems?

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:55.820
There's all kinds of new experiments showing that there's changes in behavior as those microbiomes change.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:33:05.820
Yeah, and so what... I would think these are also other very low-level aspects of this field, this psychological field that's generated.

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:06.820
That's...

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.820
Sure.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:08.820
Good question.

01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:17.820
Our audience, just to keep the questions brief, because we have many people waiting, and we can always take up things after the program is open.

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:22.820
I'm Fritz Kessel, psychoanalysts, psychiatrist.

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:30.820
The issue, I'm very glad the unconscious was finally mentioned. It was not mentioned in the entire, I think, in the entire presentation.

01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:37.820
The unconscious, that the unconscious was... that this phenomenon is probably very, very much related to the unconscious.

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:56.820
And that the issue is, do you think that there's an archaic kind of phenomenological unconscious that is not psychodynamically meaningful that we would not very much use clinically because it doesn't have any psychodynamic meaning?

01:33:56.820 --> 01:34:16.820
Versus slips of the tongue specific things that happen in dreams and so on that we do think are psychodynamic meaningful. And if we're very much over into that more archaic camp or just unconscious things kind of popping up that have no particular psychodynamic meaning,

01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:34.820
is that pathological? Are we starting to get involved in a hyperattachment to the patient? Are we so attached as when psychoanalysts presented it that her periods coincided with the patient's periods?

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:48.820
Are we so unconsciously overattached that we are making these, concocting these kind of synchronicities that may be more symptomatic of...

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:52.820
We're just too attached to the patients.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:55.820
Sure. I think this is again a question about...

01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:56.820
Could you speak louder?

01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:02.820
This is again a question about the attribution of meaning, I think, and the role of counter-transference that Edgar was raising in there.

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:13.820
Yeah, I think that's always a bias. I think though, if you'd let me expand it just slightly, is there a repressed unconscious that's wholly divorced from more primitive layers?

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:21.820
I suspect that these bleed into one or another, that we're looking at spectrum phenomena and it's very difficult to have a complete cut off.

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:32.820
I mean, I know Freud's arguments about... Because his interest in telepathy and his insect examples where he felt that there are chaotic modes of communication.

01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:44.820
The problem is that what happens when some of these archaic modes get operating in the therapy that may be because of traumatic situations that are extra therapy.

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:52.820
They're not about necessarily therapeutic attachment, but actually the preconditions that the person's bringing in.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:36:01.820
Then I would say that those become therapeutically relevant. It's an associative model rather than just a repressed model, and that's the kind of patience I was talking about.

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:16.820
I'm joining Erin Berg. Several thoughts, but I think the issue of unconscious communication has not really been brought up in a way that it seems to me is very important.

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:32.820
I think starting with forensic paper, 1933, confusion of tongues, I think the issue of whose experience are you experiencing and to what extent we carry the feelings of the other without even knowing it at the moment.

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:51.820
It seems to me that in my own work with patients, there are times in some of my writing, what I've focused on is the counter-transferances often are most important tool for understanding what's going on with the patient and vice versa.

01:36:51.820 --> 01:37:07.820
I think the whole idea of negative therapeutic reaction, I think at this point we understand that often it's more the impact of the analyst that's provoking that rather than it has to do with the patient.

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:26.820
I'm also thinking about the case you mentioned, and it seems to me my experience, and I think in that kind of case where you have to hospitalize the patient when you're away, there is something about the connection that is absolutely vital.

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:39.820
There are certain patients who my experience is if I leave them a number when I'm away and there's an emergency they will call me and they will survive. If I gave them someone else's name, they would fall apart.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:49.820
Now this is the same stuff that goes on between mothers and children, that if the mother is present in one minute you can calm the baby.

01:37:49.820 --> 01:38:03.820
A babysitter, it might go, maybe it might be hysterical for hours. So it seems to me the personal connection is somehow very important and I just feel maybe it should be more included in this.

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:21.820
I would appreciate if you ask questions or if they make comments, you can always make your comments later, but feel like you can focus on asking your question.

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:35.820
I'm not really sure if you're interested in any training. And here is two sentences to lead to my question.

01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:57.820
The question is, what does the question mean to the children in this state a moment in a connection between the two? It seems a little kind of information that is connecting or circulating in ways that none of the explanation that we have in science can explain, right?

01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:07.820
Then there was this interesting point about how science manages things. A very important thing in science is to be able to predict, right?

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:18.820
Your hypothesis is solid if you can predict the system. And of course with synchronicity you have a problem, which is that it's unpredictable.

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:35.820
So I was wondering, would you guys be considering that maybe what we call synchronicity is just the unpredictable part of a phenomenon that might be much more general, but we can't see?

01:39:35.820 --> 01:40:00.820
And I have two examples that I think you could tell me if it's relevant or not. Two things. I was always kind of interested in all those experiments that show that cognition can go occur sometimes much faster than any neuronal connection can go.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:09.820
You just flash people with the minimum information and they catch it way before the whole thing, you know, the whole physiology should be able to say it. That's one thing.

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:28.820
The other thing is, and another thing that really fascinates me is the way group of organisms can work together in ways that I think are difficult to explain with usual neural patterns.

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:39.820
I think of birds and fish and I'm done. Which is that? So do you guys see something interesting there or not?

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:42.820
Well, Harold had it, I think.

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:46.820
I think the first reaction is like a tennis player, right?

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:50.820
Oh, it's just not on you.

01:40:50.820 --> 01:41:09.820
The typical example that is often discussed is a tennis player who receives the ball from the other one within, I don't know, as you say, it's a timescale which is far too fast, far too short, I should say, to plan a controlled reaction and then put the racket in this way.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:20.820
So that's typically explained by anticipation.

01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:36.820
Anticipation, the experience tennis player anticipates by the movement of his opponent what he will do where the ball will go and before even the opponent plays the ball, he already arranges his action planning and so on to hit the ball to where it might come.

01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:45.820
I would like to say this is a perfect example of using causality to illustrate something that could have been interpreted by somebody else as coincidence of meanings.

01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.820
There's a perfectly causal physical reality.

01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:53.820
But this is, I think, this is the conventional wisdom about the story.

01:41:53.820 --> 01:42:00.820
Now, I think the other question is, I mean, for the work that I'm doing is even more interesting.

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:16.820
Namely, the question whether we might have a spectrum from very, very unusual and very, very in quotation marks, meaningful synchronicities down to something which we observe like an everyday basis.

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:32.820
And I think one of the predictions that the Paul Jung conjecture makes is that this should be the case.

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:46.820
And those experiences that Jung originally highlighted as numinous synchronicities experiences, they are in a sense the tip of the iceberg. So what are the normal correlations?

01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:54.820
One, my favorite candidate for those are correlations between brain states and mind states within a person.

01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:02.820
These correlations are completely ununderstood, not understood at all. Everybody knows they are there. But we feel that we are in a conscious state.

01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:06.820
Of course, everybody assumes, yeah, the brain must do something.

01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:16.820
But what, I mean, neural correlates of consciousness don't tell us anything. It's just the measurement of a correlation, but it's nothing about the origin of the correlation.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:26.820
You see? So these are totally, you can look at the whole area of psychosomatic, which is a similar example.

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:37.820
And I think these whole, the framework of thinking that Paul Jung posed, right, gives us an idea to understand this whole spectrum.

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:48.820
I cannot move my right arm. This whole spectrum between a total over emphasis of meaning, right? Yes, thank you. Thank you.

01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:56.820
These would be the coincidence phenomena. And then you go to the baseline, you go to the ordinary experiences.

01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:04.820
And then the prediction would be that on the other side, where you don't have coincidences, you have dissociations.

01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:13.820
And this is another kind of exceptional experience, which we know that happened, a paradigmatic example out of body experiences, right?

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:21.820
Out of body experiences, the mindness of my body is no longer, does no, it's somehow interrupted.

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:28.820
So I see my body as if from an outside perspective, and that's precisely the opposite of coincidence.

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:36.820
So this is all part of the picture. And so now we're talking about pattern reproducibility.

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:40.820
And this kind of stuff has been reproduced already in the last years.

01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.820
So there's a lot, I'm only saying that very shortly because we don't have a lot of time.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:54.820
But there's a lot of interesting research going on, but not in terms of reproducing individual effects, but reproducing now patterns,

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:59.820
patterns of behavior, patterns of experiences, something like this. Thank you for that question.

01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:00.820
It's a great opportunity.

01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:08.820
But if we could get a power law relationship of those spectrum phenomena, then we could begin to point to an underlying unifying phenomena,

01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:15.820
even though we can't describe what it is. In other words, if there's a spectrum and we do an intensity, frequency, log log plot,

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:21.820
and we get a straight line, then it indicates that we've got the same fundamental phenomena going on,

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:25.820
that would be interesting to think of how to do that experiment.

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:35.820
My question actually is exactly about patterns. I'm a young analyst, and I would like to just say that most of my experiences

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:39.820
of synchronicity that I use clinically are not with particularly traumatized patients.

01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:45.820
I wouldn't want us to think that that's a prerequisite for some kind of synchronicistic event.

01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:50.820
Mostly the things happen to my patients outside and they come in and they want to talk about how did that happen.

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.820
What does that mean?

01:45:53.820 --> 01:46:01.820
I'd like you to talk. I'd like all of you to throw this out to talk about the correlation between pattern,

01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:07.820
because usually it feels big because it's replicating something. It's amplifying something.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:17.820
Meaning, pattern meaning and hope, because there's always a upswing, a charge when something synchronicity happens,

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:23.820
where the patients come in feeling like there's a moment of hope that this could mean something.

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:33.820
This could mean something. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about the correlation between pattern making, meaning and hope.

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:37.820
Thank you.

01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:43.820
I'll take a shot at that from way out again.

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:53.820
The pattern making, I think the primordial synchronicity, this is what I think you were saying, Harold,

01:46:53.820 --> 01:47:00.820
is that our minds and bodies go together, that brain state, and that's constant nonstop.

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:02.820
I'm thinking about reproducibility.

01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:12.820
Then when you come to pattern making, because we're talking about coincidences, two things happening that ordinarily may mean nothing at all,

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:18.820
could just be a correlation, which is useless from a scientific point of view, or it could have meaning.

01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:25.820
This depends on the person. A lot of that is essentially the work of metaphor.

01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:33.820
A metaphor that works is not always universal, but it'll work very tightly for some situation or other.

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:46.820
What occurs to me regarding the hope thing is that in the writings of mystic, Sufi mystics, this is 11th, 12th century,

01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:56.820
basically the technique, they talk about the imaginal world between the pure invisible stuff and the pure material stuff.

01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:03.820
That's where the work goes on, not in the so-called archetypal realm, maybe or the material realm, but in between.

01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:08.820
And in that in between, there's a lot of image formation going on.

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.820
How does that correspond to what we're talking about? That's what metaphor is.

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:14.820
You're throwing two things together and looking between them.

01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:20.820
And finally, the way they did this was very much like Jungian active imagination.

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:26.820
A hypnagogic state, they would explicitly put themselves in there, and then they would just go forward,

01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:32.820
and they would take the prophecies of the boron in the case of the Sufis.

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:38.820
And this is woodwork elsewhere too, of course, is to take those things and take them forward.

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:45.820
So, as Ebeneh Araby said, this is the land of prophecy, where prophecies are true, is only in this realm of the imaginal.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:47.820
That's where it's true, and that's where the hope is.

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:52.820
So, look forward, Michael Scott, we in a lab for, you know, in one case, you're looking in the wrong place,

01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:57.820
because you're trying to universalize something that's individual.

01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:03.820
Yeah, Kay, I'll read it.

01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:04.820
Hello.

01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:06.820
Oh, anxious.

01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:15.820
What I have to do to say has to do with somehow the words I have a co-creative, inter-subjective fields,

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:23.820
more archaic, archaic but not meaning, and very much counter-transference.

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:26.820
I'm a music psychotherapist.

01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:29.820
I have a lot of Jungian background training.

01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:38.820
So, our whole field in the creative arts is co-creative, everything we do, and it's not like you're over there,

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.820
and I'm sitting this close to the client.

01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:46.820
I was talking about this with my supervisor, who didn't really get it.

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:48.820
You know, you're not way over there and protected.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:54.820
You're right here with me, and we do, we write music together, we sing together,

01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:58.820
and there's something I do called pre-associative singing, right?

01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:02.820
So, we're just free associating, but we're doing it through music.

01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.820
I'm playing, they sing, and I sing.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:11.820
Now, what happened recently, and just throwing this out to get your opinion,

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.820
because it kind of freaked me out, was I'm singing with this woman.

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:21.820
She is dissociative, and it's happened now about five times, and we've discussed it,

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.820
is basically the technique.

01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:27.820
She'll sing a word, and I'll repeat it.

01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:29.820
She'll sing, and I'll add to it.

01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:32.820
She'll sing another word, but I'm right there with her.

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:37.820
Somehow, in this process, her dissociation, which you all know happens,

01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:40.820
got to me, and I started to, like, go under.

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:46.820
But what happened is when I went under, it's like I went into a trance,

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:53.820
and I was having my own dream, and all of a sudden, I sang my brother's holding a sign

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:57.820
that says, I'm a teddy bear, and she said, what?

01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.820
And I, like, snapped out of it.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:04.820
And because this has happened before, she said, what happened?

01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:10.820
I said, I don't know, and I don't know if that was part of related to you,

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:16.820
or that was related to me, or that was co-created and related to both of us,

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.820
and I'm wondering what you think.

01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:22.820
It's happened, like, four times, and I have four or five, so.

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:26.820
Well, I think that relates to a lot of what Darlene was saying,

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:31.820
that this kind of, where the question of ownership and individual psyche

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:38.820
is itself a model that's too limited to completely describe these kind of phenomena.

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:43.820
You're looking at genuinely co-construct, and it has something I think to do

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:45.820
with the porosity of the mind.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.820
In those kind of relationships, the deeper you enter into an affective,

01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:54.820
empathic relationship, there's a kind of porosity, and one has to be careful about that as well.

01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:59.820
It's both wonderful in terms of the connection, but if you think of complexity,

01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:03.820
one of the things in terms of creating complexity is you have to break symmetry,

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:04.820
you have to lower symmetry.

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:09.820
Therefore, when you're in a very tight empathic relationship, it's highly symmetric.

01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:13.820
And to create more psychic structure, there has to be a rupture.

01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:15.820
In fact, I think your patient did that.

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:19.820
She disrupted you, and something more complex could come of that.

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:24.820
My name is Valerie, I'm a writer.

01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.820
Every experience of synchronicity that I've had has been helpful.

01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:32.820
It's felt like a great gift encouraging and supporting my growth.

01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:38.820
So assuming that at some point, synchronicity will be proved as scientifically happening,

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:44.820
whatever that means, just taking the next step from this, what could it be for?

01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:50.820
I mean, is it possible that there is some substance, some force that could only be serving,

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:57.820
healing, and growth, because synchronicity never seems to happen as...

01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:02.820
Yeah, that's an extremely good question, and it's something I should have said right up front.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:08.820
That in the way Jung uses the word synchronicity, it is only a synchronicity

01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:14.820
and the person who is observing it and making the connections,

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:21.820
internalizes it in such a way that it leads to some expansion and deepening of consciousness.

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:27.820
Until it gets to that point, it's a synchronous event, but not synchronicity.

01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:33.820
And I should have said that, and thank you so much for forcing me to say it right now, reminding me.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:34.820
Thank you.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.820
I just have time for two more questions.

01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:39.820
Hi, my name is Dan.

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:43.820
I'm a student in cognitive science.

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:52.820
So I'm aware of at least one mathematical equation, the HKB equation for people that aren't familiar,

01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.820
Hans Kelsobun's equation that attempts to model coordination.

01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:02.820
And so I was wondering whether the esteemed speakers were aware of this equation,

01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:10.820
whether they could say something and whether or not synchronicity is conceptually distinct from coordination.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:13.820
Did I say coordination and synchronicity or distinct?

01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:14.820
Yeah.

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:19.820
Can you put that question on the blackboard, please?

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:20.820
What is the equation?

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:23.820
I didn't understand what the equation was.

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:31.820
HKB equation, which attempts to...

01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:32.820
I don't have to...

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:38.820
I mean, I'm aware of the equation, but I'm not an expert, so I'll try to at least explain it.

01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:46.820
The HKB equation is a mathematical equation that attempts to account for finger coordination between subjects.

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:54.820
And so the observation is that finger subjects begin out of synch with one another

01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:04.820
in certain conditions they begin to go into sync.

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:07.820
That HKB, that stands for three names.

01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:12.820
One of them is Herman Harken, the founder of the field of genetics,

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:18.820
which is the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and many other things.

01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:22.820
So Harken, then the second one is K, Scott Kelso in Florida,

01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:27.820
and the third one was a PhD student, Heinrich Bunz, B, U, and Z.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:31.820
And indeed, they were modeling with tools of non-linear dynamics,

01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:38.820
these processes in which motions, I mean, in that case, finger motions,

01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:44.820
from an asymmetric state spontaneously go into the symmetric state.

01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:48.820
It happens spontaneously, not only with finger movements, but with many other movements too.

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:55.820
In other words, you cannot maintain the asymmetric motion for an arbitrary long time.

01:55:55.820 --> 01:55:56.820
It's not possible.

01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:57.820
Why?

01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:04.820
Because the potential that describes the whole situation has a deeper minimum for this symmetric motion.

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:08.820
And then at some point, for some people it takes long, for some people not so long,

01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:11.820
they relax into the deeper minimum.

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.820
That's the stable thing.

01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:17.820
That's something like the principle of least action, you know, if you want.

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:22.820
But before we go to the next question, I'm still stuck on the last two questions,

01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820
digesting some of what I heard.

01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:29.820
And it occurred to me just right now that I just learned something very important

01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:34.820
for myself, education, which is the relationship between meaning and hope.

01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:40.820
What I heard is once you experience the synchronicity and see meaning,

01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:44.820
it opens up hope, that's what the lady who asked the question mentioned.

01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:50.820
And Beverly even went further saying that actually only when you do that feedback

01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:56.820
and see benefits, you register it and see that you're opening it up,

01:56:56.820 --> 01:57:01.820
that you are experiencing what Jung was talking about.

01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:07.820
That makes me understand synchronicity as very successful, potentially successful

01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:11.820
therapeutic mechanism based on some feedback mechanism.

01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:19.820
And therefore even less, possibly less relevant to explain physical science.

01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.820
It's like explaining religion.

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:24.820
The piety mechanism that makes you feel better.

01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:28.820
When you go to church and you very pious, we actually feel better.

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:29.820
It's like a rush.

01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:35.820
And that is a mechanism that you cannot necessarily, this has no relevance to science.

01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:40.820
The more at the end of the session, I'm realizing more and more that this is a wonderful

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.820
therapeutic mechanism that's been successful.

01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:49.820
But I'm becoming more and more skeptical as to one need to explain it scientifically.

01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:56.820
At the end of the day, what makes you feel good doesn't necessarily mean that there's a meaning there.

01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.820
But Edgar, what you're not.

01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:06.820
If I want somebody to levitate and really want to levitate, the person I can bet as a scientist would not levitate.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:11.820
But I can imagine somebody to feel good having the image of that person levitating.

01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:12.820
Okay.

01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:20.820
Oh, but Edgar, what is quite different from what you're saying is, first of all, one doesn't make a synchronicity happen.

01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:30.820
We do not use it as a therapeutic tool because there's absolutely no way that you would know what would really be surprising to a patient

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:34.820
except that it would be shocking in some way, which is not too...

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:37.820
So it's not something one does to the other.

01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:38.820
It happens to me.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:49.820
The only way that... why it's a question at all is how do we understand the fact that so many people experience

01:58:49.820 --> 01:59:00.820
untoward a causal, unexpected, multiple coincidences that come together, that somehow matches up.

01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:03.820
Something that happens on the outside to the inside.

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:10.820
It's not to say we have to explain it for what it is, but why does it so often happen?

01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:15.820
What's the point of so many people having these kinds of experiences?

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:21.820
I guess the answer that we're hearing is possibly because it does help you feel better.

01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:24.820
No, sometimes it makes you feel terrible.

01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.820
That's not always the case.

01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:30.820
You dream about somebody you absolutely cannot stand and then you get a...

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:35.820
I thought you said yourself that it's only satisfied the quite tree of simplicity

01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:38.820
when it leads to some self.

01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:39.820
No, no, no.

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:40.820
Oh, yes, no.

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:45.820
Countessness, but sometimes what you become conscious of is what you used to want to know about yourself.

01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:46.820
I see.

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:47.820
It doesn't mean it's bad.

01:59:47.820 --> 01:59:48.820
No, okay.

01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:49.820
It doesn't...

01:59:49.820 --> 01:59:50.820
Okay.

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.820
So the last question here.

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:52.820
Thank you.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:59.820
First, I just want to say it's been an amazing experience to listen to you all with your different perspectives

01:59:59.820 --> 02:00:01.820
very exciting.

02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:02.820
And...

02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:09.820
I'm Janine DePyer and I'm very interested in the topic of telepathy.

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:18.820
So I think my question really is coming from a place of wondering why did everyone come today?

02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:20.820
What is it that's motivating us?

02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:21.820
Yes.

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:28.820
And what is the motivation of each of you to pursue your various lines of inquiry and interest?

02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:36.820
Because mine as a psychoanalyst is, I suppose today, looking at it clinically, like some of you have mentioned

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:39.820
about the value of this potentially clinically.

02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:45.820
But just as some of you have said, there are times when I think, what the heck, you know, what is all this about

02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.820
and why is it even important?

02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:52.820
What draws me into it is, of course, a personal connection to it, having had experiences of it.

02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.820
But I don't know if all of you have.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.820
So I'm just interested to know what brought each of you into your field.

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:02.820
And of course, I'd love to know from everyone else why you're here.

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.820
But just with you, eminent speakers, I'd love to know that.

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:05.820
Thank you.

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:07.820
You go with time.

02:01:07.820 --> 02:01:09.820
Let me just prepare the participants.

02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:11.820
There is going to be one more question.

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:13.820
One more question, okay.

02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:21.820
I think that the electromagnetic field illusion was a great addition to the discussion.

02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:22.820
Hold on.

02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:24.820
Let me do this.

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:28.820
I think that the electromagnetic field illusion you made was a great addition to the discussion, as it can provide,

02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:34.820
the so-called light at the end of the tunnel, you know, for your search towards synchronicity.

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:40.820
And perhaps one day we will find that our brains do in fact impact, you know, the neurocortical fields of others.

02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:43.820
However, as far as we're concerned, that's not the case right now.

02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:48.820
You know, in your discussion of the Paul Young conjecture, there were a number of references to wholeness,

02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:53.820
the meaningful coincidences, you know, in a scientific world dominated by doubt and scrutiny in its history,

02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:58.820
things like Heisenberg, uncertainty principle, Grodel's and completeness theorem, you know,

02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:05.820
with synchronicity, just a way to feel better about the unknown, or are you all confident that you will one day find the equivalent of the fair day discovery of the magnetic field?

02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.820
I don't know about feeling better.

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.820
I don't know if the better came into this.

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.820
You know, maybe I can't say something about this issue.

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.820
Please.

02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.820
I think people better really just say it in a way.

02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:21.820
You know, understanding if understanding something is feeling better about it.

02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:22.820
Yeah.

02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:28.820
That's a different level than I would say. The experience itself is not necessarily feeling better.

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:32.820
You know, we have in the Freiburg Institute where I'm also a part-time working.

02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:39.820
We have a counseling unit there, and in the last 15 years we have seen about 2,000 actually clients which come,

02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:45.820
and some of them ask for advice because the experience that they have,

02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:50.820
synchronicity experiences, telepathy, extracellular perception, what do you want, you know?

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:56.820
They are deeply troubling them. They experience them as negative and burdening.

02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:01.820
I mean, not everybody. It's almost like half and half.

02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:08.820
There are some who really feel that this is enriching their life and they interpret it very positive.

02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:12.820
That's the whole thing, right? But others are, and it's the half.

02:03:12.820 --> 02:03:14.820
It's the other half.

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:18.820
They cannot get along with these experiences at all.

02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:28.820
And now, if you ask a psychiatrist, we have a psychiatrist in the lab actually in this group.

02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:35.820
And the psychiatrist, when he hears what these people report, he opens his manual, the DSM,

02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:46.820
the IV, or V now, and then he looks it up, and then he sees, this is a very severe precursor for schizophrenia, for instance.

02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:52.820
You see what I mean? So what I'm saying is these experiences are completely ambivalent.

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:59.820
Some patients, or some clients, we don't have patients, clients report them positively, others report them negatively,

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:10.820
and even the progressive psychiatrist, who, there is no discrete distinction between healthy and diseased,

02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:19.820
but things about the continuum, he would insist that these phenomena are on a spectrum from healthy to dysfunctional.

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:27.820
And the convinced psychiatrist, even of the modern continuum type, would completely dismiss the positive side.

02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:33.820
And I think it's the interesting thing is that not that everything is positive.

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:41.820
The interesting thing is that given the normal assumption that they are all dysfunctional, we also have positive cases.

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:43.820
That's the interesting thing.

02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:46.820
And so with that, there's so much more to say.

02:04:46.820 --> 02:04:47.820
Yes.

02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:53.820
One thing that I would like to point out is to point me in thanking the panelists for a wonderful discussion,

02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:59.820
especially Beverly Tsubrissi for organizing a wonderful discussion. Thank you.
