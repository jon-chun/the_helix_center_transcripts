WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The Helix Centre.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.600
I'm Ed Narsesian, Director of the Helix Centre.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.000
Welcome to this program on synthetic and systemic biology.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Before Rob Panzer introduces the participants and tells you a word or two about our future programs,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
I'd like to say that the meeting will last around an hour, an hour or 15 minutes.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
After that you'll have time to ask questions.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
But please ask questions rather than making commentaries.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
I think it works better that way. Thank you.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
So let me tell you first about some upcoming events.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
On Saturday, May 18th, from 6.30 to 8.30, we're going to have the second annual heavy mental variety show.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
It's a night of mind, brain and magic.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
The amygdalaids led by neuroscientist Joseph Ladoux

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
will play several suites of original songs on mind brain topics,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
the mind body problem, memory, emotion, unconscious processes and mental disorders.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
Each suite will be preceded by a short lecture on the scientific or philosophical foundations of the topic.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
Also, internationally acclaimed magician Mark Mitten will dazzle you with mind bending

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
and brain twisting tricks of his trade. Doors open at 6.15.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Admission is $10 without drink tickets and $17 for tickets with two beers or glasses of wine.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Saturday, June 8th, altruism and empathy is a program with Stephanie Brown, Alan Leslie,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Wind Schwartz and others.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Then there are some round tables that are in the works for September,

01:46.000 --> 01:54.000
but I want to make special emphasis on a symposium that will be holding on October 12th and 13th

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
in co-sponsorship with the Algama Foundation of Switzerland.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
It will be a two-day symposium exploring the significance of the work of A.B. Warburg

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
for art, science and psychoanalysis.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
We will re-examine his work through the compound lenses of current knowledge of dynamic memory,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
the Freudian unconscious and historical scholarship.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
It will be an international gathering of scholars drawn from the arts and sciences

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
featuring round tables, exploring Warburg's ideas and their adenbrations,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
and will focus on neurostatics, memory and unconscious psychosis and creativity,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
and Bizwanger and Warburg. Bizwanger was his psychiatrist at one point,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
and classical and renaissance art.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Also, the evening preceding it, Friday the 11th, will feature the

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Mignoloids returning for a pre-symposium performance, and joining us at the symposium

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
thus far, or historian Christopher Johnson, historian and psychoanalyst Peter Loenberg,

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
art historian David Friedberg, philosopher and art historian George D. D. Hubermaugh,

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
philosopher Andrea Pinotti, Warburg Institute historian Francois Quiviget,

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
neuroscientist Christina Alberini, Aijon Chatterjee and Vittorio Galese,

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
and Pierre Magestretti, and psychoanalyst Francois Answarmey and Edner Ncessian,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
also novelist and essayist Siri Housvet.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
Let me go on now to today's program.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
No. As soon as we have the definite times of the round tables

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
and the confirmed other participants will put it up on the website,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
we'll keep checking back. Thanks.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So let me introduce today's participants.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Andrea Califano is the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor in Chemical and Systems Biology

He leads worldwide discovery in early clinical activities of Novartis,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
which aims to develop novel therapeutics for diseases.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Prior to joining Novartis, Dr. Fishman was Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
as well as Chief of Cardiology at the Mass General Hospital

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
and the founding director of their cardiovascular research center.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Dr. Fishman is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
and the Institutes of Medicine of the National Academies.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Michael Hecht is Professor of Chemistry at Princeton

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
and holds affiliated appointments in the Department of Molecular Biology

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
and Institute for Integrative Genomics.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
His research is at the interface of chemistry and biology,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
specifically his lab works in protein design and synthetic biology,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
as well as on the molecular underpinnings of Alzheimer's disease.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
In addition to teaching and research, Dr. Hecht is the master of Forbes College,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
one of the 600 graduate colleges at Princeton University.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Christopher Mason is Assistant Professor at Wile Cornell Medical College

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
and at the Institute for Computational Biomedicine.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
Professor Mason also holds appointments in the Tri-Institutional Program

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
on Computational Biology and Medicine of Cornell Memorial Sloan Kettering

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
and Rockefeller.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And at the Wile Cornell Cancer Center,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
where he's the Director of the Single Molecule Lab,

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
he is co-founder also of the New York Synthetic Biology Association.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Said Tavasi is a systems biologist who was Professor

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
in the Department of Molecular Biology

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
and the Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
before joining the faculty at Columbia University in 2011.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Over the years, his laboratory has addressed fundamental challenges

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
in decoding the regulatory genome

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
and revealing how networks of interacting genes implement complex phenotypes.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
The long-term goal of his research is to achieve a predictive understanding

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
of biological behavior in terms of the structural and dynamical properties

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
of the underlying molecular networks.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And Michael Waldholtz most recently served for six years

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
as managing editor at Bloomberg News Business Week

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
following his 25-year career as a writer, editor,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and bureau chief at the Wall Street Journal.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
At Bloomberg, he was responsible for news coverage related to health care and science,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
including the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries,

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
health insurance, medical services, public health, and health policy.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Mr. Waldholtz is the author of the book Curing Cancer

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
and a co-author of Genome.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
He was awarded the 1996 Pulitzer Prize

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
for national reporting for his stories on the breakthrough in AIDS medicine.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Let's start the conversation.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
Who would like to initiate with a question or a remark

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
or maybe say a few words about what the subject is about?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, I think one of the ways to discuss the topic.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm a systems biologist, but also a dabble in synthetic biology.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
But these new fields, as they emerge, they have a definition problem

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
because the initial investigators who are forging the path forward,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
they're all doing somewhat different things,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
and in the process of actually defining the field.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I think one way to define systems biology

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
is in contrast to the prevailing approaches of modern biology in the last century.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
There have been extremely successful two axes of which are biochemistry and genetics.

07:40.000 --> 07:47.000
So, I think if I were to describe this really powerful existing methodology

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
that is responsible for basically everything that we know, almost everything that we know right now.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
There are two ways of studying biological systems.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
One is to break it down into its composite components

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
and intricately study the details of those individual components

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
in an attempt to figure out what they're doing, what the whole system is doing.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
That's sort of what biochemistry does.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
The other approach has been very successful, even older than biochemistry,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
which is genetics, which is to take those individual components,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
break them down and see the fact that that has on the system,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
see how that perturbation causes a malfunction in the system.

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
And so, it's akin to essentially studying, for example, how a car works

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
by slowly destroying little parts of it,

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
taking out the spark plug or the carburetor and seeing what the fact that has.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
So, it's extremely gross and caveman approach to understanding the system,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
but it has been extremely successful.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
But the real challenge nowadays for all of us in biology,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
and I think that's what kind of was the impetus behind systems biology,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
is to attempt to understand what the whole system is all about.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
What is it doing? How are the parts coming together?

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
And I think the grand vision for us to shoot for is to have an understanding

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
of biological systems in ways that are more similar to what physicists think

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
about systems, which is to be able to predict the dynamical trajectory of a system in time,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
not well enough to understand that.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
That's the challenge. And I would argue that we're very far from that still.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
But this is kind of the goal that we're shooting for.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
To engineer the system.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, I think engineering a system is important because I think one way,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
and that sort of was synthetic biology is about,

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
but I think in order to really, if you want to prove to someone that you really understand the system,

09:41.000 --> 09:47.000
you should be able to re-engineer an instant of it and have it,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
and predict what that thing is going to do.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And I think that's the scientific value of synthetic biology.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
There are, of course, other aspects of synthetic biology that are really important.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
And I agree. I think that's the true test of our understanding is the ability to forward engineer,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
and then I discreetly predict exactly what matters.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It scares some people, though. That's the thing.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
When you say synthetic biology, there's often people who are worried that you're going to be creating

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
super bugs or, you know, they think of evil scientists in their lab hackling late at night.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
But the, you know, most biohackers or more synthetic biologists are generally just tinkerers.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
They just want to try to discern what is sort of this test of their understanding of the genetic system.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
And there's even a laboratory in Brooklyn that's called GenSpace,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
which is a community laboratory.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
The way you think of buying a gym membership today, you could go to Brooklyn on Atlantic Avenue

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
and get membership to GenSpace and go and play with pipettes.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
And if you want to make some of your cells turn green with GFP, you can do that in a couple weekends

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
and learn how to do it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
So there's, you know, and that's just synthetic biology.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
But when they set up the lab in Brooklyn, they had the FBI come first to make sure that they were legitimate

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
and they invited them to come home.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Really, we're just a group of people who want to tinkerer.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
They're really tinkerers.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
And so you go from that impetus of tinkering, I think, in larger academic and industrial centers

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
to make it on a real high throughput scale.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
So it's...

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Well, I was just going to say it maybe as a...

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
as the lay person, the non-scientist on the panel,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
it might be good for everyone here if someone could give.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.000
Because I think that was a really great general picture of how systems biology differs from what was being done.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
But I think for many of us, synthetic biology leads a very specific description with examples of what's going on.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Yeah, I'll do that.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
So, again, I think what's said was defining with systems biology, synthetic biology.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
In a sense, I'd like to define that by saying that biology, as we know,

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
albeit old biology that was taking things piece at a time, or systems biology, the modern type of biology,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
those fields are looking at that which is.

11:51.000 --> 11:56.000
And I think synthetic biology goes a step beyond that and asks what might be possible.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
What might we have not yet seen, but it's still possible?

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
Okay, so in a sense, well, just that, that synthetic biology is going beyond that, which is and explores that, which might be possible.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
Which really does have a bit of a science fictiony, brave new world tone to it, but it's real.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
So could you...

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Let me elaborate on that.

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
And I'll tell, I think much of what people normally think of as synthetic biology is where people are taking pre-agisting genes,

12:25.000 --> 12:34.000
proteins, or regulatory elements from various different cells, organisms, and mixing and matching them to make new cells that have particular properties.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
The example you gave a moment was a moment ago where you can take a green fluorescent protein that exists in one particular system

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
and move it into another system and people have made green fluorescent organisms that didn't fluoresce before.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
So that's one form of synthetic biology.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
And that's...

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
That makes E. coli smell like bananas, for example.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
Right, so in that case, there are people who are taking pre...

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
In a sense, one can look at it as an analogy, as a toolkit of parts.

13:03.000 --> 13:10.000
And so the natural biology that we have is a toolkit of parts, genes and proteins and regulatory elements.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
And much of what people do in synthetic biology is to take these tools, these parts and rearrange them into different machines.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
That's one form of synthetic biology, and that's what most people think of when they discuss synthetic biology.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
I have a different take on synthetic biology, which I'd want to...

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, I'll do it now.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
A different take on synthetic biology, which is a bit perhaps more synthetic, and that is...

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, you started by saying, how do we define the basics, or maybe we'll define biology before we even get going?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
So what does it take to be a living system?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
What does it take to be a cell?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
What are the minimal requirements to be a cell?

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
And I think in some respects, one can say that a living system, a cell, has to have molecular machinery, molecular machines that do stuff.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
So a living system has to have an enzyme that digests food, that's a molecular machine, or a molecular machine that enables vision.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
So those are molecular machines.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
And most of the molecular machines and biology are proteins.

14:03.000 --> 14:11.000
So one thing living systems need are... I'm defining living systems as a collection of molecular machines that do stuff.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
The second thing, I think, that living system that we need to define in terms of living systems are a blueprint, or an encoding...

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
A way of encoding those molecular machines such that can be passed down from generation to generation.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
So a factory is a collection of machines, not molecular machines, but it's not alive.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
It doesn't pass down a collection of machines to the next generation.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
Biological system cells have a collection of molecular machines, the proteins, that do stuff.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
And a genome that encodes those molecular machines, and the genome gets passed down along the way.

14:42.000 --> 14:50.000
So my view of synthetic biology is a bit different from what I mentioned earlier in the sense that instead of taking molecular machines and genes,

14:50.000 --> 14:57.000
that preexisting nature and recombining them into different systems, taking the banana smell and putting into bacteria, taking the green fluorescent protein,

14:57.000 --> 15:06.000
and putting it into cats or whatever. Instead of mixing and matching preexisting parts, I think synthetic biology in its most extreme case is now at the point where,

15:06.000 --> 15:17.000
rather than take those preexisting machines and mixing and matching them, one can ask, is it now possible to come up with new sequences, new proteins, new genes, that can sustain life?

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
I want to challenge a little bit, because I think there's a much broader sense in which we can think of synthetic biology.

15:25.000 --> 15:36.000
For instance, if you go back to what Zayla was saying in terms of creating something that essentially a new function will not be previously seen, utilizing biological components,

15:36.000 --> 15:44.000
would say that for instance you're saying the cycle of each of these things, to synthesize alcohol in a vat was probably the oldest or most synthetic biology.

15:44.000 --> 16:02.000
And that's the next thing I have to do with Diggenome, which is there are many ways in which you can even use natural evolution to create environments in which bacteria can multiply and naturally achieve some type of selective functions,

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
and that also means that it's a synthetic biology.

16:06.000 --> 16:18.000
So I would say there's an entire progression of application of synthetic biology that go all the way from synthesizing molecules using sort of biological forms,

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
all the way to actually synthesizing novel forms of biological life by messing around with the DNA, I think, kind of right, they're almost synthetic.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
As a synthetic biology and a synthetic biology are almost at two phases of the same coin.

16:30.000 --> 16:40.000
So you exclude reproduction of the two strongest poll shows of the human mind. So one is trying to figure out how things work, and the second one is to mess around with them as soon as you understand how they work.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And some extent it's exactly what the two fields are doing.

16:42.000 --> 16:56.000
This is biology is trying to figure out things work, and it's trying to do so in a way that sort of takes a step back and goes into a much more unbiased, sort of completely neutral approach to understand biology,

16:56.000 --> 17:04.000
where for instance people say, let's make an example of the English language and say the word doc, depending on how, where you say the word doc,

17:04.000 --> 17:11.000
and if somebody says doc and you're in street, you better just get out of the way, but if somebody says doc and it's in a French restaurant, then no means a completely different name.

17:11.000 --> 17:25.000
And so in biology it's exactly the same thing, the same gene may be doing, completely different things in different contexts, yet the old vision of microbiology was that this pressure, this function, this activates a photo, this is the same.

17:25.000 --> 17:38.000
These are all true observation in particular context, and I think if system biologists thought of something, that context is extraordinarily important, and context is both molecular and physical.

17:38.000 --> 17:54.000
So on the other side, I think once we have this recipe, we think of ourselves living at the boundary of systems and synthetic biology, some of the things that we use from systems to actually implement the centennial biology

17:54.000 --> 18:14.000
is we program cells, so if you take for instance two genes and you modulate them in this molecule or you're seeing genetic approaches, and you can now turn the lineage of a cell into another lineage, that's a form of a state biology, that's a necessary question for programming the DNA, but certainly we program the full cells into the complete number function.

18:14.000 --> 18:31.000
So these are, I would say, there's a type repertoire, and this is also a way to justify the field, because if you start thinking of synthetic biology as the way, you know, heroes die in the first place, then it becomes a little less frightening if you think about it as manipulating DNA and making crack and stack.

18:31.000 --> 18:49.000
And where you put exactly that threshold, what you say, it goes from being something that is controversial to being something that's not controversial, that's where you really have to move your ethical slider and try to figure out where the lead is, but it's not a real breakpoint is a type of thing.

18:49.000 --> 19:04.000
I think the breakpoint is that it's now just in the last few years become possible to not just move proteins and genes from one system to another, but to actually create new sequences that bear no resemblance to anything that ever existed before, and to have those

19:04.000 --> 19:23.000
enabled biological functions, I think that's new.

19:23.000 --> 19:34.000
So in the high, sorry, the high-mutational context, for instance, you remove the DNA-repared genes from a bacterium, you can essentially engineer the same way as if you actually put in new pieces.

19:34.000 --> 19:47.000
I have a simpler definition, which is any interaction that humans have with biological systems that changes the behavior of those systems.

19:47.000 --> 19:57.000
And the implications that come from that run a gamut as a physician, I'll start with the medical possibilities are fantastic.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
You can make new medicines.

20:00.000 --> 20:11.000
In fact, any medicine, in fact, is synthetic biology, both in its origin and its impact on the cell.

20:11.000 --> 20:22.000
And then the second is the scientific question, which I think is what's being addressed here too, which is a question of how do you actually influence a cellular system?

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
And what's remarkable is how robust systems are.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
They tend not to change.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
So you can push on them in many, many ways without them changing.

20:34.000 --> 20:53.000
And that's where, as a geneticist, the caveman approach, which is what I do, is so remarkable because that approach, the genetic approach, finds those few nodes in the whole system that are critical and causes the system to either collapse or to amplify.

20:53.000 --> 21:05.000
And those are in many ways where the synthetic biologist will go because most of the places you interfere, turning genes up or down or proteins on, do nothing.

21:05.000 --> 21:18.000
And so, in fact, of course, it's actually a miracle that any of us survive any drug we're given because these drugs have very powerful effects.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
Somehow, the body buffers them in most cells except for the cancer cell or the cell that needs to be attacked.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
So that's the scientific element.

21:27.000 --> 21:35.000
But for me, it's not a complex synthetic biologist, not complicates anything you do that changes the system, the behavior of that system.

21:35.000 --> 21:42.000
I think something that's really fundamental to that point is, you know, the origin of these systems, right?

21:42.000 --> 21:50.000
Biological systems come about through this random process of mutation and natural selection over hundreds of millions, millions of years, right?

21:50.000 --> 21:59.000
And, you know, there's an organizing principle, there are bunch of organizing principles that contribute to its evolution and its function.

21:59.000 --> 22:08.000
So, if you imagine these kind of buffered systems where you perturb lots of different components quite a bit, actually, and the cells doing perfectly fine,

22:08.000 --> 22:16.000
you'd imagine that you would say that the biological systems in general are extremely robust to environmental perturbation, to noise, and so on and so forth.

22:16.000 --> 22:26.000
Whereas if you compare them to human engineered systems, like 747 or something, right, each of the components in these machines have been designed to have some tolerance.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
But the tolerances that they have are typically much worse than biological systems.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.000
And part of that has to do with the fact that these systems have to withstand a certain amount of mutation as they evolve with time.

22:40.000 --> 22:49.000
They have to have components that are modular because of the mix in matching that goes on, and the sharing of genetic information that happens as a function of evolution,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
mostly among the microbes in the horizontal gene transfer.

22:52.000 --> 23:01.000
But those kind of contingencies of natural selection are embedded in the way in which the system functions that are very different from the kind of things that people think about,

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
when they want to design a system from scratch.

23:05.000 --> 23:15.000
And I think what's really amazing and really fascinating to look forward to in the future is the adoption of a lot of these evolutionary methods,

23:15.000 --> 23:29.000
some of which I think Michael has done in his work and others, is to utilize rapid evolutionary scenarios to design systems that are robust to a variety of different environmental perturbations and variations.

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
And you know what's interesting about that just as a footnote is that cancer is not robust.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
That's why we can kill it because it didn't evolve to support the rest of the system.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
And to that end, I think the idea of starting to design systems, designing life again,

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
we would probably not like some of the things that evolution has designed.

23:51.000 --> 23:59.000
For example, increasing gene expression noise as a measure of fitness in some cases or increasing mutation rate to give you a further adaptive advantage for some bacteria.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
We would probably not design a system to start to do those things, but their actually evolution has created them.

24:05.000 --> 24:20.000
I think as again as a lay person looking in the thing that interests me about synthetic biology is that there's an extension of using all the tools of molecular biology and genetic engineering that have come about over the last 20 to 50 years.

24:20.000 --> 24:43.000
To do what Michael says, which is to create new forms of life or new versions of existing forms of life by actually in the laboratory creating genetic sequences that don't exist, often using the same laws of that govern how we exist today.

24:43.000 --> 24:58.000
Laws of mutation. I think for most people, we don't understand that we've evolved to who we are today through some sort of natural selection, but that we aren't exactly who we might have engineered from the first place.

24:58.000 --> 25:12.000
And if we had to choose, but that a lot of this tinkering has exactly, you know, people get very concerned and I'll bet you we get questions from the public that you are playing God or tinkering with nature in a way that we can't.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
You know, how do you have the right and who's governing you?

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
But that kind of tinkering, of course, mankind has been doing and nature has been doing from the get go.

25:21.000 --> 25:31.000
I often think of the piece of corn for some reason. I always look at corn when corn first evolved in this hemisphere, in the northern southern hemisphere.

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
It didn't look anything like what corn looks like today and corn looks like what it does today because of human tinkering with it.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Same with that ball.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Same with that ball. Dogs are even better at that.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
So we've been tinkering all along.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.000
Or horses, yeah. I would even argue, I even push back against people who critique it.

25:50.000 --> 26:00.000
One is the historical context you just mentioned, but I would even argue, I guess I put forward the thesis that it's actually our duty as a species to embrace the engineering in that our survival may very well depend on it.

26:00.000 --> 26:07.000
And if you think in the long, long term, I'll posit this sort of thought experiment. So you think 100 years from now or 1,000 years from now or 1,000,000 years from now.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
I actually have this question, whenever we interview grad students or faculty for the department.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
My last question I always ask them is how long do you think the human species will survive?

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
And it always throws people off because they're not expecting that at a job interview or a student interview.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
But I like it because it gives me a sense of their hope actually for the human species.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
And a lot of times people say 1,000 years or 1,000,000 years.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I usually remind them we've been here at least for several million years in our current form.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000
But one person even said 100 years, I think, well, humans will only be here for another 100 years and I said, well, good God, man.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Why don't I just go to the beach and sell bananas and hang on?

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
He said, well, I want the last 100 years to really count. It was actually what he said. I couldn't imagine.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
But I would argue it's our duty because we probably won't be here on this planet forever and the human genomes not built to live on other planets.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
So we may have to think of a time when we re-engineer the species on which we depend or even the human genome in order to actually survive in a long, long, long term.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
I think we have the ability of the species to think that far so we should consider that as a thought experiment.

27:00.000 --> 27:07.000
There's a precise moment in time. I think if you look at Albers, Natans and Smith, Nobel Prize, right, when they, restriction enzymes,

27:07.000 --> 27:14.000
that demarcated a very important milestone because before, the only thing you could do to manipulate biology was essentially look very natural.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
You could graft a plant on top of another plant. People have been doing that for tens of thousands of years.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
Nobody ever thought that would be either an ethical or potentially controversial. People have been breeding dogs, etc.

27:28.000 --> 27:35.000
But the moment you could actually do it molecularly and actually infringe on the domain of the most sacred molecules, DNA,

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
then all of a sudden things escalate to tremendous proportion.

27:39.000 --> 27:48.000
I think, you know, obviously, one of the things that actually Mark said, I think, is extremely important is that we live to be a system of homeostasis

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
and actually 90% of our machinery is to keep the cell doing exactly what it's doing regardless of perturbation.

27:54.000 --> 28:01.000
But the biggest domestic system is the actual world. If you go outside, you know, one of the biggest problems you have right now,

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
people try to engineer algae to produce lipids at much higher rates.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
So you, for instance, get better biofuel production. And people have been very successful doing that.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
You know why we're not producing fuels? Because the moment you actually start breeding these things in normal environment,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
they are immediately out-competed by normal algae that don't do that.

28:18.000 --> 28:26.000
And so that's the way of the plan of getting back and basically telling you, look, yeah, you produce more fuel, but for the planet, it's not very helpful.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
And so these species will actually be out-competed and will eventually die. It will become not a dominant species.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
So I think that we have to always come to terms with, I think, today, right in New York Times that our CO2 levels are the highest in

28:39.000 --> 28:46.000
400 million years. That worries me. I think a lot more. Because that can trigger an absolute irreversible catastrophe and

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
finance and no way to react to that. Most of the living organisms, if you think of the number of species that we have

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
and the number of genetic experiments that are happening every day, and each one of them, just because of, you know, normal rates of mutations,

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
almost everything that you could possibly do in the lab is actually being done out there.

29:03.000 --> 29:11.000
So when you say we're synthesizing new virus for influenza, is lethal and can transmit to man-to-man? That's being done every day out there.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
I have to disagree with that. I have to go back to what I said before and disagree with that.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.000
I think the current and the next stage of synthetic biology are profoundly different.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
It's not just ionizing radiation and individual mutations, and it's not just sampling sequences that may have been already sampled.

29:25.000 --> 29:36.000
I think it's at the point now when one can design proteins entirely from scratch that are not mutationly related to anything that's been seen on Earth before.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
And one can sample new sequences, both protein and DNA sequences, that are unrelated to anything that's ever been around.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
And I think that's a fundamentally different thing. It's not just making mutations.

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
Michael, has anything been created like that that can be a specific example?

29:52.000 --> 30:08.000
Well, that's what my lab does. But there's also, I mean, I think in terms of protein design, there's David Baker in Seattle who's doing computational work to design proteins entirely from scratch with predetermined folds and predetermined activities

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
that are unrelated to anything that any sequences that exist on Earth.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
My own work, we're making libraries of novel sequences unrelated to anything that has ever existed on Earth.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
And if a sequence base is larger than can it ever been sampled with a history of the universe?

30:23.000 --> 30:32.000
And someone can now make sequences that have never existed before and then challenge those sequences to provide to see whether they can provide life-sustaining functions.

30:32.000 --> 30:43.000
So one can actually go into bacterial cells, knock out parts of the genome, and then see if those parts of the genome can be replaced by sequences that never existed before.

30:43.000 --> 30:51.000
So if you do that, if you take a bacterial cell that has 4,000 genes and you replace four of them, well then it's an E. coli that's a little weird and it has four new genes.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
Again, these are not mutant genes. These are genes unrelated to anything that ever existed.

30:56.000 --> 31:12.000
So if you do it four out of four thousand, it's a minor thing. But when you start, I'm not going to do this, but we can imagine just around the corner that people can now replace large sections of a genome of, let's say, a bacterial cell with sequences that never existed before in the history of the Earth.

31:12.000 --> 31:20.000
And then that, I think, one has to come to grips with the fact that those are new forms of life that are not evolutionary variants of existing forms of life.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
They're fundamentally new, fundamentally new sequences, proteins designed from scratch, genomes designed from scratch.

31:26.000 --> 31:34.000
That, I think, is around the corner and I think that's, you know, in terms of philosophical or theological issues, that's sort of something that one wants to think about.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
Another thing would be chemotherapy. Often we use nucleoside anelones. We have variations of AC, G, and T that are just different enough that they killed the cells.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
And so you can use synthetic biology. I would even argue that chemotherapy could be viewed as a form of synthetic...

31:47.000 --> 31:56.000
And the genetic, the genetic code there. We're 20 amino acids for as long as the world's been around, but we can now engineer the genetic code to have more than 20 amino acids.

31:56.000 --> 32:10.000
What is the... I'm trying to understand the grasp of at least the fundamental semantic difference between having a protein that is completely different from another one and got to be completely different because of some very complex evolutionary path.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
God there, one that you would engineer from scratch.

32:12.000 --> 32:23.000
Parentage. The difference is parentage. The difference is linear. The difference is whether it evolved from something that pre-existed out in Darwin's swamp or whether it's something that came to be in an innocent, pathetic lab.

32:23.000 --> 32:38.000
I understand, but what I'm saying is it's a form of mental evolution. Instead of deriving from a process where the one position at a time to get there, there are by a process where the complete sedimentation is computed by computer or by AMMB.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
But the point is you now have a new protein. We're not saying we're creating new proteins all the time. We're doing the mutation.

32:44.000 --> 32:58.000
In some cases, we're doing big rearrangements and so other things that are... You do an inversion, for instance. That is a... I think in the public's mind, one is... evolutionary is natural.

32:58.000 --> 33:05.000
And this is synthetic. And I think that is the question that the product is the same. The protein is the same.

33:05.000 --> 33:17.000
So, for instance, again, as a journalist, we try to get down to examples. I think there are a couple of examples of synthetic biology that are out there already that are interesting.

33:17.000 --> 33:33.000
And it's interesting to see whether the public is bothered by it. One is changing the genes of algae to produce lipids or oils or fats and getting algae to produce biofuel of some type.

33:33.000 --> 33:47.000
Or in another instance, changing the genetics of yeast to not only create alcohol when they interact with sugar, but now to create fuel, which is already happening. Not in a commercial level, but it's happening.

33:47.000 --> 34:02.000
And those are examples of what at least has been described to me as synthetic biology. At that level, I think the public sort of feels, okay, you know, we're sort of tinkering with yeast in one instance, maybe bacteria or algae in another instance.

34:02.000 --> 34:14.000
But what is it when we start tinkering with humans? So you're talking about the fact that there may be medicine in the future. What do you... from synthetic biology, what do you say?

34:14.000 --> 34:29.000
Let me take it over several different ranges. The first is we can now take individual genes in a bacteria and line them up in a way so they will make novel drugs.

34:29.000 --> 34:49.000
Because you can predict from the sequence of the enzymes you put in there all the reactions that the cell will do, and then they will excrete that in. So you could, in principle, make very complex... and do you can naturally make very complicated molecules naturally in a cell.

34:49.000 --> 34:59.000
In fact, these are called natural products, even though these, of course, are unnatural in the sense that we were thinking about it. So from the point of view of new medicines, very powerful.

34:59.000 --> 35:15.000
Because these kinds of natural products are extremely good at being drugs. Let me take it to the extreme. I have taken care, let's say we're taking care of a child who has inherited disorder.

35:15.000 --> 35:28.000
Well, now we can go in with a particular set of enzymatic replacements, and this has not been done, but in principle. We certainly have done it in experimental systems.

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
Take out the bad gene and put in the good gene. Replace it with the normal gene.

35:34.000 --> 35:51.000
Would you deny that to a child? You're changing their genome. Why would you not do that? We're not there. We're far from that. There's lots of issues about how many cells would have to take it up, etc.

35:51.000 --> 36:10.000
If you had a child with, let's say, with hemophilia, rather than getting regular injections every day, or regularly to prevent bleeding, would you not take the opportunity to fix their hemophilia gene? Of course you would. At least I would as a physician.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
What if it was an embryo? It's easier if it's an embryo.

36:12.000 --> 36:27.000
You can certainly do it as an embryo, and that's where it's been done in other animals' machines. But even in an adult or child in principle, if you could change enough of the liver and you get enough into the liver, you could do it.

36:27.000 --> 36:37.000
So there you have an extreme. One, you're tinkering with bacteria. Everyone says you can make a drug. The other, you're tinkering with humans. Both cases, you will revolutionize medicine for the better.

36:37.000 --> 36:45.000
There's even a more extreme scenario that's actually being used in human trials. HIV infects tel lymphocytes.

36:45.000 --> 36:56.000
There's a small fraction of a Western European population that has a variant of a core receptor on the surface of cells that is very ineffective for HIV infection.

36:56.000 --> 37:15.000
So what they're doing now in humans now is taking out some of those white cells in HIV patients and using zinc-finger nucleases to inactivate or modify that core receptor in a way that makes that patients T cell in vitro, impermeable to the HIV.

37:15.000 --> 37:27.000
Put it back into the human and have that grow and repopulate. And the idea is that eventually this could be a nice way to destroy the, to get out of HIV.

37:27.000 --> 37:43.000
So these kind of things, because of the example that Mark brought up, and there are many more examples coming up, because now, because of really amazing, fundamental basic research into understanding the way in which molecules work, we now have generated these tools

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
that allows to go on an engineer human cells, any kind of cells that we want. And people are going to be wanting these treatments, because they're critical.

37:50.000 --> 38:11.000
And Dr. Siano has engineered this gene directly into the stem cell compartment of the bone marrow, and essentially populate the niche, these are the metabolism, and basically, this one child that was treated was effectively almost completely cured of a pretty bad disease by essentially doing the direct transplantation in the bone marrow.

38:11.000 --> 38:28.000
But, I mean what I was trying to do before was simply to some extent demystifying, when I do this, I'm kind of doing it in a more, maybe a little bit provocatory way, because obviously, I'm not trying to say that, trying to, in fact, to pass judgment at all on this entire field.

38:28.000 --> 38:38.000
I'm just basically saying that there are oversensetization of the process, and there are undersensetization of the process that are happening.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.400
cases, for instance, we think that certain things are immoral,

38:42.400 --> 38:44.720
when we've actually been doing some other things that

38:44.720 --> 38:47.060
are very, very close to them, and are not quite

38:47.060 --> 38:49.680
substantially different in theory,

38:49.680 --> 38:51.520
but that we're considered to be natural.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.600
And all of a sudden, because you're

38:52.600 --> 38:56.840
doing these at the molecular level, it's no longer natural.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.000
And to some extent, it's always when chemistry gets involved

38:59.000 --> 39:00.440
and things get complicated.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.080
But we have to remember that we all

39:02.080 --> 39:05.600
work with chemistry, whether it's natural chemistry or not.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.840
So when you actually graph the plant on another plant,

39:07.840 --> 39:08.920
and you're mixing their genomes,

39:08.920 --> 39:10.760
since I understand you are doing chemistry.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.240
But then chemistry in a way that doesn't involve pipettes,

39:13.240 --> 39:14.360
but it's still chemistry.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.680
I think I want to bring the conversation a little bit

39:19.680 --> 39:23.560
back to systems biology, because the degree

39:23.560 --> 39:26.680
to which synthetic biology is going to be successful,

39:26.680 --> 39:28.360
and people are going to rely on.

39:28.360 --> 39:32.160
And it's going to actually, over long-term produce results

39:32.160 --> 39:33.720
that people aren't going to be afraid of,

39:33.720 --> 39:35.840
relies on a foundation of understanding

39:35.840 --> 39:37.880
of how cells work.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.000
And that's where systems biology and modern biology

39:40.000 --> 39:40.840
comes in.

39:40.840 --> 39:46.280
And so one of the major challenges for us

39:46.280 --> 39:48.640
is to understand these systems well enough

39:48.640 --> 39:50.440
to be able to predict exactly what happens

39:50.440 --> 39:53.040
if you re-engineer a particular molecule in the cell.

39:53.040 --> 39:56.720
And what are the consequences of that when

39:56.720 --> 40:00.640
you put it back in in a very complex multi-scale system,

40:00.640 --> 40:02.880
which is a human body, all these organs interacting

40:02.880 --> 40:05.760
with each other, where we have just only

40:05.760 --> 40:08.160
begun to scratch the surface of that kind of potential

40:08.160 --> 40:09.400
interactions that can happen.

40:09.400 --> 40:14.560
So I think synthetic biology and systems biology

40:14.560 --> 40:16.400
are going to be interacting with each other

40:16.400 --> 40:18.000
as they co-evolve.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.560
And synthetic is going to heavily depend on systems.

40:22.560 --> 40:26.200
And I think this marks the divide between what

40:26.200 --> 40:28.200
Michael and Ray were talking about,

40:28.200 --> 40:31.040
which is using natural selection evolution

40:31.040 --> 40:35.960
to develop variants of existing molecules,

40:35.960 --> 40:39.520
is a essentially a brainless thing.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.720
You just set up the selection, cause mutations,

40:42.720 --> 40:45.000
and you'll end up finding bacteria that

40:45.000 --> 40:47.760
can do a particular thing, or mammalian cells.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.520
But having the knowledge of what are the compositional

40:52.520 --> 40:56.600
components, the organizing principles by which amino acids

40:56.600 --> 40:59.560
come together to form proteins, what do those folds do?

40:59.560 --> 41:00.920
How do the folds interact?

41:00.920 --> 41:03.440
And how do you make machines out of those folds?

41:03.440 --> 41:07.000
Is it a foundational knowledge that we need to gain?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.080
And people are gaining.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.960
Michael's laboratory, for example.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.480
In order to set up a foundation that

41:13.480 --> 41:17.040
allows us to build new things based on rational engineering

41:17.040 --> 41:18.080
principles.

41:18.080 --> 41:21.360
And I think that's where the most exciting stuff is happening,

41:21.360 --> 41:24.160
because that's where it will impact our understanding

41:24.160 --> 41:26.840
of biological systems.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.760
And so I think that's what I find really exciting.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.240
The other way around, too, I think actually

41:30.240 --> 41:32.600
what's been, to me, re-transformation is that we always

41:32.600 --> 41:35.040
think that understanding biology informs

41:35.040 --> 41:36.040
the ability of engineering.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.640
But actually, the ability of engineering

41:37.640 --> 41:40.320
also really helps dissect it.

41:40.320 --> 41:44.000
So for instance, Diego di Bernardo came from Jim Collins

41:44.000 --> 41:45.720
lab, engineered in yeast.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.480
A fairly complicated circuit.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.840
And that circuit was used in this conference

41:49.840 --> 41:51.840
that we ran off of last seven years, called

41:51.840 --> 41:54.320
Dream, where we essentially challenge

41:54.320 --> 41:57.080
systems biologists to dissect the piece of biology

41:57.080 --> 41:58.160
we actually know.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.120
The problem is that there's really no piece of biology

42:00.120 --> 42:00.880
we actually know.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.960
Literally, there's not a single one that we actually know,

42:02.960 --> 42:04.800
except for extraordinary, simple things.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.840
So having an actual engineer system

42:06.840 --> 42:08.720
and was engineered in a way that could not interact

42:08.720 --> 42:11.120
with the rest of the environment in yeast

42:11.120 --> 42:13.720
was incredibly important, because now you can get data

42:13.720 --> 42:16.280
that basically says, if you can reconstruct

42:16.280 --> 42:18.800
what the logic of the circuit was, now we

42:18.800 --> 42:21.400
know that your method works well before there's really

42:21.400 --> 42:24.000
no way to know whether it was able to be constructed.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.960
You didn't have a gold standard.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.200
You have a gold standard.

42:26.200 --> 42:27.360
And so this was actually, I think,

42:27.360 --> 42:30.520
that there's an entire new sort of discipline

42:30.520 --> 42:34.320
in synthetic biology that will help systems biology

42:34.320 --> 42:36.600
dissect regulatory models.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.480
I think to elaborate on something

42:38.480 --> 42:41.040
so you'd said a moment ago about making mutations

42:41.040 --> 42:44.800
and selecting is brainless as easy, and I agree.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.840
Versus engineering and knowing something about the system.

42:47.840 --> 42:51.080
And I think it has to do with Darwin on the one hand

42:51.080 --> 42:54.000
and engineer on the other hand and having them work together.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.800
So if you make random collections of mutations,

42:56.800 --> 42:59.120
you do selection, you said it's brainless in the mindless.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.280
We can do that into where it works.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.280
However, if you understand the system,

43:03.280 --> 43:05.320
then you can make a smart library.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.920
So suppose you can make 10 to the ninth a billion different

43:07.920 --> 43:09.440
variations of something.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.480
If you make that billion variations randomly

43:12.480 --> 43:14.680
and you select among them for a desired property,

43:14.680 --> 43:17.040
you may or may not get a hit of what you want,

43:17.040 --> 43:18.320
even among a billion.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.400
However, if you know something about the system,

43:20.400 --> 43:23.440
the system being either the molecule or the entire cell,

43:23.440 --> 43:25.400
then you can devise a collection, same number,

43:25.400 --> 43:26.760
10 to the ninth a billion.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.400
But now that billion is sampling that region of space

43:29.400 --> 43:31.640
that's most likely to succeed.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.280
And that's incredibly powerful.

43:33.280 --> 43:36.120
So if you can now make a smart library,

43:36.120 --> 43:39.360
I'm using the word library to indicate a collection, right?

43:39.360 --> 43:42.400
You now make a smart library of 10 to the ninth variations.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.480
And you select in a Darwinian sense among those,

43:45.480 --> 43:49.600
then you've combined both the smarts of the engineering

43:49.600 --> 43:51.520
and the dumb selection of Darwin,

43:51.520 --> 43:53.480
and then you have a much better chance of getting it.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.440
If I go again, I ask the question of specificity.

43:56.440 --> 44:01.440
You are making libraries of proteins or sequences, right?

44:01.440 --> 44:03.720
In a particular area?

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
For what purpose?

44:04.720 --> 44:05.560
I'll give you an example.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.960
So for what purpose?

44:06.960 --> 44:08.920
Or give me an example.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.160
Well, an example is, so I mean, for example, Jack Schostak

44:12.160 --> 44:15.560
is a very well known scientist, Nobel Prize winner.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.200
He did some spectacular work where

44:17.200 --> 44:18.880
they made libraries of 10 to the 12th,

44:18.880 --> 44:22.080
a huge number of sequences, and selected among them

44:22.080 --> 44:23.560
for particular features.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.720
And they found them, because 10 to the 12th is a big number.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.040
And if you weed through that library,

44:28.040 --> 44:29.800
you'll find what you're looking for.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.160
In our case, we try to make designed libraries,

44:33.160 --> 44:36.120
and we'll make a library of 10 to the 6, much, much, much,

44:36.120 --> 44:37.320
much smaller.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.160
And it'll be much richer in terms of getting folded proteins

44:40.160 --> 44:43.400
or functional proteins, because you're

44:43.400 --> 44:48.160
pre-biosing a library to that part of space

44:48.160 --> 44:50.600
where you're more likely to get something that you want.

44:50.600 --> 44:54.320
Again, are you developing proteins of a certain type

44:54.320 --> 44:55.520
for a specific purpose?

44:55.520 --> 44:59.480
Or are you just doing it to see if you can do it?

44:59.480 --> 45:01.560
A 10-grained name.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.280
In our aim, what we're doing is we're

45:03.280 --> 45:05.840
trying to see what's possible.

45:05.840 --> 45:07.400
Let me give an example from something

45:07.400 --> 45:09.040
that happens in cancer all the time.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.800
So it's a very precise thing.

45:10.800 --> 45:15.240
So people do routinely, after Steve Ballage and other people

45:15.240 --> 45:18.840
introduce the technique, very large screens

45:18.840 --> 45:21.520
where they essentially knock out every single gene

45:21.520 --> 45:24.040
in a particular cell to see what are,

45:24.040 --> 45:25.560
because cancer, as Mark was saying,

45:25.560 --> 45:27.080
is a little bit less stable than normal cells.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.080
Actually, certain vulnerability emerge

45:29.080 --> 45:30.880
that are not normally in normal cells.

45:30.880 --> 45:33.000
And so they knock down every gene, and they say, OK,

45:33.000 --> 45:35.360
so we would gene kill the cell.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.480
If you do it out, it's an extraordinarily inefficient way

45:37.480 --> 45:38.120
of doing it.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.640
So one thing that we've shown, for instance,

45:40.640 --> 45:44.960
is that you can now study the regulatory model of the cell.

45:44.960 --> 45:46.520
So you reconstruct it from scratch,

45:46.520 --> 45:49.080
from a large number of observation of the cell.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.640
And when you interrogate these models

45:50.640 --> 45:53.760
with the specific question of how you would want to sort of

45:53.760 --> 45:58.320
abrogate the cell viability, they give you

45:58.320 --> 45:59.560
a set of recipes.

45:59.560 --> 46:03.800
And these recipes have typically a hit rate of about 60%,

46:03.800 --> 46:06.600
meaning that the best one was 100%.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.520
The worst one was 30% on average, we get 60% across,

46:09.520 --> 46:12.000
maybe 15 different tumor types that we looked at.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.520
So now, instead of having to shut down 24,000 genes,

46:15.520 --> 46:18.880
and then maybe you have most of the genes that actually

46:18.880 --> 46:21.560
will kill the cell that are shooting on the wheels of a car,

46:21.560 --> 46:23.760
they'll kill every cell, the one that are specific,

46:23.760 --> 46:26.320
maybe very, very small number, you now

46:26.320 --> 46:31.320
end up having a hit ratio of maybe 1 in 1,000

46:31.320 --> 46:36.040
to a hit ratio of now 60%, which is a huge change,

46:36.040 --> 46:39.440
and is exactly what Zane completely derived by,

46:39.440 --> 46:42.520
our ability to understand in a rational way

46:42.520 --> 46:45.240
what the cell is doing, mechanistically.

46:45.240 --> 46:47.880
So we still seem to have a PR problem, I guess.

46:47.880 --> 46:50.680
I think all of us are very pro-synthetic biology,

46:50.680 --> 46:52.920
pro-systems biology, but there's still,

46:52.920 --> 46:54.480
I think a large segment of the public

46:54.480 --> 46:56.640
that is frankly terrified, I guess.

46:56.640 --> 46:59.120
But I mean, what do you think are the ways we could,

46:59.120 --> 47:01.040
and we try to demystify it, so I'm

47:01.040 --> 47:02.640
going to make it more palatable?

47:02.640 --> 47:03.960
I thought that's how we're going to get

47:03.960 --> 47:05.200
mambarded in the question period.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
Yeah.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.200
OK.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.440
Well, yeah, I think one of the-

47:10.440 --> 47:11.280
Medical groups.

47:11.280 --> 47:13.760
I think one of the questions, you know,

47:13.760 --> 47:18.040
you can dance around some specific examples, not just-

47:18.040 --> 47:19.040
I'll give you one.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.040
OK.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.400
I mean, when you try to find a way to kill a cancer cell

47:23.400 --> 47:27.520
with an antibody, you have an antibody that carries a toxin,

47:27.520 --> 47:29.880
you will screen through artificial libraries

47:29.880 --> 47:31.680
that look like antibodies.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.080
They're made of antibody components,

47:33.080 --> 47:37.040
but they may not be real until you find one that binds tightly,

47:37.040 --> 47:40.320
will carry your toxic payload in to kill the cancer cell.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.280
That's how you do the business.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.920
So you're always- you know, these screens

47:44.920 --> 47:47.200
can lead to very powerful new drugs,

47:47.200 --> 47:50.960
and they're new proteins that may be unnatural in the sense

47:50.960 --> 47:53.800
of being seen before.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.960
So the analogy, there might be nuclear power.

47:55.960 --> 47:58.800
That we could use nuclear energy for a good, in that sense.

47:58.800 --> 48:01.560
But I'm not troubled by this, because I think it's

48:01.560 --> 48:05.240
the same issue that you have with nuclear power.

48:05.240 --> 48:09.680
If you call everything atomic, then you have the good and the bad.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.880
If you call everything synthetic biology,

48:11.880 --> 48:15.120
there will be some places we have to worry about it, right?

48:15.120 --> 48:15.800
So call it.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.560
If you throw everything into the same bucket,

48:17.560 --> 48:20.440
instead of saying, let's look at each of the kinds

48:20.440 --> 48:24.200
of specific applications and see, are there any that actually

48:24.200 --> 48:25.440
have problems?

48:25.440 --> 48:28.720
And the vast majority are either

48:28.720 --> 48:31.840
add to fundamental knowledge, or we'll add to a therapeutic

48:31.840 --> 48:32.840
armamentarium.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.440
And I think, again, the public, or at least the people

48:35.440 --> 48:41.120
I deal with when I'm answering questions as a journalist,

48:41.120 --> 48:44.400
I think an example you gave, or similar to one,

48:44.400 --> 48:48.240
would say, well, there is a drug out there called Enbrough.

48:48.240 --> 48:51.320
That works very well against rheumatoid arthritis.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.080
It is a synthetic antibody.

48:54.080 --> 48:55.840
In other words, it's a man-made antibody.

48:55.840 --> 48:56.280
It's the same thing, yeah.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.720
It's a man-made antibody.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.000
It was made in a laboratory.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.040
It takes something that was natural, which is a antibody.

49:04.040 --> 49:08.320
And scientists figured out a way of manipulating it,

49:08.320 --> 49:11.640
or creating it, in a form that it works specifically

49:11.640 --> 49:16.120
against a receptor in the immune system.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.840
In arthritis, the immune system is overactive.

49:18.840 --> 49:22.600
So this antibody turns the immune system down.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.600
Most patients given Enbrough don't know that.

49:24.600 --> 49:27.160
It's like me, when I get in my car,

49:27.160 --> 49:29.280
I don't really care how it works.

49:29.280 --> 49:31.800
I know that when I turn the key and put it in drive,

49:31.800 --> 49:32.920
it goes.

49:32.920 --> 49:34.920
All that other stuff I don't care about.

49:34.920 --> 49:38.200
So when most patients don't care that Enbrough does exactly

49:38.200 --> 49:39.720
what I just said.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.640
So in that place, people don't care about that.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.520
It's synthetic.

49:44.520 --> 49:48.840
But when we talk about creating new kinds of bacteria,

49:48.840 --> 49:52.440
new forms of yeast, or taking cells out of the body,

49:52.440 --> 49:56.000
like you said, manipulating it, and then putting it back

49:56.000 --> 49:58.920
in the body, people, I think, begin to have issues with it.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.720
Well, yeah, I know.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.040
I mean, for example, the experiments

50:02.040 --> 50:03.480
at the University of Pennsylvania,

50:03.480 --> 50:06.240
where they took lymphocytes out of patients

50:06.240 --> 50:09.200
who had terrible cancer and engineered

50:09.200 --> 50:12.440
a totally synthetic new receptor on their surface,

50:12.440 --> 50:15.040
and then those lymphocytes went and killed that cancer,

50:15.040 --> 50:16.800
cured those patients.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.720
That's about it.

50:17.720 --> 50:20.080
And stayed in that patient forever.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.120
So they're carrying this abnormal sequence forever.

50:23.120 --> 50:26.960
And my guess is quite happy to do so.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.080
So I think it, again, is important what it's for.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.640
The other point, which needs to be made

50:31.640 --> 50:34.600
and was made back at the origin of the molecular biology

50:34.600 --> 50:37.000
revolution when everyone was worried

50:37.000 --> 50:39.800
and actually shut down molecular biology, as you recall,

50:39.800 --> 50:43.280
for a few years, is that pretty much everything we make

50:43.280 --> 50:48.040
is not going to survive in the world,

50:48.040 --> 50:50.480
because it is not being selected for.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.000
It is not robust.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.760
Evolution has done a wonderful job

50:54.760 --> 50:57.760
of selecting out anything with any weakness.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.600
So pretty much anything we make, and this

51:00.600 --> 51:02.400
has been proved time and again, whether it's

51:02.400 --> 51:05.520
an unusual mouse, which was the original question,

51:05.520 --> 51:09.320
or these bacteria or yeast, will die in competition.

51:09.320 --> 51:13.520
So realistically, I think that the problem is small.

51:13.520 --> 51:14.920
But it's not nonexistent.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.560
And that's why I think we should say there will be times

51:17.560 --> 51:19.240
you should worry about it and times you don't.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.400
And I wouldn't just put it all under the one rubric, one

51:22.400 --> 51:24.760
umbrella of synthetic biology.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.920
I was saying that you just mentioned with those children

51:27.920 --> 51:30.640
what happens when those children's children,

51:30.640 --> 51:34.840
that they don't know long ago, doesn't affect the germline.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.560
So I would take even a step back.

51:36.560 --> 51:38.800
So the question is, you have to be very pragmatic about these

51:38.800 --> 51:39.320
things.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.560
So the question is, is there anything

51:41.560 --> 51:45.720
that has ever been possible to do in terms of stopping

51:45.720 --> 51:46.960
progression of knowledge?

51:46.960 --> 51:50.280
And that has never worked out.

51:50.280 --> 51:53.160
Could you have stopped understanding

51:53.160 --> 51:57.240
that you can break the atoms and that creates energy?

51:57.240 --> 51:58.640
To some extent, we could have prevented it,

51:58.640 --> 52:00.440
but somebody at some point would have done.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.120
And so I think that the more important

52:02.120 --> 52:04.360
to try and understand whether knowledge is good or bad,

52:04.360 --> 52:07.920
I think knowledge is neutral, is how we use knowledge

52:07.920 --> 52:09.680
that can become good or bad.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.080
So I think that this is a matter that is very important

52:12.080 --> 52:14.320
for legislation to take a stance.

52:14.320 --> 52:18.200
What are the things that are viable that we put safely into?

52:18.200 --> 52:21.520
So they have to be obviously a number of safety constraints

52:21.520 --> 52:23.800
that have to be satisfied, et cetera.

52:23.800 --> 52:28.280
But this is much more of a legislative matter

52:28.280 --> 52:31.520
than a matter of whether the knowledge producing

52:31.520 --> 52:35.400
exercise that essentially the scientific enterprise is

52:35.400 --> 52:38.520
undergoing should be arrested or continued.

52:38.520 --> 52:42.040
Because that's going to fail no matter why you try.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.680
There's never been one single situation

52:43.680 --> 52:46.520
where we've been able to stop the progression of scientific

52:46.520 --> 52:47.000
knowledge.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.640
So I would step ahead of that and try

52:49.640 --> 52:51.120
to figure out what we do with it.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.720
I think it's important the case where

52:52.720 --> 52:54.760
you have malicious intent, where you

52:54.760 --> 53:00.720
try to create warfare agents in this crazy world of ours today.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.440
That's possible.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.680
The only way to stay ahead of that is to just know more.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.200
That's the most important thing.

53:08.200 --> 53:10.840
Know more than the guys who are attempting

53:10.840 --> 53:14.000
to build malicious agents.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.240
The other thing is that we have to do a better job

53:16.240 --> 53:19.760
of educating the public, which is pretty dismally

53:19.760 --> 53:22.600
scientifically literate about a lot of these issues.

53:22.600 --> 53:25.000
I see it in the nuclear case, for example.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.960
It is by attaching a label onto something,

53:27.960 --> 53:30.920
you demonize it immediately, and you shut down the cortex.

53:30.920 --> 53:33.000
And nobody looks deeper.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.640
And we are in the realm where that

53:36.640 --> 53:38.400
could happen with synthetic biology.

53:38.400 --> 53:40.880
It's up to us, I think, as a scientific community

53:40.880 --> 53:45.120
to do better outreach and to educate the public more

53:45.120 --> 53:47.360
about the details of exactly what we're doing.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.560
How is it that we're generating these things?

53:50.560 --> 53:51.800
Where do they come from?

53:51.800 --> 53:54.480
What were we doing during dog domestication era?

53:54.480 --> 53:56.120
How is that different?

53:56.120 --> 53:57.440
Why do we love dogs?

53:57.440 --> 53:59.920
I mean, it was a really amazing experiment

53:59.920 --> 54:02.480
of human selection, right?

54:02.480 --> 54:04.640
And so I think those are the two things that,

54:04.640 --> 54:06.280
and I agree with Andrea, you can't really

54:06.280 --> 54:08.160
stop the pursuit of knowledge.

54:08.160 --> 54:11.520
And sometimes it'll be used for malicious purposes.

54:11.520 --> 54:14.080
The other aspect of it, I think, the bad,

54:14.080 --> 54:17.240
is the inadvertent problems that we might have

54:17.240 --> 54:18.520
with some of these things we engineer.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.400
We don't know how well they'll function.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.520
That's where, as a community, we have to set standards

54:23.520 --> 54:26.120
that, for example, the FDA will have

54:26.120 --> 54:28.160
to adopt about these therapeutics

54:28.160 --> 54:31.440
to make sure that we don't do harm on average,

54:31.440 --> 54:35.240
that we apply these methods to extreme cases

54:35.240 --> 54:38.800
where there is, for example, no other alternative.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.760
So these standards will evolve.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.240
And these things happen naturally all the time.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.480
I don't know if you looked at Aspen recently.

54:45.480 --> 54:48.440
There are no trees anymore because of the beetle

54:48.440 --> 54:52.320
infestation. The entire forest has been completely destroyed.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.120
And there was no genetic engineering at play.

54:55.120 --> 54:58.760
So these things happen in an organism

54:58.760 --> 55:00.920
or a microorganism getting out.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.400
The other one is like, I don't remember the name of this piece,

55:03.400 --> 55:06.080
but this plant that grows over vegetation

55:06.080 --> 55:08.520
if you go every US highway right now.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.520
Cousy.

55:09.520 --> 55:10.520
Cousy.

55:10.520 --> 55:11.520
Cousy.

55:11.520 --> 55:12.520
Cousy.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.520
Cousy.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.520
Cousy.

55:14.520 --> 55:15.520
Cousy.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.520
Cousy.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.520
Cousy.

55:17.520 --> 55:18.520
far Al715.

55:18.520 --> 55:19.520
lime b87aes.

55:19.520 --> 55:20.720
Non- grinded, huh.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.720
It's not resistant.

55:21.720 --> 55:26.620
How are you thinking about how we're looking at these Brand

55:26.620 --> 55:27.620
documents?

55:27.620 --> 55:28.620
And I also like that.

55:28.620 --> 55:31.840
And that counts as directed by the healthcare

55:31.840 --> 55:32.840
glycogen.

55:32.840 --> 55:19.080
So not as designed, Jackson, pawns over the

55:19.080 --> 55:40.080
plant council.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
Yes.

55:41.080 --> 55:44.100
And a partly, one term is linear.

55:44.100 --> 55:38.240
The bestCLE

55:38.240 --> 55:41.480
there was something implied in what you were saying.

55:41.480 --> 55:49.840
I was just putting out there the idea that the novelty is at a new scale.

55:49.840 --> 55:56.040
I was not going to put any value judgments on at all, but just to say that the possibility

55:56.040 --> 56:02.240
for one of the things I've talked about with students, it's not a question of if new forms

56:02.240 --> 56:04.240
of life are possible, it's when.

56:04.240 --> 56:09.240
It's when.

56:09.240 --> 56:12.160
That's something that one needs to think about.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.400
I sort of agree with what you two were saying before.

56:14.400 --> 56:18.280
I think transparency, right?

56:18.280 --> 56:24.120
You can't stop the progress of science, but in an attempt to prevent evil from happening,

56:24.120 --> 56:26.320
I think transparency is the most important thing.

56:26.320 --> 56:29.720
It's really better to know than not to know, because otherwise I would absolutely do it

56:29.720 --> 56:30.720
first.

56:30.720 --> 56:35.360
But I think when people do things behind closed doors in secret, then you've got to worry.

56:35.360 --> 56:39.720
We've seen that in societies forever, but when people do things out in the open, I have more

56:39.720 --> 56:41.520
faith that people will do good things.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.640
That's a standard of care in the bio-brick foundation.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.640
The idea is you want to build a house with bricks.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.160
You don't want to build a genome in an organ in the same way.

56:49.160 --> 56:51.720
All the parts, you can order them online.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.720
You can look up at what every piece is, every piece of DNA.

56:53.720 --> 56:54.720
It's all open.

56:54.720 --> 57:00.720
I wonder if you were also, though, up against a certain psychological orientation of the

57:00.720 --> 57:07.080
public who is not steeped in the science, where there tends to be an idealization followed

57:07.080 --> 57:10.800
by a de-idealization of new technology.

57:10.800 --> 57:16.720
I think the same thing happened with nanotechnology that was the promise of all these wonderful

57:16.720 --> 57:22.800
things that were going to take place in the world and transforming human life.

57:22.800 --> 57:27.600
And then there's the big, bad, gray goo that's going to the nanobots that are going to take

57:27.600 --> 57:28.600
over.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.600
I wonder if there's a...

57:29.600 --> 57:32.920
I think you make a really good point, because I think people are essentially scared of what

57:32.920 --> 57:35.520
they don't really understand in detail.

57:35.520 --> 57:41.360
When you do a graft and put a plant on top of another one, people understand that intuitively.

57:41.360 --> 57:46.400
They're not scared of it simply because they feel they have achieved that level of reassurance

57:46.400 --> 57:50.120
that is necessary to let that be in the back of their mind.

57:50.120 --> 57:55.120
When you start talking about very complicated operations, the manipulations of fundamental

57:55.120 --> 58:02.440
molecules of life, then people only grasp certain aspects of it, and it scares them to

58:02.440 --> 58:05.640
no end because simply they don't know exactly what's been done.

58:05.640 --> 58:09.000
And so I think that one of the things that really should be important about this, about

58:09.000 --> 58:15.200
demystifying this process is actually really have a major effort in education and in dissemination,

58:15.200 --> 58:20.280
because sound of these things can be explained in relatively simple layman terms.

58:20.280 --> 58:24.960
In a way that if you want to know about it, you can actually do it.

58:24.960 --> 58:28.320
I think there's the educational aspect and the fear that you referred to, but I also

58:28.320 --> 58:34.400
wonder whether you think that there's just a tendency that when the promises, especially

58:34.400 --> 58:41.080
when these new technologies are kind of hyped and people don't really know what the hard

58:41.080 --> 58:45.520
work is all about to develop the science, that there's a disappointment then when these

58:45.520 --> 58:47.960
things aren't forthcoming and so then there's tends to-

58:47.960 --> 58:53.040
But I think that disappointment currently constantly exists.

58:53.040 --> 59:00.440
The war on cancer, you know, 40 years ago, sequencing the human genome, where's all the

59:00.440 --> 59:01.440
great discoveries?

59:01.440 --> 59:07.280
Well, the truth is in the laboratories, the war on cancer has advanced and there have

59:07.280 --> 59:10.640
been breakthroughs, but cancer isn't cured.

59:10.640 --> 59:17.400
And the human genome sequencing has led to all the synthetic biology, but we're not

59:17.400 --> 59:21.720
buying anything in the grocery store, at least that I know, or the drug store as a result

59:21.720 --> 59:22.720
of it.

59:22.720 --> 59:28.000
And I think that kind of- that's just the nature of being human.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.640
I would like to make one pitch.

59:29.640 --> 59:30.640
I think that-

59:30.640 --> 59:35.480
One pitch as a retired working journalist, I mean I'm still working as a science writer,

59:35.480 --> 59:41.880
but not for a publication, is that I believe it's in the best interest of the scientific

59:41.880 --> 59:51.000
community, the pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology industry, to help educate the public.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.840
Listen, news people never think- we never think of ourselves as educating the public.

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.680
We think of ourselves as seeking the truth, but there are very few people who are as skilled

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.600
as I am in doing what I do.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.320
And it took me about 30 years to figure out how to do it.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:15.240
And I would argue that as the science gets more complicated, as these issues become more

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:22.680
difficult for the lay public to grasp that a group of writers who can translate science

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:27.280
into understandable, easily accessible, but an entertaining-

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:33.360
Not just writing, but video and film or whatever, and someone ought to get together because

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:41.760
the field of journalism in which those writers bubble up, I mean, there are schools that teach

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.000
science writing, but there aren't places for those people to have jobs.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.640
In other words, the world, the media world has changed so dramatically that it is in

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.160
a self-populating area.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.080
I would say in the 1950s and 60s that it was an explosion, and in other words, the creation

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.960
of the science writers, and it was around the space probe, but there was- I mean, think

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.960
about it.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.840
In New York City alone, there were six newspapers in each one of them had one or two science

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840
writers writing about the space.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.840
That's gone.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.920
Science writers are- Well, that's what I just told you.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
That's really disturbing.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:21.600
And without- and so what's happening, again, not to say, the new model is a nonprofit model.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:27.640
There are a number of nonprofit news organizations, investigative news organizations like ProPublica

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.760
that are being funded by nonprofit organizations, sort of like the Gates Foundation, the Kaiser

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:42.320
Foundation, Kaiser Health Foundation, underwrites the science news at PBS, and the Gates Foundation

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.400
is underwriting science news at NPR.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.400
And if those didn't exist, there wouldn't be science writing at those two places.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.800
So that's my pitch.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.000
What- What about science science-

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.680
Well, that's the New York Times.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680
Yes.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.680
What about Seattle?

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.680
I don't know.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.780
There's no science writers.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:06.720
I think there's even a bigger issue, which is not the- I think the scientific literacy

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:13.760
issue and our ability to outreach is very critical to all these issues we're discussing.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.820
But I think the fundamental challenge that I see now in modern progressive societies is

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:28.360
the lack of teaching of the history of science and technology to the population that is supporting

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.480
it with their taxpayer money.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.880
If you ask an average person on the street, you know, what all this money is going for,

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.520
they will tell you, well, they're curing cancer.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.280
They're using it to develop new nanotechnology, nanobots or whatever.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.360
But actually, what they don't appreciate is that the reason why their cell phone works,

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:56.040
which is a miraculous technology, the reason their laptops work, has to do with a very

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:04.040
long viewed investment in basic understanding of nature that came decades and decades ago.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.200
Microwaves, quantum mechanics, attempt to understand the fundamental working principles

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.760
of the universe that had no application whatsoever.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.000
These were just crazy passionate individuals who worked on specific problems because of

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.480
their taste in those problems, because of their passion, because of their love of understanding

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.480
the universe.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.360
That decades later, maybe even a century later, accumulated into a level of understanding

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.320
that allows us to now build whatever the hell we want based on fundamental rational principles.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.400
This is the history lesson that we fail miserably at communicating to people.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:47.440
And that's why the budget of the NIH, which supports all of biomedical research, is 130th

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.160
or 140th of the military budget in this country, which is an outrage for modern.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.800
Let me push it even further because I think this is really important when you say that

01:03:55.800 --> 01:04:01.600
there is this perception that you can actually find applied research and that applied research

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:07.600
will miraculously generate the microwave and the cell phone, etc.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.360
And unfortunately, everything that applied research does is to move our fundamental understanding

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:19.040
of how matter and biological matter works or inert matter works into something that is

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.480
then a lack of value.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.800
But if you don't have that knowledge, you don't push that knowledge forward, the well

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.760
will dry up and we won't be able to do any more applied research.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.680
So the idea that we now, everything has to be translational, everything has to be applied

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.800
is really a major problem because in the long run, we'll figure out that all these things

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.400
now are being translated and there's no more basic advancements that can be translated into

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.400
the data.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.560
And to follow up on that, what gets hit hardest in times of austerity are exactly the topics

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.000
we're discussing today.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.480
Systems biology, synthetic biology, approaches that are out of the box that are new, that

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:02.040
don't have a great track record because what does well is very well defined, almost no

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.240
risk proposals that attempt to move science forward incrementally.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:13.480
So you have a very well established field of traditional biology and if you send your

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.600
proposal to the NIH, your ability to get that funding for your proposal relates directly

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:24.960
to how close you are to existing inertia of knowledge that exists in your field.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:29.320
If you're totally out of the box, you get penalized and in times of austerity that's

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
even worse.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.720
So if our fields are actually suffering this innovation challenge, partly because of this

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:42.480
funding that I alluded to, but partly because what funding limitations do is to then, you

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.200
know, then it goes to the Congress and goes to the White House and these guys are saying,

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.480
we need you guys to have deliverables.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.600
You need to give us deliverables within a year or two.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.080
What have you done for us in the last 10, 20 years?

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.760
You promise all this stuff and you haven't delivered.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:03.080
So we want to make your science more applied, get, solve these specific problems that don't

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.920
understand that in order to have any chance of solving these complex problems, you need

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.960
a foundation of investment in basic research and that takes a long time.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:16.120
Part of the problem isn't the education of what you're calling the late public.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.320
Most of the problem is educating the scientist.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.920
There are very few scientists who know where their history came from.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:31.320
And, you know, if you take the average graduate student now, they will go back 10 years, they're

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.040
considering it a history lesson.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:39.080
And if you look, for example, if you want to go back to the cures for cancer, many of

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:46.640
those discoveries came out of the fundamental work by New Sline-Volehart on the fruit fly.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:53.520
This was to understand how a fruit fly cuticle gets patterned.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.280
Did all the work, worked out all the original pathways, all the stuff that you guys are working

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:04.280
on now, all those pathways were discovered by a set of genetic experiments that then later,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.440
30, 40 years later, led to those cures.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:15.280
If you want to look at atherosclerosis cures and the statins prevention, you have to go

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:20.520
back to 1948 for the first epidemiological scientific studies, which were really pretty

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:25.320
much curiosity driven about what relates to heart disease.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.640
So you can draw a trajectory.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.880
And that arrow in my experience is about 40 to 50 years if you're lucky if it's going

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.880
to work minimally.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.240
So I think the problem, though, is with the scientist as much as it is with the late public.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:43.480
And my holly kinase, the czechuan, old cell psycho, was old yeast.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480
I know.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.040
It was like, all those old little things started.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.960
How old the major target for doing that?

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.200
I went in the back to one thing that you said, because this issue, we were joking before

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.720
when you guys arrived, because I arrived a little earlier, that we always promised science

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.240
to solve a problem in 10 years.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:04.520
To some extent, Nixon's in 10 years is going to solve cancer then, Andy.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:10.160
For God's name, the director of the National Cancer Institute in 2000.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.840
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840
It won't go there.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.080
Andy, you promised the cure for cancer.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:17.080
Probably the new cancer.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080
15 years, etc.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.920
Every once in a while, we come up with another 10 years or 15 years.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.960
But the reality is that actually, the only problem is that cancer is cancer.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.560
Cancer is plural.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.400
And because a lot of cancers have been solved in the 10 years.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:35.240
For instance, I was in Basel when the day that actually they announced that Glevaik,

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.720
because in fact approved, FDA approved, and that actually solved one cancer completely.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.800
It was essentially 30% of the patient will erupt.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.880
But people that the next day were going to die in Glevaik, all of a sudden, they were

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880
saved.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:58.040
The same thing in the secular cancer, same thing for instance in her two breast cancer.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.520
I used to be one of the absolute worst tumors that you could possibly get.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.280
Now they react very well to trans-susima and on and on and on.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.680
So I think that we have, if you count the number of 10 years blocks, we've solved more cancers

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.560
than those number of 10 year blocks, it's just that we have discovered that this is such

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.640
a heterogeneous disease, both within the patient and across patients.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:25.560
You want to say something with it, because I was surprised that you said that every patient's

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.280
cancer is different from the next...

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.320
So the spectrum of genetic alterations that lead to more agencies and progression are

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.920
essentially different in every single patient.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.240
There's no two patients that have the same set of mutation.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.320
There are some recurrent mutation that occur in multiple patients.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.920
But those only tell a part of the story.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.040
In fact, we're now doing a span cancer study where we study, live about 7,000 patients

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.960
that we fully profiled.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.960
And you can see that these patterns of genetic alteration, they don't co-segregate on any

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.680
two patients.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.160
And so one, I mean a big initiative, I was actually part, I'm sharing the net, co-sharing

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.640
the next annual meeting of the ACR, the megastation for cancer research.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.960
And one of the big topics in that meeting and also one that we had as a forum in the

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.960
zero meeting is going to be the end of one study.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.320
It is studies, clinical studies that are going to have a single patient.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.240
And we have three patients in our Columbia and other places that have done these on a

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:23.840
genetic basis, we do it on a more assisted biology basis, where we're trying to solve

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.320
cancer just for one patient at a time.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:30.200
And not that we think that we're actually going to fight cancer one patient at a time,

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.880
but we need to understand cancer one patient at a time before we can understand what other

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.840
rules that can be generalized.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.840
And so this is really...

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.560
Understanding the genetics under the machinery...

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.600
Understanding how the genetics collapse into creating certain dependencies that are then

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.760
much more universal than the genetics.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.840
So the genetics is distributed, so for instance, in an example, many very, very bad cancers

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:57.800
have a mutation in the gene called KRAS or in other RAS genes.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.280
But if you have a mutation in another gene called NF1, you will have almost the same phenotype

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.280
because NF1 actually is the protein that allows KRAS to...

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280
It's called GTPAs...

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.800
I have this GPA's function.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.320
So whether you mutate one or the other, it really makes very little difference.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.960
And you can have very similar phenotype.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.920
And there's an entire set of protein downstream from that that will give you like B-RAP and

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.920
the vice-RAP for it.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.800
That will give you exactly the same, or very similar phenotype.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.160
This sent to me mutated differently in different cancers.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:31.600
For instance, in melanoma, you may have more B-RAP mutation in pancreatic cancer, 60, 70%

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.920
of the patient have KRAS mutation, but no B-RAP or very few B-RAP mutation.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.040
So the question is that if you actually go in and try to figure these things up one gene

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.560
at a time, you will really never be able to get the full story.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.120
And we know, for instance, KRAS is called right now an undrugable target, although many

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.600
companies, but assuming purely...

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.200
Nobody is probably trying to find the drug that will shut down KRAS.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.240
And so what we're left with is trying to figure out if this is the actual mutation, what is

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.920
the node in the cell that becomes the vulnerability because you have the mutation?

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:02.920
Okay?

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.920
Should maybe another gene.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:09.120
So for instance, right now we know that if you use in prostate cancer a combination of

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.640
a gene that inactivates protein called A-K-T through a virus, different mechanism.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.800
And in one, in another protein called MEC, the tumors that have KRAS mutation tend to

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.800
be respond well.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.560
But that may be just an observation, we work in patient, we don't know, etc.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.760
So I think this is exactly why I think we need to try and understand tumors on an individual

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.760
basis before we can now generalize because generalized has not really helped us, certainly

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.160
helped us in some cases, but we have picked up the lohanging fruits and now we're left

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.760
with all the other things that we don't really understand.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:42.760
Yeah.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.200
For example, it's so individual.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.760
I can't speak for any other group than mine.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:57.160
Our approach is what we call a molecular pathways approach, which is basically a systems biology

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.280
approach.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.280
Because I would agree entirely that it's very difficult to explain biology in general,

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.360
whether it be cancer or regenerative biology on the basis of one protein.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:16.920
But what we know is that the language of biology, the grammar of biology, is the pathway.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:23.320
The signal, the receptor, the transaction, nuclear transcription.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.800
And those pathways are conserved from fruit fly to man.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.080
Probably only a few dozen of these pathways.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:38.440
So for us, what we've taken upon ourselves to do is to try to dissect these pathways,

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.560
health and disease, and say not only what are the pathways that are perturbed, because

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.440
they can be perturbed, as you say, in many different places.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.160
But what are the vulnerable nodes where we could hit them with a drug?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:58.960
And so for us, we can play with all turning up, turning down all the different parts of

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.200
the pathway without effect.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:04.880
But then we'll find one node that may not have been ever known to be associated with

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.840
that pathway before and that we can hit.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.920
We know we can turn the pathway on or off.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.560
And that's the beginning of the process that takes 10 years after that to make a medicine.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:17.080
And it can get more complicated.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.640
I mean, I guess I see some more things in leukemia, as some drivers describe being in

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.440
other cancers, is that being like a cancer biologist today is being sort of like a molecular

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440
mechanic.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.680
And someone just comes to you and says, I have leukemia, which is the same as saying my

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.680
car doesn't work.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.160
And you just say, well, it could be because you have no gas in your car, you have no wheels,

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.920
you have no steering wheel, you have no headlights.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.600
It could be for any number of all these reasons that may actually intersect the same pathway.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.760
But just saying I have cancer can be very, very different for a lot of different reasons.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.840
And it's being like a mechanic makes it a bit, you know, you have to figure out which one

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.720
it is, I'd say, as what the job is.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:58.200
I think the way in which systems biology impacts that I think is one way, as we were

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.000
discussing about the molecular pathology and the pathways involved in disease.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.200
The other side of this, I think, which is a new revolution in medicine, the emerging revolution

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.760
in medicine, which is an attempt to approach medicine scientifically.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:18.200
Medicine has evolved through these really kind of old-fashioned approaches to physical

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.080
science and symptoms.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.880
And I think it has done a terrible job of doing the kind of data mining that we do on large

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.160
data sets that we get from the genome that have billions of pieces of information.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.520
So you go to the doctor, you make all these measurements.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:38.920
You do CBC, you have various physical science and symptoms written down in paper often,

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:45.720
not inputted into electronic form, in ways that could, in retrospect, much better define

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.600
a subtype of disease.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.040
So we lump things together because, you know, we're lazy.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.640
Because we've never had a molecular pathology, molecular basis of the pathology that's

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640
going on.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.400
And so, we have, we can have that molecular pathology, the other side of medicine, which

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.840
is to characterize and bin individual patients into pathologic classes.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:13.240
In order to then come up with the exact treatment that works for them based on this pathway,

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.440
and I said, that's going to be really revolutionary.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:23.200
I think in the field that's most, I think, most in need of that is psychiatry, where,

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.560
you know, a lot of the classification of disease states are still very old-fashioned

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560
and ossified.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.840
And I think that's a very exciting area where potentially the kinds of data that we're

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.440
getting on the systems level and together with existing quantification can lead to much

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.440
better.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.440
Molecular psychiatry.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.440
Yeah, I'm like, what's coming.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440
I just can't.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.440
I just want to direct that as one question.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:50.560
One other pivot point, I guess, to comment on the, to go back with the mechanic analogy

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.880
is that we, the humans are though difficult and we do have many, many genetic elements

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.640
that are not in mice, they're not in chimps, not in rhesus macaques.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.320
You know, there is evolution and keeps adding things and moving things around.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.440
And so one of the big challenges people say, well, I haven't just figured out cancer yet.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.200
We're still discovering how many genes there are in the human genome.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.040
You know, a lot of people think 25,000 or 40,000.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.200
The number is at least 55,000 vectorin counts and I can promise you we're just going to

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200
end up hiring.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.240
And so, you know, we're just, you know, getting, even within the scientific community, people

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.720
have figured out how many genes are there in the human genome is itself, you know, it could

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.600
almost prompt wrestling matches at conferences and I've threatened to tackle people who use

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.800
the number 25,000 genes and I'll do it again today publicly.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.760
But so it's complicated and we're still learning.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.760
Okay.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:36.760
So any questions?

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:50.360
I have to come up here.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360
Thank you.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.360
Breath taking.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.560
What comes to mind is a question of time management.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:01.000
You gentlemen have great goals, limited time.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
How do you want to spend your time and advise other people who might want to do this kind

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.080
of dissemination and research to divide their time most effectively?

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.080
Sleep less.

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:27.760
Well, I would say it would be fantastic if we were supported at a level that was commensurate

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:36.520
with the goals, ambitious goals that we have and the impact the economic and lifestyle

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:40.640
impact that these scientific methodology will have in the future.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.280
So that would be great because they'll free us from not writing grants.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.600
Because right now we're spending 30, 40% of our times writing grants to the NIH and that's

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.840
very, very painful.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:54.960
And nine out of ten of those, the funding right now is such that maybe the 10th percentile

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.360
roughly maybe works.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.360
It's worse.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.200
So maybe the, let's be optimistic and say it was the 10th percentile.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.600
That means not the number we have here, but suppose there are ten of us in this room writing

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:14.320
grants the NIH, nine of them or more go into the shredder and don't get funded.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.680
Then you go back and you spend however many hours or days it takes or weeks it takes.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:19.680
Months.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:20.680
And you write it again.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.680
So that's I think it's very hard to make progress when you're spending most of your

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.320
time writing grants that will go into the shredder and not get funded.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.040
And the ones that go into the shredder and don't get funded are not by people who don't

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.040
know what they're doing.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.960
They're by, hopefully we know what we're doing.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:35.120
People like us.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.120
And so that's.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.560
So it's very, it's very interesting because I spent, I did the opposite of what Marty is.

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.840
So I spent 16 years in industry then I moved to academia.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.640
And I realized when I moved to academia that I had to start writing grants which was a

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.960
completely foreign notion when you are in industry.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.360
And I realized that if the American industry worked on using the same metrics that the

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.920
NIH works there would not be an American industry because the idea is that what you

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:06.080
actually do in industry you have a track record and based on that track record you keep building

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.560
funded and your track record goes down and you stop getting funded and you shrink your

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.560
project.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.840
And then maybe you can grow again at a later stage when you come up with a new bright idea

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:21.800
in NIH funding concepts with through the grants your track record really doesn't count very

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.800
much.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:26.400
In fact most of these grants, old say, exception investigators you always go get top boost

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.040
but in the end what counts is whether somebody says, oh you're a proposal is too ambitious.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.600
Well you know whether it's ambitious or not.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:38.160
You should be based on the fact that whether you accomplish in the past funding cycle.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.160
And so I think that there's pretty much a general understanding that we need to rethink

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:49.160
a little bit the ways that sort of funds for research are managed and distributed because

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.280
and then maybe we need two different mechanisms.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.640
One for establishing investigators that we should be based mostly on track record unless

01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:00.160
you propose something completely new and one for junior investigator that really starting

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.440
together their career launch and it may be some extra boost in health.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.640
But the way the system works right now has become really, really very difficult to hold.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:17.200
And there's a series concerning here that's from friends all the time that we're going

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.320
to lose a generation of scientists that the next generation coming along people who are

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:25.280
in graduate school and doing postdocs now they look at us and they see that we spend

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.720
our time writing grants that don't get funded and get demoralized and they in graduate school

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:34.320
and postdocs say I don't want my boss's job I want to do something else because because

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.440
of the you know the tightness of the funding and how time is spent it's very demoralizing.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.800
But we're certainly bruising the American scientists because the American scientists

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:47.520
are essentially is a species that should go under protection because right now it's under

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.760
the... and there's only so many times you can say failure and makes me more determined

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.400
I guess it's...

01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:00.060
So Dr. Fishman had commented that the administration of a particular compound would not affect subsequent

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.060
generations.

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.160
Forgive me I missed it was it the compound related to emerald the drug that was being

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:11.560
done. No we were talking about the cells that were generated artificially using a construct

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.840
to target the T cells of a person to their own cancer.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:21.960
I'm curious if other members of the panel would feel confident making that statement

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.760
that it would not affect subsequent generations.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.760
It depends on the therapy there've been publications of gene therapy that has showed up in germline

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.560
tissue I mean I can't speak to this particular experiment but I think I know the literature

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:38.880
you're probably thinking that's only T cell so it shouldn't occur in this particular case

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:44.040
it should not as far as I know but these are not replicating viruses so you take out the

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.600
T cell you put in something when that T cell dies eventually it can't go into the virus

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.600
the...

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.440
Your concern about epigenetic...

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.440
Actually yes.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.440
Your concern about epigenetic.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.120
I'm just saying your PR problem really.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.400
So epigenetic interactions it's been intergenerational epigenetic interactions have been studied pretty

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.800
well in mice but very scarcely in humans that's changing with what's called the epigenome

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.840
roadmap project from the NIH is helping with that but most of that is not intergenerational

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.160
and in the short answer is I'd say you know people probably haven't looked at what the

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160
the...

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:21.320
For the audience I guess epigenetic just refers to changes that aren't to the DNA of ACGT

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.880
but when you have modifications to those the ACGNT that the letters don't change but their

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.200
state does.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.960
So epigenetic changes are heritable but I don't know if there's any evidence.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.360
No there is evidence that they are for example they are...

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.000
It's been proved best in the nematode worm where you can...

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.320
Something that happens in a grandfather worm can be passed on through two generations

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.920
epigenetically without any change in the sequence of DNA.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:54.040
There are suggestions from old studies but they're epidemiological suggestions of epidemiological

01:23:54.040 --> 01:24:02.240
effects of a grandfather's smoking in Scandinavia upon two generations later disease.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.240
Who was the diet wasn't it?

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.240
No the diet was...

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240
I think the diet...

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240
You may be right with this.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.240
No no no no no.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:12.840
The smoking in the grandfather affected the diet of the two generations, obesity rate

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.120
in two generations but that's of course epidemiological...

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.480
But there are diseases that are completely transmittent epigenetically so Wilms...

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.280
Wilms do much for instance is completely epigenetic disease.

01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:26.840
And fragile ex-syndrome is an epigenetic, red syndrome is an epigenetic but the actual

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.640
proof of the transmission has been passed on in the nematode worm.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.480
Well I ask my question in an attempt to address yours actually.

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:42.360
I agree the transparency is paramount as far as PR for your industry but hubris and trust

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.520
speaking as a member of the public is something will require.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520
Thank you for this time.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520
Thank you.

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.520
Thanks.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:56.680
I wanted to go back to the funding issue and ask...

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:05.960
So for you me this is a very eastern, US eastern group here and there are companies that are

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:08.360
printing DNA.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.600
You can order it online and get little vials of DNA.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:18.360
There are VCs funding this kind of stuff and so I'm curious whether you guys have gone

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.920
and looked for your funding not with the NIH or in Boston but out in Silicon Valley where

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.520
there is in fact a lot of money and the freedom to do really interesting stuff.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:34.360
The VCs tend to fund, I mean especially these days they tend to fund, they tend to be essentially

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360
bankers.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.360
What they want to do is to minimize absolutely every risk possible and assure themselves

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.760
that they're going to have a huge return on investment and then jump in.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:51.640
And also there are three to at most five years horizon and this is not the way the science

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640
can work.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640
Not all of them.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640
But the vast...

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.640
But the vast...

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640
Could people let us know the ones that...

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.640
Yeah, let us know.

01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.640
Are you representing one?

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.640
It comes to me afterwards, I don't want to take this over but seriously.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:07.960
Well, some of the VC firms that they're tied to the terms of getting that money are very

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:13.520
either onerous in terms of the timeline or what strings come attached to it there.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.920
But I've done some work with industry, just grants, just well let's say we're interested

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:22.200
in how perfectly you can take a single cell, amplify the genome and correctly genotype

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.840
it or work like that, that's industry funded.

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:29.040
There's definitely a lot of convergence of ideas and passion from industry and academic

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:34.000
and government researchers and clinicians but they rarely intermingle as much as they

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.880
should I think is what you're getting at.

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:42.160
The major issue is the goal directed nature of that transaction and that you can't impose

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.720
that expectation on scientists who are attempting to understand the system they don't know

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.200
much about, right?

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:56.760
You need to support innovative adventurous researchers to follow for five, ten years down

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.480
a path that they don't even know ahead of time and that it might not yield anything.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.760
And if you do enough of that, once in a hundred you will have the breakthrough of a generation

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.640
that will solve all your problems.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.840
You just don't know who that person is going to be.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.320
And that is not the kind of structure that industry receives will support.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:17.960
They just cannot quantify the risk and the ROI on that.

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:20.280
Let me give you some very practical examples.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:27.600
So we are all sort of asked by many confederate companies and biotech to work and collaborate

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.480
with them but the kind of collaboration that they always have in mind are the ones where

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.400
they look at something that we've already done and is really ready for a practice of

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.560
two years, two days ago we just signed a letter of intent to do a clinical trial in breast

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.160
cancer that was a complete novel cancer come from systems biology.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.240
So that's now being done.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.240
That's the kind of thing that they're looking for.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.000
They're not looking to find the research that led to that.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.520
So I think the problem is that that well will dry up and there are some companies like

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:59.480
for instance, Novartis and others that actually have also take a step back and have a lot

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.920
of collaboration on the CCLE.

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:05.800
This is the creation of this thing called the cancer cell line in CCLE.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:09.720
It's been one thing that Novartis has done and it's been transformational for the entire

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.320
community and it's truly a basic science effort.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:18.120
I wish there were even more dissemination of the data that came back from that to the

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:22.360
open community but what has already been put out there has been really valuable.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.680
And this has been collaboration with in the case the Broad Institute and other institutes.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.240
So there are examples like that but I would say 99% of the examples that we have are very,

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.240
very pragmatic.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.040
I'll talk to you ever once too.

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.040
That's great.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.040
I love it.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.040
If you have ideas.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.960
Crazy billionaires need more than they seem to be.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.000
That sounds good.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.120
So we're finding a lot of the end of ones for instance using that type of support.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.560
Well I agree with all the places where Blaine was placed.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:53.560
I think one was not mentioned as the drug companies themselves.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:57.640
I can't remember the exact numbers but if you look at their marketing budgets versus

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:05.320
their research budgets, it's opposite directions and you know just the goal of the ads on TV.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:10.160
My question is wouldn't that money be better spent supporting your guys research than marketing

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:12.200
and what caused this?

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.960
Why did drug companies go in this direction?

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.960
We may have on buy answers.

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:25.360
So I run research so I'm happy to have as much funding as I can get.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.360
But you have to remember that the companies, and I'm not defending it by the way, I'm just

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:35.240
explaining what I think happened historically because I'm not an expert in marketing.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.240
But these are publicly held companies.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:43.600
So these are companies that part of their job is to make money and to have a share price.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.240
It worked is the answer.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.040
In other words they were able to make money.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.320
So here's the history that's an interesting history and I think is quite educational in

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:54.400
terms of thinking how they should go forward.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:30:03.760
Historically, pharmaceutical companies could make a lot of money by making minor modifications

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.080
in a drug that was there.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.480
So if you look at the history of FDA approvals over years, there's only about 20 new drugs

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:16.360
approved a year which is very few considering the number of pharmaceutical companies.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:21.720
And only five, six of those are really new and would change medicine.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.240
The rest are relatively minor modifications.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.920
You say well how can a company do that?

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.480
And they did that because it worked.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:36.120
It was cheaper to do the experiment because you already knew that it worked when you got

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.120
into the clinic.

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:39.920
All you had to do was change the slight absorption.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.480
See, it's not that they're always unimportant changes but they're relatively minor.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:47.400
Also patents because the new patent is running out, they just modify and do the new thing.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400
Exactly, exactly.

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:54.920
But here's the problem now which is I think good in the direction that you're suggesting.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:00.080
As governments throughout the world, not just the United States, become more conscious

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:08.040
that the medical budgets are eating up a lot of their funding, they're pushing for novelty.

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:15.480
They're saying I don't really want to approve or not or to fund but pay back for something

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.280
that's not really innovative.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:22.880
So the pressures from the outside are now conspiring, I believe in a good way, to force

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.800
companies to do more innovative work and to have more breakthroughs.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:32.720
The only thing that's changing is I think that the notion of marketing which was driven

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:38.000
by just no sheer mass efforts, that's why it was so expensive, is what I think is going

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.480
to be not necessarily the future when you have a lot more that can be available online,

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.640
on the web, et cetera.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.120
So I think there may be a lot of forces conspiring to change that balance over time.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.920
At least that's my hope.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920
Okay.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:57.840
Councillor Hough, I mean the one thing that we've observed actually over the last few

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:05.720
years is that there's been a shift back towards pharmaceutical company and biotech engaging

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:12.360
academics, centers at a much earlier stage and essentially outsourcing some extent part

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.360
of the research.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.640
We do it a little differently.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.160
We have actually markedly expanded my basic science discovery group.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.920
So a very large part of what we do is fundamental pathway analysis and fundamental discovery,

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.640
publishable work, we have 100 postdocs.

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:33.200
We also interact a lot with academia so for my bed, which we don't know if it'll work

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:38.400
as this thing takes so long is that the more we discover fundamentally in the long run,

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.000
the more medicines it'll be.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Hi.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.880
I might be at the wrong place, I'm not sure.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.960
I think you all feel that way actually.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.560
I needed a new disc.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.040
Is there anything going on out there right now?

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:00.040
I broke my one bar six years ago and destroyed the disc.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.840
I can tell you a little bit about it right now, it's early stages in what's called regenerative

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.000
medicine.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.720
I certainly can't promise anything now, but there are two directions that you can think

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.720
about.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:20.640
One is that there are some studies that suggest that you have in your, so the problem is the

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.600
disc is distorted, the bone is distorted.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:26.720
So the question is can you regenerate normal tissue?

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:33.360
And we know we do have cells sitting in our spine and in our cartilage that can do that,

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.360
but they don't.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.840
So one set of groups are looking for drugs or...

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:38.840
Disparked that.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:39.840
Yeah.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.040
And the other of course are devices.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:47.280
And they are not an expert at all, but newer, smarter, better devices that are less destructive.

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:54.760
But you may have an extreme form of it, but everyone has degenerative disease in their

01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:01.440
spine, pretty much everyone over in middle age or over has started having problems with

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.440
it.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:05.120
We're not meant to stand upright, but it's a big problem.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.960
It's 94% of people over 40 that have these issues.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:10.440
Yeah, it's a huge problem.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:16.080
But I think now with our understanding of developmental biology and where the stem cells

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.680
come from, I'm not talking about the kind of stem cells you read about in the newspaper,

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:23.400
but the stem cells that sit in your cartilage or sit in your bone that could become new

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:24.400
cartilage.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:27.320
And there, I can't though promise when.

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.800
Has anybody working on the cure for greed?

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:30.800
For what?

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:31.800
A cure for greed?

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.800
Greed, I think we have to understand it first.

01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.320
That was the life of the psychiatry, I think.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.320
That's an important one.

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:42.160
I'm trying for that, thank you.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:48.880
Hi, first of all, thank you for extraordinary discussion.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.760
And to ask my question, I have to make a couple of points.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:02.840
First, if we always simplify, it's a matter as what was said here, it's like we believe

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.800
in evolution, but we don't like it.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:08.160
We like creation.

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:19.760
And second point is if we start to play and we create toys, we won't stop.

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:27.120
And at some point, it's a question from like your question when humanity will end.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:35.880
It's like at some point, we will be able to create something from scratch and probably

01:35:35.880 --> 01:35:38.640
in our image.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.920
So would we do this?

01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:49.920
Would we give these new creatures absolute independence and for a view?

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.040
Or we try to control them?

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.440
If they're sentient, absolutely.

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.520
If they're bacteria, it becomes a good question, I think.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.600
If they're bacteria that you made, I think there should be some statutory responsibility

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.920
for the thing that you created that has no sentience.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.240
I think it has to otherwise people will make them and say, well, I don't know.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.720
I'm thinking about something bigger, like in our image.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.720
Well, I know.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:15.800
You know, children, essentially, are made in our image.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.960
But we wait until they're 18, I guess.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:24.880
I don't give my children a few will.

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:25.880
They take it.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.880
But you don't have to give it.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880
They have to take it.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880
I'm not going to give it.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.400
This came up to when people talked about cloned or IVF babies, are they real people?

01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:35.400
Do they have souls?

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.000
Are these questions have come up before?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.400
I think without question, if they have somewhere between 45 and 48 chromosomes and they look

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.040
like all of us and they are what we call human, I think it's...

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.080
You don't even have to go that far.

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.400
I mean, right now, there's always been a problem.

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:58.040
Half of the sci-fi literature is about getting sentient organics that are actually non-biological

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.320
and they're silicon-based.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.480
I think that's probably a much earlier thing to come because now they're starting to achieve

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.520
some pretty dramatic computational power.

01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:11.040
And already, they're starting to...

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.040
This place I'm pretty scary characteristics.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.920
I can't speak for everyone, but I'd be happy to give more rights rather than to take them

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:17.920
away from entities.

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:22.480
But it's easier for control purposes, I guess, to take them away from things that are scared

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.480
of.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480
We love one last question.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.480
Great.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.480
Thanks for coming here today.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:35.920
My question actually comes around to the point that each of you come from different sectors

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.920
of the industry, private and research and whatnot.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.000
What are you doing or what is being done in order to have more of a brain trust and a

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.600
collaboration of discoveries?

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:55.000
I come from the technology sector, so we have a lot of cross-breeding in philosophies around

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.400
designing and architectures.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.360
But it's easy for us because technology's fundamentally programming is fundamentally

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.160
free.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:05.960
But it touches the funding issue of where that money comes from and then the private sector,

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.120
the profitability of the business model, and then actually the interest in the research,

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.600
right, the actual why are we trying to figure out these protein sequences or what it may

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.600
be.

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.160
So I'm just kind of curious of your opinions on that area and how you see the future of

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.160
that moving forward.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.160
So that's really a great question because if I've seen something that has been really

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:28.880
transformational right now, is that the old model of funding, this is I'm talking about

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:33.400
academia in this case, but the old model of funding where there was, it's called R01 based.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.000
R01 is a particular type of grants that funds an individual investigator.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.320
So, you know, Chris gets an R01 and then his labs does specific research that they propose

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:43.160
in the R01.

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:50.800
But there have been a number of now sort of, we call them networks of research centers.

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.920
One that was, for instance, participating in the last five years, we call cancer target

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.920
discovery and development.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.160
And this is essentially a group of centers.

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.320
We started with five centers and then it's been expanded because it was a very successful

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:05.120
experiment to 13 centers.

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:11.320
And we are essentially not just forced, but really encouraged to collaborate with each

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.320
other.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.480
And it's been one of the most extraordinary experiences in terms of having really valuable

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:22.120
incredibly productive collaborations that we really would never have thought of if we

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.880
had continued to do the research in a more traditional way.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.160
So I think the NIH is starting to recognize this and I think NSF as well.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.640
And so there is a trend.

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.160
I'm not saying that it should be only collaborative research that needs to be done, but finding

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.600
the right balance between the two is probably going to be really instrumental because most

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.960
of the especially things like systems biology, when we have a system biology paper today,

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.520
it has anything from people that did the mathematical model of people that actually

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:50.520
run the self-infrastructure.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:52.520
We would do the experimental validation.

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.200
We would do the mouse work, et cetera.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.200
And it end up being humongous team efforts, not just things that you can do in one lab.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.680
And so I think hopefully we're going to see more and more of these separate collaborations

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.080
and that will be very, very productive as we've seen them be.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:20.840
Thank you very much.

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:42.280
Thank you very much.
