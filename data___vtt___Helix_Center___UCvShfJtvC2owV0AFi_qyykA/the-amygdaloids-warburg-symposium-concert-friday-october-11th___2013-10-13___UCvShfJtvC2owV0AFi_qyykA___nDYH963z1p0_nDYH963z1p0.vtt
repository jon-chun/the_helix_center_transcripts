WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Coming.

00:02.000 --> 00:08.000
I guess you know we're the amygdalaids and we play music about mind and brain and mental disorders.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
So it's fitting that we're in this particular place tonight.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
And the program is we're going to play a few songs and play about 45 minutes, 50 minutes or so.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
But before each sort of suite of songs, which would be one or two songs together on a particular topic,

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
I'll just give you a brief kind of background about the intellectual background of the topic,

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
the historical kind of place that the ideas come from, that the song is sort of based upon.

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
And we're going to start off with a couple of songs about one of the deep problems in psychology, philosophy,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
neuroscience, psychiatry, all of the things that we know and care about, which is the mind-body problem.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
And you know this goes back to the ancient Greeks.

01:03.000 --> 01:14.000
We have ideas from the article at Delphi, for example, that the article said know thyself and a couple of millennia later,

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
Descartes tried to solve this problem by concluding that the only thing he could know was himself with certainty.

01:22.000 --> 01:34.000
But you know this becomes, with Freud this becomes more questionable because then we have some issues about how much of what we are is conscious and how much is unconscious.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
So a couple of themes will be explored tonight through the music is consciousness and unconsciousness and the automaticity of certain aspects of who we are.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
And we're going to start with a couple of songs that are more in the area of consciousness,

01:49.000 --> 02:13.000
in particular with the first one is sort of a tribute to Descartes and he goes like this.

02:13.000 --> 02:32.000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, but it is to be me, I see your eyes,

02:32.000 --> 02:49.000
and they're staring at me, they're sharp as knives, oh what do we see, you can't see, you can't see inside of me,

02:49.000 --> 03:14.000
inside of me there's a blade only I can be.

03:14.000 --> 03:36.000
My soul has passion, it's trying to feel, searching for desire, nothing is real, my will is weak, it's not very free,

03:36.000 --> 03:59.000
nothing to get hung about, oh that's just the deal, you can't see inside of me, inside of me, that's a place only I can be,

03:59.000 --> 04:14.000
you can't see inside of me, inside of me that's a place only I can be.

04:29.000 --> 04:58.000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, it's to be me,

04:58.000 --> 05:21.000
I think so I am, I feel so I must be, sometimes I don't know, but it is to be me, you can't see, you can't see inside of me,

05:21.000 --> 05:50.000
inside of me there's a blade only I can be, it only I can't be only I can beson

05:50.000 --> 05:55.240
All right, thank you very much.

05:55.240 --> 06:01.440
Tyler, you'd say something for a minute while I switch guitars.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.880
Well, about the mind-body problem.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.400
Yes, what's the next song, Joe?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
I forgot.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
Mind-over matter.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
Oh, mind-over matter.

06:09.400 --> 06:19.680
So, yeah, yeah, we have to, well, of course, in culture, we think we have a lot of control

06:19.680 --> 06:23.440
over matter, and we do in a certain sort of way.

06:23.440 --> 06:30.340
But there's always a longing for more and more transcendence, and so we think of ourselves

06:30.340 --> 06:35.640
as immaterial beings as the same times that were materially embodied.

06:35.640 --> 06:41.520
And so this next song is a little bit about the, that kind of conflict between the material

06:41.520 --> 06:43.520
and the immaterial.

06:43.520 --> 06:51.440
Yeah, and it's about the, you know, the longing that you can have for someone who's not here

06:51.440 --> 06:57.140
and sort of delude yourself into thinking you can overcome space and time and bring

06:57.140 --> 07:20.120
that person together with you.

07:20.120 --> 07:30.020
Mind-over matter.

07:30.020 --> 07:35.020
There's something I'm trying to do.

07:35.020 --> 07:46.460
I guess it's only physics that keeps me apart from you.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.860
Mind-over matter.

07:50.860 --> 07:54.260
Something I'm trying to do.

07:54.260 --> 07:58.100
Break down space and time.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.940
Be together with you.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.180
I'm trying to will you here.

08:05.180 --> 08:09.940
Mind you wherever you are.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.900
Locate your body or soul.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.980
Pull you in from afar.

08:17.980 --> 08:21.980
Are you still in my time?

08:21.980 --> 08:25.980
Have you slipped away?

08:25.980 --> 08:49.940
Have you gone forward to back living in another day?

08:49.940 --> 08:56.940
Where am I to be?

08:56.940 --> 09:03.940
Different continent around the sea.

09:03.940 --> 09:08.940
In the air, flying free.

09:08.940 --> 09:11.940
In a place, heavenly.

09:11.940 --> 09:21.940
No mound of space or time can keep you from being mine.

09:21.940 --> 09:50.940
I'm trying to keep you from being mine.

09:50.940 --> 10:00.940
Mind-over matter.

10:00.940 --> 10:10.940
There's something I'm trying to do.

10:10.940 --> 10:20.940
I guess it's only physics that keeps me apart from you.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.940
Mind-over matter.

10:24.940 --> 10:32.940
Something I'm trying to do.

10:32.940 --> 10:42.940
Break down space and time.

10:42.940 --> 10:47.940
Be together with you.

10:47.940 --> 10:52.940
Be together with you.

10:52.940 --> 11:02.940
Thank you.

11:02.940 --> 11:08.940
Now we're going to switch gears to the unconscious mind.

11:08.940 --> 11:16.940
We're going to do a couple of songs about how we aren't always quite aware of what's driving our behavior.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.940
There's a lot of stuff deep below the surface.

11:19.940 --> 11:23.940
The mind is below the tip of the iceberg.

11:23.940 --> 11:29.940
This is a song by Tyler called the automatic mind.

11:29.940 --> 11:35.940
The song is about the way the mind travels by itself on its own journey.

11:35.940 --> 11:40.940
You can not have any particular stimulus.

11:40.940 --> 11:44.940
You could be meditating in one of the main lessons.

11:44.940 --> 11:52.940
The first insight is about meditation.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.940
This is an ongoing meditation for me.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.940
The song is called the automatic mind.

11:58.940 --> 12:04.940
I still have to write beyond the automatic mind one of these years.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.940
Right now it's the automatic mind.

12:06.940 --> 12:11.940
It's got an interesting base part here.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.940
When you get there you'll write the song.

12:14.940 --> 12:15.940
Beyond.

12:15.940 --> 12:16.940
I get there.

12:16.940 --> 12:45.940
Okay.

12:45.940 --> 13:03.940
Welcome to the automatic mind.

13:03.940 --> 13:10.940
The door is open to remembered time.

13:10.940 --> 13:18.940
Images are conjured like a dream.

13:18.940 --> 13:29.940
Guiding actions on the waking screen.

13:29.940 --> 13:36.940
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind.

13:36.940 --> 13:45.940
As I think about and can't live without the automatic mind.

14:06.940 --> 14:14.940
We live in the automatic mind.

14:14.940 --> 14:21.940
Introspection opens in her eyes.

14:21.940 --> 14:28.940
It seems advanced yet hardly in control.

14:28.940 --> 14:40.940
Illusion of the will is comfort cold.

14:40.940 --> 14:46.940
Even though I realize it's still I feel so blind.

14:46.940 --> 14:56.940
As I think about and can't live without the automatic mind.

14:56.940 --> 15:02.940
Walk.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.940
Talk.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.940
Drink.

15:08.940 --> 15:09.940
Think.

15:09.940 --> 15:10.940
Think.

15:10.940 --> 15:11.940
Think.

15:11.940 --> 15:14.940
Think.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.940
Think.

15:18.940 --> 15:20.940
So

15:48.940 --> 15:50.940
You

16:18.940 --> 16:35.340
I realize it's still I feel so blind as I think about and can't live without automatic mind

16:39.340 --> 16:44.060
All right, so let me just take that opportunity to introduce Tyler Tyler as a

16:44.060 --> 16:48.940
Professor of Environmental Sciences and biology at NYU and he works on

16:50.540 --> 16:54.720
Atmospheric and issues and carbon and things like that anything else you want to add about that?

16:55.060 --> 16:57.060
That's good Joe. Okay

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
Daniela Schiller is a

16:59.980 --> 17:05.700
Assistant professor at Mount Sinai. She's a cognitive neuroscientist and she studies

17:06.220 --> 17:09.180
recovery from fear and processes in the brain that

17:09.180 --> 17:15.020
Allow people to get over fears through various ways anything else

17:16.980 --> 17:23.820
And she's also an award-winning storyteller for the moth organization and other places

17:27.180 --> 17:31.900
Amanda Thorpe is a world-famous international

17:33.180 --> 17:34.500
musician

17:34.500 --> 17:40.340
She hails from Derby, England Darby, I guess it's a doggy

17:43.340 --> 17:48.340
And we're very fortunate to have her with us and although she's not technically a scientist

17:48.340 --> 17:55.100
She does have a background in neuropsychology from University College London. So we count her as a part of the team

17:55.700 --> 18:01.020
Okay, and under the lamp, but she's a fabulous musician with a separate solo career all together

18:01.020 --> 18:06.500
With a bunch of CDs you can find her online at demandathorp.com, right?

18:08.980 --> 18:14.420
Okay, I'm Joe LaDue and I'm a professor of neuroscience at NYU and now we're gonna do a song called

18:16.300 --> 18:18.300
My Mind's up

18:20.420 --> 18:27.020
So my mind's eye is another one about the the way the mind plays tricks on us and does things that

18:27.020 --> 18:34.340
We don't always know too much about and if I can remember where this thing goes this time we're being good shit

18:34.740 --> 18:36.940
Okay, so take it away

18:36.940 --> 18:50.220
I can't think

19:06.940 --> 19:13.020
If you look into my mind's eye

19:16.300 --> 19:20.460
You would see the way that I cry

19:22.900 --> 19:27.860
Deep inside in my mind's eye

19:27.860 --> 19:35.340
We had love it was good

19:38.540 --> 19:42.700
You are there you understood

19:45.380 --> 19:47.380
Everything

19:48.420 --> 19:50.420
Yes, everything

19:50.420 --> 19:59.380
You can't always trust what you think you know can't trust what you believe

20:01.220 --> 20:04.060
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show

20:05.140 --> 20:07.140
It's simply disease

20:08.300 --> 20:14.180
My mind's eye you were mine my mind's eye was fine

20:14.180 --> 20:21.700
If you look into my mind's eye

20:24.860 --> 20:29.260
You would see the way that I cry

20:31.700 --> 20:36.700
Deep inside in my mind's eye

20:36.700 --> 20:45.980
You can't always trust what you think you know can't trust what you believe

20:45.980 --> 21:06.500
Sometimes your mind just puts on a show it's simply disease

21:15.980 --> 21:17.980
You

21:34.380 --> 21:39.980
My mind's eye you were mine my mind's I was blind

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
My mind's I was blind

21:43.500 --> 21:47.500
My mind's I was blind

21:47.500 --> 21:51.500
Oh, yeah, my mind's I was blind

21:54.500 --> 21:56.500
Thank you

22:01.260 --> 22:03.260
Okay

22:05.020 --> 22:11.180
Yeah, map your mind so we have automatic mind and my mind's eyes like part of the the problems with our

22:11.180 --> 22:13.180
psyches and

22:13.860 --> 22:18.100
But there's also a lot of joy being a human being as well

22:18.860 --> 22:26.420
Which I hope we're all smiling about every minute of the day. So this is actually some of our favorite song. It's by Joe

22:26.420 --> 22:42.180
It's called map of your mind. Okay, here we go

22:42.180 --> 22:54.660
Made a map of your mind I've charted my course

22:57.380 --> 22:59.380
I'm sailing deep inside

22:59.380 --> 23:13.900
Got the winds of force got the heat of your heart keep you from the cold

23:16.780 --> 23:23.740
Got the currents of will take me to your soul

23:23.740 --> 23:28.740
I'm on a journey

23:31.580 --> 23:33.580
Out of God

23:37.100 --> 23:39.100
It's a boy

23:41.340 --> 23:43.340
Had I knew I

23:46.700 --> 23:48.700
And excursion

23:48.700 --> 23:53.100
Of the inside

23:56.580 --> 24:02.740
It's a trip fuel by fire

24:02.740 --> 24:20.620
Made a map of your mind I charted my course

24:20.620 --> 24:34.540
Tailing deep inside I've got the winds of force got the heat of your heart

24:37.100 --> 24:43.700
Keep me from the cold got the currents of will

24:43.700 --> 24:48.300
Take me to your soul

24:51.500 --> 24:57.900
I'm just hoping I'll say it will be true

24:57.900 --> 25:12.220
That they'll take me straight to you

25:12.220 --> 25:17.420
Let the winds blow from the sweet

25:17.420 --> 25:21.420
Joe and I land

25:21.420 --> 25:28.420
My minds will meet

25:51.420 --> 25:56.420
Got the heat of your heart

25:56.420 --> 26:01.420
Keep me from the cold

26:01.420 --> 26:05.420
Got the currents of will

26:05.420 --> 26:10.420
Take me to your soul

26:10.420 --> 26:15.420
Made a map of your mind

26:15.420 --> 26:19.420
Take me to your soul

26:19.420 --> 26:24.420
Made a map of your mind

26:24.420 --> 26:29.420
Take me to your soul

26:29.420 --> 26:34.420
To your soul

26:34.420 --> 26:39.420
To your soul

26:39.420 --> 26:44.420
To your soul

26:44.420 --> 26:49.420
All right, thank you

26:58.420 --> 27:05.420
Now we have a song called Trace, which is something that people here have studied

27:05.420 --> 27:15.420
Of traces of memories, how they leave permanent records in the neurons and now the DNA and the neurotransmitters

27:15.420 --> 27:18.420
From having the memory, it's really there

27:18.420 --> 27:25.420
So it's a connection between our daily lives and the discoveries about the neurological systems of our brains

27:25.420 --> 27:28.420
The song is called Trace

27:28.420 --> 27:38.420
We're moving now into the memory part of the show, so we do a couple songs about memory

27:38.420 --> 28:06.420
You left a trace in my memory

28:06.420 --> 28:14.420
A permanent place in my synoptics

28:14.420 --> 28:21.420
Say the time feels all pain

28:21.420 --> 28:36.420
The time can't erase your place in my brain

28:36.420 --> 28:43.420
Days and nights they were so fine

28:43.420 --> 28:51.420
Months and years, maybe sublime

28:51.420 --> 28:58.420
Time stood still, while it flew on by

28:58.420 --> 29:24.420
Time ended when you said goodbye

29:24.420 --> 29:32.420
You left a trace in my memory

29:32.420 --> 29:39.420
A permanent place in my synoptics

29:39.420 --> 29:47.420
Say the time feels all pain

29:47.420 --> 29:55.420
Time can't erase your place in my brain

30:17.420 --> 30:46.420
Time can't erase your place in my memory

30:46.420 --> 30:57.420
You're a dominant trace, you won't erase your a dominant trace

30:57.420 --> 31:12.420
You won't erase your a dominant trace, you won't erase your a dominant trace

31:12.420 --> 31:20.420
You'll never be a ray

31:20.420 --> 31:26.420
Okay, thank you

31:26.420 --> 31:32.420
For those who are sort of neuroscience aficionados

31:32.420 --> 31:38.420
That song was written over a dinner with Richard Morris and Yadine Doudai

31:38.420 --> 31:44.420
Which Richard challenged me to write a song about Yadine's theory of the dominant trace

31:44.420 --> 31:48.420
Just in case you know what that means

31:48.420 --> 31:55.420
The next song is back to the other guitar, it's glue

31:55.420 --> 32:00.420
This is another song about memory

32:00.420 --> 32:09.420
It's about glue and the way that emotions can glue together your memories and make them stronger

32:09.420 --> 32:15.420
You probably noticed that most of our neuroscience songs are love songs

32:15.420 --> 32:20.420
That's the way we kind of tell the story of the brain

32:20.420 --> 32:30.420
We got us this on

32:30.420 --> 32:37.420
We can go behind you

32:37.420 --> 32:42.420
Turn that off for a second

32:42.420 --> 32:52.420
Shisha's a good scientist

32:52.420 --> 33:15.420
I saw you leaving, you saw me too

33:15.420 --> 33:24.420
You smiled at me, that's what you do

33:24.420 --> 33:32.420
I tried to follow, but you were gone

33:32.420 --> 33:39.420
Now I'm waiting, sitting home alone

33:39.420 --> 33:47.420
Keep thinking about your smile and eyes

33:47.420 --> 33:54.420
Can't believe your words were lies

33:54.420 --> 34:02.420
You made me happy, so very glad

34:02.420 --> 34:10.420
I can't forget those times we had

34:10.420 --> 34:17.420
There must be something in my brain

34:17.420 --> 34:24.420
There must be something in my veins

34:24.420 --> 34:33.420
There must be something in my brain

34:33.420 --> 34:39.420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

34:39.420 --> 34:54.420
I saw you go, I didn't know

34:54.420 --> 35:02.420
But you'd be there in the week or so

35:02.420 --> 35:10.420
It's so hard to realize in that

35:10.420 --> 35:17.420
I wasn't really aware you're right

35:17.420 --> 35:25.420
I dream about you, most every night

35:25.420 --> 35:33.420
I dream you're there, everything's alright

35:33.420 --> 35:40.420
I keep hoping, my dreams will come true

35:40.420 --> 35:47.420
But I'll wake up, right next to you

35:47.420 --> 35:55.420
There must be something in my brain

35:55.420 --> 36:02.420
There must be something in my veins

36:02.420 --> 36:09.420
There must be some crime over

36:09.420 --> 36:19.420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

36:39.420 --> 36:55.420
I keep thinking about your smile and eyes

36:55.420 --> 37:03.420
Can't believe your words were lies

37:03.420 --> 37:11.420
You made me happy, so very glad

37:11.420 --> 37:19.420
I can't forget those times we had

37:19.420 --> 37:25.420
There must be something in my brain

37:25.420 --> 37:34.420
There must be something in my veins

37:34.420 --> 37:40.420
There must be some crime over

37:40.420 --> 37:48.420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

37:48.420 --> 38:03.420
That keeps my memories stuck on you

38:03.420 --> 38:14.420
Alright now, so we've done memory and the mind body problem

38:14.420 --> 38:17.420
The unconscious, and now returning to fear

38:17.420 --> 38:22.420
We'll do a couple songs about that

38:22.420 --> 38:46.420
We'll play a couple more songs

38:46.420 --> 38:58.420
We'll play a couple more songs

38:58.420 --> 39:06.420
We'll play a couple more songs

39:06.420 --> 39:20.420
When the night is dark

39:20.420 --> 39:25.420
When the night is dark

39:25.420 --> 39:28.420
I lose my fear

39:28.420 --> 39:31.420
When the night is dark

39:31.420 --> 39:37.420
Never shed a tear, then the daylight comes

39:37.420 --> 39:45.420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

39:45.420 --> 39:48.420
And I have to fake

39:48.420 --> 39:52.420
When the night is dark

39:52.420 --> 39:54.420
Night is dark

39:54.420 --> 39:56.420
I feel so free

39:56.420 --> 40:01.420
When the night is dark

40:01.420 --> 40:07.420
I feel the peace, then the daylight comes

40:07.420 --> 40:15.420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

40:15.420 --> 40:18.420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

40:18.420 --> 40:32.420
It scares me away

40:32.420 --> 40:55.420
Night is dark

41:02.420 --> 41:09.420
When the night is dark

41:09.420 --> 41:14.420
I come alive

41:14.420 --> 41:18.420
When the night is dark

41:18.420 --> 41:22.420
I begin to thrive

41:22.420 --> 41:26.420
When the daylight comes

41:26.420 --> 41:31.420
It scares me away, the daylight comes

41:31.420 --> 41:34.420
The daylight comes

41:34.420 --> 41:37.420
When the night comes

41:37.420 --> 41:42.420
When the daylight comes

41:42.420 --> 41:46.420
It scares me away

41:46.420 --> 41:50.420
When the daylight comes

41:50.420 --> 41:53.420
When the night is dark

41:53.420 --> 42:03.420
I begin to thrive

42:03.420 --> 42:08.420
We're going to close things out here with a song

42:08.420 --> 42:12.420
That ends where we started, it's called the mind body problem

42:12.420 --> 42:16.420
And we're going to just solve that problem right here now

42:16.420 --> 42:23.420
Alright, ready for a little blues

42:46.420 --> 42:56.420
I've got a mind body problem

42:56.420 --> 43:01.420
I don't know what to do

43:01.420 --> 43:05.420
I've got a problem

43:05.420 --> 43:09.420
I don't know what to do

43:09.420 --> 43:14.420
My body won't you sew

43:14.420 --> 43:17.420
My mind says no

43:17.420 --> 43:22.420
You said you'd always love me

43:22.420 --> 43:27.420
To me it'd be true

43:27.420 --> 43:31.420
You said you'd love me

43:31.420 --> 43:35.420
To me it'd be true

43:35.420 --> 43:39.420
Well now you're gone

43:39.420 --> 43:43.420
I'm sad and blue

43:43.420 --> 43:48.420
Well now you're back

43:48.420 --> 43:52.420
You want me again

43:52.420 --> 43:56.420
Now you're back

43:56.420 --> 44:00.420
You want me again

44:00.420 --> 44:04.420
If I relent

44:04.420 --> 44:08.420
I lose in the end

44:08.420 --> 44:11.420
I've got a mind body problem

44:11.420 --> 44:16.420
I don't know what to do

44:16.420 --> 44:21.420
I've got a problem

44:21.420 --> 44:26.420
I don't know what to do

44:26.420 --> 44:30.420
My body won't you sew

44:30.420 --> 44:33.420
My mind says no

44:33.420 --> 44:44.420
I don't know what to do

44:44.420 --> 44:51.420
I don't know what to do

44:51.420 --> 44:58.420
I don't know what to do

44:58.420 --> 45:03.420
I even tried religion

45:03.420 --> 45:06.420
Get over you

45:06.420 --> 45:10.420
I even tried religion

45:10.420 --> 45:14.420
To get over you

45:14.420 --> 45:17.420
My body's not you sew

45:17.420 --> 45:21.420
Oh, oh, oh

45:21.420 --> 45:24.420
I've got a mind

45:24.420 --> 45:27.420
I've got a mind

45:27.420 --> 45:30.420
I can't get over

45:30.420 --> 45:33.420
I can't get over

45:33.420 --> 45:37.420
I can't get over

45:37.420 --> 45:41.420
Oh, oh, oh, oh

45:41.420 --> 46:00.420
I'm going insane

46:12.420 --> 46:17.420
I've got a mind body problem

46:17.420 --> 46:21.420
I don't know what to do

46:21.420 --> 46:25.420
I've got a problem

46:25.420 --> 46:29.420
I don't know what to do

46:29.420 --> 46:33.420
My body won't you sew

46:33.420 --> 46:39.420
My mind says no

46:39.420 --> 46:44.420
I'm going insane

47:09.420 --> 47:14.420
I'm going insane
