WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
In a kind of fertilizing way and today we have a wonderful group from very different

00:07.760 --> 00:13.840
backgrounds including two of my colleagues from the Helix Executive Committee.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.480
We are the group that brainstorm these programs and then try to organize them as best we can.

00:21.480 --> 00:30.120
The events today will be live streamed so both in terms of knowing that sometimes a camera

00:30.120 --> 00:36.200
will be on you and when you ask questions just remember this will be going out on YouTube

00:36.200 --> 00:38.680
and will be there into infinity.

00:38.680 --> 00:47.320
So it's just good to remember what you want to project into the world.

00:47.320 --> 00:53.800
And just before I mention and give the backgrounds of the participants I want to mention the

00:53.800 --> 01:01.680
two upcoming programs, the next two at least of the many that we're organizing.

01:01.680 --> 01:09.160
One is on January 19 on mathematical models and the mind and then on February 9 we will

01:09.160 --> 01:16.760
be having around table on status and what that means in society and in human relationships

01:16.760 --> 01:20.640
and animal and tribal systems.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.160
So two very interesting other events coming.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.040
Today we have an author, a filmmaker.

01:30.040 --> 01:38.800
We have a scientist and a professor of ethics, human and animal ethics and we have two of

01:38.800 --> 01:44.560
the members as I mentioned of the executive committee, William Grassi who is a historian

01:44.560 --> 01:52.560
of religion and a scholar and author and Gerald Hurwitz who is a psychiatrist and a professor

01:52.560 --> 01:56.840
of psychiatry at Columbia.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.320
And they're more familiar.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.920
I'm not going to read a great deal about their backgrounds.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.480
They're all online.

02:04.480 --> 02:11.640
And then Josh Aronson as I said is a filmmaker and he's currently after a very distinguished

02:11.640 --> 02:16.720
career of many different subjects and topics.

02:16.720 --> 02:26.000
Today in his current time he is making a film about the use of animals, specifically dogs

02:26.000 --> 02:29.960
in the treatment of veterans with PTSD.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.760
Does it have a title yet?

02:31.760 --> 02:33.280
To be of service.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
To be of service.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.080
As in service dogs.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
About service dogs.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Wonderful.

02:38.080 --> 02:45.520
And as I say he's done films in the past, some of which have been Oscar nominated.

02:45.520 --> 02:53.000
Such as the sound in the fury about children who were capable of getting implants that

02:53.000 --> 02:57.240
would allow them to hear when their parents were deaf.

02:57.240 --> 03:03.920
He's done one called Orchestra of Exiles which was about the formation of the Palestine

03:03.920 --> 03:11.280
Symphony and which then became the Israeli Philharmonic from musicians that were taken

03:11.280 --> 03:17.200
from the orchestras during the Holocaust in Europe.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.840
And a whole variety of different topics which I won't go into now but you can raise what

03:22.840 --> 03:26.880
you would like to include.

03:26.880 --> 03:35.160
And Elizabeth Hess is an author and she writes about animals.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.560
She's the author of two books on animals.

03:37.560 --> 03:45.240
The first lost and found dog cats and everyday heroes is a hardcore braised book.

03:45.240 --> 03:51.040
And the second Nim Chimsky, the chimp who would be human, was published by Bantam in

03:51.040 --> 03:52.960
2008.

03:52.960 --> 03:59.320
And that book was the basis for Project Nim, a documentary film by James Mash and right

03:59.320 --> 04:02.720
now she's working on two book projects.

04:02.720 --> 04:08.200
One on the American Pitbull Terrier, the rise of blood sports in the USA and the racial

04:08.200 --> 04:11.680
construction of bias against the dogs.

04:11.680 --> 04:18.400
And the second is a book about the first primate research laboratory in New York, Lem Sip, the

04:18.400 --> 04:26.720
laboratory for experimental medicine and surgery and primates associated with NYU.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.640
And she will tell you more of what she does.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.680
She's also the vice chair of the Animal Legal Defense Fund and a member of the advisory

04:33.680 --> 04:38.800
board of Out of the Pits, the first pitbull rescue in the country.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.640
She lives with two pitbulls saved from a dog fighting ring in Alabama.

04:44.640 --> 04:50.800
James Sirpell is the marine, more endowed chair of animal ethics and welfare at the

04:50.800 --> 04:55.160
School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

04:55.160 --> 05:02.000
He has a bachelor's degree in zoology from University College London and a PhD in animal

05:02.000 --> 05:05.720
behavior from the University of Liverpool.

05:05.720 --> 05:11.000
He focuses on the behavior and welfare of dogs and cats, the development of human attitudes

05:11.000 --> 05:15.560
to animals and the history and impact of human-animal relationships.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.760
He's published more than 180 articles and books.

05:19.760 --> 05:26.320
He's the author, editor, co-editor of several including animals in human society, chaming

05:26.320 --> 05:32.560
perspectives in the company of animals, companion animals and us.

05:32.560 --> 05:38.840
And he's the creator of a widely used canine behavioral assessment and research questionnaire.

05:38.840 --> 05:46.400
So you can hear all of the depth and expertise and the humanity of the group that is now

05:46.400 --> 05:50.160
going to begin their formal, informal discussion.

05:50.160 --> 06:00.240
Well, I thought downstairs it would be fun to start off by introducing a childhood pet.

06:00.240 --> 06:07.360
So I got a puppy from my bus driver in fourth grade and called it Buzzball.

06:07.360 --> 06:13.680
Buzzball was a border collie and this is in suburban Wilmington, Delaware.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.880
In the 70s, the dogs were never on leashes.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.840
They just wandered around the neighborhood.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.160
And Buzzball was never, never lived inside.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.920
She was mostly covered with ticks.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.760
But she would chase cars and we would clock her at like 40 miles an hour fighting at the

06:30.760 --> 06:34.560
heels of the car up and down the neighborhood.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.760
She was a remarkable dog and she was very, very loyal to me and she followed me everywhere

06:39.760 --> 06:43.400
on my walks and waited for me when I visited with friends.

06:43.400 --> 06:50.440
And there was that line from, it was the Garrison Killer or whatever, hoping to live

06:50.440 --> 06:53.360
up to my dog's expectations of me.

06:53.360 --> 07:02.000
But I've had many intimate animal relationships since then, including working with slaughter.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.240
So we can talk more about that, but I have a lot of philosophical indigestion when it

07:07.240 --> 07:12.720
comes to talking about the animal, human, continuum, the real tough thing.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Anyway, that's me.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
I'm William Grassy.

07:14.720 --> 07:20.160
I'm Josh Aronson and I love the theme of childhood pets.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.760
I have a different relationship though and it's interesting because the arc from my childhood

07:24.760 --> 07:30.800
relationship with animals and the relationship I have today having spent the last 18 months

07:30.800 --> 07:36.240
with veterans who have service dogs, it's quite an arc because I had traumatic experiences

07:36.240 --> 07:41.040
with pets because of my mother who was not an animal person at all, but somehow we could

07:41.040 --> 07:42.200
have pets.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.640
I had pets.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.680
The first one was a Springer Spaniel, the first one I remember that was powerful for

07:47.680 --> 07:49.040
me.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.800
And it was very much my dog.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.800
His name was Julius and we had a lot of Springer's and all of them named Caesars, different

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
Caesars.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.360
He was the first of them, Julius Caesar.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.920
And when I went off to college, came to New York to go to college and I said goodbye to

08:02.920 --> 08:07.320
my dog, thinking I'd come back, and I came home for the first semester and he wasn't

08:07.320 --> 08:08.320
there.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.520
My mother had him put sleep because he had some illness and didn't want to spend the

08:11.520 --> 08:16.360
money to send the vet or operate on him, whatever was necessary.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.960
Same thing happened to Fuzzball.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
Same thing.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
Yeah.

08:19.960 --> 08:20.960
College.

08:20.960 --> 08:25.680
Well, I was stunned that I wasn't even notified, that my mother never, it never occurred to

08:25.680 --> 08:30.400
me that there was a connection that might have been deeper than just some casual connection.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.000
But in fact, it was a very deep connection.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.240
Because like Fuzzball, I used to just go around with that dog on my bicycle and just,

08:36.240 --> 08:37.680
we were, he was my pal.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.840
And he was exterminated without my even knowledge of it.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.360
And she continued that kind of relationship with my pets very dramatically and I really

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
just locked it out.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
I did.

08:49.360 --> 08:56.160
And now I've been with many, many veterans who say that their dog has saved their life.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.560
The fact of having a dog in their life who's a highly trained service dog, the bond has

09:00.560 --> 09:02.240
saved their life.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.560
And so it sort of brought me back to its deep connection to these animals and I'm talking

09:06.560 --> 09:09.720
more about that as we get on with our conversation.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
Yes.

09:10.720 --> 09:16.600
I try to get very difficult actually to pin down one childhood pet because I always feel

09:16.600 --> 09:21.160
in my childhood as something like the sort of Gerald Darrow, my family and other animals

09:21.160 --> 09:25.160
kind of situation where there was a sort of endless dream of animals went through my

09:25.160 --> 09:28.320
household and I was usually the instigator.

09:28.320 --> 09:36.520
And my parents were remarkably tolerant of the snakes, the lizards, the rats, the mice,

09:36.520 --> 09:38.200
you name it, I had them.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.640
And I was profoundly attached to them so much so that I think when I got to about the age

09:42.640 --> 09:46.440
of 12, my parents decided there must be something wrong with me.

09:46.440 --> 09:52.880
It took me to an actual psychiatrist in from Harley Street in London.

09:52.880 --> 09:58.520
And he sat me down and he did, I forget what the test is called, where you draw a squiggle

09:58.520 --> 10:03.280
of his paper and your arm is to turn it into something more kind of comprehensive.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.360
And I saw this squiggle and instantly saw a gorilla in the shape.

10:09.360 --> 10:15.080
So I completed the design of the gorilla and he said, perhaps that's how you see me and

10:15.080 --> 10:19.400
I looked at it but he was a very fragile looking man.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.560
I didn't say anything.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.920
So yes, I've constantly been surrounded by animals, I'm still surrounded by animals.

10:27.920 --> 10:33.560
I can't imagine that somehow without them be very difficult.

10:33.560 --> 10:41.920
Yes, my first pets were two turtles, got them at the circus and my mother promptly named

10:41.920 --> 10:49.760
them gin and tonic and they lived for a month and they were flushed down the toilet at

10:49.760 --> 10:54.280
the end of their lives, something that was common.

10:54.280 --> 10:58.360
We threw the lime in.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.200
And after that, I had the same experience.

11:03.200 --> 11:11.520
Our first dog that the family had was a little snouser named Churchill and my mother bought

11:11.520 --> 11:17.440
at a gimbal's department store and I adored the dog, it was my dog, I walked the dog and

11:17.440 --> 11:21.840
I went away to camp one summer and I came back and the dog was gone.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.040
And I said, you know, where's Churchill?

11:25.040 --> 11:28.880
And they said, gone, we got rid of him, you went away?

11:28.880 --> 11:31.880
That was it.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.080
So I think this was a fairly common experience.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.720
Very interesting.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.720
Sherry?

11:37.720 --> 11:46.560
Oh, so I had one wonderful relationship with my dog growing up, Dusty Dog, who lived to

11:46.560 --> 11:51.840
the ripe age, I think of 17 or 18, so it was my entire childhood.

11:51.840 --> 11:57.440
And he was a mutt, it looked like a wheat and terrier but was very lively and extremely

11:57.440 --> 11:58.440
quick-witted.

11:58.440 --> 12:07.720
I had to say that I really did experience him as being a person, you know, because of his

12:07.720 --> 12:12.320
intelligence and his engagement with everyone, with everyone, not just with me.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.560
He was very lively.

12:13.560 --> 12:20.440
But one of the funny little stories about how clever he was was that we lived in this row

12:20.440 --> 12:26.360
home neighborhood in Philadelphia and there was a dog and he, a female dog and he, across

12:26.360 --> 12:30.960
the street and I think there were, because as Bill said earlier, a lot of dogs were off

12:30.960 --> 12:32.960
leash in those days.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.200
They were collection about seven or eight dogs outside.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.440
The house, like with his vigil.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.760
And Dusty went out to join him, but I think at some point realized that if he went around

12:43.760 --> 12:49.320
the back, went around the block and came around the back, he didn't have any competition.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.720
So whether or not that's what his thinking was, I don't know, or he just happened to

12:52.720 --> 12:53.880
come down that block.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.240
But we were wondering where is he, because all the other male dogs were out in front.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.480
And so we said, wait a minute, maybe he's elsewhere.

13:00.480 --> 13:05.520
And so he had camped out behind, so he had less competition there.

13:05.520 --> 13:12.320
Really incredible how much I think many of us when we engage with animals can see them

13:12.320 --> 13:13.320
as persons.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.280
There's something, there's a quality of personhood that some of them have.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.760
I'm not sure they all do, but I know that Dusty Dog did.

13:20.760 --> 13:29.600
And if we pay attention, my dog first year came in heat, was had by every dog in the

13:29.600 --> 13:33.640
neighborhood and had a litter of 12 puppies.

13:33.640 --> 13:43.560
And my mother, who's a farm girl from Manitoba in the Depression, she, we looked sort of

13:43.560 --> 13:50.240
the 12 puppies, took seven of them, put them right in a bucket of water and triumphed.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
And that was a lesson.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.720
I said, Mom, I'm sure you didn't drown me.

13:54.720 --> 14:00.160
But that's the kind of attitude, a farm attitude.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.480
And I admire that.

14:01.480 --> 14:07.160
We have 900 million dogs in the world, almost a billion cattle.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.080
We have these trucks, we start talking about food animals.

14:11.080 --> 14:19.840
And I read it statistic recently that 95% of the biomass, the mammalian biomass, is

14:19.840 --> 14:23.160
humans and are domesticated animals at this point.

14:23.160 --> 14:30.120
So 10 to 5% of the remaining biomass of mammals are wild animals.

14:30.120 --> 14:35.960
They must have missed the rats in New York City, I think, in that count.

14:35.960 --> 14:42.040
But anyway, we have grown so much, it's a big business.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
What did you say?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.040
It's 80?

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
85 million.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
85 million in the United States.

14:46.040 --> 14:55.320
And so these relationships with our animals, the ones we love and the ones we eat, are

14:55.320 --> 14:59.840
hugely complicated on so many different levels.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.160
But you're involved in training, you're part of the business.

15:03.160 --> 15:09.400
Because I'm extremely honest, since I'm trying to train veterinarians into the article.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.200
Which, you know, it sounds as though you wouldn't need to.

15:12.200 --> 15:16.880
But actually, I think a lot of veterinarians have a lot of difficulty with this.

15:16.880 --> 15:22.200
Because on the one side, they're required to represent their clients, who are people

15:22.200 --> 15:27.960
with who have interests in animals, which may or may not be beneficial relationships

15:27.960 --> 15:29.360
they have with their animals.

15:29.360 --> 15:33.440
And on the other side, they're supposed to be representing the welfare and the health

15:33.440 --> 15:34.440
of the animal.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.000
And frequently, those come in conflict.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.800
And it's a big problem for a lot of these young people, they're very conflicted.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
They don't know.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.800
Or they have their own love affairs with animals.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.600
They have their own love affairs with animals.

15:47.600 --> 15:53.280
And they face to the client who walks into their practice and says, I want you to put

15:53.280 --> 15:55.160
my dog down.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.080
And you know, the vet says, why?

15:57.080 --> 15:59.520
Well, I don't want it anymore.

15:59.520 --> 16:05.980
And curiously, my daughter who's of that says that the holiday season is a particularly

16:05.980 --> 16:08.560
big time for euthanizing animals.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.320
Yeah, it's true because people have given it.

16:10.320 --> 16:15.520
It's also great to go to a shelter to adopt an animal because within a month after Christmas,

16:15.520 --> 16:22.400
the shelters are full of extraordinary purebred, mixed breed, every kind of dog and cat that

16:22.400 --> 16:26.040
you can imagine from all that impulse purchasing.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
Yeah.

16:27.040 --> 16:31.560
Well, it's actually, these are often animals that have been around for a long time for

16:31.560 --> 16:32.560
some reasons.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.560
Not just impulse.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
No, they do.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.560
It's both.

16:35.560 --> 16:43.160
They give away the old one to get the new one or they buy the new puppy at the pet store

16:43.160 --> 16:50.920
and take it home and it proceeds to eat through their apartment and they don't want it anymore.

16:50.920 --> 16:51.920
Yeah.

16:51.920 --> 17:00.280
Well, it's amazing to me just hearing our stories about pets, how dramatic some of these stories

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
are.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.280
I mean, like intensely dramatic.

17:02.280 --> 17:08.000
Not too many other things that many of us experience, I guess, in our sort of everyday

17:08.000 --> 17:13.400
lives that are like these are really dramatic and intense stories about loss and killing,

17:13.400 --> 17:14.400
right?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
Yeah.

17:15.400 --> 17:24.040
Intentional killing and treating these beings as commodities, I guess, of some sort.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.040
Yeah.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.640
Well, let's get it on the table.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.640
I eat meat.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.440
Anybody else here eat meat around the table?

17:30.440 --> 17:37.240
So right here, I mean, you know, I've had the opportunity to see what slaughterhouses

17:37.240 --> 17:40.400
look like from start to finish as a young man.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.160
That's pretty scary.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.960
The smell and the noise and, you know, stays with you for a long time.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.240
What kind of slaughterhouse were you in?

17:48.240 --> 17:49.800
That was beef in Belgrade.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.600
That's a long story.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.400
That's pre-temple Grandin.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.400
Yes.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
So it was really sweet.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.400
Yeah, it was a small scale slaughterhouse.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
Yeah.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.640
And it's not that much better with Temple Grandin either.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.640
Really?

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
Really?

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
And it's more about...

18:04.640 --> 18:06.720
The film makes it look like it's a big improvement.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
It's more about it.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
I think her stuff is more about how to handle...

18:09.720 --> 18:11.440
No, the arrow more is documentary.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.200
How to handle the cattle.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.960
You know, the vets and the caretakers need to handle the cattle.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
Yeah.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.040
But on that too.

18:21.040 --> 18:27.360
So, you know, and then hand-milled cows in a summer camp in Vermont, for instance, stuff

18:27.360 --> 18:29.200
like that.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.680
So I always approach things from an evolutionary point of view.

18:33.680 --> 18:39.480
And so in the evolution of humans, meeting is incredibly important in the growth of our

18:39.480 --> 18:41.800
brain and the way that we live.

18:41.800 --> 18:47.320
And apparently our ancestors, whenever they arrived, they hunted all the large mammals

18:47.320 --> 18:52.880
to extinction in North America, South America, Australia.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.920
So, it's a really interesting question.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.920
And you know, how do we deal with that ethically?

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
You're the...

19:00.920 --> 19:01.920
You're the ethicist.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.920
You eat meat.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.920
How do you deal with your indigestion?

19:04.920 --> 19:05.920
Well, exactly.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.920
I mean, you talk about philosophical indigestion.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.600
It's an indigestible topic.

19:12.600 --> 19:20.640
This whole issue of how you deal with these moral conflicts in relation to animals.

19:20.640 --> 19:26.000
So... and it's becoming more intense now, especially with the environmental concerns

19:26.000 --> 19:30.760
of CO2 and beef production specifically.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.960
That's the no brainer at this point.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.640
This is becoming a huge issue and will continue to become a huge issue of going forwards.

19:37.640 --> 19:42.200
And you know, people now say, you know, if you eat beef, you're essentially destroying

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
the planet.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.480
You shouldn't be doing it.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.200
And I think that's...

19:47.200 --> 19:51.560
You know, it's adding an additional layer on the ethical concerns about the welfare of

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
the animals.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.640
It's adding this whole component of what are we doing to the planet.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.640
It's a very, very intense situation.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
And we're in a state of flux.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.680
That's the other interesting thing is that we've been...

20:04.680 --> 20:08.760
We're coming from a time when people really didn't think about these issues very much.

20:08.760 --> 20:14.240
And in a very short space of time, in a few decades, really, it's become a central topic

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
of conversation.

20:15.240 --> 20:21.360
Everybody is thinking about it and agonizing about it at some level.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.440
And it's...

20:22.440 --> 20:25.920
You know, these are interesting times we live in.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.000
It's interesting to see how it all pans out.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's the...

20:30.000 --> 20:36.200
If the scientists figure out how to culture flesh, animal flesh, without the feathers

20:36.200 --> 20:41.160
and the squawking and the legs, would that be something that you would eat?

20:41.160 --> 20:42.160
Oh, sure.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
I mean, you know...

20:43.160 --> 20:44.160
You'd welcome the...

20:44.160 --> 20:49.320
I eat all kinds of things, but I don't eat things where I know the animal has suffered

20:49.320 --> 20:51.400
to get on my plate.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.640
So I happen to live in the Hudson Valley.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.920
So I eat fresh eggs from my friend's farm.

20:57.920 --> 21:02.880
And I do eat, you know, sort of meat, you know, on that level.

21:02.880 --> 21:08.240
But there's no question that vegan food is coming and it's going to taste good.

21:08.240 --> 21:13.640
It's going to taste just like meat because that's what vegans want.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.520
You know, meat eaters think that's a contradiction.

21:17.520 --> 21:26.480
But already one of the biggest vegan burger meat producers has joined forces with Tyson

21:26.480 --> 21:31.800
Foods, which is pretty interesting because Tyson is one of the biggest exploiters of

21:31.800 --> 21:35.960
chickens, as I don't know if you've been in a chicken slaughterhouse.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.400
I've done that too.

21:37.400 --> 21:43.560
But they say if you go visit all those slaughterhouses, you can't still eat meat, but you're

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
far.

21:44.560 --> 21:47.320
But it's certain kinds I bet.

21:47.320 --> 21:51.160
I bet you want to know where the piece of meat on your plate came from.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.120
I never made a living in slaughterhouses.

21:54.120 --> 21:58.800
I mean, I visited them and at camp I was in charge of the...

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
Why did you visit?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.760
It was a long story.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.960
Probably a good one.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.720
And I lived on a horse and cattle farm.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.000
So I know what's...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.120
And I've worked on dairy farms for short periods.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.120
So I know what's involved.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.360
I know what it means.

22:14.360 --> 22:20.200
And for me, it turns out that I also spent two weeks at Auschwitz in 1983 teaching young

22:20.200 --> 22:22.640
Germans about the Holocaust.

22:22.640 --> 22:30.000
And the images of the slaughterhouse and the Holocaust, it's the same motif.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.920
And so at some level, if we can do this, if we can treat other humans like animals,

22:35.920 --> 22:38.640
is it moral to treat animals like animals?

22:38.640 --> 22:39.640
Yeah.

22:39.640 --> 22:44.400
And at one level, in which I get moral indigestion, philosophical indigestion.

22:44.400 --> 22:49.560
Well, on the other hand, I don't think utilitarian ethics works.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.760
So the greatest good for the greatest...

22:52.760 --> 22:53.760
Right.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.760
The Peter Singer.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.960
And I don't think the hierarchy of consciousness works.

22:57.960 --> 23:06.480
I think pigs that I've known, we had a pig at the farm in Pennsylvania where the kids grew

23:06.480 --> 23:12.400
up and certainly a lot smarter than the dogs, if we want to talk about animal consciousness.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.920
Pigs are very smart animals.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.880
They're just messy pets.

23:16.880 --> 23:17.880
They're just messy pets.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.880
You need a...

23:18.880 --> 23:19.880
I don't recommend it for...

23:19.880 --> 23:24.200
Well, I did see a woman with a small pot belly pig once in New York City.

23:24.200 --> 23:31.200
There's a bunch of pigs that are therapy animals, actually, in New York City, working.

23:31.200 --> 23:39.880
And I went to visit AIDS hospice facility in New Jersey with a therapy pot belly pig.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.800
And it was one of the greatest experiences of my life because when you're lying there

23:44.800 --> 23:50.200
feeling horrible and a pig walks into your room, I mean, what can you do but laugh and

23:50.200 --> 23:52.200
get up and say hello to the pig?

23:52.200 --> 23:59.960
And this pig brought so much laughter and joy and hilarity to this incredibly depressing

23:59.960 --> 24:09.080
place that the pig was a celebrity and welcome guest as often as this pig's handler could

24:09.080 --> 24:10.080
get there.

24:10.080 --> 24:17.760
And the pig was a registered Delta Society, as it's called Pet Partners Now, therapy animal.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.120
Well, what is a therapy pig?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.120
How are they trained?

24:21.120 --> 24:23.560
What is it that they do differently from a normal pig?

24:23.560 --> 24:26.160
Well, first of all, they're pot bellies, so they're small.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
They're not hogs.

24:27.160 --> 24:32.680
You're not getting a 400 pound pig out of your truck.

24:32.680 --> 24:38.480
But they're, you know, as you know, he just said pigs are smarter than dogs, so they need

24:38.480 --> 24:40.520
to be housebroken.

24:40.520 --> 24:46.880
They need to be socialized around humans, which is they understand a lot of language

24:46.880 --> 24:52.840
the same way I'm sure all of us talk to our dogs and they don't speak English, but they

24:52.840 --> 24:55.640
understand what we're talking about.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.420
My question was, is there anything different between just a regular garden variety pot

25:00.420 --> 25:03.640
billied pig with all these qualities and a therapy pig?

25:03.640 --> 25:07.680
Yeah, not all animals are suitable to therapy work.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.400
And everybody gets a dog and wants their dog to be a therapy dog now.

25:11.400 --> 25:17.680
And not all animal and to have a therapy dog or a therapy pig, the handler has is doing

25:17.680 --> 25:20.520
the therapy, essentially, not just the pig.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.160
And it's a team.

25:22.160 --> 25:25.600
And you're trained in the pet partners program.

25:25.600 --> 25:29.000
To be that team in how to relate to people.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.280
But the key to it is having an extremely well socialized animal.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.920
And you can really socialize pigs.

25:35.920 --> 25:40.960
I mean, I also went to a nursing home with a donkey.

25:40.960 --> 25:46.800
And it was also a great experience.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.800
The donkey wasn't so well housebroken, but the donkey walked into this nursing home like

25:52.800 --> 25:56.000
he had been visiting his relatives there for years.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.120
And he walked down the hall and he walked into each room, said hello, stood there for a

26:01.120 --> 26:05.480
few minutes, walked out, walked into the next room.

26:05.480 --> 26:09.680
And you know, there was one, you know, this was an amazing experience.

26:09.680 --> 26:14.680
We walked into this room and this woman was lying asleep in bed.

26:14.680 --> 26:21.720
And the donkey walked over to her bed and stuck his head over the rail and snorted loudly.

26:21.720 --> 26:24.640
And I thought, oh my God, this woman's going to have a heart attack.

26:24.640 --> 26:28.840
And instead she sat up in bed, threw her arms around the donkey and gave him the biggest

26:28.840 --> 26:30.640
kiss I've ever seen.

26:30.640 --> 26:33.080
And I said, you know, you seem to know donkeys.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.200
And she said, yes, my husband was a veterinarian.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.480
We had, I was around many farm animals.

26:39.480 --> 26:44.040
And this has been my best day here by meeting this donkey.

26:44.040 --> 26:51.120
I mean, there are all kinds of animals being used in interesting situations now.

26:51.120 --> 26:58.200
And I think the dogs are, you know, obviously they're the most common therapy animals.

26:58.200 --> 27:04.360
And dogs are so trainable and so willing to be our slaves in a sense.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.760
And affection slaves.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.960
Our affection slaves.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.720
And we ask them to be that often.

27:09.720 --> 27:10.720
But I think.

27:10.720 --> 27:11.920
And they enjoy it.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Some of them do.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
Most of the most part, they enjoy it.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
I think they do.

27:14.920 --> 27:21.080
I think, you know, I think dogs can be overwhelmed by people too.

27:21.080 --> 27:26.480
But you know, there are more challenging kinds of animals that are used in different kinds

27:26.480 --> 27:30.120
of therapy sessions, which are interesting.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.160
I mean, there's.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.720
There's horses are often used chickens.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.720
Yeah.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.720
Parents are used.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.720
Birds.

27:38.720 --> 27:39.720
Parents.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.720
Yeah.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.720
Parents.

27:41.720 --> 27:46.760
Chickens, somebody who has a flock of chickens who has them in a school situation said that

27:46.760 --> 27:53.440
the chickens were really good because it's very hard to get to know a chicken.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.720
So therefore, if you're an adolescent that has, for instance, a lot of trouble getting

27:57.720 --> 28:04.920
to know people having to work out a relationship with a chicken is quite demanding.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.960
And she insists that everyone get to the point where that chicken will get on their

28:07.960 --> 28:12.640
lap comfortably and relax with them.

28:12.640 --> 28:18.280
And it takes some time and the kids, of course, love the chickens.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.600
It never gave the chickens a chance.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.440
So it's the only animal.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.440
You still can.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.240
The only animal I didn't feel bad about killing.

28:25.240 --> 28:31.920
So Josh, in terms of the animals that the dogs that are used with the veterans, what

28:31.920 --> 28:33.560
are their specific qualities?

28:33.560 --> 28:37.080
I know some of them make the grade and some of them don't.

28:37.080 --> 28:43.240
Well, the qualities of the dogs that are selected to be finally allowed to be service

28:43.240 --> 28:47.800
dogs and are trained through completion have specific qualities.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.760
They're very good with children.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.880
If some dogs, no matter how much you train them, are not responsive to children or even

28:53.880 --> 28:57.000
are frightened of children, those are immediately disqualified.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.880
If a dog has problems in busy areas or noisy areas, they're immediately disqualified.

29:01.880 --> 29:06.880
If a dog won't get into a confined space under a table and stay there comfortably for a length

29:06.880 --> 29:13.640
of time, like a dinner, they're disqualified because apparently they can't train that out

29:13.640 --> 29:15.120
of them.

29:15.120 --> 29:20.240
So about 10% of the dogs they start with in service training are rejected.

29:20.240 --> 29:25.720
And those are great pets to adopt because they've been trained so much more than comfort

29:25.720 --> 29:28.200
animals that they're quite phenomenal.

29:28.200 --> 29:34.120
And you might even object to it because they're so responsive that they lose their dogness

29:34.120 --> 29:37.200
and because they're so connected.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.680
I was interested to hear you describe what the comfort animals are because it's a big

29:41.680 --> 29:45.120
controversy in the service dog world for two reasons.

29:45.120 --> 29:48.880
One, because people are getting fake service dog certification.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.000
And the reason they do that is they want to be able to travel with their dogs on airplanes.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.480
And of course, if you have a dog that shouldn't be on an airplane and there have been accidents

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
where dogs-

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
Which is most dogs.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
Right.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
But well-trained service dogs-

30:00.480 --> 30:01.480
Yeah.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.480
They're fine.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.560
They're fine on an airplane and they'll be under a seat.

30:04.560 --> 30:09.440
Even a Labrador Retriever will squeeze under the chair in front of you for two hours and

30:09.440 --> 30:10.440
won't budge.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.440
It's remarkable to see.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.440
Yeah.

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
And they come right out.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.440
So comfort dogs won't do that.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.320
And they get dogs and they try and do this with them.

30:18.320 --> 30:21.760
But what's important about the service, the distinction between the comfort dog and the

30:21.760 --> 30:28.160
service dog is all the things you said that a comfort dog has service dogs have, but they

30:28.160 --> 30:33.560
have something else that's profound, which is the ability to bond so completely one-on-one

30:33.560 --> 30:35.000
with their companion.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.480
So it's that bond that works in a very deep way to help them unwind the symptoms of PTSD.

30:42.480 --> 30:47.240
It's just an absolute unconditional love that those dogs feel one-on-one.

30:47.240 --> 30:52.080
Now any dog can feel that, but in a service dog when you combine it with so many other

30:52.080 --> 30:56.680
things, it's a profound therapeutic tool.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.680
It's very powerful.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.800
It's also used in prisons very effectively.

31:00.800 --> 31:07.040
So I'm interested in that we're so inhumane to the animals, but our pets humanize us.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.840
So what do you think's going on?

31:09.840 --> 31:16.080
Why is this relationship with a dog or a cat or a pig or whatever?

31:16.080 --> 31:21.320
What is it that we get from them that we don't get from other humans?

31:21.320 --> 31:28.240
Well I think in terms of service dogs with people, it might not just be veterans.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.680
It can be, you know, service dogs can be blind people obviously, it can be autistic children

31:32.680 --> 31:33.840
often get them.

31:33.840 --> 31:38.080
It's just complete absolute devotion and what they call over and over again you hear of

31:38.080 --> 31:40.800
unconditional love.

31:40.800 --> 31:45.040
And how powerful the unconditional love is in the veteran community is because a lot

31:45.040 --> 31:50.200
of veterans have moral injury as they call it today and they have a lot of guilt and

31:50.200 --> 31:54.840
shame which are two powerful things because they've both, they've been commanded to as

31:54.840 --> 31:59.720
19 year olds to do things that are morally reprehensible or they've seen things that

31:59.720 --> 32:04.280
are so awful that they're embarrassed and they're shamed and they're guilty or because

32:04.280 --> 32:09.320
their mates have died and what runs through their mind is what they could have done to

32:09.320 --> 32:11.800
save them for the next 30 years.

32:11.800 --> 32:16.160
So they are so filled with shame that they can't release it and they end up off in a

32:16.160 --> 32:20.640
shut-ins and all over the country there's hundreds of thousands of veterans who are shut-ins

32:20.640 --> 32:25.320
and they get a dog, a service dog and the dog has to go out.

32:25.320 --> 32:30.640
So the first step is he has to take responsibility for the dog and take the dog out and he learns

32:30.640 --> 32:36.040
very quickly that no matter what he does even if he's weeping, even if he's crying, even

32:36.040 --> 32:42.120
if he's having a nightmare, if he's just sullen, the dog will love him and the dog will lick

32:42.120 --> 32:47.760
him and wake him up from nightmares and be his companion and so gradually he lets go

32:47.760 --> 32:49.720
and starts to love the dog.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.920
It seems to be pretty consistent and it's the first time he's felt anything in a long

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
time.

32:54.920 --> 33:01.080
He or she because a lot of women vets have PTSD as well and that's a powerful mechanism

33:01.080 --> 33:05.280
and I once asked someone I was interviewing in the film who was a writer who knew a lot

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
about dogs.

33:06.280 --> 33:12.040
I said well why isn't the unconditional love of a spouse equally good for that?

33:12.040 --> 33:15.840
He said oh you know the old jib, you put your wife and your dog in a trunk of a car and

33:15.840 --> 33:21.840
close the trunk, open an hour later, who loves you at the end of an hour?

33:21.840 --> 33:23.840
They're excited.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
They're excited.

33:24.840 --> 33:25.840
They're excited.

33:25.840 --> 33:26.840
Yeah, you again.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.040
And your wife won't speak to you for two weeks, right?

33:30.040 --> 33:31.040
So it's...

33:31.040 --> 33:35.880
Well maybe more than an hour.

33:35.880 --> 33:41.040
So it's a very good story because that defines what unconditional love is.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.440
One of the things that happens in a lot of psychiatric illnesses and certainly PTSD is

33:45.440 --> 33:54.040
among them and I'm not sure if people generally appreciate this very much but it's that caregivers

33:54.040 --> 33:58.840
get rebuffed off and I mean there are efforts to sort of cheer you up or encourage you or

33:58.840 --> 34:03.280
it gets you to do something like get outside or get out of bed.

34:03.280 --> 34:08.800
You're met with a lot of pushback that could be in various forms and we might imagine some

34:08.800 --> 34:13.280
with PTSD could be irritable but there's all sorts of ways people can push back and their

34:13.280 --> 34:19.880
psychiatric illness keeps them from responding to normal social cues and the failure of those

34:19.880 --> 34:25.440
social cues often demoralizes the caregivers so the caregivers give up to some degree in

34:25.440 --> 34:29.960
withdrawal and they start to dismiss the sufferer.

34:29.960 --> 34:35.160
So a dog or another animal who's trained in this way just keeps it up.

34:35.160 --> 34:40.720
That does not, they're not as readily discouraged they take it if many more iterations and that's

34:40.720 --> 34:43.720
what you're calling unconditional love.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.000
You could mistreat me I still think you're great.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.040
And also they can't talk which I think is very critical.

34:49.040 --> 34:55.800
They can't ask you how you're feeling and they can't criticize the fact that you're

34:55.800 --> 34:56.800
not getting out of bed.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.800
You're still in bed?

34:57.800 --> 34:59.800
You know, you're not going to think that.

34:59.800 --> 35:07.720
The animal is it's empathic but it's not verbal and it's very critical.

35:07.720 --> 35:12.440
It's very clear though that the dogs can take on and understand your feelings and they are

35:12.440 --> 35:16.160
very empathic so if you're sad or you're sick or you're in bed and you're not getting

35:16.160 --> 35:20.440
out of bed the dog will come to you and will curl up with you will lick you will encourage

35:20.440 --> 35:24.560
you to and make you feel better because of course when you pet a dog or look into the

35:24.560 --> 35:30.920
eyes of a dog there's an oxytocin release and it feels good so it's a very very powerful

35:30.920 --> 35:34.800
connection that happens with a bonded animal and a human.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.440
My dogs love it when I'm sick in bed all day.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.560
They just love it they just curl up.

35:40.560 --> 35:45.680
But not to take it away from the psychological realm here I think the other big attraction

35:45.680 --> 35:51.080
to dogs I mean there's so many dogs in New York City now it's just mind-boggling and

35:51.080 --> 35:56.520
I think we live in a world where nature is receding certainly the wilderness is receding

35:56.520 --> 36:02.840
the waters are rising and I think having this dog in our homes with us is a bit of the wild

36:02.840 --> 36:08.200
literally and you know what I like about my dog is dogs are they're unpredictable you

36:08.200 --> 36:13.080
know I can't really always predict what they're going to do or what's going to happen when

36:13.080 --> 36:19.840
a stranger walks into the house or you know they take you out of the human realm and back

36:19.840 --> 36:27.200
to you know a wilder moment and bring that into your life and I think that's a lot of

36:27.200 --> 36:30.080
why city people love dogs.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.600
Is it connect the connection?

36:33.600 --> 36:34.600
Yeah.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.600
Yeah.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.040
And what do you ask on the test that you've developed?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.040
Oh.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.040
The canine behavioral assessment and research question.

36:43.040 --> 36:49.840
And actually came about because I wanted to collect behavioral information about dogs

36:49.840 --> 36:53.120
and they're very difficult to study because they live in people's houses and you can't

36:53.120 --> 36:57.320
go in there and say do you mind if I sit in your house and observe your dog.

36:57.320 --> 37:03.200
And so I was looking at the sort of psychological literature and I found of course the child

37:03.200 --> 37:08.880
psychologist had the same issue and very often they resort to question it so surveys which

37:08.880 --> 37:14.320
they give to parents and give to teachers and so on to ask them about the child's behavior.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.160
So I thought well let's develop something like that for dogs.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.880
So I did that and what do you ask?

37:20.880 --> 37:24.320
Well it's all sorts of questions about how the dog responds to different things in its

37:24.320 --> 37:31.280
environment and it tries to persuade the owner to be as unbiased as possible and their evaluation.

37:31.280 --> 37:36.840
So you don't say you know is your dog friendly you'd say how does your dog respond specifically

37:36.840 --> 37:42.120
when this happens like a stranger comes to the door or whatever and try and pin them

37:42.120 --> 37:44.440
down to very specific things.

37:44.440 --> 37:49.520
It's a hundred item questionnaire you can go online and complete it for your dog and

37:49.520 --> 37:54.720
it'll churn out a little chart that will tell you where your dog lies in relation to other

37:54.720 --> 37:56.240
dogs in our database.

37:56.240 --> 38:00.040
We have about 50,000 dogs in the database now so it's a good sample.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.480
So along what dimensions like how are they evaluated?

38:03.480 --> 38:12.040
Aggression, fearfulness, anxiety, excitability, attachment and attention seeking, separation

38:12.040 --> 38:15.200
related behavior, all the you know pretty much damage.

38:15.200 --> 38:19.600
Are you collecting the eugenics information too about the breeds?

38:19.600 --> 38:24.320
I am collecting breed information we're doing some very interesting research on breed differences

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
in behavior.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
Very interesting.

38:26.320 --> 38:31.680
Of course there are differences but I think dog breeds are a terrible thing.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.680
What do you mean?

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
I just think they're really terrible.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Why?

38:35.680 --> 38:36.680
The creative ones you?

38:36.680 --> 38:46.000
Just you know there's I think the eugenics is bad for humans it's bad for dogs and the

38:46.000 --> 38:47.440
more you mix things up the better.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.440
Dogs are not humans.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.600
I mean I'm talking about genetics.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.600
I know.

38:51.600 --> 38:57.440
But you know I mean I think it's not a bad thing to think of your dog as a person to

38:57.440 --> 39:05.400
treat your dog as a family member but they are animals and one of the things about the

39:05.400 --> 39:09.120
you know I think it's great that the dogs are being used so heavily with vets right

39:09.120 --> 39:12.720
now and for the PTS programs and I can't believe that the end of the year I must have

39:12.720 --> 39:20.320
gotten 20 direct mail pieces asking me to give money to programs for PTS dogs for vets.

39:20.320 --> 39:26.040
They're springing up like you know mushrooms after the rain everywhere in every community

39:26.040 --> 39:27.760
and there's a good reason for it.

39:27.760 --> 39:33.480
I think the reason is it's working and it's expensive but I would still ask the question

39:33.480 --> 39:38.240
why aren't we giving our vets health decent health care and now what we're doing is we

39:38.240 --> 39:43.160
have these private organizations throwing dogs at them when the hospitals are overcrowded

39:43.160 --> 39:48.920
they you know vets can't see doctors and and essentially we treat them not well.

39:48.920 --> 39:54.760
So I think we tend to use dogs as a kind of band aid for certain problems and we're

39:54.760 --> 39:56.800
using them for everything now.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.880
We're the kid average dogs, bomb dogs, drug dogs, PTS dogs.

40:01.880 --> 40:07.800
I mean we want dogs to do an incredible amount of work for us that we don't want to do.

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
Well the dogs.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.800
I'm not shy I agree with that.

40:10.800 --> 40:11.800
I don't think I agree with that.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.080
Actually the truth is also dogs like doing those things.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.840
How do you know that?

40:16.840 --> 40:19.400
Well you can see in their behavior in the way they respond.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.280
Maybe dogs like sleeping all day in front of the fireplace too.

40:22.280 --> 40:23.280
Well don't do.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.280
No they happen.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.680
I mean we have done studies of for example therapy dogs and whether or not you know

40:28.680 --> 40:33.640
that there's a welfare problem in using dogs for this purpose and actually every single

40:33.640 --> 40:37.440
one of the studies has been done to date suggests that the dogs are enjoying it.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
Like work.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.720
For them it's a much worse experience going to a veterinary hospital than going to visit

40:42.720 --> 40:45.120
people in a human hospital.

40:45.120 --> 40:49.360
So that kind of makes sense when you understand the dogs perspective because.

40:49.360 --> 40:55.080
From the human perspective not the VA perspective but the human perspective.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.480
The idea of therapy you're absolutely right the VA is letting us down the government is

40:59.480 --> 41:02.360
letting us let us soldiers down in every possible way.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.960
Not universally I mean the VA here in New York City is quite good.

41:05.960 --> 41:11.120
It's very good therapist in Los Angeles it's quite good but those are two out of thousands

41:11.120 --> 41:16.520
and many many soldiers that I interviewed just report horrible stories about the VA.

41:16.520 --> 41:21.280
But most of the therapists that I interviewed in most of the soldiers I interviewed found

41:21.280 --> 41:26.440
that the service dogs in conjunction with good therapy and the appropriate meds as a

41:26.440 --> 41:31.640
trio of approaches is a very good approach and of course there's something now called

41:31.640 --> 41:37.080
the mass program that this program is using MDMA working with vets that's been very very

41:37.080 --> 41:39.680
powerful and some of them also have dogs.

41:39.680 --> 41:44.240
So I think there's a lot of modalities of treatment for PTSD that are being utilized

41:44.240 --> 41:46.600
and the dogs are simply part of it.

41:46.600 --> 41:51.280
One of the vets said some people have crutches, some people have walkers, some people use

41:51.280 --> 41:52.440
drugs.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.920
I have a dog.

41:53.920 --> 41:57.320
It's a medical modality that's organic that works very well for me and has brought me

41:57.320 --> 42:00.600
back to life and a lot of people report the same language.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.360
Now that's the human perspective.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.360
It's a good thing.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.360
I'm not saying it's a bad one.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.560
And you're arguing maybe it's not good for the dogs from my observation.

42:06.560 --> 42:10.480
No for some of the dogs I don't think it is good and there are instances where dogs have

42:10.480 --> 42:11.840
been pulled away from vets.

42:11.840 --> 42:16.360
I don't know if you've come across any of them for your film because the dogs are considered

42:16.360 --> 42:17.360
endangered for the lives.

42:17.360 --> 42:21.800
I just want to point out that there are what 900 million dogs in the world right now and

42:21.800 --> 42:30.160
half of them are feral living on our trash in an urban environment or in a round human.

42:30.160 --> 42:33.400
And we're breeding dogs for these programs.

42:33.400 --> 42:40.600
And so our dogs in New York City are treated pretty well.

42:40.600 --> 42:46.160
One thing that I tell anybody who wants a dog is two are better than one because they're

42:46.160 --> 42:52.320
very social and to leave a dog alone in an apartment is torture for that dog.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.160
And we have a neighbor I keep telling her that the dogs always bark and I say two dogs

42:56.160 --> 42:58.000
are better than one.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
They don't get it.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.120
So that you know just a bit of practical advice.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.760
Dogs hate being left alone.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.840
In fact all species pretty much do.

43:06.840 --> 43:11.040
Now they're especially, I mean cat doesn't mind as much being left alone but better have

43:11.040 --> 43:12.040
two cats right.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.040
Yeah.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.360
Or cat and a dog or whatever.

43:14.360 --> 43:21.560
So just for the humanity of our pets just understand a little bit about their psychology.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.640
The truth of the matter is humans are mammals too.

43:24.640 --> 43:25.640
We have feelings.

43:25.640 --> 43:30.040
We're very social and humans don't like being left alone.

43:30.040 --> 43:36.680
And that's why one of the reasons why a dog and the person who's otherwise isolated,

43:36.680 --> 43:37.680
is so healthy.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.920
Not just mentally healthy, physiologically healthy in every way.

43:41.920 --> 43:47.400
So yeah don't leave your poor dog locked up alone in an apartment.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.400
Not a nice thing to do.

43:48.400 --> 43:54.400
I want to go back to a comment you made earlier Bill which was this I think rather bold claim

43:54.400 --> 43:57.640
that pigs are much smarter than dogs.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.000
I wanted to flesh that out.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.880
No pun intended.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.880
I want to know on what basis.

44:04.880 --> 44:05.880
I'm not challenging.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.320
I think it's a general thing to conversation.

44:08.320 --> 44:12.000
Which is how do we know what it means as a smart one dimension?

44:12.000 --> 44:15.560
Well no the barnyard would know that.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.640
What do they know about that?

44:18.640 --> 44:22.840
They also understand I don't think smartness is one one.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.920
No one makes that right.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.200
There's no IQ test for pigs or dogs.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.200
Right.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.200
Maybe not for humans.

44:31.200 --> 44:33.200
So anyway you can take what you want to.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.200
Discretts.

44:34.200 --> 44:36.800
They are very smart animals.

44:36.800 --> 44:37.800
Right.

44:37.800 --> 44:43.840
And you know again if we put the Peter Singer hierarchy of consciousness model of the ethics

44:43.840 --> 44:53.280
of animal eating then squid and octopus and cuddle fish would go right out the door because

44:53.280 --> 44:57.520
they are extraterrestrial intelligence.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.640
I'm interterrestrial intelligence that we barely understand but they're clearly very

45:01.640 --> 45:02.640
smart and sensitive.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.800
But again I don't think that Peter Singer version works.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.280
I don't think utilitarian ethics works.

45:09.280 --> 45:15.400
I think the only thing that can work in our relationship with animals is a sacramental

45:15.400 --> 45:18.080
attitude.

45:18.080 --> 45:21.440
And I say that somebody who's not really speaking is religiously.

45:21.440 --> 45:24.200
I just think that we eat animals.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.680
We sacrifice their lives.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.920
It's called the great Eucharistic law.

45:27.920 --> 45:33.760
Eat and be eaten, all of us will die and the animals will be recycled.

45:33.760 --> 45:42.520
And the greatest honor we do to the animals that we kill is to pay attention and be grateful

45:42.520 --> 45:47.840
and a little bit have some indigestion and about it.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.000
So that's how I frame it.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.160
Well not to mention kill them humanely.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.160
So this is where.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.160
And thanks then when you kill them.

45:56.160 --> 46:01.760
So this is again I think we're not the first humans to fall in love with our animals.

46:01.760 --> 46:07.480
I think that's been going on throughout human history and it's reflected in mythology and

46:07.480 --> 46:08.640
a whole bunch of other things.

46:08.640 --> 46:13.920
So and we're not the first generation to treat animals poorly either.

46:13.920 --> 46:19.680
No ever since the domestication of animals they've been treated poorly essentially.

46:19.680 --> 46:25.440
I mean they've been rounded up and used for work and excess ones have been killed.

46:25.440 --> 46:31.160
And along the way farmers and herders have fallen in love with those animals.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.160
Yes.

46:32.160 --> 46:39.160
And one of the things that they have to teach veterinarians is how to recognize bestiality.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.160
Right.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
As a problem.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.160
We don't like to talk about it but it's there in our culture.

46:44.160 --> 46:49.560
Well I think vets need to be allowed to love animals and save them.

46:49.560 --> 46:56.520
And one of the things about vet school is you take these live animals and you cut them

46:56.520 --> 46:59.680
up and you throw them in the bin or not.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.200
I mean are you Johns Hopkins is that?

47:02.200 --> 47:03.200
No.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.200
Oh you're so handsome.

47:04.200 --> 47:08.200
They don't do that to the section.

47:08.200 --> 47:14.960
No but they have a huge school of researching alternatives to using animals in all research

47:14.960 --> 47:16.720
including vet schools.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.320
At Johns Hopkins they do.

47:18.320 --> 47:24.880
I mean the vet schools are increasingly trying to avoid doing practice surgeries on live animals.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.840
So that's going out the window.

47:27.840 --> 47:32.040
It may be still present at some vet schools but it's no longer present at mine.

47:32.040 --> 47:37.320
But when I first got there it was they were doing that and in fact it was the students

47:37.320 --> 47:39.800
who eventually put a stop to it.

47:39.800 --> 47:44.560
In other words the students said enough we don't need this.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.320
And eventually the faculty were forced to agree.

47:47.320 --> 47:53.040
And there was a tradition within the faculty that we couldn't send these students out to

47:53.040 --> 47:56.680
practice veterinary medicine unless they cut up a live animal.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.880
That was where it came from.

47:58.880 --> 48:04.920
But now it's recognized that they can learn that stuff on the job under the supervision

48:04.920 --> 48:05.920
of a trained veterinarian.

48:05.920 --> 48:08.200
They don't have to do it in vet school.

48:08.200 --> 48:12.560
And we don't use chimpanzees for car crash studies anymore either.

48:12.560 --> 48:20.320
For instance or you know certain kinds of toxicology studies because we recognize snow

48:20.320 --> 48:23.560
because there's a law that says we can't.

48:23.560 --> 48:28.480
And we can give some surgery practice by taking them out to animal shelters where they help

48:28.480 --> 48:32.640
span newtors unwanted animals prior to being adopted.

48:32.640 --> 48:33.640
Tough stuff.

48:33.640 --> 48:40.840
So they're learning the job skills in a humane and respectful way I guess you would

48:40.840 --> 48:41.840
say.

48:41.840 --> 48:48.920
Elizabeth I was struck by your new book which is on cultural bias of having pets or animals.

48:48.920 --> 48:52.120
No no no this is a book on the pit bull.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.520
On the pit bull.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.040
Which is inherently a mixed breed and a mutt.

48:57.040 --> 49:01.760
So it's not a purebred dog unless you talk to the Brits and they think it's a Stafford

49:01.760 --> 49:03.720
Terrier and it's a purebred dog.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.720
But I thought I heard that there was a cultural bias.

49:05.720 --> 49:07.120
Yes I think there is.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.120
I mean.

49:08.120 --> 49:09.120
Two pit bulls specifically.

49:09.120 --> 49:10.120
Absolutely.

49:10.120 --> 49:15.000
One of the problems with pit bulls I mean they're more ordinances across the country

49:15.000 --> 49:17.400
saying pit bulls can't live in this neighborhood.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.400
They're not inherently violent dogs.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.400
They're not inherently violent dogs.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.080
They're not inherently violent dogs.

49:25.080 --> 49:33.000
There's just more of them because they're bred on every corner by drug dealers and whatever.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.720
But they're they you know all these pit bulls that are flooding every shelter across the

49:37.720 --> 49:38.720
country.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.160
People who understand these are the losers.

49:41.160 --> 49:46.240
These are the dogs that the drug dealers and the dog fighters don't want.

49:46.240 --> 49:53.000
Because to get one dog worth training to go into the pit for a fight you know you have

49:53.000 --> 49:54.720
to breed hundreds.

49:54.720 --> 49:59.640
Because most of them don't want to fight and you have to get a really gamey you know the

49:59.640 --> 50:05.600
kind of dog that's going to end up working for the police as a cadaver dog or a bomb

50:05.600 --> 50:10.640
dog or a because they're just so eat the police are using a lot of pit bulls now.

50:10.640 --> 50:16.280
Because if you get a really you know hyper gamey dog and you put them to work the dog

50:16.280 --> 50:19.080
excels it's got a lot of energy.

50:19.080 --> 50:24.320
You know training them to fight each other is an ordeal cost a lot of time and money

50:24.320 --> 50:27.040
and most of them won't do it.

50:27.040 --> 50:32.800
So it's just you know they're a huge problem in this country and when most people and most

50:32.800 --> 50:39.240
buildings for instance say no pit bulls here what they often mean is no poor people know

50:39.240 --> 50:46.360
people who might be associated with drugs or crime often people of color I mean the word

50:46.360 --> 50:50.760
pit bull kicks off all kinds of racial and economic biases.

50:50.760 --> 50:53.880
The same way the German Shepherd.

50:53.880 --> 50:55.120
German Shepherd used to.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.120
Right.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Right.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.120
Yes exactly.

50:58.120 --> 51:02.760
Because for me I have a bias but only because of what I've read in the paper.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.280
There are enough pit bull incidents and pit bulls going after someone or tearing someone's

51:07.280 --> 51:08.280
face apart.

51:08.280 --> 51:12.280
And you've read it enough so you think well it must be in their DNA that they're just

51:12.280 --> 51:13.400
aggressive animals.

51:13.400 --> 51:21.600
No there's no there's no aggression gene and there's a very well known dog trainer named

51:21.600 --> 51:28.080
Ian Dunbar who sort of was the first trainer to deal with quote dangerous dogs and when

51:28.080 --> 51:32.160
asked as he always says what is the most dangerous dog you ever met.

51:32.160 --> 51:38.040
He tells a story about an older woman who had a shit sue who she was extremely close

51:38.040 --> 51:43.440
to and the dog slept here every night and the dog was older around seven or eight years

51:43.440 --> 51:49.040
old and one morning she woke up and the dog she startled the dog and the dog woke up and

51:49.040 --> 51:51.800
bit the nose off her face.

51:51.800 --> 51:59.200
And you know that was the most difficult dog that Ian Dunbar ever worked with and that

51:59.200 --> 52:07.000
was a 15 pound shit sue and if you look at dog statistic bites at real dog statistic

52:07.000 --> 52:10.800
bites you will see that the pit bulls not the number one binder.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.800
It's little dogs.

52:12.800 --> 52:15.720
It's the little guys the thing is their mouth are so small.

52:15.720 --> 52:16.720
I still got a cigarette.

52:16.720 --> 52:20.080
They do so much damage but it's the little dogs that bite.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.520
Why is that do you think?

52:21.520 --> 52:23.080
Probably frightened.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.080
What is that?

52:24.080 --> 52:25.080
Probably frightened.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.080
Easily frightened.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.080
Yeah.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.080
Yeah.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.080
It's a soft defense.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.080
Interesting.

52:30.080 --> 52:36.200
I thought when I heard the description of book I thought it was about how because I

52:36.200 --> 52:41.680
came across this that culturally in the African American community you find less dogs in

52:41.680 --> 52:47.000
their homes and I asked and in my research and the work I've done in my film across

52:47.000 --> 52:52.320
the country there are very few African Americans that have service dogs several but amongst

52:52.320 --> 52:58.040
you know 95% were white or Hispanic and I sort of and I asked around and I finally these

52:58.040 --> 53:02.040
people these African Americans that had dogs sort of worked through them and I heard two

53:02.040 --> 53:03.040
different things.

53:03.040 --> 53:09.160
One was African Americans in America don't have dogs because police use dogs and the

53:09.160 --> 53:13.040
dogs in the inner cities are frightening to them because they're trained and aggressive

53:13.040 --> 53:19.040
so they're afraid of dogs and the African Americans said no that's not true anymore.

53:19.040 --> 53:20.920
It was in the last generation.

53:20.920 --> 53:24.240
So I thought your book was sort of on that topic because of the description of it somehow

53:24.240 --> 53:28.400
I didn't get what it was but I found it a very interesting subject because we were of

53:28.400 --> 53:32.280
course looking for African Americans and Hispanics to have in our film and it was hard to find

53:32.280 --> 53:36.120
them with service dogs.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.120
Have you found women?

53:37.120 --> 53:38.120
Yes.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.120
We have a lot of women.

53:39.120 --> 53:40.120
Yeah.

53:40.120 --> 53:41.120
A lot of women.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.120
Yeah.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.600
But of course the cause of PTSD in most of the women is rape.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.600
Not that.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.120
The statistic is horrific.

53:51.120 --> 53:55.000
The 90% of women in the military have been sexually harassed if not rape.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.120
90% have been harassed.

53:57.120 --> 54:02.480
Well, I'd want to pit bull or German Shepherd by my side in that case.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.480
Yeah.

54:03.480 --> 54:04.480
Yeah.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.480
Where that shitsu.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
Where that shitsu right?

54:06.480 --> 54:09.480
Of course I don't know how the shitsu would do against a leave sergeant.

54:09.480 --> 54:10.480
Probably well.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.720
There's a nose.

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
Yeah.

54:12.720 --> 54:14.720
But pretty high up though.

54:14.720 --> 54:19.440
Are there a different group coming into training to be veterinarians?

54:19.440 --> 54:20.440
Say that.

54:20.440 --> 54:26.280
Is there anything changing in the applicants to train as veterinarians?

54:26.280 --> 54:32.280
Well there's been a huge change over the last 30 or 40 years from men to women.

54:32.280 --> 54:39.600
So now we have the incoming classes of veterinary students in at vet schools are about 80% female

54:39.600 --> 54:41.520
and they used to be 80% male.

54:41.520 --> 54:45.760
So that's been a massive change and that's brought with it.

54:45.760 --> 54:53.600
I think many of these changes in attitudes to animals and a resistance to buying into

54:53.600 --> 55:02.080
the old sort of exploitation position and being much more compassionate and concerned

55:02.080 --> 55:06.200
about these types of issues.

55:06.200 --> 55:10.040
I mean actually you often hear a lot of the older male vets bemoaning this.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.640
Oh god do you know there.

55:12.640 --> 55:16.800
Feminizing the profession you'll hear them muttering darkly.

55:16.800 --> 55:19.400
But I think it's all for the good actually.

55:19.400 --> 55:26.920
Well my oldest daughter is a vet and so I followed her career at Penn.

55:26.920 --> 55:32.080
I think they have a hard, I understand that they have a hard time getting vets who want

55:32.080 --> 55:34.680
to do agricultural animals too.

55:34.680 --> 55:38.720
It's all either equine or small animal.

55:38.720 --> 55:45.320
And so if you it's more competitive than medical school in terms of getting accepted.

55:45.320 --> 55:50.480
It's a growing industry and if you do want to get into vet schools say you want to do

55:50.480 --> 55:53.040
agricultural animals because it's a leg up.

55:53.040 --> 55:58.960
There's just all the extension services around our lacking veterinarians.

55:58.960 --> 55:59.960
So hard life now.

55:59.960 --> 56:00.960
It's a very large animal.

56:00.960 --> 56:01.960
It's a very hard life.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
It's actually very dangerous.

56:03.960 --> 56:06.960
Dangerous and very hard work.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.920
You get no sleep.

56:08.920 --> 56:14.360
But it is unusual training because unlike human medicine you have to study multiple animal

56:14.360 --> 56:19.320
species and including reptiles and birds.

56:19.320 --> 56:22.720
It's a very interesting training.

56:22.720 --> 56:27.760
I'm interested in about what are, again always interested in evolutionary things.

56:27.760 --> 56:36.200
But I think you know for a long time in the West we thought animals was sort of machines

56:36.200 --> 56:42.000
and now we don't seem to acknowledge what's obvious that they have their sentient beings

56:42.000 --> 56:46.440
with emotions and feelings.

56:46.440 --> 56:54.920
And I don't know how much they think about the future but we're also starting to recognize

56:54.920 --> 57:03.280
ourselves as not a height of rationality but emotions are how humans communicate.

57:03.280 --> 57:11.040
And our feelings come prior to our rationality if at all.

57:11.040 --> 57:19.200
And so I just think it's you know in the human animal continuum how important is it

57:19.200 --> 57:26.200
to see ourselves as animals today and what does that help us in terms of dealing more

57:26.200 --> 57:29.840
effectively with each other and the world around us.

57:29.840 --> 57:37.320
I mean I'm just another animal on some level.

57:37.320 --> 57:41.800
Well that seems to have been the sort of history of the ideas.

57:41.800 --> 57:46.200
Well we have this idea that we started off with this massive gulf separating humans from

57:46.200 --> 57:52.400
animals and it was really a sort of philosophical gulf and that gulf is sort of slowly being

57:52.400 --> 57:58.000
narrowed and now we allow some animals to kind of jump across the gap and join us as

57:58.000 --> 58:01.240
family members but not all of them.

58:01.240 --> 58:04.360
But they represent sort of ambassadors as it were.

58:04.360 --> 58:11.960
They represent that other group of animals out there and I think that's an ongoing process.

58:11.960 --> 58:19.840
But at the same time you know if you look at the discourse on animals historically yes

58:19.840 --> 58:25.400
at the level of educated people there was all this talk about how animals were completely

58:25.400 --> 58:30.120
different from humans and they didn't have souls or they didn't do mechanisms or whatever

58:30.120 --> 58:33.600
but at the popular or folk level I don't think people ever believed that.

58:33.600 --> 58:38.440
I think they lived with animals and they knew that animals were sentient and had feelings

58:38.440 --> 58:42.080
and would respond in particular ways in the same way a person would.

58:42.080 --> 58:48.080
So I think there's always been this not only well that sort of tension between the people

58:48.080 --> 58:55.080
who actually knew the animals and the intelligentsia who were kind of pontificating about animals.

58:55.080 --> 59:00.360
Well fairy tales are filled with snakes who know and fox who know.

59:00.360 --> 59:05.320
And people who turn into animals and animals that turn into people and you know the gulf

59:05.320 --> 59:09.080
is obviously very permeable.

59:09.080 --> 59:16.400
And children as we've heard some of the major emotional development is you know loving the

59:16.400 --> 59:21.600
stories about animals even not just the animals around you.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.080
People girls with horses.

59:25.080 --> 59:31.120
Well it seems what is important about trying to understand as best we can what sort of

59:31.120 --> 59:39.480
consciousness or experience animals have to inform how we treat them.

59:39.480 --> 59:44.040
I think there's one one of the larger arguments against let's say slaughtering animals is

59:44.040 --> 59:46.920
they are conscious or they have some sentient being.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.720
I'm not saying that's a complete argument but that's something that is brought to bear

59:50.720 --> 59:53.800
what we talk about how we treat animals.

59:53.800 --> 59:59.400
And I find it interesting that when you ask when I've asked people to talk about whether

59:59.400 --> 01:00:06.440
you think animals have sentions or not and that across a wide range of animal types.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.720
There are those I think you feel well absolutely there's no data about it how could you see

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.120
it otherwise.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.480
And there are others who still persist in thinking in this sort of Cartesian way that

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:23.600
animals are missing something that humans have that makes them less than.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.840
And earlier Betsy was really interesting because I used the word personhood to describe my

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.080
relationship with Dusty.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.440
I meant it in a sense because we didn't dress him up or we didn't wear human clothes.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.120
We didn't kiss him on the list which I find disgusting but anyway we didn't treat him

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.080
like he was a person literally.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:51.720
But I had a sense of I know it's an interesting question when we try to decide whether animals

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.320
have any degree of consciousness is it possible that we are projecting our own consciousness

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.680
onto them.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.240
Right so could that be playing some part because there are those who think in terms

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.800
of human consciousness leaving animals aside that we're actually projecting our own sense

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.880
of consciousness you know this is sort of a dentist's view of consciousness sort of it's

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.240
an illusion that we are putting together a lot of sense data and other thoughts that

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.400
go from our heads and then we say we have a certain personhood we are imposing that.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.040
I'm not it's not a view I subscribe to but it's out there.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.040
So the question I think is also with animals how much of what we view as being the sentience

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.800
of animals out a projection of ourselves and I'd even extend to my experience of Dusty

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.400
as a person because in some ways I look back and think of him as being like a human and

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.520
I thought well he didn't talk.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:48.800
Why don't I have this persistent feeling that I had that sort of the verbally intimate

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
relationship with us.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.000
Well this is the thing we draw the line between humans and animals at language and what that

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.760
means is complicated.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:05.800
And I think that the issue of personhood is to a large extent a legal issue because corporations

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.560
have personhood and animals are objects in the eyes of the law.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:15.960
And I think you know I don't think that all of us especially those of us sitting around

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:21.520
this table or in this room need to be convinced that animals are intelligent that they're

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:27.920
sentient beings that they're capable of loving us and vice versa but the law needs to be

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.320
convinced of that because animals have very few protections and New York state is one

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.400
of the worst states in the country as far as animal cruelty laws go.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:47.480
And so and I let my dogs kiss me in the face but I probably shouldn't.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:54.800
Actually you're much greater risk of infection with a human bite than you are of a dog bite.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.760
So yeah there you go.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760
Kiss your dog good night.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760
Yes absolutely.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:01.800
I've trained all my family members not to bite any more.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800
But anymore.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800
Right.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.880
People all know about the non-human rights project and Stephen Wise who's trying to go

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.280
through the courts to get the status of personhood for animals.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:19.320
And in fact last Friday he just argued for an elephant which is in the Bronx Zoo.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:25.680
An elephant ironically named Happy who's been alone in a cage for I don't know how many

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.360
years 40 years or something insane.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.320
And he's trying to go through the courts to argue that the elephant should have the status

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.240
of personhood that elephants cannot that it's torture for them to be alone.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.280
What you're saying about the top two dogs or two cats.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.720
More so for elephants.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:50.160
More so for elephants and this this elephant has one acre to move around in which is very

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.440
small for an elephant.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:58.000
And it had a companion the companion died companion was never replaced.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:07.480
And the case was argued on Friday there was a writ of habeas corpus in a previous lower

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:13.760
court and it went through and the case is now going to be moved to the Bronx.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.720
So I have a problem with invoking human rights language.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.640
I have no problem with the welfare of the elephant and we have an obligation to promote

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.640
that.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:31.440
Well first off we have to recognize that human rights are a human invention and they don't

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.200
exist in nature.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.880
I mean and it's moral progress and I'm in favor of that.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.120
But there's a history of human rights and it's a useful fiction just like money is a

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.960
useful fiction right.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.240
So and I'm in favor of that discourse but I think when we take it into our domesticated

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:57.840
animals or wild animals or fish I just think it leads to enormous confusion because now

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.200
we're taking things that are different and we're treating them the same.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.640
And so some of the fill this is why I always have indigestion philosophically.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:13.240
So so and I don't think animals have the same obligations to us that we have towards them.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:17.080
So if a bear wants to maul me and eat me or whatever that's that's what bears do.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.640
Do we have any obligation to that bear?

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:27.160
Yes on another level yes we do and but not to the individual so much as the group.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:34.240
So I think species extinction is much greater problem than the than the suffering of any

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.720
individual wild animal.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.120
And I think the way we treat wild animals versus domesticated animals like so.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120
But if we can't.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.760
We're in sheep get get pink eye and it's well within our possibility to treat the pink eye

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:55.480
in national parks or whatever when they get pink eye they fall off the cliff and die.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.960
And so there's a question should we be intervening in the care of wild animals and and this

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.080
is where you know we got to maybe let natural selection do its thing.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.480
I don't know.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:14.400
But that's you know how much are we responsible for habitat for sure.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.240
But on an individual level I know I have a different problem with that I think.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.480
So anyway that's one of the big debates in animal evidence.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.880
Yeah I think the legal scholars are somewhat the legal scholars they are people who are

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.440
making legal motions.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.960
How animals like happy are trying to think well how do we get an entree to the legal

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.920
world and I guess this is like the most expedient way they've come up with which is to try

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.440
to define them that way and it may or may not be a good idea.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.240
I kind of agree with what a lot what you said.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.760
I think I understand the motivation to.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.680
The courts also recognize that this is a slippery slope you know.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:56.840
It's great if we give you know personhood to an ape or an elephant what's next and then

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:01.680
you've got the whole animal industries saying whoa you know this has to stop.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.720
I hate that slippery slope argument because it just stops progress.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.520
Oh I agree it stops very fast.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.920
But it's a very real problem for the courts.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920
Yeah.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:17.600
Because they can see the downstream effects of their rulings and the implications are

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.560
huge huge for every level of society.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:27.480
I want to just switch it a little bit in terms of our focus by asking Josh a question because

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.960
you're talking about the human animal continuum.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:39.160
Are there soldiers or veterans who apply for a service dog who flunk.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160
Many.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:45.280
And why and what what happens can you tell us a little bit of what from the human side

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.680
makes it possible or impossible to relate.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:53.320
Well it's not a matter of relating it's a matter of soldiers.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.680
If you raise a service dog and you have a facility for raising a service dog you've

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.920
been with that dog sometimes the first years with prisoners and then the prisoners they

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.040
take the dog away from the prisoners which is very traumatic for the prisoner although

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.760
they know it's coming.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.560
And then for the last year they get this training so the dog is probably worth twenty

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:17.160
five to thirty five thousand dollars a and they have immense love and respect for these

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.840
animals that they've trained so carefully and they want to make sure that the soldier

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.920
will take care of the dogs and take responsibility.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:29.120
So soldiers coming back from war with PTSD go through a huge continuum and it starts

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:35.360
with rage and anger and fear and often alcoholism and drug addiction and there's a lot of things

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.080
that come up with it that many of them deal with.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.400
And if you're addicted to drugs or if you're an alcoholic you will not get a service dog.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.240
So they're basically turned down if they're not prepared to care for the animal and they're

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.800
grilled very carefully about that.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:56.240
But if they are prepared and they qualify they can get the dog.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.600
And other instances where still their nervous system is so compromised that they're not

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.080
able to relax enough to relate to the animal?

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:09.600
Well they don't own the animal for a year when they give them this is I can't speak

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.040
for all of them but the four different facilities we worked with they're all the same in this

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.200
way that the soldier gets the animal for one year and they have to write reports biweekly

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.400
or monthly about how it's going and they have to come back and report and come with the

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:25.400
dog and they're evaluated.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.400
That's interesting.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.640
And at the end of the year they're either given the dog or they take the dog back.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.080
So they're trying to instill a reflective process.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080
Yes.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.080
Very much so.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.320
And the dogs and the soldiers take responsibility for that because they don't want once they

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.760
get the dog and they bond with the dog and they fall in love with the dog they don't

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.440
want to lose that dog because the dog is given his freedom because they can actually go out,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.280
go somewhere, go to a store at some other place not as something other than three in

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.840
the morning to avoid people you know to feel the connection that many commands that the

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.920
dogs have give them real feeling of safety that they won't have a flashback because the

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.920
dog will know it's coming and be able to stop it and block it for them or if they're

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.560
on the street and someone's coming too close they can simply say block and the dog will

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.680
immediately go in front and separate someone coming so that they don't have to feel someone's

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:22.640
coming too close and they don't overreact and attack them and end up in jail which happens

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.640
a lot.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.800
So the relationship becomes profound.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:35.240
So there's a huge change in the philosophy of training dogs which is that you really

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.040
never hit them or spank them you only use positive reinforcement.

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.040
No choke.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:49.000
No choke collars no you know and this is something that would benefit humans too right if we

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:58.600
understood that positive reinforcement is how you get good behavior and negative reinforcement

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.400
doesn't work.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.040
And I'm thinking of this in relationship with the Asian elephants that I got to know in

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:11.560
Sri Lanka when I live there for a year because there are about 300 temple elephants there's

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:18.600
about 3,000 wild elephants and about 100 elephants who live in an orphanage as a herd with two

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.720
matriarchs.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.840
And the temple elephants are all tortured that's how they train them they separate them

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:33.880
as children and then they're tortured and the Mahoots every now and then one is killed.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.680
And then I'm thinking about all these the captured herd that lives in this orphanage

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.200
about 100 elephants they breed in captivity and the possibility of training elephants

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.640
with positive reinforcement which seemed to me like an obvious no-brainer but you know

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.240
when I grew up you would hit your dog if they did something bad you'd stick their nose

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.080
in there if they defecated inside the house or something like that that's how you train

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.600
the dog and that's all gone and it works much better.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:13.360
So you're involved I just want to point out that there's a whole new philosophy about

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.080
training dogs that what I grew up with and it applies to humans too.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:26.400
Some of the parallels actually changes in training of children how people advocated

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.720
training children the same sort of process seemed to get.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.640
They don't allow child collars anymore.

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.360
Well you know if you smack your child in Sweden now you can be arrested.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.840
Perhaps the most profound one of the most profound experiences I've had was at an elephant research

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:51.200
center in southern Kruger Park in South Africa and all the houses were up on stilts with

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.480
sort of moats around them and one night there is this tremendous thundering sound and a

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:05.200
whole group of elephants came in and went toward the research center patio where they

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:15.720
had skulls of recently found elephants and they recognized that it was a baby elephant

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:21.520
and a female elephant that had been from their herd and they had a funeral.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:28.480
The elephants had a funeral around these skulls and since they were chipped the researchers

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.760
knew indeed these were from the herd.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:41.040
That has so impressed me and the other was a giraffe that knew that the wind was going

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:48.280
to change when its calf had broken its leg and when the wind changed the lions would

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.640
come.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:56.840
But I don't think I've ever experienced in a collective way even with Italian waves

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:05.920
and Irish waves that level of just instinctive grief not reflective grief instinctive grief.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.360
Are you witness this?

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.640
Yes, I've heard this.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.920
Yes, elephants are extraordinary creatures.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:21.040
In the list of weird things that animals figure out that we don't is the in the 2004

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.280
tsunami in South Asia.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:28.480
The elephants and the birds they just all took off.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.800
They went inland.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.760
They knew somehow they knew long before the waves ever hit.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:43.720
Just again there were humans that died but there were any elephants that died.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:49.960
How does a dog recognize that their owner is going to have an epileptic fit?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.960
Smells it.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:51.960
And the owner doesn't know it right?

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.960
Smells it.

01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:02.960
There are things that are sense to that we are not.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:03.960
Yes.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:10.760
You might open this up for questions from the audience.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:17.480
And if so, would you come up and speak at the mic and identify yourself?

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.120
It's been wonderful.

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:26.360
I'm a dog and a late, I become a cat lover and there hasn't been very much discussion

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.360
about cats here.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:36.800
And I've rescued three feral cats, one from the woods in Pennsylvania who was just crazy

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.640
and I wanted to bring her to New York City and I talked to people here and there and

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.880
said, I can't bring a feral cat.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.840
She'll destroy your house and everything.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.840
And one of them gave me a big cage and I put her in the cage because it was going to

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:49.400
be a cold winter up there.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400
I knew that.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.760
And I brought her back to my apartment and I'm happy to report that she became the most

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.640
charming Manhattan lady.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.320
She liked her martinis about five o'clock.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.360
I think that cats are very different than dogs.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.680
I've had lots of dogs and lots of cats.

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:12.000
I've lately become a cat person.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.760
But there, and I would like to hear what you have to say about that because they're more

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.200
mysterious, they're not, I don't think they're trainable at all.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.160
Dogs are, of course, trainable.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.600
They're domesticable but I don't know.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:32.200
You can, I mean, that my cat now never does anything that I told her to do.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.480
So, and I've found them to be enormously intriguing and interesting.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.360
Even maybe more than my dogs, which I love dearly, but last time my dog died, I just

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.280
could not face, you know, having another dog that would pass like that.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280
It was just so heartbreaking.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.280
I just like to hear a little bit of discussion about cats.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280
I love cats too.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.280
I believe in cats too.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280
I do too.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.680
But you're not going to find too many therapy PTSD cats.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.680
No, no, no.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:07.320
And I think for good reason because, you know, we've selected dogs for the, as animals that

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.680
seek social approval, they want our approval.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.480
That's what gratifies them.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.960
They're not interested in social approval.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.080
They want approval but it's not the same.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080
It's not the same.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080
They're not prepared.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.800
They'll let us pet them and purr us.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.800
Yeah.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.000
They'll delight when we feed them.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.800
And they don't show that same.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.800
Sometimes they'll play with us a little bit.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800
But after a while.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800
Yeah.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.400
The cat I have now will not get on my lap.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.800
But about three o'clock in the morning she'll jump up on the bed and lay on my chest.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.800
And she looks right at me.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.800
And they'll just lick me.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.520
That's the only thing I want to ask.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.920
You know, when a cat licks you, is she trying to eat you or is she trying to question?

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.920
Is she giving you a...

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.360
I think she's gone for the salt.

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:56.760
What's that?

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.600
I think she's gone for the salt.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.160
That raises a question I'd like to ask you.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.440
I have read that cats can be feral.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.520
And then if they're domesticized they can become domestic and that it's actually different

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.880
brain.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.600
Parts of the brain and different systems.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.680
That they can negotiate both a wild and a domestic situation.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.840
Is that so?

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.760
I don't know if that's altogether true.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.600
Because you can have the same situation with dogs.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.920
So you mentioned earlier that most of the world's dog population is what they call nowadays

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920
free roaming.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.960
They're not really feral.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:38.720
Because people own them but the expectations in many developing countries is that your

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.080
dog lives outside and it's free to wander about.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.120
But it comes home from time to time for food and what have you.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:50.600
And so dogs can navigate this as well.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.160
And cats I think are very similar.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.600
I mean their history is very different as well.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:01.240
I mean people I think in the early years wanted cats primarily to be around the house

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.960
and the farm to keep down the rodent population.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.760
They weren't seeking social contacts so much with cats.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:17.920
And I think the cats have moved in on us rather than us exploiting them for you know attachments.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.680
I just wanted to say that there's a kind of confusion about feral cats.

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.400
People think that feral cats are different species than domestic cats.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400
They're not at all.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.440
They're exactly the same cats.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:33.800
And you know feral cats were often you know cats that were kicked out of their homes for

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.960
one reason or another.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.920
And they got used to being straight.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:43.160
Just as stray dogs can be very hard to catch because they're used to keeping people away.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.480
Well if they're not fixed and they reproduce they breed like vermin.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:54.320
I mean when I lived in Jerusalem one time ago the feral cats were in and out of the garbage

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320
everywhere you went.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.200
You know you walked past the garbage container and ten cats would jump out.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.120
It was really.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.880
So you know and in Sri Lanka where I lived there were three types of dogs.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:11.280
There were house dogs, neighborhood dogs and then there were feral dogs.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.040
But what was curious to me that there wasn't a culture of talking to dogs.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.480
And that was very strange.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.080
Maybe people still spoke to each other.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:28.960
No I think there just wasn't a lot of history of house dogs or whatever.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:37.080
Or there's a kind of autism that some cultures might have about speaking to animals or whatever.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:45.000
But you know with the elephants about thirty people are killed every year by elephants

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.560
and about thirty elephants are killed by people every year.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.840
And it's all farmer conflict.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.440
The elephants come, some bachelor comes in and tears up the lawn.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:56.720
They try to shoot the elephant.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.400
The elephant comes back, you know they don't kill the elephant, comes back and they know

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:06.400
exactly who shot them, which house it was and they go after that house.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:12.040
And you know so I'm thinking well if the people knew that these are personalities that they

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:17.960
had names and they could follow them on the internet or whatever and they could, everybody

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:24.680
agreed to use names and talk to them and to sort of negotiate between two intelligent

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:31.240
species how we can get along on an individual level.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:39.080
So somebody needs to equip the villagers and standardize the language and signaling or

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:44.680
whatever, realize that each one of these elephants has a personality, a history.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:48.160
So there are groups trying to do that.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.920
That would go a long way to getting rid of human elephant conflict.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920
Yeah.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.000
The other interesting thing about the question about cats and dogs is goes back to the question

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.160
I was trying to pose before about pigs and dogs.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.920
That is animals, different animals are good at different things and are clever or not

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920
clever.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.360
In a case maybe in different ways depending on their, I guess their genetics where they

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.360
come from.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:17.920
There's an interesting new development in the study of plasticity and neuroplasticity

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.600
in brains and not just human brains in which the notion is that we inherit certain genetic

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.040
codes that actually provide some degree of plastic response.

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:37.440
In other words, the difference between some sort of hardwired instinct and then some general

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.800
drive that can sort of be expressed in many different ways.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:47.760
So an animal going from what we're calling a feral state to a domestic state is what's

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:53.280
allowed by their nervous system, the plasticity that's part of their nervous system.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.560
So if they're in this environment, they can adapt in this way and then if they're in

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.840
that environment, they adapt in a different way.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:06.280
But it's interesting to think in terms of cats and dogs, is that the dogs wish to ingratiate

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:12.480
themselves had to start with the fact that the foxes or whatever animals, wolves from

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.520
which the dogs were domesticated showed some inclination that way.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:22.120
After all these generations of cats that have been domesticated, they still, there are cats

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.280
that are more friendly, we'll get on your lap.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.160
And people always brag about that.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.800
My cat is like a dog.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:33.880
But that doesn't seem to be within the range of their plasticity yet they can be bred

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.880
to do this probably in the future, but dogs were easy to do that way.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.760
I think it was in the range of their possibilities and with cats less so.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:45.400
So I think if so.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:52.600
One comment on the legality of animal rights is we live in sort of an abnormal time where

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.040
animals don't have any legal representation.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:02.360
But in the middle ages, they would actually try animals if they trampled crops or destroyed

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.600
or even killed a person.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.040
They'd have a trial and sometimes animals got off mitigating circumstances or they were

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.520
too young to know it was wrong to eat the baby, you know, whatever.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:20.640
So post enlightenment, the Newtonian mechanical worldview that we've inherited by the way

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:29.920
is an anomaly in human history where in the past people lived most more closely.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:35.840
They had a more intimate relationship with animals and was reflected in recognition of

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:42.200
the animals having some sort of legal representation when they transgressed and damaged human property.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.200
The other thing you mentioned plasticity of the brain, you mean epigenetics?

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.200
Well, perhaps.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.200
Yes.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.560
I mean, not necessarily though because you had to hear that in some of these instances

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:59.280
the genes are conferring a trait that has some degree of plasticity built into it.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.200
You see, if this than that, if that than that.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200
Okay.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.800
Because right now in evolutionary theory, they discovered in the last maybe eight years

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.240
Neil Lamarckian inheritance acquired characteristics.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.720
So like this gentleman who was talking about cats, if he had children and he has an intimate

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:29.080
perhaps love of cats, they might be predetermined to inherit that orientation towards cats because

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:36.800
his brain was triggered in such a way emotionally to like that particular animal.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.080
So I think it's interesting that people now are having very intimate relationships with

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.080
cats.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:49.480
We're in the past, they were a barnyard predator and just kept around until maybe 1930s as

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:56.480
a barnyard thing animal to kill mice and rats.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.960
And now people are taking them into their houses and trying to domesticate this inherently

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.880
very predatory animal and treat it like a dog and hope it responds.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:17.800
The other thing is I'm wondering, I haven't heard anybody talking here about the effect

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:31.560
of zoon zenotic infectious bacteria or viruses transmitted to humans from domesticated animals

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:39.360
and the effect on our brains where our brains may be conditioned by those bacteria to respond

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.960
a certain way to the animal.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:48.560
And I'm thinking of Toxmos plasmosis gondi, you know, that kind of came out with that

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.960
article and book by Kathleen McNichlawardly.

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.480
Yeah, so about 10% of humans are probably infected with.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:26:59.960
No, it's more than that.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.280
Worldwide it's around 60% in America.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.640
So around 30% and with negative consequences.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.120
It's not good for your health.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:17.480
It's the interesting virus that mostly in cats and rats and mice.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.800
Well, compared to the revelations this morning in the New York Times about Johnson's and

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:29.120
Johnson's baby powder, which has asbestos in it, I'm not so worried about toxoplasts

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.920
although maybe that should be.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.680
But let me just say that in the history of domesticated animals that's where most of

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.480
our communicable diseases come from.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.480
Cattle.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:47.800
No, cattle and sheep and I mean all, you know, most of our big diseases we evolved.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.800
But not cancer?

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:49.800
No, no, I understand.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.800
But communicable diseases.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.120
Actually, cancer is caused by viruses a lot of it.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.800
In some cases that's right.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:59.000
Breast cancer is special.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.720
Thank you for raising a whole bunch of issues.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.760
I don't know if anybody else wants to.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.480
The animal trials one is something I looked into a while back.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.920
It was a very interesting guy called Bernard Chassine.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:18.160
He was a medieval French jurist who made his reputation actually by going around France

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.000
and defending animals in animal trials.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.840
He got a tremendous reputation for doing this and he was one of the people who was very

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:29.960
good at getting animals acquitted.

01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:35.960
He got a swarm of locusts acquitted somewhere in the south of France.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:42.200
Because his argument was that they weren't able to control their craving for the crops.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:47.200
So they had gone in there and eaten the crops and that if they, in the future, people wanted

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.760
locust not to eat their crops and they had to provide the locust with something else

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.760
to eat.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.760
And the judge bought it apparently.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760
He said yes.

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760
Sensible.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760
We'll let them off this time.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.640
Were they incarcerated so that they were in jeopardy?

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:02.200
No, they didn't come to the court the lower.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.120
So they didn't show up for their own trial.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120
They didn't write it up.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:12.600
But it was an interesting time because it wasn't clear that people actually thought

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.960
the animals knew about their own culpability.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:24.960
It was more of you that if a crime was committed then somebody had to pay the price for it

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.800
just to kind of maintain the social order.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:34.920
And so they went through these elaborate trials which really, they were sham trials but some

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:40.160
of these jurists got very, very famous and successful as a result.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.760
I think we have time for one more question.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:43.760
Mm-hmm.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.760
Yeah.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:45.760
I'm Henry Earl.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:51.000
I live over here on your cap between the Animal Medical Center and New York Hospital.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.280
And I've been struck over the last 30 years.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:56.440
Which one are you trying to go to?

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.040
That's what I was going to ask you.

01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:59.800
I bet you insurance, I'm sure.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.640
Over the last many years I've been struck with the sophistication of the techniques,

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.480
diagnostic and therapeutic at the Animal Medical Center.

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:16.320
And I've wondered about informed consent in both places but particularly at the Animal

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.920
Medical Center.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:25.320
So of course there is no informed consent but the procedures are extremely costly.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:33.480
And often unproven and the outcomes are often very unpredictable.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:38.840
The other area that I'm interested in and related to it is end of life care for these

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:43.560
domestic animals and how the decisions are made.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.720
Yeah.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:49.000
So there is informed consent but of course it's for the owner.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.600
So owners are given the consent form.

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:56.600
And so if any procedure is planned that's going to be costly or potentially dangerous

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.400
to the animal, the owner has to sign off on it as the proxy.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:06.240
In the same way that a parent might sign off for a very young child.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.760
The difference is the cost is all on you.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.760
It is.

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:14.320
And also it's all optional.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:21.560
And if the doctor screw up and your animal dies, the best you can hope for is the replacement

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:27.560
value of the animal which is not of great benefit to someone for whom this animal is

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.000
the thing they love most in the world.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.480
But that's another story.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:38.160
But yes we have now this situation where the veterinary profession has actually under pressure

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:47.480
from clients has all the modern medical techniques and treatments that are available to people

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.640
at a similar cost or those tend to be cheaper for animals even though they're doing the

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.880
same treatment.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:01.040
And we get this situation now where a lot of animals are on their last legs, keeping

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:05.560
them alive is probably cruel and the owners won't let go.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.080
The owner says do everything you can.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:09.480
Spare no expense.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.920
Just do whatever you can and the vet says well there's nothing more we can do.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.080
Well just try it.

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:19.720
And we have the situation quite frequently now in our veterinary hospital at the University

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:26.520
of Pennsylvania where everyone, the staff, the nurses, everyone is putting pressure on

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:30.520
the veterinarian to euthanize the animal.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.200
And the veterinarian says I can't because the owner won't let me.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.280
And it's the owner's property.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:41.560
And because it's the owner's property legally I have to do what they say or I can refer

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.000
them to another veterinarian.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.160
And if I refer them to another veterinarian that's going to be even more cruel because

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.760
we can at least keep the animal comfortable.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:56.160
So it's a very difficult situation now.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.160
But I think one of the differences is that a lot of the veterinary services, medical

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:06.440
services are actually superior to what we get as humans.

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:12.320
I can't speak to that.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.560
Well thank you so much.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:19.120
It was a lively, very compelling, very enlightening conversation.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:25.200
We really appreciate you being here and sharing your experience and your knowledge with us.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:26.200
Thank you very much.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.200
And thank you all for coming.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.200
Thank you so much.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:44.160
Will you help me answer your lectures or is that smart enough, expand Bob's

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.920
finances?
