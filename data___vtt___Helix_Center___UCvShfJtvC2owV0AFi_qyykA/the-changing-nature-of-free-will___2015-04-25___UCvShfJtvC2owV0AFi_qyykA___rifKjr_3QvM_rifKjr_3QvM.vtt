11:12.540 --> 11:14.840
and Diana Reese and others.

11:14.840 --> 11:20.040
I also wanted to alert you to the upcoming Helix Center annual benefit dinner, which

11:20.040 --> 11:23.560
will take place Friday evening May 8th.

11:23.560 --> 11:31.240
Information and tickets are available through the Helix Center website at www.helixcenter.org.

11:31.240 --> 11:37.400
And please follow us on Facebook and Twitter and tweet generously.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.840
So today's roundtable, The Changing Nature of Free Will.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.760
There are more extensive biographies than the introduction I'll provide.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.240
They're on your handouts and also on the website.

11:48.240 --> 11:53.480
But as I introduce each of the participants, if he or she can raise her, the audience will

11:53.480 --> 11:54.960
identify you.

11:54.960 --> 12:02.160
Akhil Bill Gromi is the Sidney Morgan Besser Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.280
His main areas of research are philosophy of mind and language, technology and political

12:07.280 --> 12:08.280
philosophy.

12:08.280 --> 12:14.880
He's the author of three books, Belief and Meaning, Self-Knowledge and Resentment, and

12:14.880 --> 12:17.440
Secularism, Identity and Enchantment.

12:17.440 --> 12:22.480
He's currently writing a book on the Nature of Value, Practical Reason and Agency.

12:22.480 --> 12:27.920
Louis Cabra is the Pagnelli Bull Professor of Economics and International Business at

12:27.920 --> 12:30.600
NYU's Stern School of Business.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.800
His research focuses on the dynamics of firm competition, both from the antitrust and from

12:34.800 --> 12:36.760
the strategy perspectives.

12:36.760 --> 12:42.000
His research topics include reputation, learning, network effects, sunk costs, innovation,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.600
strategic risk choice.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.240
In addition to numerous journal articles, he is the author of Introduction to Industrial

12:47.240 --> 12:48.240
Organization.

12:48.240 --> 12:55.280
Brigitte Kahl is a professor of New Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York

12:55.280 --> 12:58.280
and associate professor at the Religion Department at Columbia.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.400
A biblical scholar with strong interdisciplinary and ecological leanings, a major focus of

13:02.400 --> 13:06.960
a recent work has been between New Testament and Roman Empire, especially with the Groud

13:06.960 --> 13:09.000
to the Letters of Paul.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.920
He is the author of numerous articles and several books, including Galatians Reimagined, Reading

13:13.920 --> 13:17.000
with the Eyes of the Vanquished.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.560
Ken Kishida is a research scientist in the Computational Psychiatry Unit at the Virginia

13:21.560 --> 13:25.200
Tech Carilion Research Institute.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.560
He investigates neurobiological processes underlying human choice behavior using computational

13:29.560 --> 13:33.840
approaches paired with measurements of behavior and associated neural activity.

13:33.840 --> 13:38.360
Such experiments designed to expose how the brain encodes computations important for adaptive

13:38.360 --> 13:40.520
choice behavior.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.240
Simon Coshan is professor emeritus and senior research scientist in the mathematics department

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
of Princeton University.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.720
A recipient of the Frank Nelson Cole Prize in number theory of the American Mathematical

13:50.720 --> 13:56.160
Society, his interest lie in mathematical logic, number theory, and quantum mechanics.

13:56.160 --> 14:01.680
His work on the foundation of quantum mechanics includes the paper with Ernest Specker on the

14:01.680 --> 14:08.680
Coshan Specker Paradox and with John Conway on the free screen and now to our round table.

14:08.680 --> 14:16.680
All right.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.080
Well, I have difficulty.

14:18.080 --> 14:23.840
Usually when I talk about science with other neuroscientists, not very often with philosophers

14:23.840 --> 14:24.840
or theologians.

14:24.840 --> 14:33.720
So I know why myself and folks that I tell the rest of us here are interested in the

14:33.720 --> 14:40.160
problem or what value you guys have placed on this idea.

14:40.160 --> 14:47.320
I don't work exactly on free-wearing topics that you've heard just before.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
Did that include free-well?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.840
A lot of different things, not this.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.480
I think it's a fascinating topic, one that I'm interested in.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.440
I've been reading mostly about, and I don't do a lot of research on.

14:59.440 --> 15:04.160
Just to get things started, I mean, personally, I don't think that free-well is a proposition

15:04.160 --> 15:09.560
that can be proven or disproven in a way that's agree from that.

15:09.560 --> 15:14.160
I see free-well primarily as an axiom.

15:14.160 --> 15:21.960
If there is no free-well, then what's my identity?

15:21.960 --> 15:29.640
The thing that I do that I think is just the result of the temporal events or it's totally

15:29.640 --> 15:38.440
conditioned by particles or whatever the negation of free-well is, then I would have no identity.

15:38.440 --> 15:43.320
And I cannot imagine a world where I wouldn't be I.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.960
So I like to think of free-well as an axiom.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.720
I think it can be studied.

15:47.720 --> 15:54.400
It can be falsified in some way, but I would rather think about it as an axiom rather than

15:54.400 --> 15:57.360
a proposition that we can prove or disprove.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.360
Just to name you.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.240
So, I mean, let's just jump in.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.160
I'll add a bit to that.

16:05.160 --> 16:11.400
So when I've thought about this in the past, before I really pursued a role in science,

16:11.400 --> 16:16.840
trying to answer these kinds of questions, in that transition, I've found that actually

16:16.840 --> 16:23.200
the idea of free-well, it has this kind of use as a belief to frame how we do think about

16:23.200 --> 16:26.960
ourselves and how the choices we make have an impact.

16:26.960 --> 16:32.680
But from a scientific perspective, I actually find that it's very challenging to use that

16:32.680 --> 16:38.680
idea to go in and study the thing that it's trying to capture.

16:38.680 --> 16:43.400
When you get into discussions of free-well or consciousness, a lot of it boils down to

16:43.400 --> 16:50.080
an hour of trying for everyone involved to define and talk about free-well.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.760
When we're talking about free-well, to me it seems like what it is is we're interested

16:53.760 --> 16:56.560
in how humans make choices, right?

16:56.560 --> 16:57.640
The choice of behaviors that we see.

16:57.640 --> 17:04.120
We want to explain when we execute certain acts, it has some rare professions.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.480
Could we have done something different?

17:06.480 --> 17:09.320
Have we been at that moment again?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.320
And we want to try to explain that.

17:10.320 --> 17:16.560
To me, it seems like it's a useful idea, only to fill in a gap where we haven't really explored

17:16.560 --> 17:17.560
it very much.

17:17.560 --> 17:22.520
As a neuroscientist, I've been interested in studying choice behavior from a biological

17:22.520 --> 17:32.800
standpoint and trying to understand what does lead to the varieties of choice that we express.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.800
I wouldn't say that it's free.

17:34.800 --> 17:40.280
There's really nothing free about what humans or any other biological organism does.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.960
Everything comes at a cost.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.520
We can't go on forever without eating or sleeping or breathing.

17:46.520 --> 17:51.960
There's a real constraints on the kinds of choices that we can make and how we can navigate

17:51.960 --> 17:53.840
the world.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.560
On the other hand, as humans, we seem to gain some control over the environment so that

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
we can have these luxuries.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.880
We can sit in a room and talk about things rather than be out hunting and gathering our

18:05.880 --> 18:09.800
resources and shelters, right?

18:09.800 --> 18:16.080
We get this kind of luxury and that expands to lots of other domains where we create some

18:16.080 --> 18:22.200
freedom from our past, I guess.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.840
So let me just ask you something.

18:23.840 --> 18:30.040
Would you agree with the proposition that the only reason why we cannot predict behavior

18:30.040 --> 18:38.640
of a certain agent, be it human or non-human, is lack of precision in measurement?

18:38.640 --> 18:46.160
That one day, if we measure neurologically with sufficient accuracy, every single neuron

18:46.160 --> 18:51.760
of the human brain, we'll be able to model and predict behavior.

18:51.760 --> 18:57.800
Yeah, so in some ways we do predict behavior.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.760
If I want to make you feel bad, I'll insult you, right?

19:00.760 --> 19:04.320
Or I'll attack you physically, right?

19:04.320 --> 19:09.840
And that will have very differences on how you're going to act with me.

19:09.840 --> 19:15.760
I have kids, and so when I want them to do certain strategies that I could use to interact

19:15.760 --> 19:18.760
with them and others that won't be very effective.

19:18.760 --> 19:27.640
From a scientific standpoint, you can put people or pigeons into a Skinner box where they can

19:27.640 --> 19:33.880
make choices and you can set up the reward, schedule the hovers in such a way that they

19:33.880 --> 19:38.240
will act actually quite predictably.

19:38.240 --> 19:41.480
In some sense, it's in probabilistic terms, right?

19:41.480 --> 19:44.720
Decision, decision, it is not perfect.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.720
It's probabilistic, as he said, and rightly so.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.600
Is that error term in your models?

19:50.600 --> 19:56.200
Is that due to measurement error or is it due to something that's inherent to the model

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
that you model?

19:57.200 --> 20:02.440
I think it's the big philosophical or whatever question about free will.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.080
Is it all a matter of measurement?

20:04.080 --> 20:11.040
The only reason why I cannot predict exactly what you're the rat or human subject is going

20:11.040 --> 20:17.080
to do is that I'm not measuring carefully enough, or is there any fundamental, if you

20:17.080 --> 20:23.080
will, of uncertainty which cannot be properly predicted?

20:23.080 --> 20:33.000
Let me interject here.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.600
Part of that question is, is the uncertainty, our knowledge of what's going on as philosophers

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
say, epistemic?

20:37.600 --> 20:42.040
Or is there an underlying uncertainty here?

20:42.040 --> 20:49.400
So I'm a mathematician and might ask why I'm here altogether.

20:49.400 --> 21:01.280
But about eight years ago, I proved a result together with John Conway at Princeton, which

21:01.280 --> 21:08.520
is a refinement of a much older theorem going back with Anchbeck as Swiss mathematician,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.640
almost 50 years.

21:10.640 --> 21:18.400
And the question there is the underlying question is not directly about the question of determinism

21:18.400 --> 21:20.440
in the universe.

21:20.440 --> 21:29.320
Is the universe strictly deterministic in a quite precise way that classical physics

21:29.320 --> 21:37.360
in seismic Newton has said that if you know the state of the, not in the mind know, if

21:37.360 --> 21:44.040
the state of the universe is whatever it is at a given time, classical physics tells you

21:44.040 --> 21:50.720
that the state of the universe, both at any other time, both in the future and the past,

21:50.720 --> 21:52.800
is totally determined.

21:52.800 --> 22:01.080
So that was started a century by Isaac Newton in his system of the universe.

22:01.080 --> 22:10.720
And that brings in an old philosophical question that goes back over 2,000 years between the

22:10.720 --> 22:18.320
Stoics and Epicurus and the Romans, with Lucretius and Cicero.

22:18.320 --> 22:26.920
And the more modern version is what Hume started and Hobbes in the 18th century.

22:26.920 --> 22:36.520
And it's what's called compatibilism by philosophers is free will compatible with such a deterministic

22:36.520 --> 22:38.960
picture of the universe.

22:38.960 --> 22:46.800
So the contribution that these theorems make that I was talking about is to say that it's

22:46.800 --> 22:54.720
pointless to even talk about that because modern physics in the form of quantum mechanics

22:54.720 --> 23:03.960
gives rise to certain experiments, which shows that, so quantum mechanics itself, if you

23:03.960 --> 23:11.720
accept it, says that even if you're nicely the state as much as you can, what's called

23:11.720 --> 23:20.440
a pure state, at the present time for a closed system, like a particle or several, then the

23:20.440 --> 23:26.040
future, you can, for the future, you can only talk about probabilities for that.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.840
And if you accept quantum mechanics, that's not epistemological.

23:30.840 --> 23:37.720
It's not our knowledge, it's just an ontological fact that you cannot give, that there are

23:37.720 --> 23:41.240
probabilities only that you can give.

23:41.240 --> 23:46.680
What the theorem that I'm talking about says is, see, people didn't like that point of

23:46.680 --> 23:47.780
view.

23:47.780 --> 23:52.640
Even the founders of quantum mechanics, like Schrodinger and Einstein, really were not

23:52.640 --> 23:58.520
very happy with this whole idea of there being an inherent probability.

23:58.520 --> 24:06.160
And various people have tried to get back to a classical picture which reproduces the

24:06.160 --> 24:17.000
question, but says that these are probabilities, if you knew the underlying states, would be

24:17.000 --> 24:21.400
just a lack of knowledge of the underlying hidden variables.

24:21.400 --> 24:32.600
So an example of biology is we have probabilities attached to inherited traits, like blue eyes

24:32.600 --> 24:40.560
and brown eyes, one uses these probabilities, but men don't introduce a sort of hidden variable,

24:40.560 --> 24:47.080
namely jigine, which nobody knew existed at that time, but if it explains the process

24:47.080 --> 24:53.040
of endowment and factors, it explains the probabilities very well, and eventually they

24:53.040 --> 24:55.960
were actually founders as molecules.

24:55.960 --> 25:05.040
So people who believe in such hidden variables feel that they might try to explain the probabilities

25:05.040 --> 25:08.800
of quantum mechanics in the same way.

25:08.800 --> 25:15.520
This theorem, I'm not going to make a distinction between Schrodinger and myself, and then somewhat

25:15.520 --> 25:17.720
improved on myself.

25:17.720 --> 25:21.840
It says that you can't put quantum mechanics.

25:21.840 --> 25:28.280
If you try to give a classical explanation of certain experiments that we came up with,

25:28.280 --> 25:31.640
you'll run into a contradiction.

25:31.640 --> 25:38.120
If you actually want to say what the future state is, I can explain this in more detail

25:38.120 --> 25:40.320
if people want later.

25:40.320 --> 25:51.040
But there's just a series of 40 experiments in this which quantum mechanics gives probabilities

25:51.040 --> 25:53.440
for the outcomes.

25:53.440 --> 26:00.080
But if you try to give, say this is the outcome for this, you simply run into mathematical

26:00.080 --> 26:01.520
contradiction.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.040
So that's what the theorem is about.

26:05.040 --> 26:11.760
This is that the whole, this argument between what are called compatibilists and those who

26:11.760 --> 26:18.560
believe compatibilism and free will are, in fact, they are not compatible.

26:18.560 --> 26:27.960
That is to say that free will and determinism are incompatible, the incompatible list, that

26:27.960 --> 26:35.200
argument is an old-fashioned argument which now since quantum mechanics for almost 100

26:35.200 --> 26:37.920
years is simply out of date.

26:37.920 --> 26:47.720
One doesn't have to talk about this compatibilism because quantum mechanics is a pro-intontologically

26:47.720 --> 26:49.720
probabilistic theory.

26:49.720 --> 27:05.160
It says we will never get back to a classical kind of deterministic universe.

27:05.160 --> 27:14.400
The question broadly is whether those who believe in free will, will find comfort in

27:14.400 --> 27:22.520
the fact that we move from some level of certainty to predictions that are merely probabilistic.

27:22.520 --> 27:32.760
They might say that the real threat to free will is that you should see it as that human

27:32.760 --> 27:40.880
agency is susceptible to prediction even if the prediction is demoted to a probabilistic

27:40.880 --> 27:47.880
prediction for the reasons that you and others have established.

27:47.880 --> 28:00.160
So, there are two questions that seem to suggest that there is a more principled issue

28:00.160 --> 28:09.040
about freedom than one of whether the system, the school system is to be seen in probabilistic

28:09.040 --> 28:14.360
terms or something more close to certainty.

28:14.360 --> 28:28.480
One is to raise the question, you see if it is the case that all laws, even in Newton's

28:28.480 --> 28:38.040
mechanics, laws presumably come with a heterosperivistic clauses with all things being equal clauses,

28:38.040 --> 28:44.640
in Latin it is called cadaerosparibus clauses, that is you hold certain things steady.

28:44.640 --> 28:50.440
So you can predict so long as certain conditions are met.

28:50.440 --> 28:55.960
So there is a clause which says it says it were looking out for things that allow for

28:55.960 --> 29:00.200
exceptions and saying those must not arise, those conditions must not arise.

29:00.200 --> 29:09.560
Now the trouble with human behaviour is that if you were tempted to say that certain intentions

29:09.560 --> 29:19.040
and choices and preferences, if one were tempted to say that their laws are the probabilistic

29:19.040 --> 29:26.160
or more definite forms of law, if one were tempted to say their laws would say if you

29:26.160 --> 29:32.960
made certain choices or had certain preferences you would act in such and such way.

29:32.960 --> 29:41.560
The trouble is when we try and say what has to be in a cadaerosparibus clause, it is just

29:41.560 --> 29:42.800
about everything.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
Right?

29:43.800 --> 29:52.280
I mean if I say if I believe that water will quench my thirst and so I predict that I

29:52.280 --> 29:59.760
will, if I have that thirst and that belief I will drink that water, that could go, that

29:59.760 --> 30:03.400
prediction could be falsified by just about anything.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.400
Right?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.720
Why am I being too lazy to pick it up?

30:06.720 --> 30:09.080
Why am I being too busy talking to pick it up?

30:09.080 --> 30:12.040
Why am I preferring orange juice to drinking that?

30:12.040 --> 30:14.200
It could be just about anything.

30:14.200 --> 30:19.160
So what has to be held steady when one says all things being equal I will drink that water

30:19.160 --> 30:20.720
if I have that visit.

30:20.720 --> 30:26.240
We have no ex-anti-hould over all that has to be held steady.

30:26.240 --> 30:31.400
But if you compare what has to be held steady, say in the law of falling bodies in Newton,

30:31.400 --> 30:35.960
you can ex-anti-state in a very general way what has to be held steady.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.960
And that's part of the problem that you were raising.

30:37.960 --> 30:44.480
We have no, all the, all things being equal clauses as it were have to come exposed.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.480
We can't, ex-anti-say what has to be held steady.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.360
I think that's part of the problem.

30:49.360 --> 30:54.080
Isn't that the promise of neuroscience that we will be able to control that?

30:54.080 --> 31:02.320
I mean if you get down to the really nitty-gritty of neurological activity that eventually if

31:02.320 --> 31:07.520
you measure sufficiently well, you should be able to control for all of those conditions.

31:07.520 --> 31:13.040
You know, your past behavior, your state of, the state of the world could also be the state

31:13.040 --> 31:16.640
of your mind measured in some precise way.

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
Right.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.080
So you can't do that but by changing the subject.

31:20.080 --> 31:26.440
That is, you couldn't do it with the vocabulary of orange juice first and so on.

31:26.440 --> 31:30.840
You'd have to do it with the vocabulary of neurophysiological states.

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
Right.

31:31.840 --> 31:37.320
So in a sense you change, you can do that by a reductive change of the subject.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
Right.

31:38.320 --> 31:43.440
You can't do it with the vocabulary of beliefs, desires, preferences, etc.

31:43.440 --> 31:49.720
You can talk about brain states and then the question arises, well we wanted a prediction

31:49.720 --> 31:51.480
with this vocabulary.

31:51.480 --> 31:57.640
You've given us a prediction in a different vocabulary and that really is in a way the

31:57.640 --> 31:58.640
mind-minded problem.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.120
And it seems like some of the resistance to that change in vocabulary.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.880
It's not the vocabulary that we use day to day.

32:05.880 --> 32:06.880
Right.

32:06.880 --> 32:11.120
And the value from what I understand about free will.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.280
We're not so concerned about whether or not our pet dog has free will.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.400
We care about whether or not other humans have free will.

32:17.400 --> 32:22.640
Because when they do, either don't accept or that we want to support, we want to assign

32:22.640 --> 32:26.080
them credit or not.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.680
And there's, I think, good evidence that this is something that's very important to our

32:29.680 --> 32:30.680
species.

32:30.680 --> 32:34.560
It's something that's evolved in how we process information about others.

32:34.560 --> 32:38.200
It's how we organize in small groups but also bigger structures.

32:38.200 --> 32:46.280
So if you change the vocabulary to a biological one or a physiological one, there's a worry

32:46.280 --> 32:54.400
that then the whole social structure which is built on this other language will collapse.

32:54.400 --> 33:00.920
And it's actually what's going to happen with exceptions based on what we understand from

33:00.920 --> 33:02.680
medicine and neurobiology.

33:02.680 --> 33:09.720
So whether it's legal or whether it's interpersonal, if a person has a particular psychiatric condition

33:09.720 --> 33:15.480
and it causes them to act in certain ways, treat it or untreated, we don't treat them

33:15.480 --> 33:20.680
the same way as a society, as someone who does not have that condition.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.680
Right.

33:21.680 --> 33:25.880
And that's true in many cases.

33:25.880 --> 33:32.600
Just because you can make, it doesn't seem to remove agency.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.120
It doesn't seem to remove control.

33:34.120 --> 33:39.320
In fact, actually, I think it actually enhances it and provides more control as we start to

33:39.320 --> 33:47.200
understand where these constraints come from, from our biology or our environment, the interactions

33:47.200 --> 33:48.840
we have.

33:48.840 --> 33:52.600
Once we recognize that they are constraints, we could do things as a society.

33:52.600 --> 33:59.640
We can make choices to remove them, to make things more equal, a more level playing field.

33:59.640 --> 34:05.440
And so in some sense, by changing the language, learning what is or is not predictable, we're

34:05.440 --> 34:07.520
actually gaining more control.

34:07.520 --> 34:13.360
So wait, so that makes it sound as if the more determined we are and the more knowledge

34:13.360 --> 34:17.160
we have of the determining factors, the more free we are.

34:17.160 --> 34:22.520
As we come to understand that, so I'm not sure if you're making, but it says though

34:22.520 --> 34:25.000
as we learn about it, we become determined.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Right.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.760
So I guess what I'm saying is that there are forces that we're completely unaware of

34:31.760 --> 34:35.880
in our biology and in our environment that have impact on the way we make decisions.

34:35.880 --> 34:36.880
Right.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
Right now.

34:37.880 --> 34:43.920
But I thought your point was that once we come to know more about those determining factors,

34:43.920 --> 34:49.320
we actually get a bit of control and therefore are more free.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.320
Yes.

34:50.320 --> 34:54.560
So there's nothing more free is different from completely free.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
Right.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
More control, more choice.

34:57.560 --> 35:01.320
It is a pair of paradox in that, isn't it?

35:01.320 --> 35:10.640
But usually we thought agency was threatened by determinism and you're suggesting agency

35:10.640 --> 35:16.080
is enhanced by determinism so long as knowledge of the determinism.

35:16.080 --> 35:23.120
So if we're going from determinism to completely free will or some version of compatibleism,

35:23.120 --> 35:30.400
that is not the language that I actually find useful to talk about these things.

35:30.400 --> 35:35.440
From the work that I do and the way that I approach these problems, I can make observations

35:35.440 --> 35:40.560
that can control certain experimental settings and I can make measurements and generate models

35:40.560 --> 35:43.160
for what I might expect to do in the future.

35:43.160 --> 35:48.640
So generating essentially scientific beliefs.

35:48.640 --> 35:53.840
When we talk about free will and when we get really heated debates over that, what we're

35:53.840 --> 35:56.680
actually talking about is human behavior.

35:56.680 --> 36:04.760
When we see others and so in the space of trying to explain human behavior, we can learn

36:04.760 --> 36:08.840
more about what is guiding that.

36:08.840 --> 36:16.960
I agree with you that if we know more about what is determining our behavior, we do in

36:16.960 --> 36:28.320
a sense become more liberated because we know what the knowledge of necessity is actually

36:28.320 --> 36:30.720
a liberating thing.

36:30.720 --> 36:39.640
But here's the interesting, it's really very fastily about the docs which is that what

36:39.640 --> 36:41.600
you say is absolutely right.

36:41.600 --> 36:48.080
The more we find out about, so if I'm angry and I've figured out what exactly the well

36:48.080 --> 36:52.920
springs of my anger are, I have no anger.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.840
That's the point that Spinozo is making.

36:55.840 --> 37:05.120
But here's the fascinating thing, that is true only if it is piecemeal.

37:05.120 --> 37:11.320
If it's piecemeal, there is something which when it's small, my anger or some particular

37:11.320 --> 37:18.480
thing, one thing or the other, but if one had nothing but the perspective of seeing oneself

37:18.480 --> 37:25.820
say as a sacri-endless sees one, just in a detached way, if one made that thing comprehend

37:25.820 --> 37:29.120
offensive, we would have no agency.

37:29.120 --> 37:36.080
So the very thing which when it's small is liberating in just the way you describe, if

37:36.080 --> 37:42.520
you just blow it up to say make it a comprehensive thing saying, well we can just see all our

37:42.520 --> 37:45.400
behavior as present and future.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.720
And that's the end of agency.

37:47.720 --> 37:51.320
Well, it creates an interesting question I think about agency.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.840
Where does that begin and then?

37:52.840 --> 37:53.840
What are those boundaries?

37:53.840 --> 38:02.840
So from a biological perspective, an organism has physical boundaries, but that's different

38:02.840 --> 38:07.600
from I think the agency that you're talking about or the sense of it.

38:07.600 --> 38:18.360
So while I exist in the body that I walk around in, I interact with people in exchange information

38:18.360 --> 38:22.960
either consciously but also quite implicitly.

38:22.960 --> 38:28.600
Just being in a room full of folks or being in a conversation, your brain is processing

38:28.600 --> 38:32.360
this information in ways that's guiding how you're going to behave in ways that you're

38:32.360 --> 38:34.680
not necessarily aware of.

38:34.680 --> 38:44.640
And so for an observer of an agent in that context, our readout of their agency is really

38:44.640 --> 38:46.320
based on their behavior.

38:46.320 --> 38:55.840
It always comes back to one brain or one system looking at another system and trying to determine

38:55.840 --> 38:59.240
who is the agent.

38:59.240 --> 39:05.240
The hard question is what goes on when one is observing oneself.

39:05.240 --> 39:10.760
And what I was, of course, if you observe and study yourself, you will get more control

39:10.760 --> 39:13.560
of yourself in the future.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.880
And if you do nothing, if you have no other point of view on yourself but that of detached

39:17.880 --> 39:23.160
observation, then you've gotten rid of agents.

39:23.160 --> 39:28.520
So there must be some other perspective you have on yourself over and above a detached

39:28.520 --> 39:30.360
study of yourself.

39:30.360 --> 39:39.080
That is what everyone means by freedom.

39:39.080 --> 39:47.760
It's quite fascinating to listen to all that and trying to translate it into the way

39:47.760 --> 39:50.960
which I am working.

39:50.960 --> 40:00.280
And I am just noticing that the same problems but in a different key have been the technology

40:00.280 --> 40:03.440
throughout the centuries.

40:03.440 --> 40:09.560
And it is so interesting and this is a reason why I really thought I should come here and

40:09.560 --> 40:14.400
just listen to you and see where we are in that.

40:14.400 --> 40:21.440
So this big kind of paradoxical juxtaposition between determinism on the one hand, so things

40:21.440 --> 40:22.440
are determined.

40:22.440 --> 40:29.760
And in theology, of course, we say there is this supreme being called God, the deity that

40:29.760 --> 40:37.960
has created everything and has this kind of sovereignty over things that happen.

40:37.960 --> 40:46.240
So that is the kind of person who destines us or destines us or is the kind of determinating

40:46.240 --> 40:47.600
force.

40:47.600 --> 40:54.120
And then on the other hand, of course, we also need free will because if everything is already

40:54.120 --> 41:01.160
set by God, then what the hell are we doing and how come that there is a judgment or that

41:01.160 --> 41:05.840
there is repentance, that we can change, that there is conversion.

41:05.840 --> 41:11.600
And all these things that as this constant appeal to our moral agency or kind of spiritual

41:11.600 --> 41:15.840
agency to change who we are.

41:15.840 --> 41:24.360
And I think I have never worked on free will because I always thought this is kind of a

41:24.360 --> 41:30.160
dead end discussion because theologians have kind of constantly been in battle about that.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.640
I mean, you know, you have two positions.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.400
One kind of camp says and they are often well the heretics.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.400
They said there is free will.

41:38.400 --> 41:46.360
Even after the fall of Adam and Eve in paradise, you still can do good.

41:46.360 --> 41:51.000
And then there is the other position that says no, we cannot do good.

41:51.000 --> 41:56.920
And when you were talking, I just about my decisions and thinking about what I am doing.

41:56.920 --> 42:02.160
I just was kind of thinking of Paul who said, oh, I'm miserable.

42:02.160 --> 42:08.320
I'm such a miserable being because I constantly do what I not want.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.080
You know, I know what is good.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.840
I know what I want to do.

42:11.840 --> 42:16.000
But how come that I constantly do the opposite?

42:16.000 --> 42:21.160
You know, that is, you know, my freedom is restricted and why is my freedom restricted?

42:21.160 --> 42:23.520
And then there is this big term sin.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.000
I'm in bondage.

42:25.000 --> 42:32.400
I am kind of, I see the things I would like to do, but I don't do them because the novel

42:32.400 --> 42:40.280
law is at work in my limbs, in my hand, then what my mind tells me.

42:40.280 --> 42:44.840
So and then Paul says, you know, but there is a way out of that.

42:44.840 --> 42:52.360
And here is the question, how kind of theologians are asking them, where are we going with that?

42:52.360 --> 42:54.480
What is at stake in this debate?

42:54.480 --> 42:59.680
Is at stake, eat eggs or bacon for breakfast?

42:59.680 --> 43:03.560
Or is this choice or is something else at stake?

43:03.560 --> 43:13.560
Can we, can we, can we do, can we even keep the world in a state that is deliverable,

43:13.560 --> 43:14.560
for example?

43:14.560 --> 43:20.400
Or are we kind of doomed to turn it into hell?

43:20.400 --> 43:22.520
I think this is the theological question.

43:22.520 --> 43:29.840
So do we have the agency to do good or are we all under the spell of evil?

43:29.840 --> 43:37.600
And this is why I'm so interested in listening to neuroscience and to quantum mechanics.

43:37.600 --> 43:44.720
I think that all is this kind of, on the one hand, we are far more determined than we think

43:44.720 --> 43:45.720
we are.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.920
And on the other hand, there is a space of freedom.

43:47.920 --> 43:56.640
I mean, this is what I hear you to say and do I hear you wrong or is?

43:56.640 --> 44:03.840
I mean, I think it's interesting when we ask the question of this force, that this pushing

44:03.840 --> 44:04.840
is for it.

44:04.840 --> 44:09.680
And it also speaks, I think, where is agency?

44:09.680 --> 44:11.600
So agency, free will.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.960
These are ideas that seem to be very useful to us as human beings.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.240
And it's something that we do care a lot about.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.080
We spend a lot of cycles thinking about.

44:21.080 --> 44:29.640
From a biological perspective, there is a lot of stake and it's a survival of our species.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.120
And that's always been the case.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.520
And that's true for any species on this planet.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.760
It's always been about the survival of the species.

44:35.760 --> 44:43.880
And so there are things that will promote the survival and things that will demote that.

44:43.880 --> 44:50.920
And evolution by natural selection would say that basically you, that which survives

44:50.920 --> 44:51.920
when.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.480
So there's no really other direction on it.

44:55.480 --> 44:59.560
Those ideas or those things that support the survival of the species on to the next stage

44:59.560 --> 45:02.320
and the next generation are fit.

45:02.320 --> 45:10.560
And so I'd actually propose a compromise between what some popular scientists view on

45:10.560 --> 45:19.680
religion and what religion's role has been for humanity is that there has, it's been

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
a useful idea.

45:20.680 --> 45:25.040
It helps organize our day to day where we fit in the world.

45:25.040 --> 45:29.280
If it wasn't useful to us as a species, it would have been dropped long ago, right?

45:29.280 --> 45:30.880
And we would have all passed.

45:30.880 --> 45:32.120
And we haven't done that.

45:32.120 --> 45:39.160
We hang on to these ideas of being an agent or having free will or all kinds of narratives.

45:39.160 --> 45:44.400
And science is its own narrative based on experimentation and empirical thought.

45:44.400 --> 45:51.440
So you think that's also true for free will as an instrument for all agency that's necessary

45:51.440 --> 45:53.920
for living in society?

45:53.920 --> 46:00.720
I think it's something that we hang on to as a species because it is useful.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.800
At some point it occurred to me personally, well what if I didn't have free will?

46:05.800 --> 46:09.560
Well what if I don't?

46:09.560 --> 46:11.480
Well what if I don't?

46:11.480 --> 46:13.720
Well my life doesn't really change.

46:13.720 --> 46:18.640
I can't really change my behavior in any other way, right?

46:18.640 --> 46:25.600
So the choices I make or the choices I make, I'm chasing some value for every choice.

46:25.600 --> 46:29.440
And it's kind of letting go of that idea and looking to other ways to explain my behavior

46:29.440 --> 46:33.160
or others' behavior became more interesting.

46:33.160 --> 46:40.040
But there's all kinds of ideas that I think that do carry some value to us.

46:40.040 --> 46:49.240
And where that comes from, where that value comes from, that's an open question I think.

46:49.240 --> 46:53.280
I think it's hard to deny what you're saying.

46:53.280 --> 47:04.200
But I'm wondering if the term useful is the right term.

47:04.200 --> 47:14.680
All my instincts are to say that there's something more lofty about the norm which

47:14.680 --> 47:22.560
says we ought not to shape the concept of human freedom.

47:22.560 --> 47:27.360
Not that it's just that it's useful, but we ought not to.

47:27.360 --> 47:35.840
So I have a loftier sense of the norm than norms of utility.

47:35.840 --> 47:45.680
One way to ask the question which your work establishes that there is a notion of free.

47:45.680 --> 47:53.760
There's a falsity about determinism in the way you've in the move from Newtonian mechanics

47:53.760 --> 47:58.000
to contemporary physics.

47:58.000 --> 48:04.240
One thing we might ask is what is the location for the idea of norms or the usefulness of

48:04.240 --> 48:09.240
the notion of agency, which is partly what you were saying too.

48:09.240 --> 48:17.720
Here's a very simple question, suppose you did something, suppose X did something very

48:17.720 --> 48:28.560
harmful because it's a delightful sake or for personal gain or something like that.

48:28.560 --> 48:36.200
And somebody else say why did the same harmful thing because he was forced to do it, say

48:36.200 --> 48:41.320
physically forced or somebody put a machine gun to his head and said do it all, shoot

48:41.320 --> 48:43.280
you.

48:43.280 --> 48:48.600
So X and Y do exactly the same thing, it's a bad thing.

48:48.600 --> 48:53.640
This does it because he wants to do it, wants to gain from it, etc.

48:53.640 --> 48:59.000
Why does it because somebody's just forced him to do it, say physically.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.800
Now we will never give up the distinction between these two people.

49:05.800 --> 49:12.800
Now ever much we find out about the brain, whatever we find out, all the things that

49:12.800 --> 49:19.400
you know that these current, you know, is it Libet, how do you pronounce his name?

49:19.400 --> 49:21.480
Libet, Libet, others have done.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.400
Let's see, they're all right, right?

49:24.400 --> 49:29.360
All of its neuroscience establishes this.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.920
Will we ever give up the distinction between X and Y?

49:33.920 --> 49:36.320
I think that's an empirical question, right?

49:36.320 --> 49:39.240
That's something so empirical in the sense that...

49:39.240 --> 49:42.640
No, I'm suggesting we ought not to give up the distinction.

49:42.640 --> 49:44.800
So I'm denying it's an empirical question.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.040
I'm saying it's a normative question.

49:47.040 --> 49:50.000
We should never, we should not give up.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.480
We should say somebody was forced to do it, should be treated differently from somebody

49:55.480 --> 49:57.280
who did it.

49:57.280 --> 49:58.280
So now...

49:58.280 --> 50:00.720
So just for the right, I do agree with you.

50:00.720 --> 50:05.200
I also share that belief that we ought not abandon that distinction.

50:05.200 --> 50:12.200
But when I say that it's empirical, say for simplicity sake, there's two halves of the

50:12.200 --> 50:13.200
population.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.960
One half the population believes that we should remove that distinction.

50:15.960 --> 50:20.280
You know they have things that we ought not.

50:20.280 --> 50:22.640
And then there's changes in the environment.

50:22.640 --> 50:28.040
There's grand scale forces in the environment that change whether it's societal level or

50:28.040 --> 50:29.240
why not.

50:29.240 --> 50:36.680
So holding one belief or the other is beneficial to the species.

50:36.680 --> 50:43.160
Then it'll be determined at that point in time which basically wins out.

50:43.160 --> 50:47.840
So it's kind of a very abstract idea of whether or not we should maintain this distinction

50:47.840 --> 50:50.840
about responsibility for actions.

50:50.840 --> 50:57.360
But if it's not a useful idea that promotes the genes that we carry, then I would say

50:57.360 --> 51:01.240
that it's empirical in that sense that evolutionary forces can kind of going forward.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.920
Time will determine that for us.

51:03.920 --> 51:13.640
Now, I do agree with you that we ought not lose that distinction.

51:13.640 --> 51:18.360
And I think part of that is it's come from our past that there might have been a period

51:18.360 --> 51:20.520
in time where we couldn't make that distinction.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
Right?

51:21.520 --> 51:26.360
And in this case, in the course of so we're not really clear who's actually the cause

51:26.360 --> 51:30.680
of the sort of agent, whether it's a person or the person that's been manipulated.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.080
And we struggle with assigning that.

51:33.080 --> 51:39.760
First of all, when you say species, you mean the human species?

51:39.760 --> 51:49.880
So what about all the part of us that is very similar in terms of behavior to animals?

51:49.880 --> 51:51.280
What do you say to that?

51:51.280 --> 51:59.400
And are you saying that free will is a property of being part of the human species?

51:59.400 --> 52:02.280
Only in the sense that humans care about it.

52:02.280 --> 52:06.840
It's a belief or it's an idea that humans discuss and debate over.

52:06.840 --> 52:07.840
There's actually...

52:07.840 --> 52:11.240
From what I killed said becomes more immoral.

52:11.240 --> 52:13.920
What you said has a moral connotation.

52:13.920 --> 52:18.000
That's also something that the human species uniquely cares about.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.920
So these are ideas that are very important to us.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.000
And they're probably important to us who are a very good reason.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.240
And there's a reason that we don't want to let go of them.

52:26.240 --> 52:30.160
Because when we do the structure of our society would likely fall apart.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.440
It would just be very different.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.600
We wouldn't be human anymore.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.560
It's part of how we identify ourselves as being human.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.200
I think what Simon said, you would not...

52:39.200 --> 52:45.120
Your proposal, your proposition doesn't only be humans.

52:45.120 --> 52:48.760
Well, we're talking... yes.

52:48.760 --> 52:56.120
So we're talking about determinism and then we have to talk about free will.

52:56.120 --> 53:02.880
Now my own feeling is that compatibilism really doesn't make a lot of sense.

53:02.880 --> 53:09.920
That if things are determinant, totally, and that applies to the... exactly to the situation

53:09.920 --> 53:17.040
where it's no different than being coerced from the outside, is that everything is determined,

53:17.040 --> 53:22.840
you can't make that distinction between the two cases that you talked about.

53:22.840 --> 53:27.560
So I really think that question is so...

53:27.560 --> 53:34.720
Let me make a point here about...

53:34.720 --> 53:41.360
Is it really possible to get rid of determinism in an absolute way?

53:41.360 --> 53:50.680
See, these theorems that I was talking about, they're saying that a classical theory, which

53:50.680 --> 53:59.520
is deterministic, that doesn't hold water anymore because of, say, these experiments,

53:59.520 --> 54:08.040
those 40 experiments, but usually a classical theory is not simply telling...

54:08.040 --> 54:11.120
A scientific theory is not history.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.520
It tells you...

54:12.520 --> 54:20.320
It gives you general laws and tells you whatever the state is, it'll tell you what happens

54:20.320 --> 54:25.960
afterwards and if it's classical, it'll tell you in a deterministic theory.

54:25.960 --> 54:33.960
If I lift this up, say, 9 feet, it doesn't know that if I...

54:33.960 --> 54:38.600
It should take three-quarters of second to fall.

54:38.600 --> 54:45.320
That's not magic, it just follows a well-known law that if you remember your high school

54:45.320 --> 54:55.680
physics, it's that the height, the S, is equal to 16 T squared in feet and seconds.

54:55.680 --> 55:02.840
And if I put in for the height of 9 feet, then I get 9 over 16 and it's...

55:02.840 --> 55:05.920
You take it and I get 3 over 4.

55:05.920 --> 55:09.200
Now, to know that it's...

55:09.200 --> 55:13.920
Interesting, perhaps, but that's not what scientific theories are about.

55:13.920 --> 55:20.800
I also want to know if I lift it up 16 feet, then it's going to take a full second by using

55:20.800 --> 55:21.800
the...

55:21.800 --> 55:27.560
And how that works on the different conditions that tells me this.

55:27.560 --> 55:34.680
And this theorem I was talking about, that classical physics doesn't work, is of this

55:34.680 --> 55:36.360
type.

55:36.360 --> 55:43.800
You have to know that no matter what possibility, suppose somebody says, yes, well, I'll tell

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
you...

55:44.800 --> 55:47.560
Well, in one of these 40...

55:47.560 --> 55:55.080
A particular one of these 40 experiments and I'll be right, perhaps.

55:55.080 --> 55:59.440
But I said, no, you have to tell me this in all of these.

55:59.440 --> 56:06.600
Now, that's what physics is supposed to predict different things.

56:06.600 --> 56:16.880
But suppose somebody says, I'm not interested in scientific theories, I believe in a being

56:16.880 --> 56:17.880
who's prescient.

56:17.880 --> 56:22.800
It doesn't have to be omnipotent, but he has to be present.

56:22.800 --> 56:26.000
He has to tell you what happens in the future.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.360
And I say, well, this experiment says you won't be able to predict.

56:31.360 --> 56:35.920
He says, no, this being doesn't have to predict everything.

56:35.920 --> 56:41.240
He'll tell you that you have to do this thing in particular, this experiment.

56:41.240 --> 56:44.360
In that experiment, I'll tell you what it is.

56:44.360 --> 56:55.640
So you see, this theorem doesn't act against a prescient being who tells you what the actual

56:55.640 --> 56:59.160
trajectory of the world is.

56:59.160 --> 57:02.080
Scientific theories don't tell you the actual trajectory.

57:02.080 --> 57:07.640
They tell you the possible trajectory starting from any particular state.

57:07.640 --> 57:09.480
And that's very different.

57:09.480 --> 57:19.480
So this theorem that I was talking about can't argue directly against this kind of prescience.

57:19.480 --> 57:25.600
In order to do that, I would have to put in a little bit of my own free will, namely,

57:25.600 --> 57:31.640
these 40 experiments correspond to one of 40 buttons I pick.

57:31.640 --> 57:38.920
You have to give me the free will to press one of these 40 buttons.

57:38.920 --> 57:42.320
So some electromagnet changes in direction.

57:42.320 --> 57:50.920
And then with that, even a prescient person cannot predict all the 40.

57:50.920 --> 57:54.120
All he got into a mathematical contradiction.

57:54.120 --> 58:02.440
See, there is no absolute proof that that determinism doesn't work.

58:02.440 --> 58:07.480
Let me give you a more homely example.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.200
You know, when I was young, I was growing up in England.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.160
I loved movies.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.320
And I went to once each week.

58:16.320 --> 58:20.640
And one day I saw a movie I really liked, Casablanca.

58:20.640 --> 58:23.640
I think you all know the movie.

58:23.640 --> 58:34.440
And at the movie, Rick, Humphrey Bogart, has two letters of transit, forgetting out of Casablanca

58:34.440 --> 58:36.320
to the free world.

58:36.320 --> 58:42.880
And there are three people there, Ingrid Bergman, the love of his life and her husband, who's

58:42.880 --> 58:44.520
a freedom fighter.

58:44.520 --> 58:51.240
The question that Humphrey Bogart has to make answers, which one of the two is he going

58:51.240 --> 58:54.160
to give the transit of?

58:54.160 --> 58:57.720
So I mean, I didn't know which one he was going to choose.

58:57.720 --> 58:59.680
It really was a question.

58:59.680 --> 59:02.080
And of course, we know he does the noble thing.

59:02.080 --> 59:06.160
I'm not giving anything away at this point, I think.

59:06.160 --> 59:10.840
And he allows the Ingrid Bergman and the husband to leave.

59:10.840 --> 59:16.520
He joins the Free French with Claude Rains, the Vichy police captain, where they now join

59:16.520 --> 59:20.200
the Free French at the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.640
So that's the story.

59:21.640 --> 59:28.680
By the way, afterwards, it really was a free world decision because the script writers

59:28.680 --> 59:34.760
had couldn't decide which way to end and then finally decided on this.

59:34.760 --> 59:38.400
But I want to say is this, I liked the movie so much.

59:38.400 --> 59:41.120
I went to see it next week with a friend of mine.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.600
He had never seen it.

59:42.600 --> 59:44.200
And he had the same thing.

59:44.200 --> 59:49.080
Humphrey Bogart has a free world decision, right?

59:49.080 --> 59:50.800
He didn't have a free world decision.

59:50.800 --> 59:52.760
This was the second show.

59:52.760 --> 59:53.760
Right?

59:53.760 --> 59:57.080
So he couldn't, he had to make that.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.400
Now my point is this.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.920
You know, here's the universe.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:09.400
And you know, there's a famous mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:16.440
And aside from his work in logic, he was a privateer also, he was a friend of Einstein.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:25.360
And in his usual quirky way, he found a solution to the relativistic equations, which is a

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.440
cycle that is to say the universe completely repeats itself.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.760
Now that's a possibility then.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.960
So here's the universe.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.800
Maybe there is free will and maybe not.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.240
But in the second showing, there cannot be any free will, right?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:51.040
So this sort of logical possibility shows you cannot get away with proving that, you

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.800
know, you cannot get away from proving that determinism, you know, that determinism can't

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.800
work.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.600
It shows that, you know, that in the second showing, everything is totally determined

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.000
because it happened the same way as this just like in the movie.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Right?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.400
So you have to get, there is no, it's a little like, it's solipsism.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:25.040
There is no absolute logical proof that says that you want just a figment of my imagination.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.640
You know, you've tried to surprise me and this and that.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.480
And of course you happen and we know there is such a model because when I go to bed at

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:41.160
night, I dream and these people are figments of my imagination.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.200
Do surprise me and so on.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:50.600
So it is a fact that it could be the solipsism is a logical, it's ridiculous, but it's a

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.680
logical possibility.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.960
And determinism is exactly the same thing by the second showing.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.320
In my opinion, ridiculous.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:05.440
If you ask a child of four or five whether they have free will and I've tried this and

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.320
they say, well, of course I have free will.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:15.840
You have to be sophisticated and talk about things like determinism either from a religious

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.680
or scientific point of view to start believing that that we aren't all robots and everything

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.480
is determined.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:33.360
So my point is that there is no absolute proof of either the determinism doesn't work or

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.520
that solipsism for that matter doesn't work.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.080
We have to show free will and that's the same thing with free will.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.600
So actually I tied in a little bit with what I said earlier that I like to think of free

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.400
will as something that's not falsifiable in a scientific way.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:00.800
Therefore there's a sense in which it's more of an axiom than my point is the opposite.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.760
You have there is no way of establishing free will absolutely.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.000
Oh, I agree with that.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.560
And like in this theorem we have a little bit of free will of pressing one of these 40 buttons

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.840
then I can say that the whole world is spontaneous.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:24.440
You know that actions of particles are spontaneous in this sense given this theorem in quantum

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440
mechanics.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.200
But you have to, there's no absolute proof.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:34.160
You have to put in a little, you know if somebody says look you're assuming free will to prove

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160
it.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.600
Well I can say look you know it's like the fisherman he puts in a minnow and catches

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.000
a trout and some.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.520
There I saw you put the fish in what have you done.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:50.480
You have to assume a little bit of free will and then the whole world becomes an arena for

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.080
free will or even of particles.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.680
But you know it has to become simply an axiom the free will exists because there's no way

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.600
of proving it absolutely.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:08.240
I mean may I go back to what Ken said before.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:15.480
The issue of survival of species and you kind of made it look pretty easy.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.280
I mean you know we do serve our survival but we don't.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:28.480
What if we are addicted and we know the kind of the kind of the brain chemistry of addiction

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.200
is an interesting thing.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.880
What if we are addicted through our whatever what happens in our brain if we like something

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.280
that actually destroys us.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:46.080
So isn't that a step forward in the debate on free will or not.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:53.600
I mean you know the kind of we are you know we the way we live is that really conducive

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.960
to survival.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:02.560
I mean in economy in well in ecology in all in politics in all respects.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:09.280
I mean so are we and then you know here's again where the theology comes in because you

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:14.720
know these people and I'm just realizing it while listening to our debate here.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:21.240
These people have been kind of brutally realistic saying you know we have the bondage of free

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240
will.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.360
I mean this was one of the big terms in the 16th century.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.720
The bondage of free will versus free will.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.320
So that is a rasmas of Rotterdam versus Martin Luther.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.840
So they kind of Luther says that is not such a thing as free will.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:46.600
Only theoretically but practically we are kind of we are in in prison in cause by things

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.720
we can't control really.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.120
And that is what I would call really a translation.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.280
We are addicted to doing exactly what destroys us.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.280
So how do we deal with that?

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.680
Yes so so you know addiction from a medical sense versus for the way you're describing

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.360
I think there's a good analogy there but but it is a very different thing we were talking

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.360
about addiction of course.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.760
But there are certain ideas that we are compelled to.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:21.240
So so if we all held the exact same idea and it was the wrong idea that would be detrimental

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.640
to our species right whether it was an idea or a behavior or something they were expressing.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.240
But the wonderful thing about any species is its diversity.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:36.760
And that's really what protects a species for future events.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:43.560
And so our biology sets us up for us and that's not just expressed in our tall we are a hair

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.680
color or all these other features but it also expresses itself in our brain structure which

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.480
gives rise to our beliefs and our behaviors.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:55.280
Having that diversity is really important for any species.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:03.320
And so having this debate and having ideas kind of develop is probably the thing we want

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.320
to do.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.000
We don't want to actually settle on the wrong answer for sure.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.640
Since we don't know where we are going to find something future.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.080
But addiction to fossil fuel may have a gene.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.240
It may.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:31.200
But you know what I think is when I was saying that it may be a norm, a moral norm that we

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:39.040
don't cease to see ourselves as agents with freedom even in the face, even if determinism

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.520
were established and neuroscience.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:49.240
I was really giving a secular version of many of the things you were saying when you talked

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.880
about good and evil and so on.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:58.800
So I mean that is certainly how a lot of people think of it in theological terms.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:05.800
But you can also just think of it in secular terms and talk of just normative and moral

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.800
and so on.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:16.240
We are both saying the same things in dramatically different idioms.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.520
But you know that suggests and I think you want to say too partly when you say it's just

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520
an axiom.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.120
It's not the sort of thing that you will allow to be refuted by this thing.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:37.400
And I'm suggesting that the disallowing is a normative stance, a moral stance.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.200
So there seems to be some convergence on this and even you agree.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.160
You talk of it in terms of usefulness which I've some quam about.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.880
But that's a matter of detail.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:58.120
So here's a question which I want to bring in on this.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:07.480
The kinds of things you were talking about discusses free will at a level of abstraction

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:15.240
that is what has been surfing here is that it's a normative notion as well.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:22.640
So maybe we should just say it's an ambiguous notion.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.400
Free will is just an ambiguous notion.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:31.800
So let's say freedom which is studied as a purely metaphysical thing in terms of scientific

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.040
laws, what interpretation we give to them and so on.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.440
That's freedom in its purest most metaphysic.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:48.600
Let's give another name to what has emerged as freedom as a normative stance.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.160
Let's call it freedom.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:10:00.280
And it's that freedom is the notion that everybody's always been interested in.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280
With everybody.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.080
Has always been interested in.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.640
So I would call it choice behavior.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.080
I mean I think that's when we talk about free will.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080
I don't care.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080
Call it X.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080
Call it X.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.960
It doesn't call it anything you like.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.200
The point is it's just two different notions.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:26.440
So my hesitation to freedom versus free will is that first of all freedom I wouldn't know

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:33.240
where to start with to go looking for what to observe, what to measure there or how to

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.600
even think about that.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:40.920
With free will it has only because we all know that phrase.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:47.480
But if a simplistic point you know the word free has six or seven definitions.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.680
The word will has a dozen.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
You multiply those together.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.560
I mean you're getting a whole variety of things that it could possibly mean.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:00.800
So it is absolutely ambiguous and whether it's an axiom or I think I would actually put as

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.880
a belief.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:09.760
It's not as useful to me for what I want to do with whatever it is that we're talking

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.800
about to do anything with.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.720
What I find interesting is that when we talk about free will we're not talking about the

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:23.000
behavior of other organisms except for when the conversation kind of diverges.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.200
We're talking about people.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:31.240
We're talking about human behavior and how do we make judgments over that behavior?

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.840
How do we use it?

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:43.120
Do it perhaps freedom might be something useful to go in a direction and define it specifically.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.840
But I think whatever that is it was for me it was back down to how do humans behave or

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.600
do those choices come from.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.880
Okay but do we have a concession from neuroscientists?

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.680
That's what you are right.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:06.960
So do we have a concession from neuroscientists that all the delivery research on freedom makes

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.240
no difference to freedom?

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.600
I'm not sure what freedom is.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.760
If I'm going to commit to something I would want to know.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760
You know what freedom is.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.640
I got the notion from your remarks about usefulness and so on with some modifications.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.280
I study human choice behavior.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.840
But you talked about the usefulness of a certain concept which we don't.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.320
So I'm talking about the concept or the idea.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.040
So I'm talking about what you're talking about.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.640
So you know what I'm talking about.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.800
I guess so.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.200
Let's go with it.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:48.680
So do we have a concession from somebody who researches a neuroscientist that whatever

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:55.680
the deliverances of your research are they leave completely untouched.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.880
This other thing call it whatever you like but you know about it because you raised this

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.560
concept.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.560
You named it.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:09.440
And I would not conceive as far as the way I'm understanding what you're saying.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.800
Neuroscience research and trying to understand how the brain works and how it gives rise

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.640
to human behavior does a lot of things on which we could observe.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.240
And a lot of the behaviors we observe in humans are expressions of the beliefs that we carry

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:22.840
with us.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.040
So I'm trying to gather what you might mean by freedom or some other concept whether it's

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:31.040
free will or something else.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:37.080
And in the spaces where we can agree and do something productive as two agents.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:44.680
But when we're talking about beliefs whatever kind of belief that might be.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.800
That is an area that's not as well explored in neuroscience as a visual system or how

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.760
we smell things in the world.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.760
But it's a real thing.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.760
And it's a big problem in the medical industry with a placebo effect.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.360
Where simply the idea can actually have an impact on your nervous system and it's not

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:09.160
just compliant behavior but you actually see physiological changes due to the suggestion

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.920
that this pill is going to help you.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.040
So the impact that beliefs have on human nervous systems is very real.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.240
It's something that we don't understand completely but it's something that should be researched

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.240
more.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240
No, no, so can it change any?

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:26.160
So just to try to bring it to things together.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:32.760
Do you agree that as neuroscience improves its methods, its measurement techniques and

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:40.840
so forth that there will always be a irreducible degree of unpredictability of human behavior

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.680
or that it's purely a matter of measurement.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.600
If there is an irreducible level of unpredictability, we can call that trithm.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.520
The fact that even given all the addictions, even given all the neurological conditions

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:00.080
that people have, even given all the beliefs as you wanted to find them.

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:10.640
A choice in humans which is inherent to that human for one reason or another and I'm not

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.120
going to go into quantum mechanics at this point.

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:19.080
There's an irreducible level of prediction that we can agree to call that whatever you

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.080
want to call it.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.680
But it seems to me that what we're entering here with this is the intractable mind-brought

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.800
theory problem in general.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:36.440
This is a sort of special case having to do with beliefs and free will and so on.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:44.680
The question is what is the neurology, neuroscience, to do with the brain?

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:50.320
How does that connect up with the mind?

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:59.160
My own feeling at the moment is that it's got interesting things to say but it does not

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:02.000
cross that chasm.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.080
I don't know how that chasm can ever be crossed.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:11.880
I've read many books by both philosophers and neuroscientists.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:22.880
There's always a big gap that happens at the level of neurons and what happens, it does

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.440
not cross into the mind.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.760
That's a separate issue.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.360
I don't know if it can ever be crossed but it seems to me the free will and the question

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:37.880
of what happens in neurobiology is a special case.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.920
I should have the frustration.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.120
A lot of neuroscientists will say that the mind is just the brain in whatever it does.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.720
That is stated with a lot of faith.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.840
It's not clear that that's actually been demonstrated.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:00.640
What we know is that when I do things to brain tissue that I can change the expression of

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.440
behavior, which is our proxy for mind.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:13.440
It's one thing to say that what happens in the brain is a determinant for what happens

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.160
in the mind.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:21.440
We don't actually know a great way of mental behavior other than the things that we could

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:27.720
measure which would be the brain activity of behavior.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.760
I believe that to a large extent.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:41.120
That's why I believe the relevance of quantum mechanics and the fact that there is indeterminism

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:49.560
in the material world outside of the brain, outside of humans, that in fact something

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:56.560
is going on in the brain which makes use of that freedom of particles.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.280
We know very little about what happens.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.880
A lot of people who work in neurobiology says, well, quantum mechanics doesn't play

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.200
a role in this.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:13.120
It doesn't probably at this level that is being seen.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.200
Evolution is very opportunistic.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:21.440
It seems to me very likely that in the end what's happening in the brain at the level

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:30.120
of molecules does not use all kinds of purely quantum tunneling and this kind of correlations

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.320
that happen in quantum mechanics.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.680
There are purely quantum mechanical that there's not being used at the molecular level.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.760
I believe that's what's going on.

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760
That's what happened.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.400
That's not been investigated yet.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.320
Well, simply because it's very hard to investigate what happens at that level in quantum mechanics,

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:53.200
and when it's set up in special experiments, it's very hard to deal with it, although there

01:18:53.200 --> 01:19:00.200
are many interesting experiments going on at the level of single particles.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.680
But in the brain it's much, much harder, of course.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:10.760
I believe that in the end it will be shown that there are critical effects to play an

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.120
important role in what's going on in the brain.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:24.720
I think in the end that the free will that we feel it will be connected up with this

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:32.440
kind of spontaneity that happens in the particles because I do believe that the arguments made

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:37.280
by people like humans don't hold much water.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.600
I think he's talking, by the way, about free action.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:47.760
He talks about if action is not coerced from the outside and I do what I want, then this

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.240
is you, then I'm now half free will.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.040
I think that just simply begs the question.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:02.120
It could be that I don't have free will anyway because everything is determined, but it just

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:06.040
happens to be that he was talking about classical mechanics.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.000
If you talk about quantum mechanics, the whole question doesn't arise anyway.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.240
So if I understand what you're saying, you're making a case for something like a random

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.120
number generator at the moment.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.520
That's another point.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:29.520
You see, the incompatibleists say, I agree with what I was saying here, that compatibleism

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.360
is in fact doesn't agree with free will.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.720
So they bring in random choice or random things.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:43.120
Then the compatibilists say, well, you know better often than we are.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:48.040
If part of your choice is that you throw a coin and your choice is based on whether

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.920
it's heads or tails, how have you gotten away?

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.840
How's that free will?

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.240
So random choice doesn't help.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.160
There's a subtle point here.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:04.280
What happens in quantum mechanics is not random choice.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:10.200
If I do a single act, look at the decay of a single particle, it will decay at a certain

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.160
time, and that happens at a purely random time.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.600
That's true.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:20.400
But what happens in quantum mechanics is if you have several, say two particles that become

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:27.840
entangled or correlated in a quantum mechanical way, then what they do together is far from

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:28.840
random.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.480
What happens here, actually in the case, what's called the Einstein Podolsky, Rosen

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:38.680
experiment, the EPI experiment, what happens actually determines what happens in the other

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.680
one.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.440
And you get effects that are very, very different from random choice.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:50.680
And it's these correlations which can happen over distances that I think play in a major

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:58.760
will end up playing a major role in understanding how the brain works, and in particular how

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.400
free will can occur in the brain.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:10.520
It's not random, that's a classical notion, which is sort of, you know, it's supplying

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:18.240
something much more radical in quantum mechanics that is a relatively random choice, but it's

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.440
a kind of correlated choice that happens that's much more complicated.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.400
Can I just jump in on that?

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:31.720
I just want to understand what you are saying, because I have the impression that for me

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.960
it's something like music, what you are saying.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:40.760
I mean, and I don't fully understand it, but I have a sense that this matters and that

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:47.080
is translatable into some kind of theologians have been discussing in a completely different

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.360
language.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:54.480
And it would be very helpful if we could make these languages compatible in order to understand

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.880
what we are each talking about.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:05.600
And what I hear you saying about spontaneity, something about leaps that are not random,

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600
but still leaps.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:13.600
I mean, so something, so in theology the kind of vocabulary for that is something new is

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:14.800
happening.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:21.360
You know, that is not random, but it is something things are coming together, and it is no longer

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.320
the question whether I go to Macy's and I choose a black dress or a blue dress.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.240
I mean, this is not this kind of free-built thing, but it is something can I go beyond

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:38.600
the or, you know, in which I am trapped, I mean, I don't use this or that, but it doesn't

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:44.560
make a difference, or it makes a difference, but it is not the difference that I would

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:50.760
say is the theological difference, the difference between life and death, survival or not survival.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:58.280
I mean, you know, kind of going out of this bondage of choosing things that are destructive

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:06.000
and finding a way to live that is no longer self-destructive, for example, self-destructive.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.400
By kind of things coming together, happening in a way I don't know where, sub-atomic or

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.120
whatever you, how you call that or in the brain, the neurons or whatever.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:23.000
So the, I mean, this is what theologians have been discussing, is there, and they have talked

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.240
about spirit in that.

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:33.560
The spirit transforms the ways we act and they transform the whole experiment.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:40.240
It is a different, it is moved in a different space on a different, and there all of a sudden

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.280
we see things happen before.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.400
And it is not random, it is not, it's still in this kind of oral shape, but it is something

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.000
that maybe we didn't expect.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:02.560
Let me bring up something you said in this action, and with your two cases, one of which

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.720
is coerced and the other one isn't.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.480
You're mentioning addiction.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:15.520
As you look at a person who is really addicted to heroin or cigarettes, and he really can't

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.280
get around that.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:26.000
Now if you say, I want a cigarette, I want to smoke a cigarette, and I smoke it, the

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.120
human would say, okay, you're using your free will.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:34.280
But if I'm really a, I may not want what I want, right?

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.480
Yes, but I can't get around it.

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:40.080
I'm coerced in that sense internally.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:48.760
And this is by the way, this argument that determinism cannot be compatible with free

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.920
will.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:56.400
Because if determinants happen inside, simply because I wanted, I'm being forced to want

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.680
it, just like an addict.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:05.840
So this idea of addiction sort of makes no one, I think, in this room would say that

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.760
somebody who's addicted to heroin and thus bad things is at the same level as somebody

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.240
who's not.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.240
And that's a big distinction.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.600
We all feel there's a moral distinction there.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.440
Right.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:31.800
And I think this idea then is, you know, we all agree on this, and how it plays out from

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.080
the idea of general physical theories is a very difficult question.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:44.440
As I said, there are no very good, current experiments that bring into the brain this

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.120
idea of spontaneous action of particles.

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:55.720
By the way, that's a very old idea I mentioned, Epicurus actually brought in 2300 years ago

01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:57.880
the very, this very idea.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:04.120
He said, look, you know, there was this idea of democracy, said everything is atoms, and

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.200
things just fall into the void if they're heavy or go up into the heavens.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.880
He says, first of all, there are actions going on if you do this, but also he won't

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.320
get free will.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:25.760
So he posited tiny little, what do you click, you know, kilomens, is that what's called

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.240
now swerves.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.600
And some of you may have read the Greenblatt's book called the Swerve.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.720
It's about, you know, the cretious book on Epicurus.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:46.680
And he introduced a sort of spontaneous action of the examples to interact, but also so that

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:49.200
the re-will can exist.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.960
Because he didn't believe what these Chrysopus and the Stoics believed that you can have

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.080
free will if everything is determined.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:04.280
So this I want my ideas really goes back to the Greeks of 2300 years ago.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:10.160
So I guess I'm curious where you get where this goes from spontaneous action and molecules

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.560
because there is some evidence actually in the brain that there is a lot of spontaneous

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.560
activity.

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:20.560
And you could take tissue preparation to see the spontaneous activity.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.120
Now whether that's tied to something we don't understand yet or if it is some kind of spontaneous

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:28.120
action that's a whole other area of research and it's ongoing.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:34.560
I don't think, I don't know, people have talked about that there are articles saying

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:42.200
quantum mechanical effects already existed at the level of animals and they give examples

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.720
with bird flight and various other things.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:48.520
I'm not convinced that doesn't sound.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.280
The experiments are not that.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.240
I mean are retina sensitive and have to detect a single photon.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:57.120
Single photons are detected by the retina and go to detect them.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:04.440
So it's clear that single particles like photons have an effect on the brain.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.480
We essentially see one or two or three photons.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.080
The thing that stunned me is that you could set things up so that a single photon could

01:29:13.080 --> 01:28:57.180
cause a per-

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.540
Right?

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:21.120
You set them up, you get the experimental controlled and you give them the instruction.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.400
When you see a photon get up and run a marathon and if they're willing participant that will

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.400
trigger it and they'll go.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:32.800
That's a whole lot of activity that is spontated by a single photon.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:39.960
It's kind of, but there are certainly other effects in the brain that are likely taking

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.960
on these effects.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:46.800
So I'm curious, I guess where do you get from the spontaneous action to kind of a freedom

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.800
in choice?

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:52.000
Because when we talk about free choice the question is about who is in control, right?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.360
Is it me, the agent that's in control or is it a control external to me?

01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:03.480
You mustn't think of this, that a single particle in the brain, this spontaneity of

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:09.600
a single particle, I don't see that as translated into our free will.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:19.720
It's a whole unknown network which is partly spontaneous, partly regulated by the network

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.040
itself that somehow gets translated.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.960
I'm not saying I have any theory at all about it.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:34.280
I just have the hope and even the expectation that nature works, evolution works in such

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.360
an opportunity.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.840
I can't believe that it doesn't make use of these quantum mechanical effects.

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.480
I would share your disbelief.

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.480
I'm absolutely nature's.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.160
I'd like you to get into these.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:52.360
Is there any reason to expect that the kinds of non-random forms of spontaneity that you

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.360
feel is established within?

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.360
I call it random.

01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.960
It's a non-random.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:57.960
It's non-random.

01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.760
It's a realistic thing, but these correlations are not random.

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.760
That's what I say.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.760
Oh, sorry, non-random.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:14.220
So the question is, is there any reason to believe that what you, let's say rightly

01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:23.880
claim that there's non-random forms of spontaneity that counter the deterministic aspect, that

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:32.520
those things will coincide with the things that in understanding the free will we talk

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:36.360
about such as intentions to pick up this thing.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:43.800
I mean, it just seems to me there's absolutely, we have no framework by which to say this

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:52.240
non-random spontaneity that's established in case by case translate into the intention

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:56.680
that with which I drank this, which constitutes my freedom, the intention with which he picked

01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:03.160
up the microphone, which we have no framework to say that these two things will coincide.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.560
No, coincide.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:13.880
But there are experiments in which single molecules, I suppose, that you recognize your

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:14.880
grandmother.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.120
You know, what's sometimes called the grandmother cell.

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:22.840
Single cells, I should say, not particles.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.960
Single cells may have such effects.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:33.400
So the fact that, you see, there are some correlations of this type between what happens

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:39.280
in neurobiology and what happens at the level of mind that you're talking about.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.840
Whether free will will be one of them, I don't know.

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:47.320
I'd have, that's only a hope and pay maybe, you know, an expectation, but that's all

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320
it is.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:55.600
There are some sort of more simple things in your bio correlate.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:02.160
Because if you take Liebe's experiments, you know, these RPs, which are detected by

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:09.240
the EEG and so on, are speaking directly what's measuring what's going on when somebody's

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.840
flexing, you know, contracting a muscle to raise the wrist and so on and so forth.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.760
But there's a, immediately, I mean, the observations of the evidence are immediately linked to things

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:24.640
which have to do with the intention that's involved when I flex my wrist, et cetera.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:30.160
But you are talking at a level of abstraction and distance from this when you talk about,

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:36.040
you know, the non-random, sort of spontaneity that is then, I'd be have no framework by

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.000
which to bring these two things together.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:41.080
So maybe there's something here.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:49.040
So one thing that humans are really good at are telling stories but also filling in details,

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.040
right?

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:56.040
So I can imagine that there might be some kind of spontaneous action that gives rise

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:01.920
to behavior that's unpredictable even for the agent themselves or for others.

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.120
But then it's filled in with, well, why did I do that?

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.840
Well, and then you kind of fill in these confidedly the stories from the agent's perspective.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:14.480
But if you don't have a framework which connects them, it sounds like pure fantasy to me.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.520
You have to have a framework which says the spontaneity established at the quantum level,

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:26.280
et cetera, are the sorts of things that are relevant to the intention to drink this or

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.080
to pick up that mic and so on.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:36.320
Whereas, we have a framework by which to link what is delivered by Libe's experimental

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.640
objects and things like flexing the wrist and so on.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.280
These things are just theoretically.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.880
There's a chasm between them.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.840
And you have to say, well, we can expect the two things will be brought together.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:53.920
If you don't have a framework to think, it sounds like a completely idle speculation.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:35:02.000
But there are some not free will or more complex, but at least there are things in the mind,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.880
for instance, recognizing a person which are connected to single cells having certain

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.880
things.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:14.120
I was hoping that another speaker would be, another discussant would be here.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:19.280
Peter say, I think there was talk of inviting him.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:25.040
He does experience, I don't know a lot of what he does, but I read an article at the

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:31.320
level of the scientific American in which he does experiments in which certain decisions

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:41.960
are connected up again to a single molecule, large molecule, an organic molecule, but activating

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.880
the molecule is connected up to certain decisions.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:52.160
I'm not, this is far from anything like that.

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.680
I think we'll continue to have these and many more experiments that I think made extraordinary

01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:03.200
progress in the understanding of the working of the brain and the human family.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.760
The question I think, the fundamental question is, what is it going to say about free will

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760
ultimately?

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.400
And I think we're always, correct if I'm wrong, but I think from a point of view of

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:20.080
theory of quantum theory, we're always going to hit an undecidability wall as it were regarding

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.880
the true nature of human choice.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.880
Correct if I'm wrong.

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.320
We're going to understand it a lot better, exactly.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:36.400
Remember, this spontaneity of, you can't explain, well, it satisfies these quantum

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.200
mechanical rules.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:46.200
Why is a particle choose to go back in a famous Stern-Gail Act experiment that silver atoms

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:52.640
sent through some kind of electromagnetic field and it's a size to go this way or this way?

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.040
And that's the end of the story.

01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.520
The choice it makes between this and that simply is left as part of the theory and there's

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.800
no explanation.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:07.800
If you try to give an explanation of this, then you're back to classical physics and

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.160
you run into this kind of contradiction.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:18.600
You just simply cannot explain, you're stuck with this spontaneity is like as it is with

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.160
Epicurus.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:23.120
It's there and you have to accept it.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.000
The question is how do you connect that to free well?

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I can't tell you.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.560
I mean, I don't know.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:33.520
I think we will go now to the audience for their questions.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.480
I want to be brief.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:49.960
Please questions in preference to comments.

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:56.640
With all respect, I believe this discussion has confused the indeterminacy of the Heisenberg

01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:04.600
uncertainty principle which governs subatomic particles with the nature of our behavior.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:13.120
I mean, our behavior is determined by the firing of neurons so that it is completely

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.120
deterministic.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:17.560
No, it doesn't go at all.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:25.600
I mean, if a photon hits our retina and that may be a random event or a non-deterministic

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:30.120
event, our subsequent behavior is still deterministic.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.920
I don't know how you come to that conclusion.

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:35.280
The firing of neurons.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:36.280
So what?

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:42.120
I mean, how do we don't know how there's a certain classical level at which they fire,

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:50.520
but there's all kinds of things going on at the atomic level which we know that atomic

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.720
interactions satisfy the rules of quantum mechanics.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.720
How this counts?

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.720
How ever once?

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:58.720
I don't know.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:05.240
However, once the neurons fire, our behavior is completely determined.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.640
We don't have control over that.

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:14.840
So there's room in between a neuron within the brain firing in the actual expression

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:15.840
of the behavior.

01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:22.080
So you could have folks who have had physical injuries that would actually block that communication

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.800
reaching to the muscles.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:28.680
So just having neurons fired doesn't exactly mean that you're going to get the expression

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.680
of some behavior absolutely.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:31.920
I mean, it's always going to be probabilistic.

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:37.040
You might have that window defined so that it's extremely high probability, but all kinds

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.600
of things could have been not just within the biological agent, but also the environment.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:47.840
So we're talking about making the connection between neural activity and some kind of behavior

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.400
or choice and all things being equal.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.400
That's more.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.080
But we don't know exactly how the quantum effects within the molecules that make up

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.080
the neurons.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.080
And that's just an open question.

01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.480
So I'll just end that.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:08.240
And the firing is at the end of the...

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.720
Or once everything is fired, you can say the decision is made.

01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:14.080
Yes, but what about what happened until then?

01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:15.080
I mean, that could be...

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:17.400
That's beyond our choice.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:19.080
That's beyond our choice.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.080
That's random.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:21.080
Or non-deterministic.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.080
It's life and non-choice choice.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.080
That doesn't follow.

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:32.240
So some of the choices we make now will have a huge impact on where we end up five years

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:33.240
from now.

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.800
And so that's not just in our choices.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.560
That includes the kind of neural activity that might go on five years from now.

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:44.960
So there is an idea in decision neuroscience of goal-directed behavior and goal-directed

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.480
decision-making where we might have some goal put off in time.

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.440
And so we can start to do things between now and then so that it's not immediate effect,

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:58.440
but start to build support and structure so that we could achieve those goals, right?

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.560
But how is that non-deterministic?

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.400
I'm not saying it's not necessarily...

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.360
Thank you, Madam Chair.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:15.520
The firing of the neurons in the brain, some in collective manner.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.960
That's what constitutes the decision itself.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:29.040
And the firing may itself have a spontaneous or free will...

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:34.680
We don't know what causes this firing, that firing, how they come together in some complicated

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680
way.

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.080
To say that because after the fire...

01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:45.600
There's no decision after they fire, yes, but we're talking about what happens until

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.760
there's some collective firing of the neurons, leads, gives us the decision that we make.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:59.000
All of that, as a matter of neurobiology, may have a spontaneous element, which is what

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.240
we call making the decision.

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.240
Okay, thanks.

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:11.840
Just going to sound like that, I'm picking up on the same as previous question, but it's

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.840
different.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:24.000
I'd like to offer obviously, obviously, overly simplistic, but causal model that attempts

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.880
to integrate some of the different things I've been talked about.

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:33.520
So it starts at the quantum level with virtual particle pair creation.

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:36.800
This is being a quantum phenomenon.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.280
It's a non-deterministic event.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.440
It's also the case that some of these virtual particles emerge and typically fall back to

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.040
the vacuum state once they emerge.

01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.560
Sometimes they're energetic enough to remain in our level of physical reality, if you would

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.960
allow that.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:04.720
So if we couple this happening within neural tissue, and one of those newly created, non-deterministic

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:13.080
and virtual particles then interacts with the intracellular neuronal environment in such

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:19.240
a way that it contributes to the firing or not firing threshold of that neuron, then we

01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:27.760
have a potential example of the relationship between quantum non-determinism and neural

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:28.760
particle.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:33.680
So then we take it the next step and to the research that you mentioned about the effect

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:39.760
of partially magnetic fields, the neocortex generates a weak electromagnetic field, which

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:49.400
may in fact have also an effect on the way in which the virtual particles enter or not

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:54.800
acts on that may or not be about approaching firing threshold.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.200
And it's also the case in terms of the molecule mentioned that we now know a great deal more

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:07.680
than we knew even last year about the molecules that are recruited in the, say, memory formation

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:14.680
process and the DSBs, the dual strand breakages and reconstitution that caused the formation

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:15.780
of America.

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:21.280
All of these events involve the recruitment of the effect of molecules that could be brought

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:28.320
about by the activation of the virtual particle made real.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:32.120
That's my idea and I would like, first of course, your opinion.

01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:38.240
There are many quantum mechanical effects, including the virtual particles we have created

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:43.840
and go back and forth and some that say, I mentioned another tunneling, there's another

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.480
one.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:51.440
To me the question of quantum mechanical, what are called entanglement or correlations,

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440
play it probably.

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.880
But all this is speculation.

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.240
It's all speculation.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:04.080
But it does, you know, it's worth speculating in this way, because without that, we're

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:11.520
back to the compatibility question, which I think is now a relevant given quantum mechanics.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:12.520
Okay.

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.520
Thank you very much.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:28.480
We're talking about the utility of belief in free will, regardless of whether it might

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.480
be an illusion or not.

01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:36.360
Pew research in 2014 conducted a poll and they found that 54% of Americans deny that climate

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:40.000
change is happening and that human beings are causing it.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.480
Now, let's take me as an example.

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:48.080
Let's say I believe in free will and you're a scientist and you're telling me I am of

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:54.840
my free will, I'm causing climate change that may cause, you know, catastrophic effects

01:45:54.840 --> 01:46:00.160
to the entire world, to civilization, then wouldn't that free will believe, perhaps,

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:07.280
contribute to my denying that climate change is happening in order to preserve my self-worth,

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.280
myself identity?

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:15.920
I can't even want to tackle this.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.520
So let me have it in.

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:26.080
We've been ignoring the information about climate change and making decisions that are

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.720
destroying the planet, let's say.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:40.120
And your question is, is this not an exercise or will for an exercise at free will?

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:45.040
No, the question is if I believe in free will and scientists are telling me that I'm doing

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:51.120
this, wouldn't I be much more likely to go into denial in order to not feel guilty and

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.280
indict myself and other people?

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:54.280
I see.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:47:04.800
Well, this may be, you know, I mean, on this subject I feel that the causal links between

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:17.080
our behavior, fossil fuel addicted behavior and the differences to the climate have not

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:26.360
been established with the same spectacular public visibility as, for instance, the causal

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:36.760
links between nuclear power and the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki establish.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:44.320
The reason why we all know about the nuclear possibilities of nuclear disaster is that

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:52.480
the links, the causal links between our behavior and some disaster were completely, in fact,

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:59.040
spectacularly established in the nuclear case, there's still a matter of arcane knowledges

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:01.200
in the climate change case.

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.000
And that's the real problem.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.760
We just have not got the causal links established for the public mind everywhere.

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:18.760
And maybe we're doing this out of guilt and maybe there are people who are doing it willfully,

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:23.920
but corporations are paying people to hide the facts and so on.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.680
But by and large I think the real thing is to get the information out in a way that it

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.040
was out in the nuclear thing.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.720
Nobody denies that the knowledge is in the nuclear case.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.520
It's just different in the climate case.

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:45.160
And it took Hiroshima and Nagasaki to establish that causal link.

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:51.240
But I think that is a difference because the, I mean, changing our behavior with regard

01:48:51.240 --> 01:49:02.920
to fossil usage and climate change and ecology requires us to kind of change, I mean, the

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.320
things we like.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.720
It is the addiction issue.

01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:12.960
I mean, I like my cigarette and if I'm a drunk user, I need that and I don't want to

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960
change.

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:18.600
So, you know, if they tell me this is going to happen, I mean, we see it is happening

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:24.520
now, but you know, if it's still the powerful happen in 10 years, in 20 years.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.520
So why not cave in and just enjoy it?

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:29.520
That's absolutely true.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.720
I agree with you.

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.040
And I think what you mentioned of St. Paul actually goes back to this.

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:40.360
This is, if you put it that way, this is no different from the fact that most of us know

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:47.240
that if we fill our gut at every meal, we're going to die before we would if we didn't

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.840
do so.

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.840
And yet most of us do fill our gut.

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:56.560
So it's, the climate change case is not different once you describe it that way.

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:01.400
And in that sense, it's an irrationality of the kind that Paul and others mentioned,

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:02.400
right?

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.400
We know the better.

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.400
We do the worse.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.880
And also, in some sense, a perversion of what used to be rational, right?

01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:12.880
So it used to be the case that we should fill our gut at every meal because our meals didn't

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:15.120
come three times a day, right?

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.560
And likewise, the addictions to cigarettes.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:22.800
I mean, these are experiments that I have participated with and looked at in the groups

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.320
that I've worked with.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.560
Nicotine gets into your brain and it changes the chemistry fundamentally.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.480
And we have experiments, Terrell Rans and Reid Montague to my colleagues, Rann, that

01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.800
show that fundamental computations that are very important to how we learn new information.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.520
That representation in our brain is changed by these drugs of addiction.

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:52.320
And there's new work coming along where we're looking at how beliefs could either insulate

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.200
us from taking on new information or not, right?

01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.160
And I think as far as with the climate change issue, people know what's important to them

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:02.640
and their family.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:07.840
And that either insulates them from new information or allows them to bring it in.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:15.760
And I mean, if it's 50-50 split, it just gives you an idea of how the variety of beliefs

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.960
that we have will have an impact on what comes next.

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:27.360
It's a connection to free will, I think that it's not so clear to me.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:28.920
Okay, thank you.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:32.640
I just want to say thanks for having this discussion.

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:35.080
This is the most important topic in the history of time.

01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.240
So whoever's in charge here should have more free will discussions because there's no more

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:40.240
important topic.

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:41.520
I just want my name is Nick.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:46.920
I'm actually the producer of a TV show Wednesday, channel 56 time one.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.280
It's called free will question mark.

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:52.840
You debate free will every Wednesday at 11 K Blaxes Manhattan, George is my co-host over

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:53.840
there.

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.840
And he has a show on white planes.

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:55.840
I went back to my question.

01:51:55.840 --> 01:52:00.640
Can any of you geniuses who, all right, can any of you guys give me one example in your

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:05.280
entire life that was a free will decision or anybody in the audience?

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:09.720
Just give me one example of a free will decision.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.840
Coming here today.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.600
Was there a cause for that decision?

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.280
Was there a cause or a reason for that decision?

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:20.600
Well, there's, I'm an economist.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.720
So I think there's, that costs their benefits.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:26.280
I've balanced them and I made a decision.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:27.280
What's.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:28.280
So there was.

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.880
Or a reason to your decision.

01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:31.520
You just admitted it, right?

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.520
Yeah.

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.520
Yeah.

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.520
That cause and a cause to that cause.

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.400
You can regress your cause and cause will change back to the moment before you were

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.400
born.

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:40.400
We didn't self cause ourselves.

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:42.880
Our parents had sex.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.520
Therefore that's an easy reputation of free will.

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.720
I don't know what's so difficult for you to admit.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:51.160
So part of the cause was, was my own decision of my mind.

01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.400
Our self cause, you're a little guy, you're a first cause.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.360
You can cause things without any prior causation.

01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:56.800
Is that what you're telling me?

01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.800
No.

01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:58.800
So you're just saying.

01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.800
You jump in actually.

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:03.560
Wait, wait, so you said his decision to come here was a freely willed decision and it had

01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:04.560
a cause.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:06.560
You just said that, right?

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.560
Yeah.

01:53:07.560 --> 01:53:09.560
And that cause has a cause and that cause has a cause.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.080
Regressing back to the moment before you were conceived, before the planets were, you

01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.000
know, evolved before the big bang.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:20.280
The cause is, just because there are causes doesn't mean there.

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:21.280
I'll tell you what the cause is.

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:22.280
I know what the cause is.

01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.280
The cause is a cause.

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:27.720
It doesn't mean it's a determining cause.

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:35.240
You know, Leidenitz had a certain principle of sufficient reason and which he says, everything

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:41.080
that happens has a cause that actually determines it.

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.120
Some mechanics tells you that that law is false.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.120
It's simply false.

01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:49.120
Okay, so determinism or indeterminism does not prove free will.

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:50.960
I mean, if you make an indeterminism.

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:51.960
Wait a minute.

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:52.960
Wait a minute.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:59.280
So I'm just saying, you know, there are restrictions on my freedom.

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:04.160
Certainly I can't grow through that wall even if I want to because it won't stop.

01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.640
It'll stop me from going through it.

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.240
On the other hand, I can walk around in the room.

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:14.960
I mean, just because it's not a question of randomness or complete free will or what

01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:22.080
have you versus completely determined things by causes.

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:30.520
There's a whole complex of causes that says, I'm going to marry this woman determining

01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:31.520
some of them not.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.400
I want to make this more simple.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.400
Okay.

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.400
I don't know any of you guys.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.680
The cause is always the pleasure principle, otherwise not as hedonic imperative.

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.480
You're always predicting what will give you the most amount of pleasure and the least

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:43.920
amount of pain.

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.520
So that's the cause for every decision.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:48.520
You have no choice but to do that.

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:49.520
No free will.

01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.720
I don't know why we have to have.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:51.880
That's your theory.

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:52.880
But I think we can.

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.760
I think I'll be happy to.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:57.560
It's after the meeting.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.120
But I think so.

01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.640
You're going to tell me how I can promise you after the meeting.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:06.160
After the meeting you and I will discuss it.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.480
My thing is every cause is going toward your every human being has no choice but to attempt

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.480
to go.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.480
No, I heard that.

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.480
I heard that.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:14.480
So no.

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:17.040
The belief in free will is very harmful.

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:18.040
It's very toxic.

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.800
It makes people hate other people.

01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.000
It causes suicide.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.480
People want to punish themselves because they think they could have done otherwise which

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.200
is obviously BS.

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.480
And it makes people feel like failures when they fail at something.

01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:31.000
I think whoever believes in free will needs to take a hard look in the mirror and just

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.320
know that you believe in free will because you have no choice but to do what makes you

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.680
feel best about yourself for going toward the part of the way.

01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:37.680
Thank you.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.680
Next question.

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.680
Hello hello.

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:40.680
He's constrained to do it, right?

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:41.680
Yeah.

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.680
Everything alone.

01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.680
It makes people hate their personal history as a conditioner.

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.680
The next question.

01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.680
Next question.

01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:49.680
Okay.

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:58.040
So that was a perfect segue for me.

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.040
My name is Sheila Meats.

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:01.600
Okay.

01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.680
And I do this work as a profession.

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:06.240
I've done thousands of sessions.

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:13.240
And what some people here may know about energy psychology is what we're learning as all negative

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:19.520
emotion comes from a disturbed energy field and tapping on certain points while we hold

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.760
consciousness in mind to tuning it to an issue actually brings it up to the surface.

01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:32.720
And what I have found is that there has been no evidence of free will from my work with

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:38.080
my clients because once I clear whether we talk about the information or morphogenetic

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.040
fields that you may know about as a scientist from Bruce Lipton's information on cellular

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:48.920
biology wherever you go with that, once we find that information and we remove that information

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.560
that person starts unfolding in different behavior.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.160
So it's still on some level determinism.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:59.680
But what I'd like to do is talk about the spiritual aspect.

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:02.160
And I'm probably going to be a pain in the buck is every time I'm going to come here,

01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.040
I'm going to talk about spirituality.

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.680
But I feel like people aren't talking about it enough.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:10.680
As far as first cause is concerned is being pleasure.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.840
That's a possibility.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.760
That's certainly a belief.

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:16.120
But I'm going to go beyond that.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:18.400
And I really want to hear what you have to say.

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.400
And I'll sit.

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:26.320
But I had an enlightenment experience that deeply changed my life where I got to experience

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.920
myself as that or as God or divine or whatever.

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:38.600
And what I want to say is and hear what you have to say is if there is nothing but God

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:45.680
creator divine and God contains all that there is to be known and nature is God expressing

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:53.600
as law and law runs everything which is sentient and non-sentient isn't that determinism.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:58:00.280
Isn't it possible that free will is essential in us so that we as God expressing itself

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:05.080
will be able to abandon oneself to egoic experience?

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.080
Thank you.

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:09.080
You're wonderful.

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:16.920
The interesting thing is if God is the all determining cause you could just quote one

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:23.040
of these interesting by the versus where it says yes but God created human beings in God's

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.040
image.

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:30.160
So we have part of the part of this divine capacity to choose also.

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:36.800
And you know of course, in theology God is the supreme free will and that is no our free

01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:38.600
will like that.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:44.600
And then you have and you see there are this is what this is why I am not a systematic

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.680
theologian but a biblical scholar.

01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:55.040
So my area is the Bible because this there is something else in storytelling than in constructing

01:58:55.040 --> 01:58:58.600
dogmatic big buildings.

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.320
Stories tell things from the one side and from the other side.

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:08.640
So you have a story where you hear that human beings are there to rule the earth and even

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:14.200
subdue it which is a little bit horrible in light of contemporary concerns but they are

01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:15.760
there they have free will.

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:23.320
The next story you read that is Genesis one Genesis two human beings are there and to

01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.040
preserve the earth.

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.600
No freedom at all.

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:32.040
They have just to kind of to accept their role as stewards of creation and they have

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:35.320
to and what is necessary.

01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:42.840
So how do you reconcile the two and yeah by telling stories and stories like that that

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:49.480
change you or you know and and I am kind of I'm finding these stories very interesting

01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:55.560
what we tell each other about the moments where we we were not following the pleasure

01:59:55.560 --> 02:00:00.280
principle but did I follow the pleasure principle in coming here.

02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:06.800
No I was scared to death because I never really thought about free will you know this is not

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:14.440
my area you know I feel uncomfortable but I thought it is important and you see the

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:20.880
moment when we went out go out of our way and do something that we think is necessary.

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:26.280
This is why I'm interested in silence and in your I mean these kind of switches that

02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:35.200
happen when we change the cause of our own habits and habitus and and kind of go into

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:40.840
a different mode and maybe look more at the other than at ourselves and all that.

02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:46.920
I think and these things happen I know they happen so but you know this is what I think

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:55.400
is free will becomes a power that can change things and that's what I'm interested in here.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.200
Thank you.

02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:05.720
You know Isaac Bashaevis Simba said we must believe in free will we have no choice.

02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:15.480
I want to preface my comments and questions with a statement that I appreciate everything

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:21.720
and everyone on the panel said today so this is a respectful if I have criticism it's respectful

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:25.200
it's not meant to be negative.

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:26.960
A little bit about myself undergraduate.

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.800
Keep in mind we have four other people.

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:30.240
I do that much time.

02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:33.160
You don't have to worry about me being the case I'm very to the point.

02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.840
So I appreciated that gentleman's passion and to the point.

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.800
My undergraduate molecular biologist from MIT JDMBA year spent at Penn Medical School.

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:47.400
I loved hearing all the comments reminded me of grad school.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.880
Unfortunately it also reminded me of the fact that you guys are so brilliant that you're

02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:57.080
talking up here and for the rest of us unfortunately it's very difficult because you're not defining

02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.920
what you're operating terms are.

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.480
What is pre-determinism versus free will.

02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:05.800
Dr. Cochin obviously a brilliant mathematician I appreciate that.

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:12.640
I spent time on the trading floor as a market maker and I understand probabilistic theory

02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:19.200
but are we saying that free will it has to be a conscious decision in our own rational

02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:22.280
best interest given what our probabilities are.

02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.880
We never really nail that down.

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:30.920
So I to to the point shortly I have two very concrete questions.

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:36.840
One is and my almost respect to philosophy I think this is a philosophical exercise.

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:39.440
Philosophy informs everything we do.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:45.720
My first question is, is this a philosophical exercise what is the purpose because from

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.320
my point of view people are rational beings.

02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:52.360
But they don't always behave rationally.

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:55.280
So you cannot always predict their behavior.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.920
Dr. Kribal I'm sure you would agree economists have this problem.

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:03.520
Keynesian economists have had problems with the economy all over the world.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:08.600
We're looking at a currency crash and I'm not getting political but the Austrians their

02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:12.640
main criticism is you can't quantify all human behavior.

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.640
People are rational beings but they also act with passion and irrationally.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:22.080
I was saying to my colleague that maybe someone who would be very good on this panel would

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:24.520
be someone from the intelligence operations community.

02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:28.760
They have to use game theory to predict human behavior.

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:34.560
Both in populations and excuse me let me just let me just let me let me tell you you have

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.960
two concrete questions.

02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:38.680
I would like you to ask those two concrete questions.

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:43.880
I don't want you to expand on them because we have other people and then we have I limited

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:44.880
time.

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.240
And I don't know your name I don't know your background sir.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:54.120
So intelligence community has failed to predict several instances.

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.680
Economists has failed.

02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.080
Do you acknowledge that this is a useful exercise?

02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.400
Interesting.

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:09.240
But there is no concrete end point in this because unfortunately you cannot always predict

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:13.880
human behavior and you I'll put it in more concrete terms in experimental design.

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:19.240
In experimental design it is important to define your independent as well as your dependent

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:20.240
variables.

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:21.720
This is multifactorial.

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.600
If we want to talk about photons all day long we could.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.600
Certainly there's an effect.

02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:28.240
The sum of those effects does it affect us?

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.400
Yes.

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:34.200
What is the point of the exercise and what are your operating definitions?

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:37.000
It's a why and I don't mean to be disrespectful.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.080
I really just want to understand.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.080
Thank you.

02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:41.080
The why is important.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:46.840
But as far as I'm concerned let me try to answer.

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:51.400
Talk about prediction and of course it's very close to related to the issue of free will.

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:54.600
If there's free will then there's no prediction whenever there's human behavior.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:05:01.200
I actually think the distinction or the distance between human based endeavors like economics

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:08.000
and non-behavioral endeavors like physics or thermodynamics or what have you is smaller

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.280
than distance between simple models and complex models.

02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:17.960
Simple models in economics for example studying treasury bill auctions when people do models

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:23.840
of that they actually pretty good fairly accurate in predicting price levels and trade volumes.

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:29.120
If models trying to predict the economy which is an incredibly complex system we do very

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:30.120
poorly.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:36.440
The thing is true in fact if you think about it nowadays with physical sciences it's very

02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:41.320
easy to have laboratory models of Newtonian classic mechanics that are extremely good

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.760
at predicting whatever you want to predict but we still cannot successfully predict whether

02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:47.720
more than five or six days.

02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.720
Why?

02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.160
Because it's an incredibly complex model.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:54.960
So I don't think it's so much an issue about I don't think free will in here displaying

02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:59.640
a very important role it's more a matter of model complexity that's the economist answer

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:00.640
to that.

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:01.640
Thank you.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:02.640
Thank you.

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:06.600
As a biologist it reminds me of nature versus nurture it's interesting but thank you for

02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:08.640
everything you've done.

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.640
Okay.

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:15.280
Thank you so much for your round table this is wonderful.

02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:24.400
What is your definition each of you of will not free will but will and how does it exclude

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:35.080
animals or exclude animals it's been a very it's it was brought up briefly but just how

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:39.760
does it exclude animals or does it.

02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:45.000
So I'll just start with my shared confusion I think on what we mean by free will and we

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:50.680
talk about it being ambiguous or what is it exactly right so.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:57.040
For me when I think about this question I actually set it aside because the notion of

02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:02.640
free will or will it could be choice it could be intent to choose it could be a whole range

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:08.840
of things that we all as individuals kind of share some stake in with the definition ends

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:09.840
up being.

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:13.800
But what it is we're talking about when we talk about free will is how do people make

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:20.800
choices where do those choices come from what motivates them and so for me as a neurologist

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:27.000
I study that behavior I study the organism which we call humans and I give them choices

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:35.560
and I study their brain activity and so so the idea of a will or free will is a provocative

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:41.240
concept and it has used to discuss these kinds of things but what I'm interested when I think

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:46.920
about that is our capacity for choice in what controls that.

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:55.280
I do think that's a very important and I think I'm not going to say anything about the will

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:59.560
because I think the issue can be raised by just talking about freedom and not talking

02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:05.400
about some particular faculty called the will.

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:14.000
And this sort of sums up I guess my angle on many of the interesting things that have

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:20.840
come up in what have surfaced and what my colleagues have said.

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:32.080
You see I completely agree that in the end this is a special topic within the larger

02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:41.680
problem of the mind-body problem and I agree with people like Libet they're not really

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:51.080
with the conclusions he becomes to on that particular evidence that he provides but I

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:58.320
generally agree with the view that there is a real sense in which if you talk about the

02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:07.880
dispositions of an animal's mind which yield the animals behavior and you talk about the

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:15.440
dispositions of bodies whether animals are human beings there is bound to be a reduction

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:23.280
in some sense of the dispositions the mental dispositions to the physical dispositions.

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:31.960
So if there is freedom and if the mind is in some way not in these ways dependent on

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:41.440
or reducible to the dispositions of the body it can only be I think it carries the mind

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:46.440
contains an element that is normative.

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:52.560
If you think of the mind human beings or animals or if you think of human beings as being just

02:09:52.560 --> 02:10:00.080
like animals then the mind has tendencies just because they are mental tendencies rather

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:06.120
than bodily or physical tendencies doesn't mean that they are outside of nature.

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:13.720
So if nature is deterministic and not as you suggest it is if nature is deterministic then

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:20.560
the mind because if it contains nothing but natural tendencies is determined and there

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:28.320
is no sense as you have been saying but if the mind contains a normative element that

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:35.520
is when people so suppose an animal has its behavior it does something it's frustrated

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:41.080
it changes to something else you might think well that's animal rationality well maybe

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:47.560
it is animal rationality but the animal doesn't change the behavior by thinking what I did

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:55.160
was wrong there is no normative element right it just gets frustrated and it moves to something

02:10:55.160 --> 02:11:02.040
else that's not normative in the full fled sense of thinking this was wrong I ought to

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:09.600
do this it's normativity of that kind which I think is not possessed by animals it's

02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:16.720
possessed only by us and that's what I think if anything shows that the mind is not just

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:21.360
tendencies in nature but it's such a part.

02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:28.960
You know the question of will really touches on the psychology question of motivation but

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:36.000
Rob and I both of us stayed out of this discussion because we didn't want to bring that in.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Which I not to get tongue tight here.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:48.360
Most of the dialogue was focused kind of from this anthropomorphic viewpoint on specifically

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:53.720
around the problems concerning the individual.

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.680
I think that's maybe because like the first step is to conquer this idea of losing our

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:07.400
self or our dualist intuitions that we have this kind of privileged seat in the Cartesian

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:15.840
theater and that science can't probe the subjective but and I think that's my maybe it's a language

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:21.040
thing that if we develop the language but my question what I was interested in more so

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:28.640
was supposing that we can overcome that for the moment and suspend our disbelief.

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:36.760
Move away from this anthropomorphic perspective on free will and think about it.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:43.640
Kind of superhuman and purely materialistic level.

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:53.280
The question is is matter moving towards and possibly if it's not capable of achieving

02:12:53.280 --> 02:13:05.240
free will and would that be a kind of way to move towards a kind of designed determinism

02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:10.440
in a way that makes any sense.

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.360
Who can take them this?

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:19.760
So one of the things that I tried to put forth and the way that I see the progress of science

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:25.040
on these kinds of problems is that as we learn how the system operates right our brain, our

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:32.480
bodies and system it gives us new options right so so there's lots of ways in which we

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:35.840
might not be able to make a choice that we might be constrained.

02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:38.000
One of them is that we don't know what the options are.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.560
If you don't know the option you don't ever have the option to make that choice.

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:49.760
So as we learn about what guides our choice behavior what constrains that we can have

02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:54.760
longer term goals where we can intervene on that and actually the space of possibilities

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.280
right.

02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:05.640
We do that by inventing new medicines or new technologies that give us 10 years ago.

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:11.120
In some sense we are increasing for our species the options going forth.

02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:15.320
Some of them might not.

02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:17.320
Thank you.

02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:29.760
Hi, well there's been a very constructive flow of ideas.

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:31.560
I'm an undergraduate student and I'm really interested in artificial intelligence and

02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:38.800
its impact on future upcoming technologies and especially more so how is quantum theory

02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.520
going to I won't say determine but anticipate these future technologies and the impact on

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:58.240
our society and do you think that if given unlimited resources and unlimited I guess the

02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:04.280
ultimate proficiency in algorithms could we create a machine that's capable of replicating

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:08.680
itself enough to maybe free willing.

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:18.680
Actually, so there is just within the last month or two is a paper study published by

02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:25.520
a team at Google where they've developed an algorithm that could basically human level

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:28.080
control in the context of a video game space.

02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:34.880
So it's a really interesting development kind of a cute experiment so they have their algorithm

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:41.800
play Atari 2600 games and they basically give the algorithm very little information about

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.960
as much information as you might have coming into a game and the algorithm can learn how

02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:51.240
to play it to the level of a professional game tester with not better on some of the

02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:52.240
games.

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:58.200
And so the report is called human level control through this deep reinforcement learning algorithm

02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:05.760
and this is a the core of the algorithm is something that we look at how mammalian brains

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.280
and actually other systems do learn.

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:14.760
And so here it's not going to necessarily quantum level depictions but this is just

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:20.000
a computation that this algorithm is able to execute where it's able to learn from its

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:27.760
environment and feedback to the level of how you and I might play a video game.

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:34.480
So I mean if you're interested in that you should look at that.

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.640
So I mean I have a point of view in what I've said that the idea of free will isn't necessarily

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.080
a useful one for the world we're actually interested in studying here.

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.760
What we're interested in is how do humans behave?

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:47.280
What's the sources of that?

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.360
Whether it's free that's not necessarily useful.

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:54.040
All of our choices are constrained.

02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:58.800
We're biologically so there are constraints there's limits to that.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:03.760
Now that we can get a computer algorithm to display a level of control that a human can

02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:09.760
within that environment I think is an interesting kind of demonstration of where technology

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:10.760
is going.

02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:12.760
It does provide by the way I think an interesting test.

02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.440
I don't know if you could run that test if you had a very large number of such highly

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:24.640
evolved artificial intelligence and intelligence beings.

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.720
It would be interesting to see whether there was any distinctive feature in their behavior

02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:32.480
vis-a-vis humans in a variety of situations.

02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:37.960
I think it would be an interesting test for at least some notion of free will.

02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:40.960
If the answer is no then I would say that there is no free will as we're defining it

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:41.960
in here.

02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:45.560
As at least as I was thinking of defining it I think.

02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:52.560
Okay thank you very much.
