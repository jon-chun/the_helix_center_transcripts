WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.440
Are you ready?

00:14.440 --> 00:19.320
I'm the associate director of the center.

00:19.320 --> 00:26.400
Before I introduce the participants of today's round table, I have two brief announcements.

00:26.400 --> 00:36.720
One is that the next program on the beauty and unity of mathematics is on December 1.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.600
And then on December 15, it's a program on animal consciousness.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.480
And then other programs you will see if you go to the website.

00:47.480 --> 00:51.840
I will make a very brief introduction of the participants today.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.400
If you want more information on them, you go to our website.

00:55.400 --> 01:02.800
There's a detailed bio there.

01:02.800 --> 01:09.640
Michael first, who is sitting right there, is professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia

01:09.640 --> 01:11.840
University.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.960
Laura Hirschbein is professor of psychiatry at University of Michigan.

01:16.960 --> 01:22.800
Francis Lee is the chair of the department of psychiatry at Cornell Medical, Cornell

01:22.800 --> 01:24.280
Medicine.

01:24.280 --> 01:31.480
Robert Michaels is the Wach McDermott University professor of medicine at psychiatry at Wyl Cornell.

01:31.480 --> 01:38.800
And Miklo Stott is the neuroscientist professor of pharmacology at Wyl Cornell.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.320
So as you know, the format is a spontaneous conversation amongst the participants.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.320
Thank you.

01:44.320 --> 02:13.040
Who wants to get the going?

02:13.040 --> 02:17.360
Well, we were just talking a minute ago before everybody started about the fact that I'm

02:17.360 --> 02:23.880
a historian and I'm the only woman and the only non-New Yorker, so I guess I have a perspective.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.000
But we were talking about wondering whether the history should start first if we're looking

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
to the future.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.240
But the problem with starting in the past is if you're imagining a narrative, do we want

02:34.240 --> 02:39.800
the way people tend to use history is to tell the story about the president.

02:39.800 --> 02:45.080
Are we talking about the past as the battle days that are leading to the future with new

02:45.080 --> 02:50.360
discoveries, new advances, new neuroscience, new whatever, or are we going to use the past

02:50.360 --> 02:54.840
to tell a story of decline that we've lost track of the things that we used to do that

02:54.840 --> 03:01.800
we used to do well and now we're in soulless territory of just symptom counting with due

03:01.800 --> 03:05.360
appreciation to DSM.

03:05.360 --> 03:13.000
So you can use the history to tell the story of decline, the story of progress, or as I

03:13.000 --> 03:17.160
tend to see it, the story of things that continue, the themes that come up over and over and

03:17.160 --> 03:21.120
over and over again.

03:21.120 --> 03:27.840
The things that we discover and rediscover, we discover brains, we discover symptoms,

03:27.840 --> 03:32.320
we discover statistics, I'm reading a great book on the history of statistics now that

03:32.320 --> 03:39.040
it points out that we psychiatrists were doing statistical counting in the 17th century.

03:39.040 --> 03:45.200
And so the idea of counting and looking at numbers is not new.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.720
We humans like to do that.

03:46.720 --> 03:55.080
The first step of trying to understand things is to put some order in things that hopefully

03:55.080 --> 03:57.280
patterns will emerge and will have understanding.

03:57.280 --> 04:03.760
So that's what going on for a very long time and that continues to be the main way everybody

04:03.760 --> 04:08.760
wonders in the DSM diagnostic statistical manual, what was the statistical part?

04:08.760 --> 04:12.680
And that was because it originally was used for collecting statistics in mental hospitals

04:12.680 --> 04:18.160
and nowadays I guess you could argue the coding allows people to collect statistics but that's

04:18.160 --> 04:21.680
really the only reason they keep the assets for historical reasons.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.240
It's a well-known document.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.240
It's really not a statistical anymore but you're right.

04:25.240 --> 04:30.720
The idea of starting out by the DSM unfortunately remains a descriptive observational system

04:30.720 --> 04:37.160
with almost no depth to it at all and people have criticized it for that reason which is

04:37.160 --> 04:41.000
certainly a valid criticism but it remains useful because there's no alternative.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.560
It's always the thing when somebody trashes the DSM it's okay so what do you want to replace

04:45.560 --> 04:46.560
it with?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.960
It usually don't get much response.

04:48.960 --> 04:55.960
So it's incredibly limited but it continues despite all of the advances in neuroscience

04:55.960 --> 05:00.520
and everything else it continues to have value as an organizing principle.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.440
It's very limited.

05:02.440 --> 05:08.600
I think the perspective actually is very useful.

05:08.600 --> 05:15.520
I remember 15 years ago I think when Paul the Genius came out I'm looking at everything

05:15.520 --> 05:24.520
from the basic science point you have to just a disclaimer but I remember that one of the

05:24.520 --> 05:30.320
traction of what this field is that this new genes came out and everybody believed that

05:30.320 --> 05:35.240
after a while we will be able to explain some of the symptoms and maybe actually we can

05:35.240 --> 05:40.600
define a certain disease based on diseases, disease genes.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.840
And historically now we know that it's actually absolutely another case.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.280
If anything it's even more complicated.

05:47.280 --> 05:53.640
So I've been struggling with this in my whole lab and in the university that how actually

05:53.640 --> 05:59.760
to solve that problem and we can discuss it later but obviously we have to move out from

05:59.760 --> 06:05.440
the single gene and even multiple gene because we have to understand how the environment

06:05.440 --> 06:11.520
is really impinging on this whole gene network and if you have time maybe discuss about that.

06:11.520 --> 06:16.440
I think still the genome is a hope that the genome can or epigenome rather can explain

06:16.440 --> 06:19.000
a lot of things.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.720
So historically I think we really moved a lot from genes and now we have the epigenome

06:24.720 --> 06:29.920
and hopefully we have some chance to get a little bit deeper into this how because that's

06:29.920 --> 06:35.880
still yes we are in a very simple case we have an epigenome now but like in the 780

06:35.880 --> 06:41.440
90s that we have a lot of things but we don't understand how they work together how to interact.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.960
But I think it's a little bit more bad execution now we have more players so it's almost

06:45.960 --> 06:48.160
that we need another level of understanding.

06:48.160 --> 06:55.720
I think we do know more I'm also a neuroscientist and I was just out of symposium at Cornell

06:55.720 --> 07:01.680
and yesterday and from a lot of different neuroscientists I was coming from the sound

07:01.680 --> 07:11.440
of the video and was actually clear it was muffled here too.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.000
Is this better?

07:13.000 --> 07:22.720
Is it really or not actually much closer to understanding the pathophysiologists like

07:22.720 --> 07:27.680
yeah this order despite the hundreds of genes that have now been found.

07:27.680 --> 07:33.560
The best example I was at this meeting was that the success story now the best success

07:33.560 --> 07:35.840
story in psychiatry is autism.

07:35.840 --> 07:44.920
99 genes will now have met genome wide significance very penetrative high effect sizes they account

07:44.920 --> 07:50.480
for 1% or less than 1% all autism in this population.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.720
But each of these papers is a nature paper.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.320
This is considered the best advance of what we can do at this point.

07:58.320 --> 08:03.120
And it's actually not clear how to move forward and I think this is something that I struggle

08:03.120 --> 08:04.120
with also.

08:04.120 --> 08:13.160
It's just that the hope as Miklo said was that 20 years ago or 30 years ago was just

08:13.160 --> 08:19.720
like in pulmonology or nephrology we could just get a bunch of genes and then be able

08:19.720 --> 08:28.440
to move forward and what's clear is that this is not a linear path.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.720
The brain is probably more complicated.

08:30.720 --> 08:38.600
There's some number like 150,000 or 150 trillion synapses.

08:38.600 --> 08:45.240
This is just us for us to think that a single gene or 100 genes could help explaining this

08:45.240 --> 08:47.520
is going to be difficult to answer.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.320
It was very sobering meeting.

08:50.320 --> 08:56.320
But if I may just to defect that so basically I think it's specific issues like 15 years

08:56.320 --> 09:01.640
ago in the Facebook was or Amazon started.

09:01.640 --> 09:06.200
So basically the idea if you think about it is that you get all of this information,

09:06.200 --> 09:11.000
they collect information, personal information and 15 years ago they just started.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.080
Now they have a tremendous amount of information and that's for me to ask.

09:17.080 --> 09:23.240
Now they have arguments that they can actually figure out what next move is and maybe send

09:23.240 --> 09:28.640
you an advertisement and we want to say that's saying some pet food or something because

09:28.640 --> 09:32.800
you know that you have a pet at home and more complex.

09:32.800 --> 09:37.760
So I was thinking maybe that kind of strategy because we have now genes, epigenomes and

09:37.760 --> 09:39.080
a lot of that low side.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
We have thousands of tests.

09:41.080 --> 09:46.560
So how to put together all of individual players as they would pull out the society

09:46.560 --> 09:52.160
to a comprehensive understanding of how the society works and how the brain works.

09:52.160 --> 09:56.600
But I was just thinking another day about this but it's still probably not the right

09:56.600 --> 10:00.680
template because it's a very two-dimensional of what they do.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.280
They just collect and they can interpret.

10:03.280 --> 10:09.320
What our problem is that we have multidimensional, we have genes, then we have synapses, connectivity,

10:09.320 --> 10:14.360
then we have circuit functions and then behavior which is very elusive.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.680
But most people work at that level.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.840
So I think it has to be something where you could integrate these data sets like the

10:22.840 --> 10:30.840
UN and Facebook interface but sets but you would be able to actually in a 3D almost fashion

10:30.840 --> 10:35.600
to integrate all of this information to a comprehensive understanding of the brain.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.840
I have no idea what basically I'm talking about here but I'm just basically saying that

10:39.840 --> 10:46.160
it's just something which will be the next most of time this research you don't really

10:46.160 --> 10:51.240
know what is the next big step but if something has to be very beyond this two-dimensional

10:51.240 --> 10:54.360
understanding what we have now and probably nobody knows this.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.120
It's just somebody will come up.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.720
So that's why I think it's a good idea to invest NIH and IMH puts a lot of money in

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
these things.

11:01.720 --> 11:06.720
There are a couple of people now, artificial intelligence comes in.

11:06.720 --> 11:12.160
So maybe something is coming out but we don't know what it is and unfortunately we will

11:12.160 --> 11:19.360
not be able to answer the future if I can't see I'm afraid but we just have to put money

11:19.360 --> 11:27.040
and then beating 14 internet as a concept to coming out from this and I don't see it

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
yet.

11:28.040 --> 11:36.680
I'm not for the major conditions let's say bipolar disorder or schizophrenia for example.

11:36.680 --> 11:49.440
Are the studies focused on finding out what causes the condition or are the studies also

11:49.440 --> 11:55.560
focused on dissecting it into the symptoms and trying to figure out what causes each

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
symptom?

11:56.560 --> 12:04.040
I think at this point the main, at least from what I can get, the main thrust where the

12:04.040 --> 12:11.760
money is going is collecting as many samples as possible to get hundreds of thousands of

12:11.760 --> 12:18.480
samples of biological samples from ME, DNA and other and to try to do large statistical

12:18.480 --> 12:25.240
analysis essentially genome-wide associations and they've succeeded in finding now over

12:25.240 --> 12:32.240
200 schizophrenia genes accounting again for low percentages of the risk, like 0.5% of

12:32.240 --> 12:34.840
the risk for schizophrenia.

12:34.840 --> 12:41.680
They just completed in England a study where they took 100,000 people with depression and

12:41.680 --> 12:46.920
they were able to find 50 genes that looked like they might be affected.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.960
15, 5, 0.

12:48.960 --> 12:56.360
Again, low effect sizes for each of these but essentially this is where efforts are to.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.400
Again this is sort of like counting, it's sort of like they just want to accumulate as

13:00.400 --> 13:06.560
many potential genes that might be a risk gene at this point and these are still early

13:06.560 --> 13:08.840
days I would say.

13:08.840 --> 13:15.320
20 years ago there was, there were none so if you divide by zero this is infinitely

13:15.320 --> 13:16.320
better.

13:16.320 --> 13:22.880
If you say 50 genes are responsible for the depression then what?

13:22.880 --> 13:27.560
But they account for so little of the risk so it's sort of like it's a small effect size

13:27.560 --> 13:34.120
so that there is a, the best example is one of the genes is a glutamate receptor which

13:34.120 --> 13:38.720
makes somewhat sense glutamate receptors are everywhere now.

13:38.720 --> 13:44.200
So but the problem, this one glutamate receptor they found is that it's everywhere.

13:44.200 --> 13:51.440
So how you're going to actually target a drug to or something like that is going to be very

13:51.440 --> 13:52.440
difficult.

13:52.440 --> 13:57.520
Drug companies have been targeting this class of receptors already so in many ways we know

13:57.520 --> 14:02.920
that this demiurs are stuck then with them again the complexity of the nervous system

14:02.920 --> 14:10.080
in the brain and then even if we have one hit that makes some sense it's still very hard

14:10.080 --> 14:11.640
to move forward.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.680
You know it's interesting thinking about all of this data because again this brings

14:15.680 --> 14:19.600
me back to this book I'm reading on the history of statistics and statistics in psychiatry

14:19.600 --> 14:23.480
in particular where they were drowning in data in the 19th century.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.760
You know one of the, one of Emil Cropelen's arguments was that he was spending all of

14:27.760 --> 14:28.760
his time with data.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.720
He had so much data he didn't know what to do with it and obviously we have a better

14:32.720 --> 14:38.000
capacity for managing data but the thing that came after all of this data gathering in the

14:38.000 --> 14:42.880
early 20th century was Freud and psychoanalysis has said okay we're not going to talk about

14:42.880 --> 14:46.520
these big groups we're going to talk about one person and we're going to talk about how

14:46.520 --> 14:51.880
what makes up this one person and how this one person's inner conflicts manifested in

14:51.880 --> 14:58.280
these symptoms or these experiences and so I'm wondering if the future maybe if somebody

14:58.280 --> 15:02.840
gets to the point where we have all this data and it's little pixels and it's everywhere

15:02.840 --> 15:06.560
and it doesn't cohere to a particular picture that we're going to have another wave of people

15:06.560 --> 15:11.480
saying no actually what we need are individuals, individual relationships.

15:11.480 --> 15:16.640
You know we're spending all of our time bumping into people as we're looking on our phones

15:16.640 --> 15:21.320
not engaging with people or we're going to have a backlash where maybe psychiatrists

15:21.320 --> 15:25.920
will leave maybe will follow to say no actually what we need to do is work on interpersonal

15:25.920 --> 15:31.720
interactions and that one patient again and go back in a different way.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
I don't know.

15:32.720 --> 15:35.360
Have we stopped doing that now?

15:35.360 --> 15:37.280
According to some of our patients we have.

15:37.280 --> 15:44.480
I think it's really they are not exclusive and they absolutely you have to just do both.

15:44.480 --> 15:51.280
We do certainly the last day but in the clinics you do certainly the individual but they

15:51.280 --> 15:58.280
our our goal is really to understand the basic framework of a disease rather than an individual

15:58.280 --> 16:07.240
and maybe how an individual can end up with a disease phenotype from this overall concept

16:07.240 --> 16:11.200
and you are more interested in obviously why this person got that but I think it's just

16:11.200 --> 16:15.880
the two sides of the same story and we just have to do both.

16:15.880 --> 16:20.920
There's an interesting sort of like similar backlash going right now in this other field

16:20.920 --> 16:26.120
of systems neuroscience where people thought that you just need your image more people

16:26.120 --> 16:30.840
and as they're going through various tasks or even whether sitting just to look at their

16:30.840 --> 16:35.560
connect their brain connectome just as a to bring everyone up to speed.

16:35.560 --> 16:41.560
Twenty years ago it was found that the brain actually organized itself into sort of like

16:41.560 --> 16:45.920
hubs within their in the brain and you can actually just get a right what they call a

16:45.920 --> 16:51.840
resting state without any task you can actually get a scan and actually see these hugs in

16:51.840 --> 16:59.240
the brain and this is the work of Marcus Rakel at Washington University and people were fascinated

16:59.240 --> 17:02.800
by this and no one has really been able to sort of understand how is it that you can

17:02.800 --> 17:08.800
measure blood flow in the brain and actually see these self organized networks and and

17:08.800 --> 17:14.600
so then everyone got excited and just kept on collecting thousands and thousands of

17:14.600 --> 17:20.440
scans so now we have hundreds of thousands of scans within studies now at WashU where

17:20.440 --> 17:28.880
Marcus was there they now decided that everyone's network is individualized everyone's brain

17:28.880 --> 17:34.600
is that when you average it you get some average of brain that looks like no brain on the planet

17:34.600 --> 17:39.560
earth so now what they're doing is that they're they're actually taking individuals and actually

17:39.560 --> 17:45.360
just scanning them over and over again for example during the course of depression or

17:45.360 --> 17:52.200
during something so they can scan them at the height of symptom pathology and then at

17:52.200 --> 17:56.440
some other point when they're not so I think this is the goal now that that you might want

17:56.440 --> 18:02.440
to basically go back to into and then learn something from these individuals in a way that

18:02.440 --> 18:04.920
that they're not they're not been thought of before.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.560
I think there's a there have been some drug studies on that that this end of one studies

18:08.560 --> 18:14.400
where you you take a single person is the study and how they interact with medication

18:14.400 --> 18:17.360
and that's sort of this new thing that's being there.

18:17.360 --> 18:21.960
There's so many individual differences this is essentially this is that you can't the

18:21.960 --> 18:26.400
principles that even of trying to put together a brain connectome is very difficult even

18:26.400 --> 18:31.640
though NIH is spending lots of money on these connectome projects that ultimately you it

18:31.640 --> 18:35.760
might actually just sort of like you sort of like if you want to understand fruit you

18:35.760 --> 18:38.760
don't blend it together.

18:38.760 --> 18:44.240
I believe that response is a little bit simpler because then you ask the question why this

18:44.240 --> 18:50.360
drug is actually working in one individual actually understand the pharmacology of that

18:50.360 --> 18:55.440
based on an enzyme which is either stronger or weaker in certain individuals it's called

18:55.440 --> 19:01.960
seep enzymes but basically they just metabolize the drug many times this is crucial so and

19:01.960 --> 19:07.440
we can even now a patient can be screened because it's genetically based one can take

19:07.440 --> 19:13.920
a sample from blood and it's every cell is the same and we can basically figure out

19:13.920 --> 19:20.360
that it's a fast metabolizer a slow metabolizer and maybe that's the reason somebody is actually

19:20.360 --> 19:26.440
a side effects or another person does not respond and it's just a dose relationship

19:26.440 --> 19:32.760
so that that maybe somewhat easier to understand than what the underlying cause which could

19:32.760 --> 19:38.440
be thousands of different ways but I still believe that there's a still something common

19:38.440 --> 19:45.760
feature or features that it is a circuitry I kind of start to believe in circuitry no

19:45.760 --> 19:51.480
nobody's but maybe it's just to be as it's fashionable but but circuitry in animal models

19:51.480 --> 19:57.040
at least you can understand how the circuitry can be linked to a certain behavior we can

19:57.040 --> 20:01.600
model the circuitry we can activate we can deactivate certain very different secondary

20:01.600 --> 20:08.960
even we can we can tailor we call it synaptic transmission in certain areas of brain and

20:08.960 --> 20:15.840
we can we can't respond but of course after below and underneath there's a lot of genes

20:15.840 --> 20:23.920
and synapse and other things you just don't really understand I'm gonna go back to where

20:23.920 --> 20:32.080
we started and be a little provocative to me psychiatry's defined like all medical

20:32.080 --> 20:40.520
specialties as everything that's relevant to helping people with a certain kind of problem

20:40.520 --> 20:49.720
and the neuroscience research base that we've been talking about is fascinating exciting

20:49.720 --> 20:59.280
intriguing and essentially totally irrelevant to helping any living patient it may have

20:59.280 --> 21:05.280
some hope for the future although a possible outcome of the work is that this strategy

21:05.280 --> 21:12.840
won't lead to anything helpful for patients or maybe to some modest twists on some of

21:12.840 --> 21:21.080
our current drugs almost all of our current biologic treatments were discovered by happen

21:21.080 --> 21:31.120
stance not by scientific research they're serendipitous if we never spent the penny on

21:31.120 --> 21:37.760
any neuroscience basic research over the last hundred years it would make trivial difference

21:37.760 --> 21:43.480
the current psychiatric patients but we didn't know that I mean obviously clearly that's

21:43.480 --> 21:47.920
the problem I mean it was that we were going to crack the problem by going neuroscience

21:47.920 --> 21:54.680
but as our historian warned us we have to study the past to find out we won't repeat

21:54.680 --> 21:57.680
so it wasn't money weight it was wasted in the sense it didn't give us what we wanted

21:57.680 --> 22:07.240
but it was wasted but it led to nothing yes it was a very intelligent gamble that lost

22:07.240 --> 22:13.920
so it's short term lost we don't know about the future I just want that for background

22:13.920 --> 22:19.680
because when we talk about the excitement of contemporary neuroscience research we're

22:19.680 --> 22:27.840
talking about possible hopes for a fairly distant future we're not talking about anyone who's

22:27.840 --> 22:33.120
mentally ill today or anything that might help that person but one of the side effects

22:33.120 --> 22:39.640
of the neuroscience thing is I believe it's been partly responsible for lowering the stigma

22:39.640 --> 22:45.160
of mental disorders and it's unfortunate because somehow if it's in the brain therefore people

22:45.160 --> 22:49.480
shouldn't be stigma I mean the fact that it has helped stigma in a way is sad that it

22:49.480 --> 22:54.080
took something like this but I think it has people having a brain disease calling schizophrenia

22:54.080 --> 22:59.240
brain disease I mean all over and calling substance abuse if you believe it's a brain disease

22:59.240 --> 23:04.240
but people call it a brain disease partly to try to reduce the stigma so this angle to

23:04.240 --> 23:08.480
split the besides the fact we're trying to look for answers is actually I think had an

23:08.480 --> 23:14.920
improvement with respect to the place of psychiatry and medicine and also the place of patients

23:14.920 --> 23:19.480
with mental disorders within the myths of medical history that's the rhetoric of neuroscience

23:19.480 --> 23:25.280
yes exactly no no but that's a part of the plan of all this money was well if it achieved

23:25.280 --> 23:28.600
nothing but that then it would have been well spent as much as I think it's my thing

23:28.600 --> 23:32.200
the problem the downside of that though is that the patients expectations of what we

23:32.200 --> 23:37.240
can do for them are sky high you know that they they sit there and wait for us to fix

23:37.240 --> 23:41.720
their brain disease while they don't want to put any I have too much serotonin I read about

23:41.720 --> 23:47.000
that which can give you a drug to reduce that and I'll feel better right right and so the

23:47.000 --> 23:52.520
expectations are very high our drugs are okay we our therapies are good but people have to

23:52.520 --> 23:58.400
put effort into it right I think these happen really outside of the neuroscience for example

23:58.400 --> 24:04.400
if it's infectious diseases going back hundreds of years and then figure figure out if it's

24:04.400 --> 24:08.880
a cleaner environment probably can avoid something we need a little microbiome or microbiome

24:08.880 --> 24:16.760
or microorganisms but I think eventually when this boxers discovered cloned the gene structure

24:16.760 --> 24:23.400
understood then we know the target we can design antibiotics more precisely not just by by

24:23.400 --> 24:29.080
lock like not that is silly most certainly a lot but now everything is designed or age

24:29.080 --> 24:35.120
would have not been treated the way unless you know we had the virus we had the structure

24:35.120 --> 24:39.920
we have the genome and actually the drugs which are double up that are targeting a particular

24:39.920 --> 24:46.520
gene so I think we are just a few hundred years maybe behind psychiatry but basically

24:46.520 --> 24:54.960
a history tells me that yes this is the typical curve their accidental and then for just findings

24:54.960 --> 24:59.840
and we use it because that's the only way we have maybe they are not even useful to

24:59.840 --> 25:05.400
them of further drugs like in a certain in blockers so that we couldn't go further behind

25:05.400 --> 25:11.360
that so we need some other information to build another way and be just not there yet

25:11.360 --> 25:17.960
but I think we have to just patient and I don't know we will be see that time but it

25:17.960 --> 25:24.120
just have to be this is the normal course I think every since and I said I mean first

25:24.120 --> 25:33.840
of all as I always say I agree with you Bob is that and I think it's sort of sort of

25:33.840 --> 25:38.400
reflected by the fact that the the Cornell resident's psychiatry residents really have

25:38.400 --> 25:43.160
to know nothing about the brain in order to be an outstanding resident that the training

25:43.160 --> 25:47.880
itself does not require us to even know the mechanism of action of any of the drugs that

25:47.880 --> 25:51.600
they're given because we actually don't know for example even how this year maybe it's

25:51.600 --> 25:58.920
not a good each them medical school it's not taken very seriously but will you say the

25:58.920 --> 26:06.400
way forward is if instead of putting our X percent GDP into neuroscience research how

26:06.400 --> 26:13.320
do you construct moving the field of psychiatry which is to help these people that are that

26:13.320 --> 26:21.240
are leaving very difficult lives and you but more proportion for example in prison and

26:21.240 --> 26:30.040
how do we help these with that psychiatrist and possibly difficult but very important

26:30.040 --> 26:37.040
question and I'll translate it pragmatically how should the nation devote its resources

26:37.040 --> 26:44.560
for toward the issues of mental illness and we're doing it wrong we're spending too much

26:44.560 --> 26:53.000
money in tertiary care for people with serious mental illnesses not enough money in preventive

26:53.000 --> 26:59.120
medicine even where we know certain things that would make a difference and would work

26:59.120 --> 27:09.200
we certainly would do much more for the next x years 50 hundred of the populations psychiatric

27:09.200 --> 27:18.920
problems if we put more money into early child development mentoring experiences at a facility

27:18.920 --> 27:34.200
then in tertiary care strategies for the persistent and chronic mentally ill that are biologic

27:34.200 --> 27:46.560
in nature we know that the pattern of drug use in this country has more to do with physicians

27:46.560 --> 27:54.040
needing to placate dissatisfied and angry patients rather than with knowledge about the impact

27:54.040 --> 28:01.600
of the drugs on their behavior or their brain but we know that the skillful physicians know

28:01.600 --> 28:08.000
that can reduce the patients dissatisfaction with the treatment by writing a description

28:08.000 --> 28:13.560
and more expensive the medicine better the effect of the pharmaceutical and this is triggered

28:13.560 --> 28:21.720
out of walls and we're going along with it but it's very hard to revise the system so

28:21.720 --> 28:33.920
the goal is total public health rather than satisfying individual consumers and current

28:33.920 --> 28:41.960
health delivery system has as its output satisfying consumers rather than the health

28:41.960 --> 28:49.360
of the nation that's a public health disaster which is supported politically that's not

28:49.360 --> 28:54.880
really psychiatry but it has a lot more to do with mental health in the next hundred

28:54.880 --> 28:57.760
years than neuroscience.

28:57.760 --> 29:07.000
The only thing I would say that is we've already put an x number of billions or millions

29:07.000 --> 29:12.400
hundreds of millions of dollars in these sort of early intervention studies public health

29:12.400 --> 29:18.280
efforts such as Head Start and I've not yet seen any data that that is it's just that

29:18.280 --> 29:25.000
we have not put enough or is it that it's not clear to me that we're making we're moving

29:25.000 --> 29:29.960
the needle even with the programs we have now or is it that the needle is just a part

29:29.960 --> 29:30.960
to move?

29:30.960 --> 29:37.040
Well I'm not sure Head Start's the answer Francis but for example you know the study

29:37.040 --> 29:43.680
of sure better than I do that the children of depressed mothers who are depressed during

29:43.680 --> 29:49.200
pregnancy and in the postpartum period have been mental health outcomes.

29:49.200 --> 29:54.560
We know how to treat depression better than most things we know how to treat including

29:54.560 --> 29:59.920
depressed pregnant women and depressed women postpartum but we don't deliver that treatment

29:59.920 --> 30:03.480
effectively to lots of populations.

30:03.480 --> 30:12.760
We would have more public health mental health benefit by organizing a more effective intervention

30:12.760 --> 30:22.120
to assure the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women.

30:22.120 --> 30:31.360
Then almost anything else we get for our dollar and mental health.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.240
I think the neuroscience is fascinating.

30:34.240 --> 30:42.680
I believe we should invest in it but I think that there's a there's a image probably

30:42.680 --> 30:43.680
wrong.

30:43.680 --> 30:49.320
I think we sell it with the implication that it's going to make a difference soon and

30:49.320 --> 30:51.400
I don't think that's true.

30:51.400 --> 30:58.640
On the other hand if we tell the truth we're going to lose resources so people act rationally.

30:58.640 --> 31:05.360
The way you get the largest grant and the greatest congressional appropriation is to

31:05.360 --> 31:12.160
suggest not that the connect homes are fascinating but they may lead to a cure for Alzheimer's

31:12.160 --> 31:18.520
disease possibly Thursday.

31:18.520 --> 31:25.600
You can't imagine anyone not using that strategy because we do have data that that strategy

31:25.600 --> 31:26.600
works.

31:26.600 --> 31:32.520
Well the trade-off there is a fixed amount of money available for research and we've

31:32.520 --> 31:36.880
seen it NIH the amount of research that's going into treatment development.

31:36.880 --> 31:40.720
If all got shunted over into this neuroscience thing.

31:40.720 --> 31:45.200
If we had unlimited money we can do neuroscience and we can do this but it doesn't work that

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
way.

31:46.200 --> 31:51.760
We are we or somebody is getting the money or certain portions of psychiatry and neuroscience

31:51.760 --> 31:57.400
are getting the money but the patients I think the treatment research is really dried up.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.720
A lot of it is going to form a sort of depending on pharmaceutical companies and they have

32:01.720 --> 32:09.200
unfortunately their motives aren't always aligned with ours so it's a real problem.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.840
That's right this is the way you sell money from the government but unfortunately by diluting

32:13.840 --> 32:18.800
the government into these promises we get don't get good results for the research and

32:18.800 --> 32:21.560
we're really depriving the use of the money elsewhere.

32:21.560 --> 32:26.160
Again I don't know what the solution is but I think that's a problem with the success

32:26.160 --> 32:27.760
of getting money for neuroscience.

32:27.760 --> 32:33.320
What is in the hope that the research is going to give you the tools?

32:33.320 --> 32:37.680
Oh no that's right but I think it's Bob was implying that's not happening.

32:37.680 --> 32:42.680
Well the fact that's not happening Bob said it's not happening soon but what does that

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
mean?

32:43.680 --> 32:47.840
It's not happening tomorrow it's not happening in 20 years it's not happening in 50 years.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.640
But maybe never is the problem.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.080
The one thing that's been very clear is everybody said the more we study it the more difficult

32:53.080 --> 32:54.080
it gets.

32:54.080 --> 32:58.680
That's the you know years ago this neuroscience thing see oh all we have to do is sequence

32:58.680 --> 33:03.040
the genome all we have to do is this all we have to do is that and every time we do that

33:03.040 --> 33:09.160
we're just waiting for that one is not a single biological test in psychiatry for diagnosis.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.640
One thing I remember when I was working with Alan Francis of the DSM 4 we wrote this guide

33:13.640 --> 33:17.960
book and we put a set to the guide book it was in the Alzheimer's section and we were

33:17.960 --> 33:22.480
saying that we're very confident in the next five years by the time this book is out we're

33:22.480 --> 33:26.880
going to be a biological test for Alzheimer's and boy was that all I'd still offer it 30-

33:26.880 --> 33:31.400
25 years later and we're still you you speak to the Alzheimer's people they said oh another

33:31.400 --> 33:35.760
five year or years to get that right but there's this elusiveness to actually turning these

33:35.760 --> 33:38.760
into now it's not clear what you do about that you don't want to say well let's just

33:38.760 --> 33:43.600
give up and stop doing it but there is this problem with putting money in a direction

33:43.600 --> 33:47.840
that has proven to be very very complicated at what point again if we had an element of

33:47.840 --> 33:52.560
money I'd say well let's keep pursuing that but it's coming at the cost of resources being

33:52.560 --> 33:58.120
spent on research for better delivery of treatment you just mentioned the thing with the delivery

33:58.120 --> 34:03.280
of the treatment you know how to treat depression in pregnant women but there's a delivery problem

34:03.280 --> 34:07.800
I mean putting all our money into figuring how to solve those problems would probably

34:07.800 --> 34:12.720
get better short-term results but that's much harder to sell let's spend money on delivery

34:12.720 --> 34:19.040
of care when I was in medical school in a pathology lab one of the professors would

34:19.040 --> 34:25.680
walk around the lab while we were looking at microscopes of cancer cells cancer tissue while

34:25.680 --> 34:33.680
he was smoking and so we as medical students told him you know you are a professor of pathology

34:33.680 --> 34:38.320
we are looking at cancer there's a connection between lung cancer and smoking where are you

34:38.320 --> 34:47.720
smoking he said cancer is cured in ten years I'm talking about the six days so but that doesn't

34:47.720 --> 34:55.040
mean that the research in cancer has not borne a lot of fruit so that today with immunotherapy

34:55.040 --> 35:00.760
targeted therapy and so on we are so much further than when I was a medical student so

35:00.760 --> 35:05.280
why wouldn't the same thing happen and you're right the parallels there of course right

35:05.280 --> 35:10.200
that it's going to be cured in ten years the hubs all over medicine they've actually made

35:10.200 --> 35:14.240
a lot more progress like the precision medicine is a good example that entire field and all

35:14.240 --> 35:19.360
that you know when you apply that to psychiatry we are so far away whatever precision but

35:19.360 --> 35:24.120
it's discussed it's always cancer I mean that is has been the area of medicine with

35:24.120 --> 35:27.520
I guess you could argue infectious diseases always precision medicine but cancer is a

35:27.520 --> 35:32.760
great example and they have made I mean you could argue that all that money spent on cancer

35:32.760 --> 35:36.880
which is by the way historically much much more orders of magnitude more than was spent

35:36.880 --> 35:41.280
in mental health but you're right that's finally beginning to pay off and part of it I think

35:41.280 --> 35:46.000
however complicated the cancer story is it is more tractable than I think the psychiatry

35:46.000 --> 35:51.920
story because the of all the it's just it's just so much more complex the brain then I

35:51.920 --> 35:54.920
think that we always assume the cancer thing would be that hard because it looks like it

35:54.920 --> 35:58.800
should be simple that's turned out to be extremely complex or there's just a parallel there

35:58.800 --> 36:03.040
it looks doable then we see it's not and you put a lot of money in it and finally we're

36:03.040 --> 36:07.080
getting some results and that would be the argument let's just do it in our field and

36:07.080 --> 36:12.520
the same thing will happen and it's possible but I think the only downside of that is there's

36:12.520 --> 36:19.600
a limited pie of money and what's not being spent on by pursuing this goal but just as

36:19.600 --> 36:24.240
follow up with me closest as and what you're saying it probably means that we will probably

36:24.240 --> 36:28.920
have to spend as much money as we do in cancer which is probably ten times as much as being

36:28.920 --> 36:33.560
spent on all brain disorders so it's not surprising we've not moved the needle at this

36:33.560 --> 36:40.640
point in effect and that it took cancer maybe a better analogy is to think that we're about

36:40.640 --> 36:45.200
thirty years behind cancer that might be the best way to think about it at this point

36:45.200 --> 36:50.080
you know and that but that in order to get to work cancer is we're going to have to

36:50.080 --> 36:57.080
put more money in and I would not be as provocative as Bob I would actually say that the money

36:57.080 --> 37:04.720
that was spent on sort of fundamental neuroscience or fundamental biology is probably the best

37:04.720 --> 37:10.760
money spent because we really don't know the brain that well we think we do if you think

37:10.760 --> 37:17.240
about how why we move so quickly in terms of tackling HIV to a sort of a chronic disease

37:17.240 --> 37:23.680
is because of the fundamental biology of understanding how viruses replicate you know and so just

37:23.680 --> 37:30.040
basically emphasizing that neuroscience is not necessarily just linked to side cafe but

37:30.040 --> 37:37.240
we have to talk about neurology and then many other basically this money first of all is

37:37.240 --> 37:43.400
not a big amount from the basic science perspective to be honest compared to the cancer is like

37:43.400 --> 37:49.400
there would be not but but basically so this money is really not only understanding disease

37:49.400 --> 37:54.000
but also understanding how the brain functions which has different implications in the computer

37:54.000 --> 37:59.800
science or a society of problems or behavioral things which is nothing to do with an exact

37:59.800 --> 38:06.600
disease necessarily but still how we interpret each other social behavior wars and peace

38:06.600 --> 38:14.360
and a lot of implications so I think in fact I think there's no portion of the so would

38:14.360 --> 38:20.480
be a continuous and freshly spent on directly disease related and it's not a lot of money

38:20.480 --> 38:26.040
unfortunately and there's a lot of competition for this money that's I totally understand

38:26.040 --> 38:31.760
that it's not enough other field but I think it's not whether you put left or right the

38:31.760 --> 38:37.400
money just has to be conceptually different thinking of the governmental level for the

38:37.400 --> 38:43.240
city level so it's just a thinking but what we have not enough money going there I totally

38:43.240 --> 38:49.640
agree but it's not a problem the social basic science budget because it has to fight for

38:49.640 --> 38:57.200
no reason I pretty much agree with what's been said I would add something and suggest

38:57.200 --> 39:05.560
a possible inference one is I'm a strong advocate of basic research neuroscience is basic research

39:05.560 --> 39:12.560
like molecular biology or genetics the yield on that is greater than any other research

39:12.560 --> 39:18.440
we do but it has woefully little to do with psychiatry that's all I'm not arguing it's

39:18.440 --> 39:23.920
not interesting not relevant not helpful not practical it just isn't particularly related

39:23.920 --> 39:33.040
to psychiatry it's major relationship to psychiatry is the rhetoric of social funding

39:33.040 --> 39:39.480
you can't get somebody who's in control of a foundation to give you a hundred million

39:39.480 --> 39:46.320
dollars for connect dome study but you can for Alzheimer's study and therefore it requires

39:46.320 --> 39:52.520
someone who knows how to write the paragraph that starts with the statistics about Alzheimer's

39:52.520 --> 40:09.160
and ends with something there and ends with something about connect domes the other thing

40:09.160 --> 40:15.720
is that there is a sort of public image which makes perfect sense that we have these huge

40:15.720 --> 40:22.480
problems we have heart disease we have cancer we have mental illness and neurologic disease

40:22.480 --> 40:30.440
but it doesn't work that way from a biology point of view the brain is more complicated

40:30.440 --> 40:37.960
than the rest of the body put together the brain diseases are more challenging in terms

40:37.960 --> 40:43.200
of their understanding and treatment than all the other diseases we ever think of or

40:43.200 --> 40:51.560
treat that they're helped me we have basic scientists and I want help about 40% of all

40:51.560 --> 41:00.080
the genes go to the brain how much is it expressed probably 60 60% that's a measure of something

41:00.080 --> 41:07.000
or other but how do you express that's the question of course but just the magnitude

41:07.000 --> 41:14.440
is relevant in that we're dealing with what the maker thought was half of his problem

41:14.440 --> 41:21.000
and we know that anyone who ever went to medical school knows that you can slice all the other

41:21.000 --> 41:28.320
organs and then most biomedical research when I was involved in laboratory work started

41:28.320 --> 41:33.200
by slicing an organ and putting it in the wearing blender but you can't do that with

41:33.200 --> 41:40.360
the brain doesn't work that way so the fact that the brain is more than everything else

41:40.360 --> 41:49.440
in terms of the complexity of its problem is an important proviso so certainly we need

41:49.440 --> 41:56.760
more basic research psychiatry deals with very difficult problems and I think Francis

41:56.760 --> 42:02.920
is optimistic when he says 30 years that we're about 30 years behind you said that yeah

42:02.920 --> 42:18.240
Francis and I met 30 years I think we have to recognize that there's an order of magnitude

42:18.240 --> 42:27.000
difference in the problems we face when we talk about the future of cardiology or oncology

42:27.000 --> 42:33.680
or orthopedics or ophthalmology on the one hand and the future of psychiatry on the other

42:33.680 --> 42:38.440
one of the startling things we're going to face in the future of psychiatry is that most

42:38.440 --> 42:45.080
of the people will be treating 50 years from now we don't think of as being patients now

42:45.080 --> 42:51.020
because we haven't conceptualized how we can make a difference in their lives but the

42:51.020 --> 42:58.800
history of the last 50 years in psychiatry is we move from Ed's to major diseases schizophrenia

42:58.800 --> 43:04.520
and bipolar disease to recognize the huge pools of people out there who have personality

43:04.520 --> 43:10.200
disorders who have addictions who have problems in living that we're never thought of as

43:10.200 --> 43:16.200
medical or psychiatric but can be helped by interventions even at the food level we're

43:16.200 --> 43:23.400
at now I don't think we're going to see that growth of patients with cancer or heart disease

43:23.400 --> 43:29.760
or any other disease category but we are with mental health diseases but if I can't just

43:29.760 --> 43:36.160
go back to this cancer example I remember because Memorial Camp so cancer is just next

43:36.160 --> 43:41.680
door and we have a lot of collaborations so they were stuck with cancer like 20, 25 years

43:41.680 --> 43:45.880
ago they have been developing new drugs which are a little bit different than the previous

43:45.880 --> 43:52.080
one they certainly got a little increase but it's not tremendous movement and then suddenly

43:52.080 --> 43:56.640
there was a part of shift with this in therapy which was mentioned and nobody knew that it's

43:56.640 --> 44:02.720
coming nobody just came out from the dark and then obviously people have been working

44:02.720 --> 44:08.200
on it but suddenly there was a critical mass or critical finding the mass of critical findings

44:08.200 --> 44:14.200
which were translatable to humans in amounts one could do that well before but it had to

44:14.200 --> 44:18.680
be developed a technology where you could actually use it in humans and humans would tolerate

44:18.680 --> 44:23.960
this and I think in cancer research will tell you that there was a part of our shift because

44:23.960 --> 44:29.360
now I thought only personally but the the the curate is incredible it's very expensive but

44:29.360 --> 44:34.200
I think it's just you never know when it happens it can happen in next year and it can be

44:34.200 --> 44:39.760
in 50 years so but I'm just waiting for such a part of our shift which we don't really

44:39.760 --> 44:43.480
know as they didn't know that this will pan out because they are trying different things

44:43.480 --> 44:49.600
from bone marrow transplantation to different things but this for some reason became practical

44:49.600 --> 44:55.720
feasible in humans and actually this is but was it because of a I don't know it so well

44:55.720 --> 45:01.800
but is it because there were some basic meat made in immunology that made this happen?

45:01.800 --> 45:08.880
I'm not familiar I'm just hearing from them that this was just suddenly a change labs

45:08.880 --> 45:14.600
which switch to this kind of strategy they're far better and now we have these people who

45:14.600 --> 45:20.080
have been not not a spandex they suddenly a deeper of their throat basically they they

45:20.080 --> 45:26.880
have no chance they just come back this is what people need in psychology that somebody

45:26.880 --> 45:32.880
would be treatment treatment to just ask if a phoenix which is a really serious or an

45:32.880 --> 45:37.320
orthopedic side and then suddenly you have a treatment which we just cannot be comprehended

45:37.320 --> 45:44.960
today we should all study immunology at this point we have to return to study immunology

45:44.960 --> 45:53.360
that are important constraints for example the reason why they made the part of the reason

45:53.360 --> 45:58.960
why they made the progress immunology and so on is the ability to study cancer cells

45:58.960 --> 46:04.880
out there it's not that easy to study schizophrenia cells so cancer allowed you to study things

46:04.880 --> 46:10.720
in a completely different way from different angles and even now the treatment comes in

46:10.720 --> 46:11.720
from different.

46:11.720 --> 46:15.920
Well the lack of an animal model for schizophrenia I mean animal models for cancer have always

46:15.920 --> 46:21.960
been around it's a huge barrier I mean theoretically if there was an ant that could be a breakthrough

46:21.960 --> 46:26.760
some really amazing animal model for some of these illnesses came up that could be opened

46:26.760 --> 46:28.960
the door for a lot.

46:28.960 --> 46:34.360
I would say though that I think it might have been basic understanding of immunology because

46:34.360 --> 46:40.000
that actually also now we have drugs for MS multiple sclerosis that we didn't have and

46:40.000 --> 46:45.680
they're also in the immunotherapy realm also where they target the T cells so it turns

46:45.680 --> 46:50.880
out even if even neurologists just got lucky that it turns out that these advances that

46:50.880 --> 46:56.080
the drugs that they were making to basically make T cells quiescent are actually very

46:56.080 --> 47:01.400
effective for MS which and even and they didn't so I think this will and it's still a chronic

47:01.400 --> 47:06.880
disorder which was there's but they had nothing a decade ago you know the fact that they have

47:06.880 --> 47:13.480
four to three to four new drugs in the pipeline is still quite impressive so I think we were

47:13.480 --> 47:15.280
waiting for that moment also.

47:15.280 --> 47:22.920
So in terms of research where is the research in psychiatry in terms of those major illnesses

47:22.920 --> 47:27.160
I mentioned where is that research focused on?

47:27.160 --> 47:34.920
I think the genetics I would say most of the money right now is in genetics connectome these

47:34.920 --> 47:40.280
are the brain initiatives essentially in your imaging and then there's this continuum.

47:40.280 --> 47:44.000
A lot of money goes to epigenetic which is my epigenetic.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.600
But epigenetics I think just to mention for the audiences that basically what most people

47:49.600 --> 47:56.840
realize that genes do not solve the problem and we know that environment cannot work through

47:56.840 --> 48:03.360
genes so the concept came in that environment will actually produce some change in the DNA

48:03.360 --> 48:10.000
structure or the DNA function without changing a base pair so the sequence is the same but

48:10.000 --> 48:14.920
there are secondary modifications but if you view it from a function of perspective it

48:14.920 --> 48:19.240
doesn't really matter whether you have a mutation and it alters a gene function or

48:19.240 --> 48:26.440
you have a we call chromatin which is the larger assemble of DNA and surrounding proteins

48:26.440 --> 48:32.080
you can have that same functional change as a result of.

48:32.080 --> 48:36.280
So what we many people I know because it's pretty competitive know what is to write a

48:36.280 --> 48:41.800
grant but basically the chromatin is that you propose that environment whether this is

48:41.800 --> 48:50.240
early childhood adversity whether maybe it's a during pregnancy maybe the mother is depressed

48:50.240 --> 48:56.560
but there is something memory built into the child or a field DNA which is again not a

48:56.560 --> 49:01.680
change of the sequence but it's a permanent so the child will work with born with this

49:01.680 --> 49:06.600
it's a regulatory problem like a mutation would be and it ended up with a little bit

49:06.600 --> 49:13.000
different function at the gene level which is translated to a circuit level and then

49:13.000 --> 49:19.120
functional level one the child is less than typical even when his connection is made so

49:19.120 --> 49:24.200
I think that a lot of money goes into this which is fundamental is a very good concept

49:24.200 --> 49:31.000
and very new because we don't really know this we call this areas as a and want to sensitive

49:31.000 --> 49:35.880
areas maybe or we can call it marks or whatever you want to call but we don't really understand

49:35.880 --> 49:41.560
those but even outside of neuroscience epigenetics is also cancer cancer it's actually cancer

49:41.560 --> 49:47.080
is a more more developed phase again so we learn a lot from cancers but some of the cancer

49:47.080 --> 49:51.000
findings cannot be translated because the genes which are regulated are totally different

49:51.000 --> 49:58.080
and cancer you would have that how fast it's as proliferate or divide grow and in a sense

49:58.080 --> 50:02.880
more important how maybe a synaptic function is a little tailored so it's a little bit

50:02.880 --> 50:08.240
different and it's just several order of money to the more complex that's the problem

50:08.240 --> 50:15.080
the complexity but you pointed out which means that it takes more time but just to sort of

50:15.080 --> 50:22.000
simplify your work make less but what you've found in your own lab is that that this the

50:22.000 --> 50:29.640
level of stress of the mother the grandmother or the great grandfather or whatever all have

50:29.640 --> 50:36.520
impacts on the infant so we can trace down on the granddaughters I'm talking about animals

50:36.520 --> 50:42.880
here but there are some human studies but the granddaughters will carry the memory of

50:42.880 --> 50:52.920
a grandparent either you can have like stress infection or even early childhood adversity

50:52.920 --> 51:00.000
which is very relevant to psychiatry so so we can actually tell from the granddaughters

51:00.000 --> 51:06.960
DNA that the grandmother had some impact so that would be very useful to let's say you

51:06.960 --> 51:12.400
have a child and you are not sure whether the child will be more you see some sign maybe

51:12.400 --> 51:16.840
I'm not clinician but I can imagine that you have a child and you are not really sure

51:16.840 --> 51:21.640
whether the risk is very high or no but you see some signs you could go back and then

51:21.640 --> 51:28.760
test whether that child actually had some impact through some ancestor's life and you

51:28.760 --> 51:34.320
would say yes I see some impact so I would be more careful and maybe treat that particular

51:34.320 --> 51:39.200
individual and you can actually sample the epigenome not by having to get a brain biopsy

51:39.200 --> 51:45.440
but yeah we are doing from the blood actually from below we don't have to take cuter models

51:45.440 --> 51:51.520
so we just take a little blood and we can because the blood also responds to this and

51:51.520 --> 51:56.720
there is a correlation between the blood response to the brain response these are not so it's

51:56.720 --> 52:01.320
my talking of memory the memory in this case you cannot say this is how precise like an

52:01.320 --> 52:08.880
episode would be in our life or as room or remembering this environment it's really just

52:08.880 --> 52:15.160
the adversity component it's a negative balance of this whole situation which is really somehow

52:15.160 --> 52:22.680
alters certain genes which will be a genetic fingerprint so it's not a memory we like to

52:22.680 --> 52:27.800
use memory because everybody understands memory but it's a lose memory so you will not just

52:27.800 --> 52:33.520
remember you will not remember that the adversity occurred in A or B or C environment but you

52:33.520 --> 52:39.640
know that was some really bad experience it's not post-Trump Express's order where somebody

52:39.640 --> 52:45.320
can recall the exact location and going back to the same restaurant or a same battlefield

52:45.320 --> 52:52.320
it will have a reaction it is more of a general anxiety that in general the anxiety level

52:52.320 --> 52:57.520
is really high almost sometimes you don't even know why because the person doesn't have

52:57.520 --> 53:03.760
to have an input it's already built in the DNA chromatin or epigenome which was somehow

53:03.760 --> 53:10.120
predated maybe not even in the individual's life but in the ancestor's life so your mechanism

53:10.120 --> 53:16.920
is is beautiful and articulate and very sophisticated but that that that basic understanding that

53:16.920 --> 53:22.880
a person is affected by the the their ancestry psychiatrists have been saying for 150 years

53:22.880 --> 53:33.360
that's not new right so so the thing that worries me of course is that exact thinking

53:33.360 --> 53:39.160
is what got us to eugenics this idea that the best thing to do would be just eliminate

53:39.160 --> 53:45.800
those genes eliminate those people eliminate those races you know and with the obvious

53:45.800 --> 53:52.040
conclusion and what happened in Germany and so and the thing is that the scary part of

53:52.040 --> 53:57.600
those kinds of interventions is they they start off well intended and in the United

53:57.600 --> 54:02.600
States so it wasn't just you know these crazy folks in another country so again the question

54:02.600 --> 54:08.560
is so all right so you found this then what but yeah but but just expanding so what you

54:08.560 --> 54:15.080
would say that is known it was totally anecdotal there was no scientific evidence for that

54:15.080 --> 54:19.800
and in science you never believe so at least in basic science you never take it really

54:19.800 --> 54:26.240
true until you actually prove mechanistically so our standards are really mechanistic but

54:26.240 --> 54:30.920
for the standards of the time I mean but they looked at pedigrees they gathered data they

54:30.920 --> 54:35.160
interviewed families I mean for the standards of the time they do exactly the same thing

54:35.160 --> 54:43.520
yeah but yes so that was certainly a such an association we got association and now from

54:43.520 --> 54:47.760
scientific point of view you want to have the association to cause a relationship because

54:47.760 --> 54:53.320
if this association you cannot do anything about it because if two things can be associated

54:53.320 --> 54:58.880
and you influence one thing it doesn't feel like tonana things but my point is though

54:58.880 --> 55:03.280
for the standards of the for the scientific standards of the of the time 150 years ago

55:03.280 --> 55:07.960
that was true absolutely that was the true it wasn't I mean they believed that was causal

55:07.960 --> 55:13.080
now you're saying this is true and so I'm I wouldn't doubt that your science is more

55:13.080 --> 55:17.480
sophisticated question is 150 years from now is somebody going to look back and say well

55:17.480 --> 55:23.640
you know your science was all very nice but so and that's the that's the kind of but

55:23.640 --> 55:28.720
but a big difference is when you have a causative relationship then you have a chance to actually

55:28.720 --> 55:34.160
manipulate the system if an association then basically the two things are independent

55:34.160 --> 55:39.000
from each other it's a coincidental so you don't have the two you don't have the opportunity

55:39.000 --> 55:44.960
or a chance to actually influence your outcome with something which is correlated with so

55:44.960 --> 55:48.840
that's a difference but they thought they did I mean they thought they did but it's

55:48.840 --> 55:54.680
it's wrong the law of things I mean science we don't know that we don't know that our

55:54.680 --> 56:00.280
that our crude treatments because they're crude you know would match the sensitivity

56:00.280 --> 56:06.800
of that kind of science the treatment even in a SSRI sorry that's not really causative

56:06.800 --> 56:15.160
we don't want causative because it's a association so causative when you have an absolute known

56:15.160 --> 56:20.640
player molecule pathway which is linked to and then you manipulate the pathway and then

56:20.640 --> 56:27.800
then you fix the outcome so that's what we need for develop new drugs or any conditions

56:27.800 --> 56:36.720
where it is being shown specific epigenetic change is responsible for it so this is a

56:36.720 --> 56:45.040
this is this is another problem so there's not one single gene or single logos but and

56:45.040 --> 56:51.120
then we don't have a manipulation very multiple so that's very difficult to make the but I

56:51.120 --> 56:56.920
think that that's actually one way to think about it to figure out a way to work with

56:56.920 --> 57:06.520
multiple genes but I remember when I was school manipulating one gene was a total order nobody's

57:06.520 --> 57:11.800
that student field starting the lab and in my month the person can change that gene or

57:11.800 --> 57:19.800
single gene we can manipulate me three genes and if you asked these people this would be

57:19.800 --> 57:24.920
just a single cell and a lot of same cell they can manipulate thousands at the same

57:24.920 --> 57:30.240
time what we would need is that to manipulate hundreds of genes for thousands of genes in

57:30.240 --> 57:36.480
a complex mammalian neuron and just don't have a technology but people have been very

57:36.480 --> 57:42.800
working but in cancer aren't they using various H stack inhibitors right now yes try to affect

57:42.800 --> 57:49.160
the gene yes but they're not because selectivity that's also not enough they don't have it yeah

57:49.160 --> 57:54.280
select selectivity is really important that you basically target only those nothing else

57:54.280 --> 58:01.360
yeah and there's the the classical manipulation but we had 20 years ago develop we don't have

58:01.360 --> 58:05.960
to have we don't have any multiple genes a lot of genes because at all marketing so but

58:05.960 --> 58:12.600
not only the psychiatric condition of cardiovascular diabetes hypertension there's all the same

58:12.600 --> 58:17.800
problem and they cannot really prove because they have tens of hundreds genes one person

58:17.800 --> 58:23.640
has this combination other person that combination but we do know that this probably a lot of

58:23.640 --> 58:29.200
genes each has a very small contribution but you still need they have different constellations

58:29.200 --> 58:33.760
so these are all systems by which is I think system biology is another field which might

58:33.760 --> 58:39.240
need a lot of money but again much higher level than artificial intelligence would do

58:39.240 --> 58:45.920
nobody's which is one dimensional set fail I want to use this to segue to something that

58:45.920 --> 58:54.400
I think is often not seen this way but the availability of our finer tools for assessing

58:54.400 --> 59:03.560
genetic risk at the level even of an old means that we're really into a form of euthanasia

59:03.560 --> 59:12.880
except very early so when we decide to not implant a fertilized egg that's carrying the

59:12.880 --> 59:26.160
Huntington's gene that's just early euthanasia early eugenics biologically is the same thing

59:26.160 --> 59:32.080
we're clearing the population of a noxis gene by selecting who will support and who will

59:32.080 --> 59:41.400
destroy the Nazis waited a few decades afterwards before doing the same thing and we don't really

59:41.400 --> 59:47.600
have a dialogue socially about the meaning of that in our attitude toward it we're doing

59:47.600 --> 59:54.840
something you know way even more intriguing because the methods for doing this are available

59:54.840 --> 01:00:02.400
to some social classes and not to others so we've set up a system where if you're in a

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:08.400
certain social class you get eugenics to get rid of bad genes and if you're in a different

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:16.200
class you don't and we're going to distribute the bad genes class wise in the culture that's

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:22.760
a very interesting psychiatric I don't know if it's a psychiatric issue maybe I think much

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:35.560
of what our effective interventions might be in the next few decades maybe at the pre-implantation

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:43.800
level of eugenics we can possibly get rid of some major psychiatric disorders if we have

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:52.880
enough community acceptance of screening and selective implantation of fertilized of them

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:59.120
that don't carry those disorders the thing that is I mean apart from the larger ethical

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:04.760
issues of which there are many the other thing that strikes me is if we're trying to help

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:11.200
say schizophrenia for focusing on schizophrenia where if we're trying to convince our patients

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.400
who have schizophrenia that they have lives worth living that that that disease is not

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.280
going to define them that they can live full lives that they have worth as a human and

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:27.960
then at the same time we say that we're going to try to eliminate the genetic risk for that

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.000
you know what does that say you know we care about you but actually we wish you hadn't

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.280
been born I mean that and that you know we're not at a stage where we really have to wrestle

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.280
with that other than as a thought experiment but that's we're close to it well depending

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.760
on who yeah depending on who you talk to you know so just yeah totally agree and I guess

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.880
we are just for accidentally open NIH and that's national super health that there's a whole

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.800
branch trying to really address this question very relevant but I recall another effort

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:06.960
from NIH which is more of a repairing the gene or genes so there are a lot of money goes

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.560
into our field which is basically say this is a situation and it's a chart is born but

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:19.680
can be really reestablished in normal regulation or whatever situation and now just a couple

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.920
of weeks to people of you know the new technology where you can actually get in to sell again

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.440
it's just a cell level we don't have the brain level but some yeah now some can do it

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:37.040
and a single gene and you can actually repair it you can eliminate the physical or or or

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:44.280
molecule problem and basically you it's very similar to to repairing an enzyme defect for

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:49.640
example with a virus where you would have a child with an enzyme defect and it's pretty

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.400
technically speaking is relatively simple because it's just an enzyme which is everywhere

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.360
so you make make a white blood cell and this white blood cell be produced now and you exchange

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.360
the deficient cells to their new the gene therapy so that's a similar concept except

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:12.320
that you go to the brain cell or brain region and then you basically re-establish the normal

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:19.480
situation it's it's a fiction and it's just laboratory things but it's certainly in the lab it's in

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.680
a one-genent can be done and it's just five years ago that was the first of four years ago so there

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:30.600
are new things happening yeah and we just need a larger I'm not only new things but we need a

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.400
scale up from one it's always with one gene and then we have to have hundred genes simultaneously so

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:45.640
it's going a little slow obviously well some degree of the repair of genes the technology is there now

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:52.000
it's not only a mutation can repair you can reap this so-called epigenetic what I refer which is

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.360
you know which is more complex you can repair that as well but the issue is in terms of mental

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:03.760
illness is to first determine what genes we have talked about sugar yeah 100 dreams a small fact

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.600
you can't be fixing those genes it's not going to make any difference but the whole idea is science

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:13.000
that you have these hundreds of tracks of research and some people working with it and suddenly

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.840
everything is just converge and that's the hope so they scale up the technology that they bring

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.960
and we don't have access to the brain so we need new technology to get to the brain so when

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.880
everything converges maybe a hundred years from now then then this is this is where you say maybe

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:38.040
that was a birth to invest this money but otherwise we wouldn't be there and that's the hope but I

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.320
think that was a hope in care sir the thing is though that our we do need to help our patients now

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.920
and you know sure it isn't sexy but there is a lot in systems of care that we in psychiatry

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.280
used to do a lot with the whole asylum movement the whole beginning of the the profession of

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.160
psychiatry in the United States was based on systems of care this idea that we build the

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.960
silums to take care of people to restore them to sanity and and so we have similar problems to

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.200
what Dorothy the Dix was complaining about a hundred and seventy years ago we have people in the jails

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.040
people in the streets people who are suffering who don't have family looking after them and in

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Michigan we are reinventing the idea that we need to take a look at state hospitals our

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.200
Republican governors over succeeding decades closed most of our state hospitals and now all

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.120
of a sudden we have to have a conversation about maybe reopening some reopening new new kinds of

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:36.720
new systems of care and working on ways of taking care of people because gene therapy isn't

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.320
available in our lifetime and it's hard to talk about that it's hard to say we need bricks and

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:49.640
mortar we don't just need two different things so we have to talk about yeah I mean I'm not saying

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:54.840
that you know the money should come from there I mean this is more a political issue actually what

01:05:54.840 --> 01:06:00.680
you're saying but for the patient the next 20 years neuroscience is probably not going to

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:11.840
touch the problem at the social it's like you know probably be with all the astrophysics is

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:17.640
not necessarily in our lifetime but we still pay or fund astrophysics or going to move or

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:26.840
probably we won't be there in the next few years but still in some respects that's how humanity

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:34.560
and then technology develops just to segue into something that might be a little more positive so

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:40.600
even though I think that neuroscience is going to take 20 years there are certain things that and

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:47.400
it just happens by Kirk Winston it's happening in my department but I put it in a Cornell we have

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.880
figured one of the investigators at Cornell who's a psychiatrist has figured it out a way to use

01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:02.640
neuroimaging to subtype depression into four categories by the connectome and he is able to

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:11.320
do it granted it's only one study of 1200 patients but he's able to basically get to do it with 90%

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:20.120
specificity and sensitivity so he has the shot of actually possibly getting the first biomarker

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:26.360
for a psychiatric disorder what subtypes where did the subtypes come from so what he did was he

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:36.920
got 600 patients with major depression and then and for so of control made match controls got

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:43.000
their resting state scans which I described theirs and basically through machine learning

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.480
slash artificial intelligence asked the computer to tell them is there do these people fall into

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:55.640
different subtypes do the brain connectomes look different from the controls and then the computer

01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:01.480
gave what they call a classifier sort of like yes here's a template where this this is the template

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:10.040
for depression number one two three four then he took another set of samples of of 300 new people

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:16.760
with depression or not depression or schizophrenia and this classifier could separate out people with

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:24.120
schizophrenia versus depression with a hundred ninety nine percent precision and so so these are

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:32.040
these are different subtypes and I'm just doesn't have no they're not phonological subs no these were

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.880
the computer was not taught DSM so the computer was agnostic to it it was just looking at it essentially

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:44.520
and each subtype has a slightly different abnormality in connectivity with the prefrontal cortex or

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.600
first of all he can he confirmed that the prefrontal cortex is probably very important for major

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.520
depression and they all have slightly different what they don't look different clinically is the

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.160
point right I guess that was they really don't look that different clinically miraculously

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:06.120
subtypes actually fall into anhedonic anxious they actually do really amazingly do and it was not

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.640
taught the computer was not taught this and so that felt that's life yeah so that essentially

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:17.160
they naturally which makes sense that if you're anhedonic then the hub that's involved in the reward

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.880
circuitry is probably going to be the one that's broken while the one that's that where you're sort

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.280
of more anxious is going to be probably more prefrontal cortical because of the anxiety

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:35.320
circuits related there so it fell out naturally and now we're going but what is so remarkable is

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.200
that so there's another form of treatment called trans-magnetics stimulation which is

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:47.640
which we had wild enthusiasm ten years ago but has shown to be only effective for 40%

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:55.080
than mild for mild to moderate depression what he found was was that only one subtype responded

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:01.480
optimally to TMS so now the new clinical trial he's running is to do a that was a retrospective

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:06.760
study that he did now he's doing a prospective study to see whether or not he can subtype them

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:12.840
ahead of time then give them TMS and basically see whether or not that this is actually going

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:18.280
to hold up but you can sort of now see how you can use this not obviously we say psychiatrists

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:23.880
and psychologists and social workers we can diagnose pretty well but what this can tell you is is

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:30.120
that what he noticed was was that after the people who responded to TMS their connect home

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:36.760
changed to normal so basically you now have not only a diagnostic tool but something that could

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.600
probably tell you whether or not the treatments you've had will possibly effective or not effective

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:49.800
in changing at least one sort of non at least some objective measure and stuff but the future

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:55.080
would be at least only in Cornell the media other than you would get your brain scanned

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.640
in the outpatient clinic if you come in for depression and then basically then then different

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:08.600
treatments would be tailored to that it sounds very but human one brain scan will tell you this

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.960
yes so basically because he got the computer to come up with what they call it a computational

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:19.400
classifier so then the classifier will then sort of sort it out and just say this you fit into

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:27.480
biotype one two three or four and and so then and and if you put in someone who has schizophrenia

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:33.160
they go you don't fit into any of these biotypes you know you do not you're not depressed so he's

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:38.360
now trying to develop the schizophrenic biotype and the bipolar disorder biotype but for now he

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:44.760
started with depression so but you but the reason why this was possible was because so many people

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:53.800
country and and we're doing resting state scans so he didn't have to scan 1200 people he got people's

01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:01.880
data from 1200 people from 1200 subjects from and then just use the computer to basically do

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.600
the analysis I think this is probably what's going to happen and that's why it's still important to

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.960
do all these studies because who knew that this 10 minute resting state scan was going to be so

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:18.840
important for this type of work I think you know and some ideas that we could be basically be able

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.840
to tailor things but it is really quite remarkable even to me it's hard to wrap my mind around the

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:31.720
fact that the brains has an intrinsic connectivity that can be picked up in 10 minutes it's an

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:41.560
fire an MRI machine essentially that's been around for 50 years essentially technology was always

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.320
there you know what he only what he did is he used just like he just put the pieces together

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:55.080
and he was able to do it so but replicates psychiatry is full of 50 years of starting to

01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:01.640
DSTF tests that look like they're going to be great so two replications are now being written up

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:07.240
for the replication spittifier type things so people from other universities not us really that's

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.640
for depression not for any other depression that'd be pretty damn good if you have that

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:20.760
yeah we're very we'll see what happens but what's really nice is is that and and I the thing that

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:26.120
I got from it was then we've we've we've also begun or he and begun doing

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:35.560
anxiety disorders because that's the disorder and the people with anxiety disorders fall into

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:46.600
that but again as office the brain did not read DSM and truly gonna be these gonna

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.120
and they're not the sort of

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:02.520
problems are probably going to be very different for each

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:11.880
sorry I can assure you that I hope it replicates too but that's enough the mystic notes so we can

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.640
stop the open if you have a question you want

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:23.320
to

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:25.080
have

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:31.880
facts and look at various fields of science over the years and how many years it took for

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.880
half the things before the truth to be no more true so I'm wondering if you should

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:47.160
you how many years will take care for what you think is true now if you're not true yeah I'm not

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.480
gonna predict the future but I will tell you a funny story about yeah I found a book that was written

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:58.200
from the American College of Pharmacology

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:07.160
and in I think 1965 they wrote this book called

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.360
Psychopharmacology in the year 2000 where they were predicting it's gonna

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.280
and they were

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.520
drugs that people have

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.360
helping them

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:29.400
work happy and help them that weren't happy that because we weren't going to solve the food problems but

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.680
velocity was the answer to everything was gonna cure outcome it was gonna cure

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.800
and then two years after this book was

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.840
in the United

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:50.600
take long

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.080
right well what I was gonna say we're back we're back to hallucinogens now we're back to

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.400
we're not getting it have they not banned it maybe over the 30 years we'd actually have

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.040
to

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:17.080
that was a big mistake

01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.280
that's going to be true and not true yeah like that

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.240
that's the way paper that you can laugh at when it's

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.800
it's

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.000
funny the other you know

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.760
your head of nature he was writing a paper by the RDoC project the people so RDoC project was

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.320
an attempt to toss out the DSM approach on immunology and

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.480
the tree base the idea is we're going to discover the the circuits of the brain

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.160
and then we're going to build up you know this huge

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:55.080
uh all these studies we're going to explore treatments went out in the limit said in 15 years

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:03.720
will happen it was so off and the thing to me is the full

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.440
it's predicting something in 15 years because those are

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:11.400
these are all you can't ever so you're right I mean assume a lot of what we now is going to be

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:20.360
thank you doctor Lee the end you mentioned a lot of

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.920
two different

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:30.520
in a rest brain from a typical brain look these are in huge these are in patients

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:43.400
patients um and it's made me wonder what what is a healthy brain

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:53.080
someone that doesn't meet any criteria for any DSM disorder but are there people who don't

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.240
know

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:05.720
you know it's sort of a circular argument but so I think what I think we don't have a really good

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.520
idea of what brain is it's just what we call a brain so a brain

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.360
besting codified as we have an idea of what the healthy mind is

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:21.640
that the analyst to figure that out

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.960
thank you for the

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.920
my question is with some question about which way the funding should go

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.280
what will be um the field what's the

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.280
patients and patients

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.640
what goals and what values should guide institution uh what values should

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.680
guide medicine and administration what's the future of pakari grants

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.200
no questions

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.720
so

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:10.760
so pakari grants are supposed to be so there's been a

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.880
whatever various new things then we'll

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.840
to the community

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.880
that seem to look what really

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.680
center but they're too complicated or something to be implemented and so

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.680
the

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.920
supposed to be something where you take a treatment and

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:47.400
grant is to actually dominate it's for example I think the types of

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.400
grant

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.240
really

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.960
into behavioral therapy that has been validated

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.320
institution can you

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.440
to the queen's the queen's clinic and have trained the people there

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:06.280
and then rally around

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.480
lots of money isn't being poured into these human

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.480
how

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.280
are

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.520
sorry

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.520
treatments

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:30.440
we would have to say uh that the bigger question is is that we actually

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:34.280
don't just to sort of segue we actually don't have the workforce

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:41.720
liver met to the treatment percent of 20 percent of our population

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.280
how that workforce sure I'm not actually sure I would say that

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.600
no I think what

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:57.080
the rationale for the

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.320
grants has been mainly due to other treatment

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.000
more sophisticated behavioral treatments have been able to be implemented

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:11.000
and but it's probably because they don't have enough providers that can

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.680
deliver it somewhat

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.000
I think

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.040
to pick up a thread that two threads of Dr. Mike

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.760
one of them about about prevention and the allocation

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.760
uh

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.760
about being

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.880
going to I'm going to echo that also

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:36.920
uh given how we started off with the um

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.080
progress with the genetic research

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:42.680
um

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.880
given that we spent most of the time talking about that

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.000
that this means

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.200
so what what does that mean so I will offer a an interpretation

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.960
considering where we are

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:04.600
and that and that and that there's an enormous cultural almost delusion of the

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.160
Nile of um of the source of most

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.640
technology which which Dr. Michael's mentioned which has something to do with

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:18.520
early development early development early attachment traumatic uh dramatic

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.360
abandonment early childhood even even we know data from moving to another country

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.360
the the the

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:35.320
and mental illness and yet there's no money um

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:39.800
being provided for that kind of research so I suggest we take all of the money

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.040
and

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:46.040
for

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.040
my

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.040
then we may

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040
as far as

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.040
um so now

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.040
wasn't being brought

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440
just

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440
the second

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.440
the

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440
neuroscience research

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440
uh

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.640
I think you mentioned

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.640
expectation

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:15.640
the

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.040
to get back

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.040
that's random

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.040
in

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.040
I think

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.040
part of the

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:44.520
is getting rid of stigma I think we're getting rid of stigma okay

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:50.840
this is if they were broken brains we we've just added another type

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:54.840
of

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.640
a person

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:11.640
then he did at case conferences okay

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:22.040
the conferences had less details about

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.560
interests are

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.560
that is a strong

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.560
information

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:45.560
which is a war farm kind of far farm a go genetic testing and getting history

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.520
several comments

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:05.320
um our call for uh I'll start with the last one I think the psychological psychodynamic

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:12.760
broadly in favor of talking to patients listening to them and getting to know them

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:19.480
in fine texture and detail which you feel a member of I suspect from what you said I think

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:26.040
that community has failed to demonstrate value added from the information it collects

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:32.840
for the majority of psychiatric patients so although we may not like it the fact is that

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.760
if you want to be cost effective the first thing you do is make a dss

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:45.800
then use the standard treatment for that diagnosis and wait eight weeks a third of your

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:50.680
patients will be better and there's no point in finding out how they felt about their mother

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:58.200
it's irrelevant to the outcome of the intervention if your focus is on the outcome of the intervention

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:07.960
you'd focus your subtle nuanced history taking and relationship development on the group of

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:14.280
patients who need it and might profit from it but the community doesn't like doing that

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:22.440
and it has an almost ethical quality it's un it's not humanistic no orthopedic surgeon

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:30.040
worries about being humanistic before setting a colleagues fracture but psychiatrists do sometimes

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.680
or conversely they don't because they're tired of those that do and they're arguing with them

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:46.680
so your dss diagnosis begin to in many psychiatrists hands substitute the person is sitting next to

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:54.920
you on the bus it's an unsolved problem it's a major problem in psychiatric education so that

01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.480
if you travel around the country and you make rounds and things like that you find a fair

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:07.800
number of young psychiatrists are very happy if they can document a dssm5 diagnostic

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:13.320
uh conclusion even if they're not the biggest idea who it is they're talking about

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:21.240
on the other hand the the research problem not resolved is when does it make a difference

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.720
and very importantly when does it not make a difference

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.360
even more provocative i think the lack of engagement

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:37.720
in the future of the proper diagnosis sometimes people being in analysis i don't know about

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:44.040
even doing it properly sometimes well what i would agree with it i think too often i think

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:50.920
you can't do uh not i you know i i created a structured interview for research and i see people

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.200
do horrible jobs because they don't ask the right you know get below the surface i mean it's not a

01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.760
checklist and nobody who's ever worked on the dssm has ever claimed otherwise however because

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:07.720
it looks so simple people there's a human nature here to do the simple quick thing and the dssm you

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.040
could argue is one of the worst things that happened because it's a left psychiatrist to do what our

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.160
colleagues and the rest of medicines it was just trying to do the quicker thing like getting a

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.040
bunch of blood tests and not talking to the patient so it's facilitated that it's had a plus i think

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.920
it's treatment and people have responded better but there's a huge cost and i agree about the

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.960
psychiatric education it's up to psychiatric education to to go against that tendency for people to

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.480
want a cookbook approach and tell them over and over again that is you're not going to get good

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.040
results now unfortunately it'd be nice if there were studies that could actually show for sure

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:48.840
check actually in uh alpham it's hard for me to believe that you're right it'd be

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.200
somebody could do some kind of god people who

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.520
got my gift with the out the

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.720
what why do you don't

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.080
who's going to fund that you're right i'd be great things to do

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.880
there's also an idiotic in the profession

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:19.480
you're patient in depth that it's almost

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:27.560
a virtue rather than efficiency or efficacy right and that's a weak argument in a competitive world

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.800
no you're right you see how we've gotten where we are and i'd be great if we can undo that with

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:41.880
data if you had thought like the head of some federal finance health finance

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.960
and said well we need to do this then they would ask well just show me why we should invest

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:53.080
billions in this direction rather than in this direction maybe that study a series of

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:58.120
well we may be going backwards and having to do that retrospectively with the current generation

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:04.360
of kids we're raising now so we're raising an entire generation of consumers of mental health

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.080
care who think that all they have to do is sit there and somebody will do it they will do a checklist

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:12.920
they'll get a diagnosis they'll get a pill then

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.600
they roll in that it's something that they again are it's our failure to treat rather than their

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:26.840
failure to engage so i just had a patient in the hospital a 19 year old student and we get a lot

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:32.040
of university students that umm on the inpatient unit and she she had depression i don't know what

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:37.960
that means for this teenager but she'd been on every drug i could name she'd gotten ECT

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.320
she had never engaged with therapy because as far as she was concerned that was effort that she

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:48.680
didn't want to put into and and we were done she was still depressed she was not bothering to go to

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:54.200
serve and you know she needed to actually put some work in and she didn't want to hear that she

01:30:54.200 --> 01:31:00.280
wanted the magic the magic pill or you know raising its generation of consumers of mental health care

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:07.160
to not take a role in their own recovery and i i worry about that

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.000
i'm pleased that we've positioned the position and we still have

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:26.600
to submit from the beginning the sociologic

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:38.600
the

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.360
my question

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:49.640
I that statement have any of you um been studying

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:59.720
abilities now there's anxiety anxiety may be identified as

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.680
a good state if it's no guided correctly

01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:13.000
the person is facing something in society that is not right

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.680
yeah

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:26.200
again he is a symptom not necessarily it's a state it's not bad i mean we all know

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.040
you know if you have a test to and you don't have enough anxiety to study for you you're

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:45.000
gonna fail it's anxiety or adaptive parts of being human being you can't live with that exactly

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:50.760
perhaps even

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:58.040
and

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:06.440
deal with illness in that context but

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:16.840
when you have these symptoms coupled with some disability that's causing

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.080
it somehow impacts ability to function what you need

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:31.480
ships work you know that these symptoms are being severe enough

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:37.320
always been

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.000
in normal

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.920
grieving for one year after the loss of loved one every day in pre-op

01:33:52.920 --> 01:34:03.960
they agree right with that person say it so there's always a point where you figure out when these

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:12.120
symptoms are when you know that's when they become educated

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:18.440
it's

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:23.000
by case basis it can be very do but it's a bullet theory

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.680
let's let's

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.920
my name is

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:40.760
I am interested

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.240
I have a suggestion to me and I would like to have an answer to it

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:55.320
David

01:34:55.320 --> 01:35:02.600
the man who can

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.320
obsessive compulsory disorder my question

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:24.120
a statement here is that in the review of the book that I have Adam argues

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:40.040
he is in favor of a more complex

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:50.120
I suggest from my category I'll approach

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:55.160
time mental illness which the category

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:03.080
approach driven by the DSM thank you I'm gonna

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:09.240
I was the driver when the preparation the

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.440
approach the whole one of the

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.720
I don't know what was just to move it

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:25.400
anyone in the knows that the categorical approach is a fiction there's no hard boundary between

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:28.200
any you know mild depression

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.880
life

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:45.240
not so medicine the rest of medicine is categorical and dementia people's

01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:53.880
a you have category so this tension between measuring and recognizing that there has to be

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:59.800
a point where you go from a measurement to a category

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:03.960
the DSM it's been people reified I think these boundaries in the book

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:07.960
handed down from something not the high

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:16.200
and and somehow they have some meaning to really shouldn't have so I've always here as a

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:17.560
lifelong

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:26.840
you know it's a thing with it so we're struggling with what happens to the

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.440
cat and how they become real

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.400
clinicians to practice because you wouldn't know

01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.720
time to give medicine right now if you have five out of nine symptoms of depression

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:46.360
and you all the clinical trials would use that definition you could say well if my

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:51.400
patient version of depression the one that was in the trial I don't know their

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.160
probability of responding to this treatment is because that's what the study

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.320
should be in the

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:04.760
not enough for an illness

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.280
boundaries are yes that you have to that's why it says at the front of the book

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:13.320
but

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.440
go into training and see patients to be able to get the feel

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:17.960
what they are

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:18.120
but

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.800
is they opened the door up to continuous revisions they realized that it was

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:41.080
or to see years we're going to redo the whole book now they said that you know

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:44.360
one of the reasons they did that it's very difficult to roll it in the electronic world

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:45.160
the belief is you

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.560
but now there's actually a committee set up and anyone outside can make proposals now if you

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.720
make a proposal you have to have the data to back it up but

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.520
the other thing with

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:07.800
the system it's great in theory and you know very critical of

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.160
the

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.120
have had issues

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.120
and this

01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.520
does something have it or not criteria but the dimensions are incredibly

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:27.240
sort of a lot of

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:31.320
want to put a

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.680
controlled on

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:38.920
here you don't but

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.960
systems that were created by a second

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:45.400
so we have their own professional state in all

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:49.240
so complicated that I can imagine anybody actually

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:54.920
use these factor analyses with you know 20 different domains and if you're high in this

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.240
it's like it's only on

01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:59.720
yeah yeah

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:05.640
it's incredibly complex so it it's any more

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.360
real it's not

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:14.360
it's one set of problems

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.480
thank you

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:32.680
issue which

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.960
is

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.800
some serves in general

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.320
dimensional approaches

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.320
observe information

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:46.680
categorical approaches discard

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.800
information when you reduce multiple

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:52.120
dimensions and

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.120
up

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:58.200
willing to spend a lot of time

01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.200
clinician

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:06.040
they have

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.960
so then you might guess

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.920
20 diagnoses and certainly not much

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.120
and there's an argument DSM is a

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:24.360
free purpose

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.640
it says the first sentence of the introduction

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:32.840
but the authors of DSM are largely not

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:40.280
they're largely invested in primary loyl

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:46.520
well

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.520
well

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.560
of the disorders lots of data but the

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:55.640
dimensions are most complex so

01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.760
the committee that was supposed to solve the problem came up with the

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.360
dimensional system then the parent can

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.960
worried about it and extra committees were brought in to review it

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.360
and decide about it and we ended up with both of you lose it

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:20.520
if somebody was in treatment that was correlated with the dimensions

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:23.720
dimensions would suddenly become very very popular

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:26.520
yeah i agree with that

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:27.640
thank you

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:34.040
thank you very much for participating in this

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.760
it's been very good to hear everybody's

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:41.480
I just when you guys were referring to the

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.920
issue that as

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:50.600
the separation that occurred at the turn of the century

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:54.840
with Freud versus Josper you know

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.720
don't really

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.720
I

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.520
in the proper way I think that there was a group of people

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.200
that were mainly in psychiatrists dealing with the population

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.800
which was you know history

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:18.680
in the individual whereas Josper's and the German

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:24.440
philosophical psychiatrist were looking at people who were much

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.560
more profoundly dysfunctional they were

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.560
in

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:35.640
and

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.800
of

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:42.040
Josper's and his treaties had

01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.200
the

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.200
meat

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:53.560
and the biological psychiatrist have seen some kind of biological basis

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:53.800
for

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.800
whereas

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.800
the outpatient psychiatrist predominantly were

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.800
what is that that

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:09.800
or that

01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:13.800
but continued for a century

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.800
and in complete

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.800
it's pretty clear that the first

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.800
predominant

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:29.800
based psychiatrist

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.800
was introduced

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.800
then

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:37.800
it was

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.800
a

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:51.800
a

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:57.800
biological markers were

01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:03.800
a

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.800
a silent

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.800
a patient

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:19.800
biggest

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.800
as if they are

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.800
you know

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.800
discipline these are

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.800
a

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.800
event and that's

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.800
one of the leading misunderstandings

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.800
because what's happened is that

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.800
you know 100 genes

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:51.800
about the brain is a

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.800
psychiatry from a lot of the

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:03.800
disciplines that deal with the brain

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:07.800
which is much more linear

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.800
and I mean of course they've expanded

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:15.800
because at one point they were

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.800
pointing out because they could find a lesion

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.800
and they thought they were all going to be

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.800
part of

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.800
which was initially known for community

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.800
and that

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.800
that represents

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:43.800
a hierarchical level

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:47.800
that has its own code so

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:51.800
answers

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:55.800
that becomes misleading it's too linear for the majority of

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:59.800
psychics

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.800
that are based on genetics usually it's in the

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.800
why there hasn't been more

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:11.800
literature that has been able to prove is because

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.800
of course linear mechanisms are much much

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.800
easier to so now we start

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.800
to understand that those people

01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.800
may not know the world is

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.800
what is making them feel

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:35.800
when they take those

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.800
can you come to a closure because they have people waiting we have to stop

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:43.800
but

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.800
about online

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.800
that's why you

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.800
that's why you can't prove water

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.800
those are the most important things

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:05.800
that make life worth living

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.800
those are the things that are of the mind and even

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.800
the information

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.800
when he said you know it was the father of information

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.800
it's not really about information that he proved it was just

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.800
a statistic

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.800
of data

01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.800
I think you made your point

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.800
Hi

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.800
as a data person myself I wanted to offer up

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.800
the results from a literature review out of the University of Colorado Denver

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:49.800
School of Medicine they looked

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.800
at analysis of all the published studies up until 2012

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.800
on antidepressant use versus the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.800
and what they found was that the effect size

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.800
and there were 74 studies on the use of antidepressants alone was

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.800
0.3 which means about three standard deviations between the control group and the

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.800
intervention group that received antidepressants and when they

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:17.800
looked at studies where they had control groups versus patients that

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.800
had received psychodynamics that could be the average effect

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.800
understanding

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.800
it seems that there's something about establishing a

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.800
science or a relationship with the system on expressing feelings

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:49.800
things are established in the treatment patients

01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:25.800
Cancer, or myocardial infarction, or tuberculosis, or dentistry, or dentistry, right?

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:29.800
We've been horrified. That's important.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:35.800
There are different treatments. There are several types of psychotherapy

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:41.800
cognitive behavior therapies very popular. Dynamic therapy is the beloved of

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.800
dynamically oriented psychiatrists, pharmacotherapy.

01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:49.800
All the treatments seem to have

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.800
a order of magnitude similar effect to mild to moderate depression.

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:59.800
One reading is that with severe depression, the pharmacotherapy

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.800
shows an advantage but even more striking, you don't even mention it,

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:07.800
the most effective treatment for severe depression is electroconvulsive

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.800
therapy. There's a huge amount of data on that. It's not even in your

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.800
survey. But again, more important

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:25.800
I think the average

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:29.800
range of depression is your well-depressed

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:35.800
cover or your main need treatment and then you get better and then you're well again.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.800
That's not the natural history of depression. The majority of depressed

01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.800
patients have a long term usually lifelong predisposition

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.800
or vulnerability to depression and they have more than one

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.800
episode and therefore an important goal of the treatment is to modify

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:55.800
that vulnerability and the likelihood of subsequent episodes.

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:59.800
We've been dramatically affected in that with bipolar disease

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:03.800
but that's a small amount of total depression. It's not

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.800
quite clear how effective we are

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.800
long term.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.800
That if you continue the treatment indefinitely, it continues to work

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.800
but no patient continues treatment indefinitely.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:23.800
Pathologic transfer to their therapist

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.800
so we have a problem you want me to end.

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.800
We have a problem.

01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:51.800
A blind though is...

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.800
that the drugs are effective. Take the drugs first. In fact

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.800
the best drugs we have help about one third

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:03.800
of the patients who take them. That's not widely recognized.

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.800
Partly because the pharmaceutical industry doesn't

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:11.800
advertise it that way. They'll tell you two-thirds of the

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.800
patients who take the drugs get better which is true but

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.800
with a placebo, one-third of the

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:21.800
logic of efficacy, our best pharmacological treatments

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.800
affects one-third of the people who take the treatment.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.800
The same might be true over psychotherapy in terms of

01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:33.800
treating depression. If you look on your face you don't like that idea.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.800
I'm trying to know the multiple studies on the use of psychothermology

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:41.800
versus psychotherapy for some to come blind.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.800
As my understanding, I have not seen any literature with psychothermology

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:49.800
but more on the better outcomes that I've done.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.800
I'm looking for R&D, the education program.

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:57.800
I'll be quick. I'm interested to know what the panelists think about the future.

01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.800
Oh, for psychiatric treatment by hallucinogenics, specifically

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.800
psilocybin and chemin.

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:09.800
Interested to know what the state of the situation is now

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:13.800
and what the prognosis is.

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.800
I'm interested to know what the state of

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:21.800
the situation is now and what the

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.800
prognosis is for future research and

01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:29.800
application. It's still pretty early.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.800
I think that studies are not. So certainly the ketamine story,

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.800
ketamine is legal to give and easier to study.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.800
As with most things, it's got a little height in the beginning but as more studies are being done

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.800
it's clearly solid evidence that people respond to ketamine

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.800
and people who are treating resistant to depression and don't respond to anything else

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.800
sometimes respond to ketamine. The problem with ketamine of course is it requires continuous

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.800
treatment. And we don't know how often we can do this.

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.800
There's a signal there that has been now established.

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.800
It takes it will be better for one week but that's about as far as we know.

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.800
As far as the rest of the psychedelics go, again there's a signal there as well.

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.800
This is a sad thing because of what happened in the 60s and the overreaction to

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:17.800
the misuse of psychedelics. These things have been out of the hands of

01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:21.800
the patients for 40-50 years. Now luckily it's coming back in and the

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.800
studies are now coming in more and more. The clinical trials for all kinds of

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:29.800
you know, originally cancer patients who were terminal because

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.800
only people who could be given the meds, they were allowed and they got very good results

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:37.800
and it's now they're trying for more and more application than the

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:41.800
future of psychedelic treatment is

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:45.800
very promising. But the problem is we don't want to start telling people they should go

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.800
and buy mushrooms on the street and start taking it because there's so much that's

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:53.800
unknown dosing and these things have bad effects even the studies

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:59.800
that you still aside in there are certain things that are complicated.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:05.800
What is the placebo?

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:11.800
That's a problem because you're right. People know I think I have

01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:15.800
something that has effects.

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.800
I think we'll stop after this.

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:31.800
There were two areas that were brought up. One was between medicine and psychiatry

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.800
you know somatic medicine doctors and psychiatrists

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.800
and the other congress was this between

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.800
medicine and psychiatry.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.800
The other book was from my generation the way that patients is better

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:51.800
than the other patients.

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.800
But it seems to me that there's kind of been an irony in the course of my

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:59.800
career as a psychiatrist where I watched medicine people

01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:03.800
very interested in narrative. So now with Columbia you can get a master's degree in

01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:09.800
medicine and the medical school courses.

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.800
That's psychiatry.

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:19.800
We have to be abdicated with great skills in the sense and it's funny to me

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.800
that we're not the ones teaching narrative medicine to the generation of

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:27.800
medical students.

01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:31.800
Almost universal myth

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:35.800
that's untrue and is interesting.

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.800
Of course it was not a psychiatrist. Freud was a neurologist

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.800
who treated patients who ended up with

01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.800
the rest of the story. But the psychiatry

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.800
grows out of general medicine. Neurology

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:55.800
wasn't a specialty. Freud was seeing his patient

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:59.800
outpatient with physical symptoms.

01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:03.800
The history

01:58:03.800 --> 01:58:07.800
of the sciences into its moving away

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:11.800
from medicine and away from psychiatry.

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:15.800
But in fact, my view on the

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.800
political interview skills and patient recognition are most

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:23.800
with not

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:31.800
with collided patients.

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:37.800
Who are supposed to learn the

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:42.800
or used to be supposed to learn these things. Although the inpatient seriously

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:47.800
mentally on population.

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:51.800
Skittling or disease.

01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:55.800
Are probably the least

01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:59.800
people

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:03.800
and people. They're much more important.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:09.800
Physically ill

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:11.800
or

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.800
not mentally ill

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:19.800
but they

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:26.800
are

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:31.800
all stuff on an inpatient.

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:51.800
Deafs, you know.

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:55.800
Hospital.

01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:59.800
He's not taking his meds anymore

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:03.800
after him.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:07.800
So there's a

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:11.800
story. And it's funny at University of Michigan

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:15.800
reinvented a medical humanities program.

02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:17.800
Because we say, yeah,

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:19.800
our stuff, we need to

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:31.800
do the same thing.

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:39.800
I'm gonna

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.800
and I'm gonna afford your medical student applying for psychiatry.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.800
So very interesting to talk. And I really thank you all for being here today.

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:51.800
And when I visited the future and understanding all the neuroscience we're talking about

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:55.800
immunology and more target therapies, nanobots, hallucinogens,

02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:59.800
all the neuro stimulation. Before I'm hearing from

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:05.800
this is the future of psychiatry. It sounds more like reallocating resources, delivering care.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.800
Is my future of psychiatrists, are we going to see more of the acceleration of kind of the fancy new therapies,

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.800
modalities? Or should we really be advocating for spending money where it's going to be

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.800
both impactful things like housing or the early challenge

02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:22.800
of vengeance?

02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:26.800
I'll take a shot at this. So in five years after you finish your residency,

02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:30.800
you will only see the most ill patients.

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.800
And then at some point, so that most of the other mild

02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:38.800
to moderate will hopefully be taken care of by primary care or some other.

02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.800
You will at some point realize that the treatment that your

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.800
armamentarium you have is limited. Then you will go, I heard this talk about

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.800
psilocybin. I got to do something for my patients.

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.800
This is why I think there's such a great interest because we have a limited

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:58.800
repertoire of what we can offer are very very ill patients.

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:00.800
And we have a

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:14.800
lot of work to do.
