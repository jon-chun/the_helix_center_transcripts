WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
Good day, everyone.

00:01.600 --> 00:04.160
Welcome back to the Hillock Center.

00:04.160 --> 00:05.360
I'm Gerald Hurowitz.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.880
I'm the Associate Director of the Hillocks.

00:07.880 --> 00:11.080
And we're here with a wonderful panel today

00:11.080 --> 00:12.960
on the many minds of memory.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.320
We're gonna allow Beverly Zabriski

00:15.320 --> 00:18.760
to give you more detail about our wonderful panel.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.460
Before that, I wanna mention a few,

00:20.460 --> 00:21.560
make a few comments.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.440
First of all, I hope everyone is holding on

00:24.440 --> 00:26.920
and doing well through this pandemic.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.880
It's been a very long haul.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.200
Everyone's had to adapt to it,

00:31.200 --> 00:34.760
including us here at the Hillock Center,

00:34.760 --> 00:38.560
including these Zoom roundtables.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.040
But we do what we can, right?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.120
And we're getting through this.

00:42.120 --> 00:45.840
I wanna mention that we have a few additional roundtables

00:45.840 --> 00:46.800
coming up.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.280
We're anticipating on February 20th,

00:49.280 --> 00:52.000
we're gonna have a talk on populism.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.920
And then sometime in March,

00:53.920 --> 00:56.160
the date to be determined,

00:56.160 --> 00:59.240
a talk on placebo, no, SIBO response.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.960
There may be yet a additional one on stress

01:02.960 --> 01:04.840
later into the spring.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.680
So that's it for now.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.480
I'll hand it over to Beverly Zabriski.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.280
Welcome.

01:10.280 --> 01:15.280
I was just saying that this is our second Zoom helix program.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.040
We're not sitting in a circle with each other.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.240
We're not bouncing off each other's chemistry

01:23.240 --> 01:25.120
in the same way at all.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.120
But we have a particularly wonderful, lively, creative

01:30.120 --> 01:34.040
and deep group of presenters today

01:34.040 --> 01:37.480
for whom I'm very grateful that they were able to change

01:37.480 --> 01:40.200
the date from last March 14th,

01:40.200 --> 01:43.080
which was the cusp of COVID to today.

01:43.080 --> 01:47.320
So I wanna express my appreciation to all of you.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.320
We have physicians, neurologists, an artist,

01:52.320 --> 01:56.880
dog cognition researcher, author.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.200
And if you, after the program,

02:00.200 --> 02:02.240
look at their biographies,

02:02.240 --> 02:06.040
you will see an extraordinarily varied

02:06.040 --> 02:11.040
and deep list of accomplishments

02:11.480 --> 02:13.680
so that we don't take up the whole program

02:13.680 --> 02:17.000
talking about them rather than hearing from them.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.400
I've asked each of them to go around and tell us,

02:20.400 --> 02:24.760
just say what your profession is

02:24.760 --> 02:27.480
and maybe your title and what you most want

02:27.480 --> 02:30.360
to be remembered for professionally.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.960
And then for all the credentials,

02:32.960 --> 02:35.880
we can each research that on our own.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.320
So can we start with Christina Alberini?

02:43.920 --> 02:44.720
Sure.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.520
Hi everyone.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.760
First of all, I'd like to thank

02:48.760 --> 02:53.520
everyone at the Helix Center for organizing these E meetings.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.960
They are very important so that we can keep being connected.

02:58.240 --> 03:01.240
And second, let me tell you what I'm doing.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.160
I am a professor of neuroscience

03:04.160 --> 03:08.560
at the Center for Neuroscience, New York University.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.280
And I have been studying for now about 30 years,

03:12.280 --> 03:15.720
the biological basis of learning a memory.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.600
And of course, if we want to get into biology,

03:18.600 --> 03:20.720
we have to use models.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.360
We are not using humans because we need to get into the brains

03:25.360 --> 03:30.160
of models and understand what type of biological mechanisms

03:30.160 --> 03:33.880
change with learning and which one are important

03:33.880 --> 03:35.760
for making memories.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.360
And of course, memories come in different types.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.280
Well, I'm sure we'll discuss about that.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.280
So the questions we have in the lab

03:43.280 --> 03:47.800
is mostly about memory formation and storage

03:47.800 --> 03:50.440
and also about how memories are retrieved.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.080
So when we recall memories, what happens to the biology

03:54.080 --> 03:57.880
of the brain and what are the biological mechanisms that

03:57.880 --> 04:01.680
come into play to change those memories?

04:01.680 --> 04:04.920
Because at every single recall, we

04:04.920 --> 04:10.520
change our memories and the storage of information.

04:10.520 --> 04:15.600
And what do I want to be remembered for my professional

04:15.600 --> 04:19.320
contribution while I hope there is many more things to come?

04:19.320 --> 04:21.920
So I'm looking into the future.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.160
But ideally, of course, it's not only

04:24.160 --> 04:30.040
to progress significantly in the understanding

04:30.040 --> 04:33.040
of the biology of memory, which is what we do,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.080
but also to find mechanisms through these studies

04:36.080 --> 04:40.160
that are important for memory losses and diseases

04:40.160 --> 04:41.760
of memories.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.600
And those are many.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.320
I can just mention a few.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.160
Of course, Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative diseases

04:49.160 --> 04:52.920
that come with memory loss, but also cognitive impairments

04:52.920 --> 04:56.800
in neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as problems

04:56.800 --> 05:01.280
of memories due to traumatic experiences or addiction.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.800
I'm going to stop there.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.280
Thank you.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
You're on mute, Beverly.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.160
We can't hear you.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.160
Richard, author, distinguished author.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.160
Well, hello, everybody.

05:19.160 --> 05:23.160
And thanks to the Helix organization, I'm not

05:23.160 --> 05:26.160
a dog recognition expert.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.160
Although the first half of my career, maybe I was in that I

05:30.160 --> 05:34.160
was a publisher and editor and recognizing the dogs and the

05:34.160 --> 05:37.160
successes that I've done.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.160
More recently, although I did not know

05:39.160 --> 05:43.160
that I had continued editing, when I came to the states,

05:43.160 --> 05:47.160
my first freelance job was to edit the autobiography

05:47.160 --> 05:49.160
by Rudy Giuliani.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.160
But I normally like to keep quiet about that.

05:52.160 --> 05:58.160
I've written four publish books since coming to the states.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.160
I've also contributed to a book more recently,

06:01.160 --> 06:05.160
The Presence of the Past Essays on Memory for the Academic

06:05.160 --> 06:10.160
Press.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.160
In terms of what I'd be most pleased to be remembered for,

06:13.160 --> 06:17.160
I suppose it's a book that I've got coming out in June,

06:17.160 --> 06:21.160
which is called The History Makers, which looks at people who

06:21.160 --> 06:25.160
have influenced our ideas, shaped our ideas of the past,

06:25.160 --> 06:28.160
from Herodotus to the TV age.

06:28.160 --> 06:34.160
So I'm very much here with the hat of a historian.

06:34.160 --> 06:39.160
But with a particular interest in how memory works,

06:39.160 --> 06:42.160
which of course has had a large part to play in the writing

06:42.160 --> 06:46.160
and history.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.160
Thank you very much, Richard.

06:48.160 --> 06:53.160
And then the neurologist, Guy Atre Gevvy, who is also the author

06:53.160 --> 07:00.160
of Spectrums of Hope, about the aging brain, Guy Atre.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.160
Thanks for having me, Beverly.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
I'm a neurologist.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.160
I'm Director of Park Avenue Neurology,

07:06.160 --> 07:09.160
and I'm a clinical professor of neurology at Downstate

07:09.160 --> 07:10.160
Medical Center in Brooklyn.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.160
I've been a cognitive neurologist for 26 years now.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.160
I can't believe it's been that long.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.160
And love my job.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.160
And what I'd like to be remembered for is two things.

07:22.160 --> 07:28.160
One, that Alzheimer's disease is a spectrum disorder,

07:28.160 --> 07:32.160
and it is informed very much by the brain that the person

07:32.160 --> 07:35.160
brings to the illness, your strengths and weaknesses

07:35.160 --> 07:40.160
inform how you develop it, how you manifest it,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.160
and how you respond to treatment.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.160
So it's very different, for example, from kidney disease,

07:45.160 --> 07:51.160
where you can, the same kidney condition means the same thing

07:51.160 --> 07:55.160
in multiple people, whereas Alzheimer's in one person is a

07:55.160 --> 07:58.160
private Alzheimer's and very different from Alzheimer's

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
in another person.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.160
And the same thing with mild cognitive impairment

08:02.160 --> 08:06.160
or memory problems that they vary and are very, very private

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
to each person's brain.

08:08.160 --> 08:13.160
And the second thing I'd like to be remembered for is

08:13.160 --> 08:18.160
the systematizing of menopause-related cognitive loss.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.160
Women going through menopause have cognitive loss,

08:21.160 --> 08:24.160
which can mimic that of early Alzheimer's,

08:24.160 --> 08:28.160
and when it's not recognized and treated as such,

08:28.160 --> 08:33.160
and unfortunately, in neurology, we don't actually get a menopausal

08:33.160 --> 08:40.160
or a history of anything related to the uterus from women as a role.

08:40.160 --> 08:44.160
That systematization, I'm very proud of.

08:44.160 --> 08:48.160
We just published that in the Journal of the American College

08:48.160 --> 08:50.160
of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

08:50.160 --> 08:55.160
So thank you very much for having me.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.160
And thank you for being here.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.160
And Andy Lee, who is a neuroscientist at the University of

09:01.160 --> 09:06.160
Toronto, has been working on memory disorders for many years.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.160
Andy?

09:07.160 --> 09:11.160
Everyone, thank you for the organizers for inviting me.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.160
It's a real privilege to be here and to be part of this panel.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.160
So as Beverly just said, I am based in Toronto at the University

09:18.160 --> 09:22.160
of Toronto at the Scarborough campus, and I'm a cognitive

09:22.160 --> 09:26.160
neuroscientist, so my lab is interested in how a group of

09:26.160 --> 09:29.160
structures in the brain, probably the most familiar one to a lot

09:29.160 --> 09:32.160
of people who is at the campus, how that's involved in memory

09:32.160 --> 09:35.160
processing, so we do a lot of brain imaging, MRI scanning.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.160
We look at patients with amnesia, and our particular

09:39.160 --> 09:42.160
interests are how memory interacts with other things.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.160
So perception being one, decision making, and if there's one

09:47.160 --> 09:51.160
thing maybe I would like to be remembered by, I think,

09:51.160 --> 09:54.160
I think that was Beverly, I asked her certainly not thinking,

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
what do I want to remember by?

09:56.160 --> 09:59.160
I wasn't quite sure, but I think maybe I'm not ambitious enough,

09:59.160 --> 10:04.160
but even 10, 20 years, at least one thing that we've discovered

10:04.160 --> 10:08.160
has actually contributed to our understanding of how the brain

10:08.160 --> 10:12.160
actually processes like time in memory or visual eye,

10:12.160 --> 10:15.160
it depends on memory, and gives us a little bit of understanding

10:15.160 --> 10:17.160
into why patients like Alzheimer's disease patients have

10:17.160 --> 10:21.160
memory problems, I'd be happy.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.160
So that's my answer to that question.

10:25.160 --> 10:29.160
That is quite ambitious, Andy.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.160
And we have an author and a researcher and professor at

10:33.160 --> 10:40.160
Barnard College at the Dog Cognition Lab, and I think

10:40.160 --> 10:45.160
her last book has really marked this particular era as far as I

10:45.160 --> 10:49.160
see from the people that I'm in contact with, which is our

10:49.160 --> 10:53.160
dogs ourselves, a story of a singular bond.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.160
Alexandra, thank you for being here.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.160
Thanks, Beverly, and thank you to the Helix Center.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.160
I'm pleased to be with you all here.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.160
As Beverly said, I'm a teacher at Barnard College, and I'm a

11:06.160 --> 11:10.160
Senior Research Fellow there, and I had the Dog Cognition Lab.

11:10.160 --> 11:14.160
So I'm a cognitive scientist studying non-human animal mind

11:14.160 --> 11:20.160
and the dog is my non-human of interest, and I've written

11:20.160 --> 11:24.160
widely on Dog Mind and the Dog Human Bond.

11:24.160 --> 11:31.160
I think I'd like to be remembered for bringing our attention back

11:31.160 --> 11:36.160
to imagining that Oomveldt, the world view, the perspective of

11:36.160 --> 11:39.160
non-human others, I think.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.160
And I don't know if I have fully imagined the world view of

11:43.160 --> 11:47.160
non-human people, or the world view of non-human people,

11:47.160 --> 11:49.160
or the world view of non-human people.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.160
I think I'm a non-humanist, but maybe by the end of my life,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.160
that can be an accomplishment I look back on.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.160
For now, it's just bringing people's attention to the

11:59.160 --> 12:02.160
perspectives of others and remembering that there is a

12:02.160 --> 12:05.160
perspective that is different from the human perspective.

12:05.160 --> 12:09.160
Thank you so much, Alexandra, and it reminds me that at the

12:09.160 --> 12:13.160
end of the day, I was a little bit nervous about the

12:13.160 --> 12:17.160
person who had a dream, a patient who went there and had a dream

12:17.160 --> 12:19.160
of a dog.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.160
It was considered a very positive prognosis.

12:23.160 --> 12:28.160
So I sort of work out of that template myself these days.

12:28.160 --> 12:36.160
And then we have a lady that I met, the last Chinese lunar

12:36.160 --> 12:42.160
project, and she's a scientist, a journalist, a broadcaster,

12:42.160 --> 12:46.160
and she will tell you some of the projects that she has

12:46.160 --> 12:48.160
created.

12:48.160 --> 12:53.160
Thank you, Beverly, and the Helix Center for hosting this

12:53.160 --> 12:55.160
discussion.

12:55.160 --> 13:00.160
I think this discussion sort of came out of the talk that we

13:00.160 --> 13:04.160
had at that dinner, where we were talking about if history is

13:04.160 --> 13:08.160
a positive memory of a nation, then what happens if you're

13:08.160 --> 13:13.160
consistently missing from that story or you're constantly

13:13.160 --> 13:15.160
vilified in it?

13:15.160 --> 13:21.160
So what happens to your present and how does it affect your

13:21.160 --> 13:23.160
future?

13:23.160 --> 13:28.160
So I used to be at NPR, which deals with the history of the

13:28.160 --> 13:32.160
moment, but I think my husband writes history and looks at

13:32.160 --> 13:34.160
history at a longer range.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.160
And I think that perspective is important.

13:37.160 --> 13:41.160
And because I'm married to him, I've been given the opportunity

13:41.160 --> 13:46.160
to look at a slice of history through a perspective and a lens

13:46.160 --> 13:49.160
that is often not shared.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.160
And that's the Japanese American or Asian American history.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.160
And if you look at that, America can look very, very different,

13:56.160 --> 13:59.160
and so can freedom, the idea of freedoms.

13:59.160 --> 14:04.160
So my project that I would like to be remembered for is it's

14:04.160 --> 14:07.160
called Freedom from Fear Yellable Project.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.160
I'm a conceptual artist, although I use ceramics.

14:10.160 --> 14:16.160
It's really about history and about identity, time, memory.

14:16.160 --> 14:23.160
So I took 120 yellow T-balls that I hand-pitched and I took

14:23.160 --> 14:28.160
them to all 10 U.S. concentration camps that was in the

14:28.160 --> 14:32.160
United States in the 1940s, and I photographed them.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.160
And because of that, they sort of been invited to different

14:36.160 --> 14:38.160
places.

14:38.160 --> 14:43.160
I have to say not many people like this story, and there's been

14:43.160 --> 14:49.160
a pushback on it, but I really thank this panel for giving me

14:49.160 --> 14:50.160
a platform.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
Thank you.

14:51.160 --> 14:59.160
I'm so rich.

14:59.160 --> 15:04.160
You agreed to start the discussion itself?

15:04.160 --> 15:07.160
Yes, I drew the short straw because everybody else was

15:07.160 --> 15:10.160
keeping sensibly quiet.

15:10.160 --> 15:14.160
I think I just begin as, you know, I'm not a psychiatrist,

15:14.160 --> 15:17.160
I can't list or any of those disciplines.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.160
With having read recently Paul Licker's book, Memory,

15:21.160 --> 15:24.160
History, Forgetting.

15:24.160 --> 15:30.160
And in that book, he has 79 in his index and contents pages

15:30.160 --> 15:34.160
together, 79 different categories under memory.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.160
So where on earth does one start?

15:36.160 --> 15:41.160
And I thought that to start the ball rolling, I refer to

15:41.160 --> 15:47.160
Sigmund Freud, who saw memory as constantly transforming,

15:47.160 --> 15:52.160
reorganizing, revising.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.160
And that, even in our introductory comments that people have

15:56.160 --> 15:58.160
made, was acknowledged.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.160
But I want to start by asking the other members of the panel,

16:01.160 --> 16:04.160
the other point that Freud makes.

16:04.160 --> 16:08.160
And he says that memory is essentially creative.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.160
What do people think he meant by that?

16:11.160 --> 16:18.160
And how does that tie in with your own studies?

16:18.160 --> 16:22.160
I think I can start.

16:22.160 --> 16:28.160
Yes, so to get to these questions, let's remind ourselves

16:28.160 --> 16:32.160
and who is listening to us that memory is coming different

16:32.160 --> 16:33.160
flavors.

16:33.160 --> 16:38.160
And as you mentioned, they give 79 categories of memories.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.160
And of course, there are different ways to categorize them.

16:42.160 --> 16:48.160
One or two major ways that in neuroscience we use to categorize

16:48.160 --> 16:53.160
memories is according to their duration.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.160
Long-term memories, shorter memories.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.160
Shorter memories, they last for a very short time.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
Long-term memories, they last for a long time.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.160
And they are very easy to remember.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.160
And why are they different?

17:06.160 --> 17:10.160
They are different because the mechanisms that the brain used

17:10.160 --> 17:14.160
to make and express these memories are different.

17:14.160 --> 17:21.160
And another way to categorize them is according to what they do.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.160
There are different memory systems and different types of memories.

17:24.160 --> 17:30.160
We have the clarity of explicit memories, or we have,

17:30.160 --> 17:34.160
we have to contrast to this implicit type of memories.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.160
For example, the explicit declarative memories are the memories

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
we talk about.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.160
So if we are here today and we talk about what we have learned,

17:42.160 --> 17:45.160
those are declarative memories.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.160
And in the same system, also memories of general knowledge.

17:49.160 --> 17:57.160
If I say city, you all know what I mean by that concept.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.160
So those are part of one memory system which is processed by the

18:00.160 --> 18:04.160
media temporal lobe that has been demonstrated by many, many

18:04.160 --> 18:08.160
studies in humans as well as in non-human animals.

18:08.160 --> 18:15.160
If part of this memory system is impaired or their activity,

18:15.160 --> 18:18.160
the activity is blocked, those memories do not fall.

18:18.160 --> 18:22.160
Those long-term memories do not fall.

18:22.160 --> 18:28.160
As opposed to other major system of memory, the implicit type of

18:28.160 --> 18:32.160
memories, the memories of how to do things is not, they are not

18:32.160 --> 18:34.160
spoken, they are performed.

18:34.160 --> 18:38.160
For example, if we go skiing, we have to learn how to ski.

18:38.160 --> 18:43.160
And then we remember those are very, very strong memories.

18:43.160 --> 18:49.160
Memories of how to drive a car, ride a bike, tie your shoes.

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
And then everything we do that we learn the memories which

18:53.160 --> 18:57.160
become sort of automatic, those are part of the implicit

18:57.160 --> 18:58.160
memory systems.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.160
And of course not talking about muscle memory.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.160
Muscle memory is performance.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.160
So the performance includes the muscle memories.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.160
And those are part of the implicit memory system because we

19:10.160 --> 19:14.160
perform those memories, we execute them in an implicit way.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.160
We don't think about.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.160
After we have learned, we don't think about how to turn the wheel

19:19.160 --> 19:21.160
when we drive a car, right?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.160
We just do it automatically.

19:23.160 --> 19:27.160
And in the same implicit memory system we have also emotional

19:27.160 --> 19:32.160
memories, memories that are expressed without a conscious

19:32.160 --> 19:33.160
awareness.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.160
So the other distinction is conscious awareness versus not.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.160
Implicit types of memories are not conscious in their expression.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.160
And explicit type are.

19:42.160 --> 19:45.160
So there are many different types of memory.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.160
I don't want to go on and on because it's a long story.

19:48.160 --> 19:53.160
So is it a creative process like Freud suggested?

19:53.160 --> 19:59.160
So first of all, I have to say the Freud was brilliant in predicting,

19:59.160 --> 20:03.160
let's say in his writing so many, many aspects and

20:03.160 --> 20:08.160
and processes that we then in neuroscience discovered in the

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
memory, in the memory domain.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.160
Is it a creative process?

20:12.160 --> 20:14.160
I think I, yes, I do agree.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
And why?

20:15.160 --> 20:22.160
Because when we form memories and they are stored, if we need to

20:22.160 --> 20:25.160
retrieve them, because there are recollections, something that

20:25.160 --> 20:30.160
reminds us of whatever happened in our history, in that precise

20:30.160 --> 20:36.160
moment, we are living at different experience at a different time.

20:36.160 --> 20:41.160
So now the new experience in the present is going to be

20:41.160 --> 20:46.160
associated somewhat to whatever is recalled and is going to be

20:46.160 --> 20:49.160
restored in another context.

20:49.160 --> 20:56.160
So that is already a processing of the memories, which happens, as

20:56.160 --> 20:59.160
you can imagine, every moment, every day.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.160
But also we re-elaborate memories.

21:02.160 --> 21:10.160
So if we think about something and we recall experiences and we

21:10.160 --> 21:13.160
start thinking about something else because of an emotional, for

21:13.160 --> 21:18.160
example, an emotional experience that is so important to us, we

21:18.160 --> 21:24.160
start creating associations, no associations, which will become

21:24.160 --> 21:26.160
no memories.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.160
And so the creative process is about who we are made of the

21:30.160 --> 21:34.160
multitude of experiences through learning, memorization,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
recollections and re-elaboration.

21:36.160 --> 21:41.160
I hope that gives some topic for discussion.

21:41.160 --> 21:48.160
I might compliment that by answering Richard's question in a

21:48.160 --> 21:50.160
slightly different way.

21:50.160 --> 21:54.160
I mean, I hear when I think of whether memory is a creative

21:54.160 --> 21:58.160
process, to which I also, a sense, I think that my

21:58.160 --> 22:02.160
interpretation is to say that memories are not necessarily

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
leaver-idical.

22:03.160 --> 22:06.160
In other words, they're not necessarily representative of the

22:06.160 --> 22:09.160
world that's out there because they are interpreted through the

22:09.160 --> 22:10.160
subjective self.

22:10.160 --> 22:16.160
And it really puts to the point whether if we could view

22:16.160 --> 22:20.160
everyone's memories, other humans or non-humans, whether we would

22:20.160 --> 22:21.160
recognize them.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.160
In other words, whether they are even understandable or kind of

22:24.160 --> 22:28.160
interpretable or translatable by others.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.160
Right?

22:29.160 --> 22:32.160
And so to me, that's a very generative way to begin this

22:32.160 --> 22:36.160
conversation and thinking, as Christina said, not only about the

22:36.160 --> 22:40.160
re-encoding and the changing of memory that happens with

22:40.160 --> 22:46.160
remembering, but also about the very creativity of memory to

22:46.160 --> 22:50.160
begin with, that it is an interpretation of a moment or a

22:50.160 --> 22:55.160
scene or a fact or an experience and says something is

22:55.160 --> 23:00.160
incorporated with the self, which might be impossibly subjective.

23:00.160 --> 23:09.160
I agree with you, Alexandra and Christina as well.

23:09.160 --> 23:14.160
I think all memory is a fabrication of our brain.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.160
Every single memory we have, reality is really truly a

23:18.160 --> 23:20.160
fabrication of our brains.

23:20.160 --> 23:24.160
And it's an individual reality, which is not necessarily

23:24.160 --> 23:28.160
parallel to the reality of someone right next to you because

23:28.160 --> 23:32.160
it's always filtered through your experience, through your

23:32.160 --> 23:38.160
neural networks, through your interpretations, and through

23:38.160 --> 23:41.160
your editing of what you see.

23:41.160 --> 23:46.160
So not only are you going to have alteration and distortion of

23:46.160 --> 23:54.160
memory as you recall, but you also have a true editing and

23:54.160 --> 23:57.160
distilling of memory as you lay it down.

23:57.160 --> 24:02.160
So there's a tremendous amount of editing that goes on in both

24:02.160 --> 24:07.160
the laying down of memory, what you choose to attend to, how you

24:07.160 --> 24:11.160
choose to store it, what you choose to link it to, whether or

24:11.160 --> 24:13.160
not it's real.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.160
Again, all reality is a fabrication of our individual

24:17.160 --> 24:21.160
brains, and then how you choose to reproduce it, which is always

24:21.160 --> 24:25.160
going to be different from one person to the next.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.160
Even if you agree on the generalities, the details are going to

24:29.160 --> 24:33.160
be different because each of us chooses to remember something

24:33.160 --> 24:34.160
different.

24:34.160 --> 24:39.160
So Freud was absolutely correct in terms of how he formulated

24:39.160 --> 24:40.160
memory.

24:40.160 --> 24:44.160
So it's just like, you know, we're going to go to the

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
next slide.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
So let's go.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.160
Hello.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
Yeah.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.160
Hello.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.160
Yeah.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
Yes.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.160
It's set.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
It's set.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.160
I have to say that I think there's a difference between personal

24:57.160 --> 25:03.160
memory and collective, you know, national memory, like history.

25:03.160 --> 25:07.160
And I think one of the battles that we're having in America

25:07.160 --> 25:10.160
is the history of America.

25:10.160 --> 25:15.160
And basically there is a narrative that starts with Columbus

25:15.160 --> 25:22.160
and there's George Washington and, you know, Adams and, you know,

25:22.160 --> 25:28.160
Jefferson and then it goes to Lincoln and then FDR and then

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
we're at today.

25:30.160 --> 25:36.160
And in that story, the history of the original people that were

25:36.160 --> 25:39.160
here is missing, for example.

25:39.160 --> 25:44.160
There was a survey about five years ago.

25:44.160 --> 25:49.160
I think they found out that 40% of Americans believe that no

25:49.160 --> 25:53.160
Native Americans are alive today and that they are extinct

25:53.160 --> 25:55.160
like dinosaurs.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.160
And, you know, if you read our newspapers and our history

25:58.160 --> 26:04.160
books, you sort of believe that they're actually very much alive,

26:04.160 --> 26:07.160
a lot of them were put on reservations.

26:07.160 --> 26:11.160
They've moved into cities to survive and they're still there.

26:11.160 --> 26:17.160
And the other story that never gets out, it's usually race is a

26:17.160 --> 26:19.160
big issue today.

26:19.160 --> 26:25.160
And the reason why race is often only seen in a white and black

26:25.160 --> 26:30.160
dichotomy is because the whole history of non-white laws is

26:30.160 --> 26:35.160
never talked about in our history books and the not white laws

26:35.160 --> 26:40.160
were all determined in our court of law and they came out after

26:40.160 --> 26:42.160
the Civil War.

26:42.160 --> 26:47.160
So it was determined in 1870, which was an update of the

26:47.160 --> 26:51.160
original naturalization law of 1790, which said that only white

26:51.160 --> 26:56.160
people can become a citizen, was changed in 1870 to include

26:56.160 --> 27:01.160
Africans and persons of African descent.

27:01.160 --> 27:06.160
So after that, there's been law after law after law, which people

27:06.160 --> 27:11.160
who were not African but who were deemed not white had to go to

27:11.160 --> 27:15.160
court because they were excluded from citizenship, from

27:15.160 --> 27:21.160
practicing law, from marrying other people, from, you know, they

27:21.160 --> 27:23.160
couldn't even testify.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.160
Chinese could not testify against white people.

27:26.160 --> 27:30.160
And then all Asian people were banned from the United States

27:30.160 --> 27:35.160
in 1924, which was actually the first year that Native Americans

27:35.160 --> 27:37.160
were allowed to naturalize.

27:37.160 --> 27:41.160
So there's this whole history that's missing.

27:41.160 --> 27:45.160
So I mean, is that a creative process?

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
Maybe it is.

27:47.160 --> 27:52.160
It doesn't always mean good, right?

27:52.160 --> 27:57.160
You tend to think creative means good, but it doesn't have to be

27:57.160 --> 28:00.160
creative in an evil way.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.160
And your thoughts?

28:02.160 --> 28:05.160
To me, it's almost like what Cetsco is saying, it's almost a

28:05.160 --> 28:09.160
destructive process in that we can create memories, but we can

28:09.160 --> 28:13.160
also, I mean, one of the big questions that people ask is,

28:13.160 --> 28:15.160
can we actually remove memories?

28:15.160 --> 28:19.160
So unpleasant memories, can we remove them for our own benefit?

28:19.160 --> 28:22.160
And unfortunately, maybe what you're describing is a sense of

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
that there's injustice happening.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
And so people choose not to talk about it.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.160
And so if we don't reinforce that type of information and it's

28:29.160 --> 28:32.160
the same with our own memories, if we don't reinforce and rehearse

28:32.160 --> 28:37.160
some of our memories, then those memories, we can over time and

28:37.160 --> 28:39.160
we forget about them.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.160
And what we tend to, we can often choose what we want to remember.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.160
So there's a lot of work out there where people say, can we

28:45.160 --> 28:47.160
suppress certain memories, can we enhance certain memories?

28:47.160 --> 28:50.160
And so the ones that give us the joy, the ones that we think

28:50.160 --> 28:55.160
other people will enjoy listening to, the ones which are politically

28:55.160 --> 28:59.160
correct, for example, those are the ones that people like to talk

28:59.160 --> 29:00.160
about a lot.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.160
And so those are the memories that are strengthened and those are

29:04.160 --> 29:07.160
the ones that propagate and unfortunately, memories or events

29:07.160 --> 29:08.160
that you describe of.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.160
Unfortunately, those are the ones that get destroyed and not

29:11.160 --> 29:13.160
talked about as much.

29:13.160 --> 29:18.160
And I think that raises the issue very often of whose memory is

29:18.160 --> 29:19.160
it?

29:19.160 --> 29:22.160
Does one have one's own memory?

29:22.160 --> 29:26.160
Does one have parents' memories, ancestral memories?

29:26.160 --> 29:33.160
Whose memory do we think is what we are recalling and

29:33.160 --> 29:36.160
registering and being imprinted by?

29:36.160 --> 29:37.160
Richard?

29:37.160 --> 29:41.160
Richard?

29:41.160 --> 29:46.160
Of course, one can have one's memory impaired, but I think the

29:46.160 --> 29:51.160
whole question of what is forgetting is another issue.

29:51.160 --> 29:56.160
But I'd like also to introduce this idea, which comes to me from

29:56.160 --> 30:02.160
having Ray Jonathan Moore's book, Moon Walking with Einstein,

30:02.160 --> 30:05.160
when he talks about the power of memory.

30:05.160 --> 30:10.160
And in our introductions, we talked about failures of memory or

30:10.160 --> 30:13.160
where the memory faculty has hurt.

30:13.160 --> 30:18.160
But he says, well, not only did the ancient Greeks have a God of

30:18.160 --> 30:22.160
memory because they thought it was so important, but we know

30:22.160 --> 30:27.160
whether it's from chess players or lorry drivers playing chess

30:27.160 --> 30:33.160
or even taxi drivers who you probably know in London have to

30:33.160 --> 30:35.160
take a particular test.

30:35.160 --> 30:39.160
They have to learn all the places and all the streets in the

30:39.160 --> 30:41.160
city.

30:41.160 --> 30:46.160
And it's been tested or shown that taxi drivers have expanded

30:46.160 --> 30:51.160
brains through having trained their facility in this way.

30:51.160 --> 30:55.160
But when they give up their career as taxi drivers, that

30:55.160 --> 30:57.160
expansion shrinks again.

30:57.160 --> 31:02.160
And it raises the question of, to what extent can we build up

31:02.160 --> 31:04.160
our powers of memory?

31:04.160 --> 31:09.160
If you've got people like taxi drivers or chess players

31:09.160 --> 31:13.160
improving their memory or conjurers, indeed, what can we do

31:13.160 --> 31:20.160
to make the memory faculty of our brains more powerful and be

31:20.160 --> 31:22.160
able to do more with them?

31:22.160 --> 31:27.160
So Richard, so you actually doesn't take much effort to change

31:27.160 --> 31:29.160
your brain at a physical level.

31:29.160 --> 31:34.160
You can practice violin for two days and change the amount of

31:34.160 --> 31:36.160
your brain.

31:36.160 --> 31:41.160
You can physically demonstrate more area of your brain devoted

31:41.160 --> 31:43.160
to that practice.

31:43.160 --> 31:47.160
One thing I wanted to mention which you brought up and wanted

31:47.160 --> 31:53.160
to emphasize is we all tend to prize memory, including the

31:53.160 --> 31:57.160
ancient Greeks, but forgetting is just as important for

31:57.160 --> 31:59.160
remembering.

31:59.160 --> 32:04.160
And to be able to forget and to be able to normally forget is

32:04.160 --> 32:06.160
important for learning.

32:06.160 --> 32:10.160
I mean, if we didn't forget to crawl, you know, and we're

32:10.160 --> 32:13.160
willing to, then we would have learned to walk.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.160
If we didn't forget our first love, it would be hard to fall in

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
love again.

32:17.160 --> 32:21.160
So forgetting is very, if we forgot, if we didn't forget to

32:21.160 --> 32:23.160
babble, you know, it would be harder to learn to.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.160
So it's important to understand, and there's this whole

32:26.160 --> 32:31.160
emphasis in modern society of having to remember, you know,

32:31.160 --> 32:37.160
and memory being equated with intelligence and kind of to

32:37.160 --> 32:40.160
the detriment of the importance of forgetting.

32:40.160 --> 32:45.160
So I'd like to be a proponent of that forgetting is very good

32:45.160 --> 32:48.160
for us and important for our brain.

32:48.160 --> 32:55.160
And this wonderful book by Luria, Russian psychologist called

32:55.160 --> 32:59.160
The Mind of the Monest, and he talks about a patient or a

32:59.160 --> 33:03.160
man who was studied who forgot how to forget.

33:03.160 --> 33:09.160
And it significantly interfered with his ability to function in

33:09.160 --> 33:12.160
a daily, in a productive way on a daily basis.

33:12.160 --> 33:16.160
I'd like to teach my dogs to remember commands better

33:16.160 --> 33:17.160
Alexandra.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.160
I don't know how to do that.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.160
And not forget.

33:21.160 --> 33:26.160
And I think that you also remind me of the Borges story,

33:26.160 --> 33:30.160
Phunas the memorial, where he represents a character who

33:30.160 --> 33:34.160
could not forget and actually how crippling it was and

33:34.160 --> 33:38.160
disabling of being able to act.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.160
And there are a lot of questions that have already come up.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.160
But I mean, to the sort of, how do we remember better?

33:44.160 --> 33:46.160
How does an on human remember better?

33:46.160 --> 33:48.160
That's so interesting because I think it has a lot to do with

33:48.160 --> 33:52.160
our directing of their attention, right, and our inability to

33:52.160 --> 33:59.160
realize what a salient to them in order to allow for the encoding,

33:59.160 --> 34:02.160
which is easy for them to do.

34:02.160 --> 34:07.160
I think can easily learn commands, learn to remember commands.

34:07.160 --> 34:12.160
But we're not always as good at creating an environment which

34:12.160 --> 34:16.160
allows them to pick up on the salient cues.

34:16.160 --> 34:20.160
And I think that's a lot of the things that we've been

34:20.160 --> 34:22.160
talking about.

34:22.160 --> 34:25.160
But if I can also just add one other thing to this, like,

34:25.160 --> 34:30.160
interestingly, frothy sea of ideas, it was something that

34:30.160 --> 34:36.160
sets go in and Andy were hitting on about a cultural memory and

34:36.160 --> 34:42.160
how exclusion of people from a cultural history is a kind of

34:42.160 --> 34:46.160
a cultural memory.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.160
And I was thinking about how when studying nonhuman animals,

34:50.160 --> 34:53.160
there's always a question of whether they have memory at all,

34:53.160 --> 34:55.160
right?

34:55.160 --> 34:59.160
And this is partially because we can't ask animals to do memory

34:59.160 --> 35:03.160
tasks and give us verbal responses as are many of our memory

35:03.160 --> 35:05.160
tasks, right?

35:05.160 --> 35:08.160
And so even though nonhuman animals are studied for their

35:08.160 --> 35:12.160
own memory, still, what I will be asked about dogs, you know,

35:12.160 --> 35:16.160
can they remember anything, which is ridiculous?

35:16.160 --> 35:18.160
Of course they can.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.160
I mean, all their behavior evinces it.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.160
But because we can't see into their brains, we kind of assume

35:24.160 --> 35:26.160
that maybe there's an absence there.

35:26.160 --> 35:30.160
And I'm wondering if the sort of way we disallow nonverbal

35:30.160 --> 35:34.160
others from having memory is similar to the kind of historical

35:34.160 --> 35:40.160
exclusion, memorial exclusion of peoples from our history.

35:40.160 --> 35:44.160
I'm just seeing an interesting analog there.

35:44.160 --> 35:48.160
I like to say something here because I was shaking my head

35:48.160 --> 35:52.160
because there is so much work done on memories in nonhuman

35:52.160 --> 35:53.160
animals.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.160
And of course they have memories.

35:55.160 --> 35:59.160
We can say that they are not talking to us, but that's just

35:59.160 --> 36:03.160
one single way to express memories.

36:03.160 --> 36:07.160
And so the way to express memories is how to do things is how

36:07.160 --> 36:11.160
to recognize places is how to navigate spaces.

36:11.160 --> 36:15.160
We have tons and tons of evidence in nonhuman animals that they

36:15.160 --> 36:16.160
have memories.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.160
And memories are like any other thing evolutionarily

36:19.160 --> 36:20.160
conserved.

36:20.160 --> 36:24.160
And there is so much studies ongoing to understand the

36:24.160 --> 36:28.160
biological basis of memories that have shown that in different

36:28.160 --> 36:31.160
species, there are a number of conserved biological

36:31.160 --> 36:33.160
mechanisms.

36:33.160 --> 36:37.160
So certainly they are not declarative memories, but I disagree

36:37.160 --> 36:42.160
to even doubt that nonhuman animals have memories.

36:42.160 --> 36:48.160
And I want to bring to one more point, which I think it was

36:48.160 --> 36:54.160
brought up in terms of memories and the subjectivity, the

36:54.160 --> 37:00.160
individual ways of memorizing and remembering and processing

37:00.160 --> 37:01.160
of memories.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.160
And I think that's a very important thing to do with

37:04.160 --> 37:06.160
that information.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.160
I'm not sure we choose to do that.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.160
I'm not sure it's a choice because a lot of our

37:12.160 --> 37:14.160
representations and memories are implicit.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.160
So we're not conscious of it.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.160
So we don't have choice in that sense is the unconscious part of

37:20.160 --> 37:24.160
brain that guides our decisions.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.160
And those are, of course, based on experiences and

37:28.160 --> 37:32.160
experiences we have over and over or new experiences that we

37:32.160 --> 37:34.160
have at some point.

37:34.160 --> 37:38.160
We react in certain ways, according to our history.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.160
That's why it's very individualized.

37:40.160 --> 37:43.160
So we are starting now in the lab, something that to me is very

37:43.160 --> 37:44.160
exciting.

37:44.160 --> 37:48.160
And that is how the memory system establish itself.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.160
How do they form?

37:49.160 --> 37:53.160
How does it mature?

37:53.160 --> 38:00.160
And so we are looking at the biology of episodic memories in

38:00.160 --> 38:06.160
rats and mice at the age of infancy.

38:06.160 --> 38:10.160
When we know that those memories are formed but rapidly

38:10.160 --> 38:11.160
forgotten.

38:11.160 --> 38:16.160
And this very rapid forgetting is believed to be the reason for

38:16.160 --> 38:18.160
infantile amnesia.

38:18.160 --> 38:26.160
And so the process, I don't know to call it, the

38:26.160 --> 38:32.160
phenomenon by which as adults we do not recall experiences of

38:32.160 --> 38:36.160
the first, let's say, three years of life.

38:36.160 --> 38:40.160
And Freud gave the first explanation of infantile amnesia.

38:40.160 --> 38:47.160
We don't think it now is in agreement with what we see in

38:47.160 --> 38:49.160
agreement with what we see.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.160
But now we are studying the biology of these memories

38:52.160 --> 38:57.160
forming the first few days, corresponding to the first few

38:57.160 --> 39:02.160
years of life in humans, and found that there is in fact

39:02.160 --> 39:06.160
the very conservative evolutionary concern rapid

39:06.160 --> 39:07.160
forgetting.

39:07.160 --> 39:11.160
The animals learn and they forget very rapidly compared to

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
later ages.

39:12.160 --> 39:16.160
And when we look at the biology, we found that the biology is

39:16.160 --> 39:20.160
very interesting and unique, different than the other ages.

39:20.160 --> 39:24.160
They use mechanism of so-called critical periods.

39:24.160 --> 39:29.160
Those are temporal windows in life in which the brain is

39:29.160 --> 39:33.160
particularly responsive to experience.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.160
And with these responses, it matures the functions.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.160
So let's say the visual system that has been studied a lot in

39:40.160 --> 39:42.160
the critical period.

39:42.160 --> 39:46.160
We are born, we don't see the way we see in adult.

39:46.160 --> 39:51.160
And through seeing, through the function of seeing, so all

39:51.160 --> 39:55.160
the stimulus that go in through the eyes and the brain, those

39:55.160 --> 40:01.160
shapes the brain to the point that when it's matured is able

40:01.160 --> 40:03.160
to function like in adult.

40:03.160 --> 40:09.160
So we find the same similar mechanisms in our experiments

40:09.160 --> 40:12.160
of episodic learning and memories.

40:12.160 --> 40:17.160
So what this tells us is that during this temporal window, we

40:17.160 --> 40:23.160
better have the best stimuli and experiences to mature our

40:23.160 --> 40:26.160
abilities to learn and remember.

40:26.160 --> 40:31.160
And we tested and found that it is the type of experience that

40:31.160 --> 40:33.160
matures the function.

40:33.160 --> 40:37.160
In other words, if they are exposed to one type of experience,

40:37.160 --> 40:42.160
they mature the ability to memorize like adults, that type,

40:42.160 --> 40:46.160
that domain of experiences, but not other types that are

40:46.160 --> 40:48.160
processed by the same system.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.160
So, Christina, could I ask, can one will oneself to forget?

40:52.160 --> 40:57.160
Can one will oneself to forget?

40:57.160 --> 40:58.160
Decide to forget?

40:58.160 --> 41:01.160
Can one make oneself forget?

41:01.160 --> 41:06.160
Well, I'm sure if you start saying I'm going to change the

41:06.160 --> 41:11.160
attention to change my attention and not pay attention to

41:11.160 --> 41:18.160
whatever you want to exclude over time, that will lead to more

41:18.160 --> 41:21.160
forgetting than if you don't do that.

41:21.160 --> 41:27.160
But that is one single, you know, it's a small part of the

41:27.160 --> 41:32.160
memories compared to all the memories that you're going to

41:32.160 --> 41:37.160
have.

41:37.160 --> 41:41.160
And our brain is molded according to the experiences we have.

41:41.160 --> 41:46.160
And during these critical periods, what we see is key for the

41:46.160 --> 41:50.160
development of the function.

41:50.160 --> 41:55.160
You know, Richard, I just wanted to say something to Richard for a

41:55.160 --> 41:56.160
moment.

41:56.160 --> 42:01.160
And Avid's metamorphosis, the ability to forget is

42:01.160 --> 42:03.160
really described.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.160
You're meant to drink of the river of Lethi.

42:06.160 --> 42:11.160
And that was a major part of the orific, the whole orific

42:11.160 --> 42:14.160
experience of creative transformation.

42:14.160 --> 42:18.160
And so all of those metamorphoses, all those transformations

42:18.160 --> 42:23.160
depended in Avid on that ability to forget.

42:23.160 --> 42:28.160
So I think that that's been part of our sort of more reflective

42:28.160 --> 42:32.160
experience of memory in the brain.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.160
That's a good pick up.

42:34.160 --> 42:37.160
There's an actual book by David Reif called In Praise of

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
Forgetting.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.160
Yes.

42:39.160 --> 42:43.160
He makes the point that remembering is a barrier to

42:43.160 --> 42:48.160
reconciliation, whether it's between nations, between couples

42:48.160 --> 42:53.160
or whatever, which is why that part of memory is so important.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.160
Yes.

42:54.160 --> 42:59.160
And then you often get that someone cannot forgive and then

42:59.160 --> 43:01.160
they get to an age where they forget.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.160
And then there's reconciliation.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.160
Actually, one of the happiest, you know, one of the keys to

43:07.160 --> 43:12.160
happiness I found in older patients is the ability to forgive,

43:12.160 --> 43:14.160
to truly forgive and forget.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.160
And the one other point I wanted to make for Richard's question

43:17.160 --> 43:23.160
was that forgetting is almost an unconscious, incessant,

43:23.160 --> 43:25.160
constant process.

43:25.160 --> 43:28.160
As we're listening right now, there are so many things that

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
we're forgetting.

43:29.160 --> 43:32.160
I'm forgetting the way the light falls in the room.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.160
I forget the number of, you know, the colors on the screen,

43:35.160 --> 43:36.160
etc.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.160
So it's an incessant, constant process.

43:38.160 --> 43:42.160
Unlearning is a little bit more conscious.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.160
So to decide.

43:44.160 --> 43:51.160
Can I just, can I just join in about, well, I want to say

43:51.160 --> 43:54.160
the idea of forgetting.

43:54.160 --> 43:59.160
I mean, they say that if you cannot forget the pain of child

43:59.160 --> 44:03.160
words, you would probably never have another child again.

44:03.160 --> 44:09.160
And so forgetting is part of the process of living, you know.

44:09.160 --> 44:15.160
And as for forgiving, I think part of the problem of memory

44:15.160 --> 44:20.160
and forgetting or forgiving is that you can't forgive unless you

44:20.160 --> 44:22.160
are not in the first place.

44:22.160 --> 44:27.160
And what happens if your nation is constantly telling you that

44:27.160 --> 44:32.160
whatever you think you remember didn't happen, which happened

44:32.160 --> 44:37.160
to me a lot at NPR, where I was told that, you know, the four

44:37.160 --> 44:42.160
freedoms and injustice didn't, doesn't happen in America

44:42.160 --> 44:45.160
because, you know, we had four freedoms in America.

44:45.160 --> 44:51.160
And I just wrote an opinion piece in my local paper,

44:51.160 --> 44:52.160
the Berkshire Eagle.

44:52.160 --> 44:55.160
You might want to take a look at that, but there were a lot of

44:55.160 --> 44:57.160
people who were excluded from those four freedoms.

44:57.160 --> 45:02.160
And what we continuously say that that doesn't happen in America.

45:02.160 --> 45:07.160
So what happens if the forgetting is imposed on you from the

45:07.160 --> 45:14.160
outside, you know, you haven't chosen to forget forget it or

45:14.160 --> 45:19.160
you know, you're not allowed to, if it's like gas lighting, it

45:19.160 --> 45:20.160
didn't happen.

45:20.160 --> 45:23.160
So you can't forgive because it never happened in the first

45:23.160 --> 45:24.160
place.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.160
So it creates this odd catch 22.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.160
And I've been looking into the Japanese American experience and

45:31.160 --> 45:35.160
it's really, really bizarre.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.160
It's like watching the movie Gaslight, where they keep saying,

45:38.160 --> 45:42.160
you know, this happened and they're being told, no, it didn't.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.160
It doesn't happen here in America.

45:44.160 --> 45:49.160
And, you know, that's happened to Asian people for most of American

45:49.160 --> 45:50.160
history.

45:50.160 --> 45:57.160
It's, they're Native American history is, and the laws written

45:57.160 --> 46:01.160
against them is mimics what they use against Asians.

46:01.160 --> 46:08.160
We're talking a great deal about time, about memory and time,

46:08.160 --> 46:10.160
different temporal periods.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.160
And I'm wondering about memory and space.

46:13.160 --> 46:16.160
Andy, could you say something about that?

46:16.160 --> 46:20.160
And maybe Alexandra, how is it that when you're taking your

46:20.160 --> 46:24.160
dog to the vet as soon as you get two blocks away, the dog

46:24.160 --> 46:28.160
begins to shake because there's something about the space of

46:28.160 --> 46:29.160
the approach.

46:29.160 --> 46:35.160
And in terms of what it's like to be a person of several

46:35.160 --> 46:39.160
cultures, whether ancestrally or in terms of one's own life and

46:39.160 --> 46:44.160
the effect of space where you are, or you forget something, you

46:44.160 --> 46:49.160
have to go back into the room where you first thought of it

46:49.160 --> 46:52.160
before you could pick up the memory of why you, you move to the

46:52.160 --> 46:53.160
other room.

46:53.160 --> 46:56.160
Andy, could you say a few things about this?

46:56.160 --> 46:57.160
Yeah.

46:57.160 --> 47:01.160
So I guess the way that we, we often conceive of memory.

47:01.160 --> 47:04.160
And I'm talking about episodic memory.

47:04.160 --> 47:07.160
So personally experienced memories or a biographical memory.

47:07.160 --> 47:11.160
People often talk about the what, where and when.

47:11.160 --> 47:14.160
So when did something happen, which is the time, which we've

47:14.160 --> 47:18.160
been talking about, the what actually happened.

47:18.160 --> 47:22.160
And of course, the where, and the where often has really become

47:22.160 --> 47:26.160
a prominent piece historically in memory research, a lot of this

47:26.160 --> 47:29.160
driven by, so cells in the hippocampus, which seem to

47:29.160 --> 47:33.160
indicate the spatial location of an animal in an environment.

47:33.160 --> 47:36.160
And so a lot of research has really been driven by the what,

47:36.160 --> 47:39.160
the where, which is the spatial piece.

47:39.160 --> 47:42.160
And just in terms of what you were talking about, that really

47:42.160 --> 47:46.160
speaks to the fact that we, we learn association.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.160
So a lot of our memories are association between different pieces

47:49.160 --> 47:50.160
of information.

47:50.160 --> 47:54.160
And because space is so pervasive, so we know even where we're

47:54.160 --> 47:57.160
sitting now, as we walk around, we're in a space in a particular

47:57.160 --> 48:00.160
location, often our memories get anchored that way.

48:00.160 --> 48:04.160
So there, we have certain associations, certain locations.

48:04.160 --> 48:07.160
And so therefore, when we either retrieve those memories or we go

48:07.160 --> 48:10.160
into certain locations, those may trigger those associations to

48:10.160 --> 48:11.160
come back.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.160
So in the case of the dog example you were keeping, I mean,

48:13.160 --> 48:16.160
I was actually able to speak more to that than I would, but just

48:16.160 --> 48:19.160
being in a certain location could trigger certain memories

48:19.160 --> 48:22.160
associated with, with approaching a particular target spatial

48:22.160 --> 48:23.160
location.

48:23.160 --> 48:27.160
So, so that's probably what's, what's going on, on there.

48:27.160 --> 48:30.160
And so the way a lot of continuous scientists think about memory

48:30.160 --> 48:33.160
is that we almost like have a memory map in our brains where

48:33.160 --> 48:36.160
it's a combination of this spatial information with this temporal

48:36.160 --> 48:39.160
information, which gets bound together as almost like the

48:39.160 --> 48:42.160
scaffolding of our memories, and lots of other pieces of

48:42.160 --> 48:44.160
information that can attach to it.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.160
So like emotions, whether something's rewarding or not rewarding,

48:47.160 --> 48:51.160
for example, so they all get put together into this big memory

48:51.160 --> 48:52.160
map.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.160
But space is a key component of this map.

48:54.160 --> 49:01.160
And certainly in terms of experiences that are traumatic, I think,

49:01.160 --> 49:06.160
space and perception, of course, has a huge effect in that way.

49:06.160 --> 49:12.160
And Alexandra, could you help us out with what is it in dog

49:12.160 --> 49:16.160
memory that seems to be spatially related?

49:16.160 --> 49:19.160
Well, I mean, Andy has said it best.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.160
And he's the neuroscientist here.

49:21.160 --> 49:25.160
And of course, what I liked about what he said was this emphasis

49:25.160 --> 49:27.160
on learning through association.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.160
So memory is being triggered by an association, which is

49:30.160 --> 49:35.160
a way that we think of sometimes non-human animals learning more

49:35.160 --> 49:36.160
than ourselves.

49:36.160 --> 49:41.160
But that is, of course, analogous or identical in non-humans and

49:41.160 --> 49:44.160
in humans that we learn through associations.

49:44.160 --> 49:48.160
And so it is not at all surprising that dogs can remember

49:48.160 --> 49:53.160
arriving at a vet or a person who they've met once or being in

49:53.160 --> 49:59.160
a place that they've been before and had about experience that

49:59.160 --> 50:01.160
shouldn't surprise us at all.

50:01.160 --> 50:04.160
And I think what I'm interested in in your question, Beverly,

50:04.160 --> 50:07.160
is sort of why would we be surprised by that?

50:07.160 --> 50:11.160
And I think it's because we don't think in some level we're not

50:11.160 --> 50:16.160
thinking about companion animals or non-human animals as having

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
kind of personal stories, right,

50:18.160 --> 50:23.160
autobiographical memories that they ruminate on, that they sit

50:23.160 --> 50:26.160
back and reflect on.

50:26.160 --> 50:30.160
And that's only because, well, we're not sure if they do have a

50:30.160 --> 50:34.160
kind of sense of self over time, right, and they don't have a

50:34.160 --> 50:36.160
verbal way to express that.

50:36.160 --> 50:41.160
But also because we are familiar with each other's

50:41.160 --> 50:45.160
autobiographical selves through analogy and through our telling

50:45.160 --> 50:48.160
each other about our history and our experiences.

50:48.160 --> 50:52.160
So we just have to look at dog behavior and realize that their

50:52.160 --> 50:54.160
behavior is showing us their memory.

50:54.160 --> 50:57.160
But we often are not as accustomed to that, to seeing

50:57.160 --> 51:02.160
other's memories of visible just in their behavior.

51:02.160 --> 51:07.160
We're used to seeing their memories visible in how they respond

51:07.160 --> 51:10.160
and how they articulate their experiences.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.160
We started off and made a very important distinction between

51:13.160 --> 51:16.160
explicit memories and implicit memories.

51:16.160 --> 51:20.160
But you'll notice that as we go along in the conversation,

51:20.160 --> 51:24.160
we tended to default to when we mostly talk about memory,

51:24.160 --> 51:26.160
we default to sort of explicit memories.

51:26.160 --> 51:30.160
And I wonder when we talked about creative memory and destructive

51:30.160 --> 51:34.160
memory, we'll call it, where we mostly were referring to

51:34.160 --> 51:35.160
explicit memories.

51:35.160 --> 51:39.160
And is that same creativity found in implicit memories on the one

51:39.160 --> 51:43.160
hand and, right, do dogs, for example, have some degree of

51:43.160 --> 51:44.160
explicit memory.

51:44.160 --> 51:46.160
That's sort of what Alexandra's commenting on just now.

51:46.160 --> 51:50.160
I just wondered if we could talk about that creative aspect

51:50.160 --> 51:52.160
of implicit versus explicit.

51:52.160 --> 51:58.160
Well, Socrates, when people started to write things down,

51:58.160 --> 52:03.160
was disgusted because he said, if you memorize things, take

52:03.160 --> 52:07.160
things into yourself as a memory, you experience them more

52:07.160 --> 52:12.160
deeply than when you see it on a tablet or whatever.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.160
And I'm wondering what other panelists feel about that,

52:15.160 --> 52:20.160
whether in our day-to-day rush of taking in information and not

52:20.160 --> 52:24.160
particularly memorizing it, we're losing in the depth of our

52:24.160 --> 52:26.160
response to it.

52:26.160 --> 52:30.160
Richard, so one of the things that we need to think about is how

52:30.160 --> 52:37.160
intricately, in the way the brain has developed, memory is tied to

52:37.160 --> 52:38.160
emotion.

52:38.160 --> 52:43.160
So the amygdala, jolidu, at NYU has done a lot of work on this in

52:43.160 --> 52:47.160
terms of how the amygdala is tied to memory, and it allows

52:47.160 --> 52:51.160
organisms, including dogs.

52:51.160 --> 52:57.160
I wouldn't call them lesser animals, greater animals, to evolve

52:57.160 --> 52:59.160
and survive and adapt.

52:59.160 --> 53:04.160
So in terms of the feeling of something taking it in with

53:04.160 --> 53:08.160
Socrates, it would have to do with the emotion, how much you

53:08.160 --> 53:13.160
imbue this memory with some kind of emotion, how relevant it is to

53:13.160 --> 53:18.160
you, as opposed to facts, memories for facts, which are

53:18.160 --> 53:21.160
sometimes devoid of any kind of emotion, unless it means you have

53:21.160 --> 53:23.160
to study to take an exam.

53:23.160 --> 53:27.160
So that is important, I think, in terms of the distinction between

53:27.160 --> 53:34.160
how well we remember things and how much emotion plays a role in

53:34.160 --> 53:35.160
remembering.

53:35.160 --> 53:41.160
So, Alexandra, I have a question, do you think that dogs have more

53:41.160 --> 53:45.160
of an emotional memory than people do?

53:45.160 --> 53:49.160
Sort of because of their absence of articulating themselves

53:49.160 --> 53:53.160
telling the story to themselves, we assume.

53:53.160 --> 53:56.160
I have to be agnostic about that, I think.

53:56.160 --> 54:00.160
I think that what I would imagine is more of the dog's experience

54:00.160 --> 54:05.160
is a kind of fuller-fleshed perceptual memory.

54:05.160 --> 54:09.160
In other words, in modalities that maybe don't always occur to

54:09.160 --> 54:13.160
us as part of memory formation, so for instance,

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
old-faction, right?

54:14.160 --> 54:18.160
Or, of course, old-faction is a big driver of learned

54:18.160 --> 54:22.160
associations, and we all can talk about that

54:22.160 --> 54:31.160
that, a moment from childhood, an early memory that is invoked

54:31.160 --> 54:35.160
by a scent that you encounter again, but that's actually fairly

54:35.160 --> 54:40.160
rare, we're not daily creating all-factory memory,

54:40.160 --> 54:43.160
all-factory-ly primed memories.

54:43.160 --> 54:48.160
But, of course, if one is an animal who is more living in that

54:48.160 --> 54:50.160
modality, I think that they are.

54:50.160 --> 54:54.160
And so, insofar as old-faction is actually closely tied to

54:54.160 --> 54:56.160
emotions, perhaps so.

54:56.160 --> 55:01.160
But, I don't think there would be any reason that they'd be more

55:01.160 --> 55:03.160
emotional per se, right?

55:03.160 --> 55:07.160
Versus analytic, if that's the contrast you're drawing.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.160
It depends who their owners are.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.160
Can I?

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
Can I?

55:12.160 --> 55:19.160
I would like to ask something that was triggered by what

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
Gayatri said about emotion.

55:21.160 --> 55:26.160
She, at first, said that you, in terms of your first romance,

55:26.160 --> 55:31.160
that you forget that in order to be able to have other romances.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.160
Now, what is it you forget?

55:33.160 --> 55:36.160
You still may remember the name of the person.

55:36.160 --> 55:39.160
You may recognize the person in the street.

55:39.160 --> 55:42.160
You may remember something that you're going to be able to

55:42.160 --> 55:49.160
have.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.160
You may remember the name of the person.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.160
You may recognize the person in the street.

55:54.160 --> 55:57.160
You may remember some of the places you went out together to.

55:57.160 --> 56:02.160
What you don't have is the emotions that you had at the time.

56:02.160 --> 56:06.160
So, what's, and you mentioned emotional memory.

56:06.160 --> 56:11.160
So, how do we understand emotional memory versus what is more

56:11.160 --> 56:13.160
emotional memory?

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
I'm not sure.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.160
But the other thing I wanted to ask, and this has been on my

56:17.160 --> 56:21.160
mind for a few years, and I haven't found sufficient.

56:21.160 --> 56:25.160
I haven't been able to understand it for myself sufficiently,

56:25.160 --> 56:28.160
is what Christina mentioned about experience.

56:28.160 --> 56:35.160
So, that experience with the first love of your life can continue

56:35.160 --> 56:39.160
to have an impact on you for a period of time.

56:39.160 --> 56:42.160
Or do you consider that something else?

56:42.160 --> 56:46.160
Those are the two thoughts I wanted to see if there could be some

56:46.160 --> 56:49.160
clarification for me on.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.160
And I don't know if I can offer clarification, but I can

56:52.160 --> 56:56.160
certainly comment a little bit on it.

56:56.160 --> 57:01.160
I think we're ultimately all mammals, dogs, humans, and we

57:01.160 --> 57:06.160
really have this large overlay of our new cortex, which tries to

57:06.160 --> 57:09.160
bring rationality to our decisions.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.160
Daniel Kahneman has written about this in thinking fast and

57:12.160 --> 57:16.160
thinking slow, that we try to rationalize our very basic

57:16.160 --> 57:21.160
instinctual behavior by giving it a narrative that fits in with

57:21.160 --> 57:23.160
our thinking at the moment.

57:23.160 --> 57:26.160
But it's really ultimately quite emotional.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.160
The science of economics is emotional, even though we think

57:29.160 --> 57:32.160
of economics as a very dry subject.

57:32.160 --> 57:39.160
So, to answer your question or to try to talk about it a little

57:39.160 --> 57:44.160
bit, when you're talking about emotions and how they affect

57:44.160 --> 57:50.160
memory, it appeals more to the core brain, more to the primitive

57:50.160 --> 57:56.160
brain, and it's harder to erase, which is why PTSD is such an

57:56.160 --> 58:00.160
issue, because it's the strong connection with emotion.

58:00.160 --> 58:03.160
And that's why repression, Freud's famous stories of repression

58:03.160 --> 58:06.160
are also an issue, because it's a negative suppression, if you

58:06.160 --> 58:08.160
will, of memory.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.160
So that's my thinking.

58:09.160 --> 58:13.160
I don't know what else.

58:13.160 --> 58:15.160
You wanted to say something?

58:15.160 --> 58:17.160
Yes, me?

58:17.160 --> 58:18.160
Yes.

58:18.160 --> 58:20.160
No, I would go ahead.

58:20.160 --> 58:22.160
Let's go.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.160
You were trying to say something before?

58:24.160 --> 58:27.160
Oh, no, I will.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
That's okay.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.160
Sorry.

58:30.160 --> 58:31.160
Go ahead, Christina.

58:31.160 --> 58:40.160
Yeah, to add to what was just said, if there is no emotion or

58:40.160 --> 58:48.160
valence, emotional valence, there is no long-term memory.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.160
Motivation is based on emotion.

58:50.160 --> 58:53.160
So if there is no motivation, there's not going to be any

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
long-term memory.

58:54.160 --> 58:58.160
There has been also a lot of experiments done looking at the

58:58.160 --> 59:03.160
level of stress and memory strength.

59:03.160 --> 59:08.160
And what they have found is that a little bit of stress or

59:08.160 --> 59:11.160
emotion, negative emotion, in some cases, when they've been

59:11.160 --> 59:17.160
measured as aversive memories or positive in other experiments,

59:17.160 --> 59:20.160
is essential to have long-term memories.

59:20.160 --> 59:26.160
And increasing the level of stress or emotion to a certain

59:26.160 --> 59:30.160
point is beneficial to have more memories, more detailed

59:30.160 --> 59:33.160
memories, more long-lasting memories.

59:33.160 --> 59:37.160
And after a certain level of stress, then there is a decrease

59:37.160 --> 59:45.160
of memory strength and storage, or at least they are not expressed

59:45.160 --> 59:46.160
anymore.

59:46.160 --> 59:50.160
So it's like an inverted U effect.

59:50.160 --> 59:54.160
A little bit of stress and emotion is necessary to store

59:54.160 --> 59:56.160
long-term memories.

59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.160
Too much is bad because then we distort the memories.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:07.160
And the storage is only on certain representations or cues or

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.160
whatever is that the experience was.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:18.160
And it can be also sort of inhibited, probably for a

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160
defensive mechanism.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.160
And so, let's say a very strong trauma.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.160
If we ask what happened after that traumatic experience, often

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.160
they say, I don't remember.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.160
No, but I was trying to comment on the very simple thing, which is

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.160
there is a guy at this example.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:47.160
You have, so you have your first romance.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.160
You have a lot of emotions.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.160
How do you, how come you don't have the emotions?

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160
Whatever intense, loving feelings you have, you don't have

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:00.160
anymore.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.160
In fact, if you continue to have them, you couldn't move on.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.160
Well, and I think that's a whole other.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:16.160
I think that's a whole other.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.160
I think it's a whole different thing.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:22.160
But for the sake of the discussion, let's say there is no

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.160
emotional memory.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:25.160
Then the question is, do you think that's memory?

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.160
Yes, absolutely.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:34.160
Everything that memory by definition is whatever is stored

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
and maintained over time.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.160
And therefore, maintaining of that information will influence our

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.160
behavior in the present moment.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
Can I?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
Yes.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.160
I remembered what I was thinking about emotion.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.160
And I think it's that it's not that you forget that the

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160
emotional feeling.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.160
You probably just transferred on to someone else.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.160
Because I know, I remember how I felt in my first love.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.160
And I know that maybe I don't feel that way about this other

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.160
person because there's a lot of other memories that are piled on

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.160
top of that original love that no longer makes me feel that way.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.160
But I remember that feeling.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.160
And when I need somebody else and that feeling is there, it's not

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160
that you lost it.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.160
It's just that you're now associating it with somebody else.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.160
And oh, Andy, can I just bring out one more thing?

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:33.160
The other thing about emotion is what if you're the emotion that's

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:39.160
not associated with you is fear and hatred and which is what I

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.160
often experienced growing up.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.160
When I was eight years old, I was walking home from school and

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:51.160
somebody wrote in chalk sets goes a jap, jap go home.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:59.160
This was in, you know, the early 70s and no, it's 60s, late 60s.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.160
And it turns out it was my neighbors who was two girls that

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160
lived in my neighborhood.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.160
And I'm not sure why they wrote that other than that maybe they

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.160
learned it from their parents.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:20.160
But, you know, I've even growing up and, you know, going to

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160
journalism school.

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:26.160
I didn't learn any a lot of this history, anti Asianism that was

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.160
legal or most of the history that I learned about Asians was

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:35.160
negative and fear based.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.160
And I still get it today.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.160
I've been to dinner parties in the Berkshires where people said,

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.160
oh, the Japanese, you had to be put away, you know, Pearl Harbor

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.160
or the Japanese had, you had to be nuked, you know.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.160
So to me, that's really scary.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.160
And I guess to them, it's perfectly fine because I'm

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:02.160
associated with people and a memory that triggers fear.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.160
So what do you do when that is constantly applied to you?

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.160
Even though I was, I wasn't born then.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.160
I promise I'm not scary.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:18.160
And do you want to, you wanted to respond there?

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:23.160
I just wanted to add something really quickly in response to

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.160
basically Ed's question earlier about, you know, moving along

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.160
from a past romance.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.160
And I think one potential factor which may help us do that as

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.160
well is that often our memories transform over time.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.160
So when we think about our episodic memories, the way, like

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.160
conctor scientists think about that is that you have a re-experiencing

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.160
of the event.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.160
And then we come back, people talk about jumping back in time,

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.160
we put ourselves back, we experience that relationship

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.160
perhaps, and all those memories flood black.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.160
But what often happens to those types of memories as well as

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.160
that over time, they begin to transform in the sense that they

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.160
may become more cement-sized.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.160
So they become more knowledge, not entirely knowledge, but they

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.160
lean more towards that and as opposed to the more personal

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.160
experience end.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.160
And I guess the extreme of that would be if you see a

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.160
photograph of your childhood and someone asks you about it,

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.160
sometimes you can actually remember experiencing it.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.160
But sometimes you just remember, oh, yeah, that was my birthday

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.160
party.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.160
I was five and I got a great present.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160
But it's unclear whether you actually experienced that

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.160
yourself or is that someone telling you that that's what

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
happened and that became your memory.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.160
And so there's that distinction between like a factual memory

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.160
versus a personal experience memory.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.160
And perhaps maybe that's what happens with, you know, some of

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.160
the relationships way past is that over time they transform a

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.160
little bit, we detach from them slightly.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.160
Personally, those emotions, depending on how the relationship

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.160
ended, maybe it was an amicable relationship or whether it

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160
wasn't that may influence things.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:55.160
But maybe one factor is that those memories become a little bit

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:59.160
more slightly more cement-sized and those emotions that were

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.160
attached with it, we don't re-experience them again.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.160
And so that then allows us to, you know, put that relationship

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.160
in the past and move on to a new one.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.160
I'm sure that's true, one remembers some memory.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.160
It's like remembering the photocopy rather than the real

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.160
thing.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.160
I was wondering how much we could say that that fact that you

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.160
just described where memories are sort of fungible, that that's

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.160
a feature of explicit memory as opposed to implicit memory.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.160
I'm trying to tease that out.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.160
We might open this up now to questions from the audience.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.160
They probably have some of the same questions that we do.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.160
Jerry, is this the moment to include the audience?

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.160
I think that sounds like a good idea.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.160
Let's see, I think that here we are.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.160
I think Alex, but it's a whole more.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160
Yeah, yeah, I have the questions collect this.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.160
I want to thank everyone who is viewing through Zoom and on

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160
YouTube.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.160
Thank you for the comments and questions.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.160
I've recorded them as we've gone through the Zoom.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.160
If you wrote more than one, I'm going to state your first one

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.160
and then go through everyone else's and hopefully if we have

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160
time, get to the others again.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.160
There will be some editing on my part just for time's sake.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.160
Please forgive me there.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.160
Also, if I mangle any pronunciations of names in advance,

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160
I apologize.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.160
Okay, so the first one was from S.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.160
Mason Dambrought.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.160
And they asked, are you familiar with research showing

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.160
applying metformin to a type one type edict that delays the

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.160
oncoming of Alzheimer's?

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.160
If so, please comment on this process.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.160
So I'll just briefly mention that there's a lot of research

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:51.160
now on insulin resistance and various risk factors for

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.160
developing dementia and metformin and drugs like that are

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.160
helpful in this area.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.160
So there's still a lot of research to be done here.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.160
Okay, then just a comment to bring some levity to the

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.160
conversation.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.160
Vicki Madden had wrote early on practically everyone I know

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.160
has gone a pandemic puppy.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.160
So that's not a question, but I think it's a nice, a nice

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.160
comment to add.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.160
She asked the question, but unfortunately she's little

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.160
later on.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.160
Hopefully you get to her question.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.160
But the next one was from Manon Slome.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.160
Is selective memory not in a pejorative sense, a defense

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.160
mechanism?

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.160
I would say the analysts and our audience are best to take

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160
this.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.160
No.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.160
Well, I think in a way we've already addressed that in

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.160
order to keep going, we tend to take in what we think we can

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.160
handle in the moment.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.160
I think we can handle that.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.160
I think we can handle that.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:52.160
And one of the very compelling aspects in this pandemic

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:57.160
period is how many suppressed memories have come forth now.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.160
I think there's something about the isolation.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:05.160
There's something about the amount of empathy we feel for

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.160
others that is somehow it's enough of a high level of

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:18.160
a hot house experience that what we didn't think about before

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:23.160
because we had to keep going is now emerging and coming up.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:27.160
I don't know if others are having that experience as well.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.160
And yes, I was saying to Alexander earlier that I've

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.160
never seen a period of time where so many people became so

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:42.160
dependent on the unconditional affection of their pets in

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.160
part because it's so difficult for people to be together in such

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.160
an intense way that it's almost as if the dogs become some

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.160
kind of mediator in this situation.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.160
Oh, yeah, I think that's exactly right.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.160
There are a symbol of the people who are in the situation.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:06.160
And I think that's exactly right.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.160
There are a symbol of a time before and the ease of dealing

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:14.160
with others and they become the others, the social presence,

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.160
who are near and we can touch.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.160
I think it's also interesting to remember that they are also

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.160
dogs who are experiencing this time for themselves.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.160
But new puppies are not experiencing a pandemic.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.160
They don't know it's an unusual time.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.160
They don't know it's an unusual time for them.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.160
And I think that will be an interesting dissonance.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.160
Unfortunately, if we kind of unquarantine and we assume that

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:44.160
they are adjusted and ready to live life by themselves, for

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160
instance.

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.160
But the question about selective memory goes back to the fact

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.160
that one's brain, the memory part of one's brain is

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.160
forming and reorganizing and goes back to what one of us was

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.160
saying earlier about the experience of childbirth.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.160
I don't think for what I can put together the women forget

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:12.160
childbirth, but they relegate it for the health of their life in

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.160
the present and the future.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.160
So it's not a forgotten memory, but in as much one's brain or

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.160
one's memory part of one's brain seems like a complex computer

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.160
that is refiling certain experiences so that they're not

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.160
immediately upon us.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.160
I do believe, Richard, that we do actually forget severe pain,

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.160
the physical pain of childbirth.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.160
It's hard to recreate, speaking as someone, it's really, really

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.160
hard to recreate the intensity of the pain immediately afterwards.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.160
It can happen, but it's rare from a neurologic perspective.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.160
I would assume that pain essentially stops when it stops.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.160
Yeah.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.160
Yeah.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.160
Yeah.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.160
Yeah, but to add to what Richard was saying, the forgetting that

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:12.160
happens in the first few years of life, this leads to infant

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.160
and amnesia, that is actually an apparent forgetting.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160
You're right.

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.160
We have tested these memories that are apparently gone.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.160
You'll give reminders later on in life to these animals,

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.160
the memories come back.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.160
I remember we had a patient who spoke German for, grew up in

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.160
Germany, came to the United States when he was 14 or 13,

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.160
learned English, really forgot all of us German, or maybe he was

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.160
even younger, maybe he was seven or eight, and then he had a stroke

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:54.160
and the only thing he could speak in was in German.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.160
It was very hard for his family who didn't understand any German,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.160
so to your point, but we really never forget anything.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:05.160
It's just our ability to retrieve things, including emotion,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.160
is much harder over time.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.160
What Jerry had asked earlier about the difference between

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.160
explicit and implicit memory and its attachment to emotion,

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.160
I think of implicit procedural memory as something that's a

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.160
cable, as opposed to explicit memory, which for the most part,

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:30.160
memory for events and facts, is much more like a cobweb.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:36.160
And cables are often laid down better if they are wrapped in

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160
an installation of emotion.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.160
That's a great one.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:46.160
I just want to add to the idea of suppressed memory.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.160
I'm not a memory expert, obviously, but in looking at the history

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:56.160
that I've been examining for the last 10 years, a lot of the

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Japanese Americans who were incarcerated by their own

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.160
government, just for being Japanese, did suppress that.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.160
They had, they suppressed it on purpose and they didn't teach it

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.160
to their children just so that they could survive and move on

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.160
with their lives.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.160
It was essential.

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.160
It was a survival mechanism.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.160
Is there something that actually brought up that I,

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.160
this is a language issue that I've always been interested in as a

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.160
cognitive scientist, which is the sort of two sides of thinking

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.160
about selective attention and forgetting.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.160
So you earlier said, we're forgetting, and I agree with this,

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.160
we're forgetting a lot of what's happening right now.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.160
So we're all experiencing in theory something of the same.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.160
We're in the same moment.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.160
We can see each other.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.160
There's some overlap in our experience, but we're sort of

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.160
not attending to some.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.160
Do you think it's the same?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.160
It's appropriate to say that what's happened is we're forgetting

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.160
that already because in fact it's not encoded, really.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.160
It's not been explicitly encoded, which it hasn't been rehearsed by

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160
us.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160
So it's sort of almost that it's just never experienced in a way.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.160
It's as though it's never experienced at all.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:17.160
And that's the type of thing that can't be brought back right later.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.160
But I do feel like there's sort of slippiness of language around

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.160
selective attention and selective forgetting that question brought

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:29.160
it up and just attention and how memories encoded to begin with.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Well, also I feel like our experience of the pandemic is

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:37.160
probably different than, you know, essential workers who has to

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.160
get up every day and, you know, go to a hospital or something like

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160
that.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.160
I mean, I feel lucky that I just get to stay in my work's your home.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:50.160
And it's, I don't have those memories that an essential

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.160
worker has because I never experienced it.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.160
I think Alex, we should go to the questions.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160
Yeah.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.160
Yeah.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
So next one was from Esther Dyson.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160
I guess this is more of a comment, but I could turn it into a

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.160
question.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.160
I think it would be interesting given Richard's mention in

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.160
passing about computers.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.160
They said as they listened to the intros, they thought like the

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.160
quote unquote editing sounds was more like attaching things to a

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.160
framework and the recognition of objects as an AI.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.160
So I guess a question would be like, how do you think the

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.160
formation of how humans form memories relates to how an AI

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.160
works or I guess like a deep learning network?

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.160
I'd say the primary difference would be that there's no emotion

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.160
involved with an AI.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.160
So that and that's a huge difference.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.160
And, you know, obviously the richness of the parallel

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.160
distributed networks that both humans and more advanced AI

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:52.160
system share are obviously AI systems are evolving and they're

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.160
learning fuzzy logic, they're learning to learn.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.160
But emotion is the big difference between the two systems.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160
I don't know, Andy, Chris, the rest of you.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.160
Andy, what do you think?

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.160
I agree.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.160
And I would say, I mean, just speaking practically, I would say

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:16.160
that the way that as humans, the way we do it, it far exceeds

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.160
anything that a deep neural network could do.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:22.160
I mean, there are studies out there on babies and how they do

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.160
statistical learning, how just repeating stuff and they pick

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.160
up patterns that enables babies to learn language, for example,

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.160
far exceeds anything that you could throw like an ability of a

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.160
deep neural network to recognize objects.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.160
So I think some of the principles are shared, but in the human

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.160
brain, it's expanded and more complex in a way that we're only

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.160
beginning to scrape the surface off of how some of that learning

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:48.160
occurs.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.160
Okay, so the next question, sorry if I didn't mention the last

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.160
one was from Esther Dyson.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.160
This is from Amy Olson.

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:59.160
Could you please speak to the phenomenon of phantom limbs and

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.160
how the mind remembers the body part?

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:06.160
That is no longer present, but it's perceived as if it were.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.160
So phantom limbs, is that the question?

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
Yeah, sorry, phantom limbs.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.160
So, you know, as I mentioned before, our realities are our brains,

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.160
right?

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.160
So our brain things that we have pain, we have pain.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.160
So if the brain things we have a limb, we do have that limb.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.160
So there's a part, so there have been numerous studies which I

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.160
want go into, but basically a testing to this that, and the

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.160
brain is unable to differentiate, for example, between social

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.160
rejection versus actual pain, because the same area of the

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.160
single cortex lights up.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:44.160
The brain doesn't assign a difference, which I think is

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:49.160
very interesting in terms of pain, in terms of the emotional

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.160
circuitry involved between physical pain and emotional pain.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.160
They both coalesce in certain parts of the brain.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:02.160
So phantom limb just means that that part of your brain still

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.160
thinks you have a limb attached, and that's why chronic pain is

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:12.160
such an interesting condition to treat, because even when the

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:17.160
nascent event is no longer, you know, it's gone, the brain can

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:23.160
elaborate on the pain and make it as large or as windowed down as

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:28.160
it chooses to, and it's not a conscious process.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.160
Can you make it conscious?

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.160
That's an interesting question.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.160
You know, all kinds of, you can remember many things by

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.160
rehearsing, you know, the idea of changing and explicit

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:46.160
declarative memory, like how do you learn to play the violin to

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.160
an implicit cable type memory involved rehearsal?

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.160
So yeah, I would imagine you can.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.160
I mean, you can, one of the things that I work on is in terms

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:03.160
of changing the brain's perception of chronic pain, and one of the

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.160
ways we do that is by using brain stimulation to turn down the

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.160
area of the brain that perceives the pain without actually doing

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:16.160
anything about the actual event that's causing the pain,

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.160
whether it's a neuropathy or an amputated limb.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160
Yeah.

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:27.160
So it's, everything happens in our brain, whether it's real or not,

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.160
which sounds kind of silly to have to say, but it's hard for us

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.160
to truly grasp, I think, sometimes.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.160
Christina, do you have thoughts?

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.160
You'd like to add to this?

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.160
No?

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:41.160
Okay.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.160
No, I think she did a fantastic job.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160
Okay.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160
Okay.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160
Okay.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160
Okay.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160
Yeah.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.160
So Dave asked, how can one forget or change your negative memory?

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:55.160
I think do you want to answer that?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.160
I think it's been sort of fleshed out through the conversation.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.160
So just to note that I got your question, Dave, there.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160
Satya in Prathabhan.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.160
Sorry if I mispronounced that.

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.160
Apart from cues of survival or for survival, excuse me.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:13.160
Is there a reason we were in bread with memory?

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.160
What are we here to remember being on Earth for?

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.160
I'm not sure I understood the question.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.160
What's the reason to have memories?

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.160
Yeah.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.160
What's the biological necessity for memory?

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:33.160
The biological reason is to survive.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:39.160
But in addition, they want to know in addition to survival.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.160
So besides survival, is there any other reason?

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.160
Well, consciousness.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:50.160
I mean, Gerald Edmund called consciousness the remembered present,

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.160
suggesting that we're experiencing, reflecting and remembering all at once.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.160
And that's what consciousness is.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:06.160
You know, if you ask the question, what's it for?

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:11.160
It looks to me like the only sort of obvious answer would be for survival.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.160
It may do other things other than promote survival.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.160
And I think that's what makes it a lot of fun.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.160
Obviously, we don't remember.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.160
We're not fun.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:26.160
We're not fun.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.160
But I mean, isn't memory like, you know, does a rock have a memory?

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.160
So maybe, you know, because we're animals.

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.160
Well, a rock doesn't have to cross the road.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.160
Exactly.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:48.160
Of course, the one thing that remains all the arguments about where consciousness comes from,

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:56.160
and he'd you have thoughts you'd like to insert here?

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.160
Not in particular.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.160
I would say that the survival is the main piece.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.160
Yeah.

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:04.160
Okay.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.160
So next one is from Vicki Madden.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.160
They were curious about dream remembrance.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:17.160
So they said, is the reason why they potentially forget memories or the way that they retain memories is that they have to tell to themselves.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.160
And put it in language right away.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.160
And if they don't, they'll forget it.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.160
So like, how does one go about remembering a dream?

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:37.160
This is the idea that somehow speaking of it or talking verbalizing a memory does something go some way towards.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:47.160
instantiating it or creating.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:58.160
I once did a dream sleepover seminar at the Ruben Museum of Art, where we were right there with people waking up, just as they were waking up, which is very different than seeing patients in your office.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:11.160
And they would report the dream while they were waking up, and then the next morning, we would have a group and everyone would discuss or say report their dream.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.160
The content in every case was exactly the same.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:19.160
What changed was the linear time sequence.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:26.160
So that when the person was waking up, they said this happened, but before that this happened before that this happened.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:32.160
And then when they told the dream in the morning, it was like a linear narrative.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
That that was very interesting.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:48.160
So I think, you know, some of what seems so ridiculous in dream memory is actually because we're changing the time, we're looking at it from the waking time sequence.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:57.160
So I think if you accept that where there's an anomaly, then there's more of a tendency to be open to your dreams and to record them.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.160
Remember them. Yeah.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:05.160
If I could just share a story. My husband loves trains. He's a trained fanatic.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:27.160
And you made us watch this documentary about the bullet train in Japan. And supposedly since it's invention and inception, it has had, I think, only one death on accident, which is pretty remarkable considering Japan has the most earthquakes of any nation in the world.

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:39.160
And they said that one of the things that they do, and I've seen this on on local trains in Japan, where the conductor points at something, and then he says something.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:53.160
And then it's like point and there's something to with verbalizing and pointing that they do. And we kept looking like, who is he talking to because he didn't have earphones, he didn't have anything.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:08.160
And it turns out that it's a memory aid. And now they use it at hospitals with prescriptions. They make you look at the name, you say it out loud, and then you point again.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:26.160
And it improved the accuracy by, I don't know how many fold. So, reading it, looking at it, and then verbalizing it actually does something to the memory process. Yeah.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:42.160
So I wanted to just say something really interesting and I never know this, and I don't know if you ever experienced this, but I had a graduate student who is now in medical school, and he grew up in Japan, and he came to the United States when he was in his 20s.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:27:04.160
And he had trouble, he had to unlearn the difference between L and R. He actually had a lot of trouble pronouncing. Well, there is no, well, in Japan, it was just, I thought it was so interesting that no, in Japan, there is no R or an L.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:19.160
There's only in between, there's a radirud et al. It's not an L, and it's not an R. And what he had is he had trouble hearing the difference. Yes, I couldn't hear the R or the L. So, sometimes he had to put it in the context.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.160
So, right, right, because it's not something you routinely think about.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:27.160
No, but also, I can run to the next question.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:47.160
Sorry. So, Elizabeth Manis asked, is there a distinct, well, I think this actually is a good picky back off what guy she was talking about. Is there a distinction between forgetting and unlearning.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:59.160
Richard, you have a sense of that as a historian. Again, going back to wilfulness or rather the exercise of one's will.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:16.160
There was a British officer in the early to mid 19th century, who was going through a section of Europe, and he was saying to them, well, can you say to one man, can you remember Napoleon?

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:32.160
And the man said, yes, he was well over six foot tall with long blonde hair. Anyway, what he wanted to remember was a conquering general looking like a Viking God.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:47.160
So, he unconsciously created this image, which had nothing to do with with fact, except the fact of what he thought a conquering officer should look like.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:55.160
So, to that extent, one can unconsciously will a memory.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:29:09.160
Interesting. Yeah. And all of a sacks talks about reciting to members of the family various events in their shared past.

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.160
And the family's saying, but you weren't there.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.160
And it's the same process. It would like to be.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:30.160
We also say that forgetting is a larger category and unlearning to the degree it's a separate thing it's a subset of all forgetting.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.160
Does that sound reasonable.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160
Yeah.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160
Sounds good.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:44.160
Unlearning means that we have learned something and then we are not forgetting is part of many processes.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:55.160
One of the things you'll remember the famous line in death of a salesman when the wife says attention must be paid.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:30:03.160
One of the aspects of learning and unlearning is paying attention.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:13.160
We've all seen on Andy's wall above the television set in the bookcases, a number of telephones.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:19.160
But did we pay attention to the fact that he has four telephones out of reach in his living room.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:27.160
No, but I saw the gorilla walk by. I don't know if the rest of you saw that gorilla.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:33.160
All right. So maybe it's the gorilla in the room, not the elephant in the room.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.160
Well, I think we've come to the end of our time.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:40.160
Well, can we get one or two more questions or you.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:48.160
I would like to. Yeah, I think I could pick sort of two topologies to others, but I think there's sort of two that could be interesting.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:57.160
So one was from Robert Messiati. You wrote a long thing, but I think I understand what he's saying is probably best answered by Christina.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:02.160
He was sort of curious about the physiological process of explicit memory recall.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.160
And he was what he's referring to. I'm pretty sure is like structural changes with protein.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:12.160
So I think was, I think what he's alluding to is with LTP, a long term potentiation causing protein full changes.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.160
And I think he was curious whether such protein full changes are what leads to recall, right?

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:28.160
So that the certain position of the protein over time, because what leads to recall, I'm assuming also I've had some experience in neuroscience research myself for my master's.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.160
I've read this before. So I think that's what he's referring to.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:45.160
Yeah. Yes, I'm going to give a brief answer because it could be a lot of discussion about recall. It could be another topic for another really meeting.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:52.160
We don't know anything about the mechanism to recall. It's very difficult to study because it's an instantaneous.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:55.160
It's a moment that happens.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:32:09.160
And studying the biology of that is, is, is going to be the next round here, I'm sure. But it has not been as easy to approach as encoding and new memories and long term memory.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:16.160
Consolidation and storage information. So recall is a major, major question.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:31.160
I would not equate this with the first long term potentiation is the equivalent is believe or is suggested to be the equivalent of long term memory long term potentiation.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:36.160
Or memories formation, let's say, but not record.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:50.160
There are studies of course that can reactivate the electrophysiological measurements. But again, relating that to recall of memories is a big jump.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:33:01.160
As you can imagine, you know, one electrophysiological measurement is a monodimensional understanding compared to the complexity of the brain.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:16.160
Oh, no, I apologize. When I was referring to LTP, I was mostly not in terms of recall, but it's, as you talked about, it's what I to me creates the network and the system for which the memories sort of first builds upon through synaptic pruning and what have you and obviously

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:22.160
LTD long term depression in the server and the server problem. But yeah, that's that's a whole other discussion for another day.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:27.160
And then I get.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:36.160
Okay, this is a good, this is a good light one, I think, because it's a good one to end it off this person. It was a Judy Levine asked, how is it when you do a cross puzzle.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:47.160
If you leave it and come back, you'll then remember the words that you couldn't remember before, but it comes like this without thinking about it.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:56.160
The computer warming up.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:06.160
It goes somewhere into the default default network, but it's your brain's processing it even if you're not paying conscious attention.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:16.160
It's like coming up with an answer to a problem that you had at night you wake up and you know the answer in the morning and I think it's the same sort of thing.

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:32.160
And not so much a memory issue I would think but it relates also to getting offline, not having your brain occupied with something else, so that it has an opportunity to sort of reconfigure itself and perhaps come out with an answer of course doesn't always

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:42.160
work. But there is this idea that either sleeping on it or taking a break doing something else can improve performance.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:53.160
Well, I'd like to thank everyone so much for your wonderful contributions. There's so much that hasn't been said, but I think we've all learned.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:35:06.160
We've all I hope recorded, and I hope many of us will remember much of what was said, but it was all terribly important and I think you so much participating.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:16.160
And thank you Beverly for organizing it and moderating. Yes, and I wish you all very well very well as we proceed to manage.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.160
Next year, thank you.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:23.160
Goodbye everyone who's coming. Thank you for being with us. Thank you everyone.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.160
Thank you.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:37.160
Bye bye.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:36:19.160
Thank you.
