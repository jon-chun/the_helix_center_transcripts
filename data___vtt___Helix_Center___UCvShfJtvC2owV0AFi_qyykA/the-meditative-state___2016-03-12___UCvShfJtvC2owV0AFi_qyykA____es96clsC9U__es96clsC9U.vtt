00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Check us out on our website, healaccenter.org, Facebook, Twitter.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Let me tell you a little bit about upcoming event on Saturday, March 26th.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
It's the second of our programs on Genius.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
This is Understanding Genius Women.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
It's organized by poet, visual artist, and

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Healac Center Executive Committee member Anne-Marie Levine.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Anne-Marie will be joined by Joyce Chaplin from Harvard, Kathleen Keat from Trinity College,

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Darren McMahon at Dartmouth, and Susan Seymour from Pitzer College.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
Today's program is the Betatative State, and I will briefly introduce our participants.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
Sarah Lazar, Assistant Professor in Psychology at Harvard Medical School,

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Peter Malinowski, Senior Lecturer in Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at Liverpool John Moore's University,

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Coshan Paley Ellison, co-founder of the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Morgan Stebens, supervising analyst Jungian Psycho Analytic Association in New York,

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Iyuan Tang, Professor of Psychological Sciences, Texas Tech University.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
We'll start.

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, I think.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So we start first?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:43.000
I think it's my pleasure to be here to share the research and the application related to the meditative mind,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
the meditative brain.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
So also I'm honored to have the colleagues here, the audience here.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
So it means we have a similar interest.

01:55.000 --> 02:07.000
Hope our discussion can facilitate understanding about this topic or may help your practice.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
For myself, I'm a neuroscientist and psychologist, but I'm also a long-term meditator.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, 10 years ago, I moved from China to US, so I've been a professor in China since 1987.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
So I moved here, Professor of the University of Oregon first,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
I moved to Texas Tech University.

02:33.000 --> 02:46.000
So this is my background, so I can share the idea related to the neuroscience mechanism of mindfulness meditation or meditation.

02:46.000 --> 02:56.000
Or I can and also can share the practice experience of myself when I learn in China.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
So I started practicing when I was six.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, so it's a tradition.

03:02.000 --> 03:12.000
So maybe I have a different view from yours that you can help me.

03:12.000 --> 03:19.000
So I have a question for the researchers, but you haven't since you jumped in.

03:19.000 --> 03:29.000
In my reading of the research, I haven't been able to find a coherent definition of meditation.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
It's a perfect idea, I will leave to my colleagues.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
That's a good question for someone else.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I'd say for them.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Yeah, no, I think many of us try to dodge that question.

03:45.000 --> 03:55.000
Because when we turn it, we ask the contemplatives and they say, well, you know, because there's the meditation that we all think of where we sit and we watch our breath, or we focus on something.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
But there's also meditative traditions, sorry, the scripture reading.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And there's a lot of different ways to meditate.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
So I think it's one of those.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Simone Vile is one of those.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Exactly, yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
So personally, that's why I pick mindfulness.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I pick MBSR.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Someone who even says there's not even really meditation.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So I try to avoid that question.

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
So meaning you pick a definition or a form that's already established and then investigate it.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Okay.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
I actually, I also, I agree with Sarah.

04:36.000 --> 04:49.000
Even trying to, if we would try to define meditation as like, with the definition that covers the whole field of meditation, I think we would give a very wrong impression.

04:49.000 --> 05:03.000
I think we would, it would suggest that somehow all these different approaches and Sarah mentioned a few that one could somehow bring them together and find some fundamental similarities.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
Maybe, and then from the research perspective, maybe similarities in brain states or brain dynamics or whatever.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And I don't think this is possible.

05:12.000 --> 05:27.000
But I completely agree with Sarah that the practices that somehow we cover very vaguely under the term meditation, they're so, they can be so different that it would be a few times to think that one could all lump it together.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Sure.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
So I think so that an overarching definition would suggest otherwise.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I completely agree.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
That's probably why I asked the question.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yes.

05:38.000 --> 05:51.000
But it brings to mind another question which is that some proponents of some traditions think the idea of research itself is against the grain of what the tradition is for.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
I mean, David Lopez is one of the big scholars in favor of that view.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
I don't really have a comment because I like to read the research but to, does that come into play at all?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, definitely.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
I mean, when I first started, you know, people told me you're not going to see anything.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
It's all ephemeral.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You know, whatever you're measuring is not relevant.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I still get that actually.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
You know, so you get changes in the brain.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
What does it mean?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Right?

06:20.000 --> 06:26.000
And so, oops, I'm really, this is not, I'm just here today.

06:26.000 --> 06:35.000
So, and so, I guess I have a lot of different thoughts about it because meditation is vast.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Right?

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
And it's not like I feel like, oh, we're going to do one experiment and explain all of the meditation and one or two experiments.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I mean, it's going to be years.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, pain is, I think, is a really good example.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
People have been studying pain scientifically for 50 years, right?

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And I think pain is just as ephemeral as the meditative state.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
And, you know, they've learned a lot but there's still a lot they don't know and don't understand.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
So, I think, you know, and I often look to the pain literature to sort of, you know, for parallels and whatnot.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I think it's a useful thing to look at.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
And so, but I do think there, I don't know that we'll be able to explain all of the meditative state with neuroscience,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
but I do think we can explain bits and pieces of it.

07:18.000 --> 07:26.000
And I think that has some contribution, especially, you know, in the context of psychotherapy and medical,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
using meditative techniques in medical settings and clinical settings.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
Because then I think, you know, we have a sense of now of what's going on in the mind of someone who's depressed or anxious or whatever.

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
And we have a sense of what's going on in the mind of someone who's meditating and we can sort of see how there's maybe some overlap and how one might be able to help one another.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
So, I think in a very limited sense, we can get at some aspects of it, but maybe not enlightenment,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
which is none of those things that no one wants to define, right?

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
So, and I think that's the part of my thing is, you know, if you can't define it, you can't study it.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
So, yeah. So that, that was what we can define. We'll try to study.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
And I guess if it's that broad, then we have to define little pieces and study that and put them together.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
It's so amazing. You know, I'd spent the morning and a meditation retreat and, and coming here,

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
I had to leave the retreat to come here, which was felt kind of ironic in a certain way.

08:21.000 --> 08:34.000
I have to stop meditating to go to talk about meditating and, but also I was talking with maybe 25 practitioners, you know, one-on-one during the morning,

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
and they are all practicing Zen meditation. But I wouldn't describe any of them practicing really in the same way.

08:42.000 --> 08:53.000
And how they're working with their mind in the same way. So I'm super curious to learn about how you work with variants of each person,

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
because very different, you know, even like some people are working and there's three different kinds of Zen meditation.

09:00.000 --> 09:08.000
And then there's people, individual people working in those med, those branches.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
I'm just curious about in terms of study, how do you study that? I'd love to learn.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Well, personally, I mean, so we try to get people who are all doing the same thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:29.000
That's why when I first did the first study, I did everyone, you know, even just for the possible meditation, you know, instead of just all meditation.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
And now, you know, with MBSR, it's like people going through and so, but it's hard to know, even then.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Because even though they may be listening to the exact same tape, what they're doing is different.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
But the idea is that hopefully they're more or less doing the same thing.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know if you have other ideas.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Do you want to see first?

09:47.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah. This would be the idea and the hope, you know, that if people are instructed in the same way, follow the same approaches that actually also they do the same.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
And then this is reflected, for instance, in brain activity being similar.

10:03.000 --> 10:21.000
Sometimes it seems to be the case, but we have also carried out studies, one particular study where we worked with Tibetan Buddhist meditators, all from the same tradition, all going through the same training, all having the same meditation teacher.

10:21.000 --> 10:38.000
And when we studied them, during different meditation states with magnetic encephalography, basically picking up the magnetic signal that the electrical activity produces, the electrical brain activity produces.

10:38.000 --> 10:54.000
What we found is a consistent pattern of activity that was where we find any similarity across these, I think, around 14 participants.

10:54.000 --> 11:08.000
So then we also scanned their teacher. So, and he basically, if you had never seen anything from neuroscience, no idea actually what you're looking at.

11:08.000 --> 11:16.000
And we just show someone, the visual representation of the brain waves, if you want.

11:16.000 --> 11:29.000
And then actually everyone who has eyesight could see this one is different. So whereas at maybe at an intermediate level, there is a lot of variation.

11:29.000 --> 11:38.000
But maybe they are very advanced states, maybe converges more. But I think from my perspective, it's too early to really answer this question.

11:38.000 --> 11:49.000
Actually, this question related to the research and also application. Number one, like a sorrow and a poor on post-set.

11:49.000 --> 11:59.000
So when we want to study one form of meditation, let's see, mindfulness meditation or just meditation.

11:59.000 --> 12:10.000
So you try to find the same teacher, same technique, similar participant, you want to control all the factors.

12:10.000 --> 12:20.000
It's not easy. I'll give you an example. So when I was working in medical school at a professor, so I worked with a patient.

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
So I developed a master called integrated body management. Body management, not just mine. So we call it IBMT.

12:29.000 --> 12:42.000
So we use the same teacher for the college students. So over the 500 subjects, just to see their similarity or their individual difference.

12:42.000 --> 12:54.000
So we separate the question. Number one, to see in general if people can benefit from this training. Number one question.

12:54.000 --> 13:08.000
So you know undergrad students, like American students, if you ask them, you do the mindfulness meditation for 30 minutes per day, they say, okay fine, I can do Monday to Friday. No, we can.

13:08.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm so busy. So we do. So then we find that even though the five session of IBMT, so we find the improved attention ability, improved positive mood, decreased negative mood, but it's all self-report.

13:28.000 --> 13:38.000
People argue, what's the objective markers? So we measure the cortisol, the celebrity cortisol to see all the stress hormone reduced.

13:38.000 --> 13:51.000
Then we find the immune function factor at SGA, improved. So you see my work, but you look at the 500 subjects, you find their individual difference.

13:51.000 --> 14:04.000
Even though you deliver same, like this environment, right? Everybody's here. Same environment, but does our brain interpret or perceive or process in a different way or same way?

14:04.000 --> 14:15.000
So there are lots of study, just one important study. So if this moment, we measure everybody's eye movement, millisecond. So this is the topic.

14:15.000 --> 14:26.000
You will find from Asian people, like Japanese, Chinese, over 90% eye movement, they focus on the environment.

14:26.000 --> 14:37.000
But the four Westerners, English speaker, Canadian speaker, over 90% time, their eyes focus on the target.

14:37.000 --> 14:45.000
Asian people, American people, they are in the same environment, but they perceive the information differently in the fundamental level.

14:45.000 --> 14:55.000
But they all see the targets, all see the environment. So then we study their brain to see how the brain responds.

14:55.000 --> 15:08.000
So then we find, even though the five sessions, 20 to 30 minute sessions, their brain activity change, like a brain wave, like the both signal, a pharma signal.

15:08.000 --> 15:22.000
Then they even further go to five hours, so they change the y-metastructure, the structure. Also this structure change correlates with their emotional regulation ability.

15:22.000 --> 15:29.000
When we want to reward the brain, let drive new, happy behaviors, so your brain structure change.

15:29.000 --> 15:40.000
But we do find many, many individual differences. Then we measure the physiology, if you heartbeat, breathe, pattern, or change.

15:40.000 --> 15:49.000
Then we provide them to do the working memory task, creativity task, attention task, then you'll find that most of people go to the similar direction,

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
but some people faster, some people later, some people in between. So they call the individual difference.

15:56.000 --> 16:08.000
So I think there are lots of papers from Paul Sarah's group or my group, so we have a review paper talking about the neuroscience of mindfulness meditation, the whole field.

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
Then you'll find that even though many, many publications, many, many studies, but the field is still very young.

16:15.000 --> 16:22.000
Because of scientific research, just one perspective that addressed part of the question.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
However, this meditation practice is more experiential.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
Like when I moved US from China, so the people said, oh, your message is excellent. Give me a menu.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Then I will study a menu, then we've done.

16:38.000 --> 16:46.000
Yeah, this is the mindset that I always joke them, do you learn swimming using a menu in the water?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
They said, no, I'm going to buy.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
So we actually, you can study using a machine.

16:54.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, I use a lot of scientific research method, but you can also study from a first-person perspective, from experience.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
But this is still a mystery. I think neither lots of people work, not just from research.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Do you ever control for other activities that give you the same effects?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Excellent question.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
So originally, in a field, many people did study, just use one meditation group before and after.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.000
But recent years, people find that there are several publications.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
Yeah, I think from some major labs, so they use mindfulness compared to another, even though the health education course,

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
so they find similar, non-signifying difference, at least the full papers I know.

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
So then people started, people started to use different control, active control.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
So our study always used relaxation therapy.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
So relaxation training therapy is good for the anxiety, stress.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
So we never told participants, you are in the relaxation, you are in the meditation.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
We just said, you are in the meditation and relaxation, so they believe the same.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
So some people even love relaxation. They say, oh, that's good for me.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Some people love meditation.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
So we did find, at least this version of meditation, IBM T, is better compared to relaxation training.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
So other people use other methods.

18:33.000 --> 18:43.000
And did you compare it with things like jogging or listening to music or, you know, there are a lot of things that change our mentality.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
Yes, I think their study, they use yoga, they use physical activity.

18:51.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah, we had a study compared a long-term aging population for 10 years.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
So one group, just a physical exercise, another group, IBM T, meditation.

19:03.000 --> 19:14.000
So we find that they actually work on a different system, like meditation, more works on the central neurosystem, like a brain, mind.

19:14.000 --> 19:18.000
And physical exercise, more works on the cardiovascular system.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
But then they still work on the brain, just the different order of plasticity.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
And we've done a study where we actually compared two different types of meditation, actually.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So we compared MBSR to Herr Benson's relaxation response.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And so they're both meditating. It's both eight weeks clinical.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
And there's differences in the brains.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
So I guess I'd also give it to your question a little bit.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
But also self-report. Some of the self-report questions were very different.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
You know, some things are the same. They both reduce stress very effectively.

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
But the psychological mechanisms by which they worked were different.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
The physiology was different. And the brains were different.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
And so we think that's really interesting in terms of potentially targeting different types of meditation to different conditions.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's what I was going to ask. Conditions were people.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Right.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Personality structures.

20:11.000 --> 20:19.000
Right. And there is a little bit of anecdotal evidence along those lines that some people, John Kevin's in years ago,

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
observe that people who tend to have a lot of worry in their head tend to do better with yoga and sort of the somatic practices

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
versus people who have more sort of body complaints do better with the meditation.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
And then also in terms of anxiety versus panic.

20:41.000 --> 20:48.000
You know, that people with panic tend to do a little bit better with mindfulness versus people with anxiety tend to do a little bit better with relaxation training.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
And so again, no hard evidence on that.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
Don't quote me on that one. But there's some little tidbits of evidence that suggests that that might be, you know, that there might be.

20:58.000 --> 21:05.000
Right. I mean, an extreme example is I would imagine that someone with a panic issue wouldn't be a good candidate for a death meditation.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
No. Yeah. Probably not.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
Yeah. But also someone's having a panic attack. You don't say, oh, just calm down.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
But you can say, okay, you know, you're panicking.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.000
Even though you're just be mindful what's going on right now, be aware of it. And so they really respond to it.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
You know, so that's the idea. But again, no evidence for that.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
It's not yet.

21:28.000 --> 21:36.000
So when you say that, what happens to the brain when you say, be mindful? What happens?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Yeah.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
So there tends to be more activity in the insula, which is an area involved in interreceptive awareness.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
And there tends to be turning off of the ruminative part of the brain.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
And so it's a much more experiential experience, you know, which we do expect.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.000
They've done a little bit with mindfulness and pain. And that's really interesting.

22:02.000 --> 22:13.000
So if you look at placebo or distraction or, you know, cognitive restructuring and pain, they all look pretty much the same.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
And all those forms of pain control, which you get is the front of the brain, which is like the executive part of the brain, turns on.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
And the sensory part of the brain gets turned off.

22:23.000 --> 22:28.000
So literally the front part of your brain is just telling the sensory part of the brain, just don't feel it.

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
But with mindfulness, you actually see the opposite. The front of the brain turns off, and the sensory part goes up.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And you think, what? What's going on there?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
But when you think about it, that's what happens with mindfulness, right?

22:39.000 --> 22:46.000
You're saying, just feel it without elaboration and without judging it, without trying to control it or stop it.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
And that's exactly what we're seeing in the brains, is that they're not trying to control it, they're just sensing it.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
But even though they have more sensory brain activity, and they're reporting that they feel it, you know, the same.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
They report less, it doesn't bother them so much.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
And the affect of the sensory part of it is the same.

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
But the affect of, like, oh, I don't like it, it's unpleasantness. That is less in the meditators.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
So it does seem like it's a completely different way of doing pain control.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
Well, that's interesting too, that it sounds like, I mean, those are different.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
Meditations, different meditations seem to have a different effect on the brain, and it makes me think that one of my questions is,

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
what use is the person making of the meditation?

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
Because I think we've found that people can use meditation, you know, to, let's say, repress something or to explore something.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
So, which gets us into a different level of the discussion.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, and maybe that different people need different things at different times?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Absolutely.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
Yeah, I think it's useful. I like to think of a lot like exercise, you know, and so,

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
different types of exercise have very different benefits, like weight-bearing exercise versus cardiovascular, you know, cardio.

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
And you need different things at different times depending on your condition, and I think similarly with meditation.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Like, I know when I first started, I needed fast yoga.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
There's no way I could do meditation when I first started.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
But now there's no way I could do fast yoga, right? And I really like the slow meditative yoga. So I think, you know.

24:22.000 --> 24:36.000
When you said that you essentially calm down the cognitive parts, but yet if I understood correctly, if you tell somebody, don't worry about it, it doesn't change it.

24:36.000 --> 24:42.000
Or when you say don't worry about it, you're addressing the cognitive part.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I'm not sure I understand the question. Sorry.

24:44.000 --> 24:54.000
In other words, why telling a patient or a person who's worried or anxious? Don't worry about it. Why doesn't that work?

24:54.000 --> 25:02.000
I don't know. I don't know. I can help a little bit. Okay, go for it.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
I think the people may know that one phenomena called a wide bear phenomenon.

25:08.000 --> 25:19.000
Oh, yeah. So let's do a study. Just a short one minute. So do you mind close your eyes? Everybody? Yeah, close your eyes.

25:19.000 --> 25:30.000
So just one moment. Then follow my instruction carefully to not think wide bear.

25:30.000 --> 25:46.000
Do not please open your eyes. So what happened? You're full of web bear, right? Yeah, because I'm trying to mind just behavior like this way.

25:46.000 --> 25:58.000
You want to suppress something, they will be back, right? So the life is full of opportunity, adventure, challenge or you think it's a bad part, a good part.

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
It's our label. We label this good or bad because we prefer that we think it's good. We don't prefer with that it's bad.

26:06.000 --> 26:18.000
We try to avoid, right? So in reality, I think for the beginning, in the beginning state, like I'm doing meditation today.

26:18.000 --> 26:27.000
So beginner. So I will try very hard to follow instruction, right? Try to suppress control method, emotion.

26:27.000 --> 26:36.000
So then you find the getting in so the sensory motor, sensory or interception system increase.

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
Also the self control midline brain and to single cortex, they increase a little bit.

26:43.000 --> 26:53.000
But in general, those are led for prefrontal effort control. They go down a little bit. But you struggle.

26:53.000 --> 27:04.000
In some study, they find actually some study find decrease because people use different effort to get the same way, like strategy, right?

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
So then in the immediate part, in the middle part, you practice, sometimes you can control, sometimes you cannot.

27:11.000 --> 27:22.000
So you are in the middle line. So you got the midline, PFC, insular, then you enjoy experience, meditation experience in some moments.

27:22.000 --> 27:29.000
So you do reward system deeper called stratum, so star.

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
Then you are advanced, like we see advanced meditator. So even though they don't want to use very strong control, but they just be there.

27:40.000 --> 27:47.000
So I propose two words, one called doing, another called being.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
So do you mean that you do very, you work very hard, try to get something done?

27:52.000 --> 28:01.000
It's American culture, right? We want the faster food, the faster life. Yeah, we work very hard, try to get what we need.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
So you look at Asian culture, they propose being.

28:05.000 --> 28:16.000
So sometimes being, just being with you, being with nature or environment, is still a strategy.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
So the new goal called trying now to try, trying now to try life, you deal with the white bear, right?

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
You live with emotion, you live with things, you think it's bad.

28:30.000 --> 28:39.000
So I give a talk about doing and being. So the audience said, why are you using being, being so confused?

28:39.000 --> 28:48.000
Doing makes sense. So I joke with them, do you know what we called? We call the human being.

28:48.000 --> 28:57.000
We don't call human doing, right? Yeah, just a joke. But you know, we may miss the same part.

28:57.000 --> 29:06.000
And this part related to the brain function, brain structure, physiology chain in different levels.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
So a quick question for you. Was that conclusion based on your research?

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
Or did it come out of the tradition that you were practicing?

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Good question. You mean the doing and the being, right? Yeah.

29:22.000 --> 29:32.000
Many years ago, this idea was from my practice when I worked with people, delivering the training retreat.

29:32.000 --> 29:42.000
But recent years, I'm not alone. There are many, many scholars. They point out this being state.

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
So like the mindfulness meditation, we have a definition called, yeah.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
So pay attention to the present without the judgment, right?

29:55.000 --> 30:04.000
So it's easy description, but it's hard to make it. Only you can stay with the being state, acceptance, openness.

30:04.000 --> 30:12.000
Then you can feel something. But this is not related to meditation. In your life, you have experience.

30:12.000 --> 30:19.000
In some moment, you forget time, forget the environment, you just be there.

30:19.000 --> 30:29.000
So give you, ask your own question. When you kiss your partner, in the moment you are kissing, do you mind working very hard?

30:29.000 --> 30:36.000
No, you forget. You are there. Being there, right? I think that depends.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
But here's a question for the researchers. How do you deal with familiarity bias?

30:42.000 --> 30:51.000
How do you deal with the difficulty of not wanting to confirm in your research that you already want to believe?

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
Yeah, that's hard. You have to build in skepticism.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
Or you try to work with skepticism too. The thing is also that even, because I see this with papers, they have to go through peer review.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
So even if I'm a little bit biased, when I go out to reviewers, they're going to slam me.

31:17.000 --> 31:25.000
So I really try hard not to try putting the posing point and try to think of alternative explanations.

31:25.000 --> 31:32.000
Actually, I want to get back to your last question, though. There is something called neurofeedback.

31:32.000 --> 31:40.000
And what that is, there's a really cool experiment that this guy at Yale did. He put people in a scanner who had never meditated before.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
There's a part of the brain called the PCC. It's involved in the little voice in your head.

31:46.000 --> 31:54.000
It's the mind wandering and the talking. And what he did is, when that part of the brain was active, they saw a lot of blue.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
And that part of the brain was not active and quiet. It turned red.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
And so they sort of explained to them how to meditate. And he put them in the scanner.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
And then while they were meditating, they were told just watch your breathing.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
And they got, saw on the screen, either blue or red, depending on the activity of that brain region.

32:13.000 --> 32:21.000
And this one guy, he's watching his breath. But he couldn't make it go blue.

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
It just kept going red, meaning his mind was active. And they told him, you're doing it right, you'll see this go blue.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
He's going to turn off. And the harder he tried, the worse a cot.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
So then finally he went, oh, and he got the doing versus being.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
And he realized he was thinking about his breath and like watching it and controlling it.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
So when he stepped back and just observed the breath, boom, and that part of the brain turned off, and he got it.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
And he got into a really deep state. So I think, because that was one of the questions you asked, was, you know, can you get at it scientifically?

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
And so, it's not one case, yes. And so now the guy is actually trying to do EEG in your own feedback.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
And so, you know, so with beginning meditators, because lots of times it's true when you first start meditating.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
You know, you're thinking about things and you're mind wandering and the whole thing.

33:07.000 --> 33:15.000
So can you get that feedback from that one part of the brain and help you keep on track and help you be being instead of doing?

33:15.000 --> 33:29.000
But I also wonder about the, there's a kind of a bias in the meditation world about meditative mind being relaxed and peaceful and...

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
Other?

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
We'll just meditate.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
I think there's such a bias towards, whoa.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Exciting.

33:46.000 --> 34:00.000
To peaceful and meditative. And I just wonder in some ways even what we're talking about. Because if, for example, myself or when I'm working with my teacher or when I'm working with my students,

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
if I'm always just like, you know, rainbows and unicorns and...

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
As much as I like rainbows and unicorns, it's not actually what I'm... why I'm practicing.

34:13.000 --> 34:22.000
Right. And so I just wonder about the red and the blue, because I think if I'm not going into the red sometimes and knowing how to work with that.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Right.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Does that make sense?

34:25.000 --> 34:35.000
Yeah, no, definitely. And so I think the idea is for the beginners, because often people, they get really frustrated because they never experience that really deep unicorn state, right?

34:35.000 --> 34:46.000
And you need to be sort of in that deep... when you're in that deep state, that's when all of a sudden the stuff comes up and then you know how to work with it because you've done, because you've had the...

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Oh, and those stepping back and just observing and the being.

34:49.000 --> 34:56.000
And so I think you sort of need to learn that state first before you can dive into... because otherwise you're just a therapy. Right?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
So...

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Otherwise you're just in therapy.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
What's that?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Otherwise you're just in therapy.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Right. And you're just in... you're ruminating and thinking, yeah.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, yes.

35:05.000 --> 35:20.000
So in the Jungian tradition, it's a long history of meditative states and we try to track the way the imagination is activated or not activated around certain images.

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
So it's just to address that question. It's not a chattery sort of thing.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Yeah, no, I know. I didn't mean to slam therapy.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
No, no, no, no.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Not therapy, but yes. But it's sort of...

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Everyone defends the thing that pays their bills, so...

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Right. When I think I'm really good therapy, you often get people into that same state, though.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
Like even the whole, you know, distancing and sort of seeing your thoughts is just thoughts, that whole thing.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
So I think there is a lot of between notation and therapy.

35:49.000 --> 35:55.000
But I guess that's sort of the difference though between just sort of like thinking about your thoughts versus stepping back and observing your thoughts.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Which again, I think good therapy gets you into that place where your stuff...

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I think each one works for different people.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Yeah. Yeah. And they work really well together. That's my experience.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
And just talking to other people, they work really well together.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
One of the interesting pieces of research that I just read, which is not on meditation, is that apparently, in general,

36:14.000 --> 36:23.000
of course, as a generalization, self-talk, kind of mentality states work better for men and worse for women.

36:23.000 --> 36:27.000
Where's the problem?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I'll have to find...

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
How did they define works better?

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
Again, I'll have to find it, but it basically, you know, whatever you might define as a good outcome,

36:41.000 --> 36:46.000
meaning better feeling about yourself, calmer, less panicked.

36:46.000 --> 36:53.000
You know, you come out with a self-report and a, you know, so on. That's better, roughly speaking.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
The other one's not so good.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
I had some...

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
The question of what's better is a good one.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, yeah. No, I...

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
I had some thoughts about this question with buying feedback.

37:04.000 --> 37:12.000
Because actually, when I'm giving talks about science of meditation and so on, this question comes a lot.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
Can... maybe with the idea, maybe I can I speed up the processes and so on.

37:19.000 --> 37:26.000
So far, actually, my view was very hesitant in this respect.

37:26.000 --> 37:35.000
First of all, from my understanding of the insights we have so far regarding brain activity during meditation,

37:35.000 --> 37:43.000
I would think... I would not feel confident to say, this is the signal, this is how the brain activity should look like,

37:43.000 --> 37:50.000
for the state we're aiming at. So if I don't know this, what am I feeling back?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
Yeah, so, okay, one can just try it and so on.

37:53.000 --> 38:04.000
But if I don't know what the state looks like I'm aiming at, how should I give feedback, red, wrong state, green or blue or whatever, right state?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Yeah, so that's the one thing.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
But then more from the perspective of meditator and meditation teacher,

38:14.000 --> 38:26.000
also the beauty, I think, of meditation practices, that it's one of these approaches that doesn't require anything else than my mind.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah, so we are so used to giving away responsibility, usually it's at least in the UK, it's drugs.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
So we go to the pharmacy to help ourselves to get a quick fix and a faster result.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
We like that around here too.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
So, but now there's a method where I can say, you only need your mind, trust your mind.

38:48.000 --> 38:57.000
You don't need any helmet, you don't need any EEGs, you don't need any confirmation from outside with the technology or whatever,

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
you only need your mind to practice.

39:01.000 --> 39:09.000
And for me, actually this is an incredibly powerful method or message also,

39:09.000 --> 39:20.000
which gives a lot of trust and confidence and you can also say responsibility to the person practicing or wanting to practice.

39:20.000 --> 39:27.000
And that's from the perspective of the meditator, that's the most interesting for me,

39:27.000 --> 39:37.000
all the strengths, all the qualities, all the insights, everything is in you, not in the machine you put on your head.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
Well, I'm not a meditator, no, nothing of a meditation.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
So you wake up in the morning, you meditate.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Then you go to work and you're bombarded with every possible conflict.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
What's the difference between you who has meditated and me who hasn't?

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Well, hopefully a lot.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
So...

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Feeling of self-justification?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah.

40:08.000 --> 40:17.000
So the idea is, you know, you can do practice meditation, and the idea of practicing it is that then when you go out into the world,

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
you can then use it. So the idea would be that you...

40:22.000 --> 40:29.000
One person described meditation to me as becoming very intimate with the weather of your mind, right?

40:29.000 --> 40:36.000
Because you're really... you're much more sensitive to the little thoughts and feelings that sort of flip by in the back of your brain.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And so you're more in tune with them.

40:38.000 --> 40:44.000
So then when all that stuff happens throughout your day, you see them and you're less reactive to it.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
And so you're... it's all the acting versus reacting.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
I mean, he should probably answer this question, right?

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
So the neuroscience can't answer this, but for the teachers, they can tell you.

40:52.000 --> 41:02.000
You're more calm, you're more centered, you're less reactive, and you know, you're just going to do it in a very different way.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
That's if you define meditation as a separate activity.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
Right. Well, ideally, yeah, the idea is that you can carry the mindfulness in particular.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You really can carry that throughout the day.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
And then you really do see your thoughts as just thoughts throughout the day.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
And then, you know, that in really with time, it becomes, you know, 24-7, which is idealistic, but...

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
It does... bits of it does carry through the day.

41:28.000 --> 41:35.000
One of the questions I have is the relationship between the, you know, a goal state, which is a cognitive... an idea,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
and whatever the process is that you find.

41:38.000 --> 41:48.000
I mean, Jung had this fascination with what he called natural symbols versus symbols that came from a tradition.

41:48.000 --> 41:55.000
And meaning, I wonder if there's anything that we could call meditation that isn't bound to a particular tradition,

41:55.000 --> 42:03.000
and therefore wouldn't have the goal posts be already preset, at least rhetorically.

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
I think that's you.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I don't know.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You go ahead.

42:12.000 --> 42:20.000
No, but I don't know. I don't know. And actually, I'm getting more and more confused as we talk.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
In general, like, what are we actually talking about?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
It's called mindfulness.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
I think I've been meditating too much, you know, today. But I think that... but what I'm wondering about is actually,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
even are we talking about... there are different schools of meditation, right?

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
And then there are subsets of all the schools of meditation, and then there are a million traditions of meditation.

42:44.000 --> 42:56.000
And I'm actually curious too about what I notice really differently about people I work with,

42:56.000 --> 43:08.000
and in myself, and in my own path, and in my teacher's path, is really this sense of... you know, the in Buddhism are the three jewels,

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
as they're called.

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
They awaken mind the teachings and community.

43:14.000 --> 43:24.000
So... and I often get concerned, and I know it's a big difference when people are practicing with those three, and when they're not.

43:24.000 --> 43:30.000
And usually, most meditators I find are really into the first two.

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
My own awakened mind. And I'm going to study and learn.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
It's like so transactional in a certain level, but what about community?

43:41.000 --> 43:53.000
And so to me, I'm so curious if there is... because I know that in my own journey as a practitioner has... that's like the most challenging and rewarding.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
Part of it. Community or Sangha.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
And most people are like, yeah, no thanks.

44:03.000 --> 44:13.000
And because it's usually around our family of origin stuff, but it's... you know, how do we... I'm just curious in terms of... is that part of the research?

44:13.000 --> 44:20.000
Or is it really just out of like a skill-based learning a technique?

44:20.000 --> 44:33.000
Or are you really looking at our people landing in a tradition that actually supports them in terms of their own awake... you know, awakeness?

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
In terms of learning, ongoing learning, at least for a lifetime.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
And then... you know, community.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Are they being supported by others and supporting others?

44:47.000 --> 44:59.000
So to me, it's also the service piece, which is the natural... for me, it's been the natural response to... you know, a couple decades of meditative practice.

44:59.000 --> 45:05.000
Because it's the only thing that makes sense in a certain point is being more loving as much as we can.

45:05.000 --> 45:13.000
Although that doesn't... you don't need a community for that. You can choose whatever place that you're in and the people around you.

45:13.000 --> 45:24.000
I mean, as an analyst that also has connections to lots of Dharma groups, I often find refugees from communities because communities have inherent goalposts and power structures.

45:24.000 --> 45:33.000
And I find as much crossover the other way, you know, I think perhaps there's an ideal of community.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
But I think these days it's a little more of a polyglot. At least I know it is for me.

45:40.000 --> 45:47.000
And again, I think it's also interesting because how meditation is happening here in the West is very, very different than how it's happening in the East.

45:47.000 --> 45:54.000
In the East you go, you have your teacher, you have a really close relationship with your teacher, and you live there, you know, in the community.

45:54.000 --> 46:02.000
Whereas here it's like, oh yeah, I go once a week and see my teacher once a week versus, you know, and I'm doing my striving and my job and everything else like that.

46:02.000 --> 46:12.000
So it is, I think, in also less times in some traditions, like you go, you meditate in silence and you leave and you may not even know who the people are around you.

46:12.000 --> 46:19.000
So it's not necessarily even really community in the same, even the meditation centers, but alone in the science.

46:19.000 --> 46:28.000
And I think the science varies tremendously. So again, my science is focused a lot on the clinical application, so we don't really look at that so much.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
But there are definitely scientists who are very, very interested in that question and who are actively studying that.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
So it varies. And I do think it is a really important key piece.

46:38.000 --> 46:49.000
I think the issue of community certainly is I think a lot of healing can come about by finding your community, regardless of how you put that, and that could have an effect that looks like meditation.

46:49.000 --> 47:00.000
Just from being embedded in the community where you do have a co-concern.

47:00.000 --> 47:06.000
You seem to be saying that it's an inevitable outcome of the deepening of your meditation.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
You were saying that it's a natural process.

47:09.000 --> 47:20.000
So you weren't suggesting that it was cautious about saying what's natural. Because I feel like everything's natural.

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
I haven't found something yet that's not natural. I agree with that.

47:25.000 --> 47:39.000
But I actually think it's the most terrifying for most people is to really be a part of something.

47:39.000 --> 47:52.000
But I can just say from my own experience, really working through it and staying with the discomfort, which I've learned through my meditative practice,

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
and applying that to relationships over time.

47:58.000 --> 48:12.000
But it takes both the community and yourself or your teacher and yourself to have the equal commitment to staying with it and exploring.

48:12.000 --> 48:23.000
And to me, it's very powerful. And it's been so moving to do that and has completely changed me.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
I don't know if that answers your question about natural.

48:27.000 --> 48:36.000
I have the sense that there might have been a point on one side that the community orientation is an inevitable process,

48:36.000 --> 48:46.000
but you weren't saying that. You were suggesting that there's a cultural, social context in which orientation arises.

48:46.000 --> 48:57.000
I think if there's a meditation community, like there often is in mostly other places, but that's a very different kind of context than we have here typically.

48:57.000 --> 49:09.000
Because I think what you're saying is that often here in the West, there's the least amount of emphasis placed on in the community versus in the East, there's much more emphasis placed on it.

49:09.000 --> 49:19.000
But I think another question you're getting at though is that, so in Buddhism, the idea is that human light mint, the highest is a combination of wisdom and compassion.

49:19.000 --> 49:32.000
And so compassion is a huge, and that is a natural outcome, I don't know if you want to use that phrase or not, but it is definitely one of the primary outcomes of meditation practice is really, really deep compassion for yourself and for others.

49:32.000 --> 49:50.000
So do you think, but actually this is something I'm always wondering about, do you think that some people feel like that's an arrival, that's a destination point? And for me it's like a moment by moment, because like in one moment I'm like, how cool, and then I'm like a complete asshole.

49:50.000 --> 50:02.000
But to me it's like practicing like that, it's also a coercive goal post. I mean it's very different than seeing what arises.

50:02.000 --> 50:22.000
So there's a non-striving striving, you know, aspiration versus goal, right? Because I think again, in the tradition, the idea is that if you are striving for it, you're never going to get there. And so when you just, but you said it's an intention, but a very loosely held intention is the way it's described.

50:22.000 --> 50:46.000
But why that intention? I don't know. I will say, from my experience, both in research and application part, so I started a practice when I was young, so no goal, just a tradition, you practiced.

50:46.000 --> 51:02.000
So beginning... The tradition doesn't have a goal. The path is the goal. Because in Western mind we think we need to have a goal, goal setting. We make a plan. We follow the plan, we will get it.

51:02.000 --> 51:21.000
Sometimes you can get there. Sometimes you're not. Like I have a strong intention, motivation, want to marry a movie star. I make a plan. Can you make it? Probably. Or probably not. Very likely not, right?

51:21.000 --> 51:40.000
So I think in my experience, I practiced, so I got some insight just within my mind. I know I'm going to medical school. Yeah, I'm going to work with a patient. I practice my own. I learn from my teacher. I enjoy.

51:40.000 --> 51:52.000
So when I work with many patients, I realize, oh, I want to involve more psychotherapy, psychology, because of behavior. I work with people. You talk about community. Yeah.

51:52.000 --> 52:05.000
So then I develop a method of working with different people. So then I realize, oh, we missed another part, neuroscience. So we try to explain in a scientific way. So I work with their part.

52:05.000 --> 52:23.000
So I never push myself. So you have a goal to go to community. This is your goal. So actually, we have an intrinsic motivation. It happens just when you can hear, when you can find, when you're aware.

52:23.000 --> 52:37.000
So this is why 10 years ago, I created my university job in Chinese universities. I moved to the US. I feel something. So I moved here. So my colleagues said, this is a crazy idea. Yeah?

52:37.000 --> 52:52.000
You are well established here. Why you moved there? It's a new country. You need to speak English, not German. So lots of challenge, but I feel something I want to do. So I just do it.

52:52.000 --> 53:08.000
Also, I can just stay with China. I took some of my research. Fine. So I would think we have a different understanding about the goal. We have a different understanding about how to achieve a goal.

53:08.000 --> 53:15.000
It's related to a learning question yourself, self-awareness, or what you call enlightenment, whatever you call it.

53:15.000 --> 53:27.000
So some people who have been working in the meditation many, many years, they feel something they are higher compared to other people. They feel different.

53:27.000 --> 53:40.000
But actually the same. Many people never meditate. So they still have good experience in life, understanding life. Like I was a long-distance runner. When I was young, I ran lots.

53:40.000 --> 53:50.000
During running, I feel the state similar as a meditation. I feel that. So you're reading the book, you're watching the movie, you chat with a friend.

53:50.000 --> 54:03.000
So you're just daydreaming. You are in the state. It's not a mystery. So I would think the meditation just is attitude. It's a skill. It's a decision. Whatever you want to do.

54:03.000 --> 54:14.000
You say, I don't want to meditate. I want to physical exercise. Fine. So even though for meditation, I think we should keep a balanced way about a meditation.

54:14.000 --> 54:20.000
So we open. It's a journey. This is why I call it the passive goal.

54:20.000 --> 54:29.000
Rather than I have fixed goal, rigid goal, I need to do something because we have a lot of suffering just because we only have a well option.

54:29.000 --> 54:39.000
We say, I only can do this way. I can be happy. I can be succeed. Actually it's not. So you use a term called moment.

54:39.000 --> 54:49.000
Moment moment. You can moment mindful. Moment meditation. Moment happy. This is life. So you enjoy.

54:49.000 --> 55:00.000
So I think we will be born and to be here to enjoy life rather than the suffer. Yeah, we can. Obama says yes, we can.

55:00.000 --> 55:08.000
We can't suffer. We live a suffer. We live with this suffer. Right?

55:08.000 --> 55:20.000
You think they are suffering and are non-suffering together. Make us whole. So there's a different view.

55:20.000 --> 55:27.000
Sarah, are there any studies with monks who pray all day? Oh yeah.

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't mean Buddhist monks. I mean Catholic monks. Oh, I think there's been a few. I think so.

55:33.000 --> 55:42.000
A few study. Yeah, not as many. Not as many. And is that different than meditating and mindfulness?

55:42.000 --> 55:50.000
Yeah, I don't know. There are two studies. Two study related to the prayer.

55:50.000 --> 55:58.000
It depends on the different type of prayers. Some prayer, just a prayer for something like a mancho.

55:58.000 --> 56:09.000
Some just like compassion based the prayer. Yeah, so thinking about the goodness, well for others, the different practice.

56:09.000 --> 56:16.000
So they find some overlap in the middle line of the brain.

56:16.000 --> 56:24.000
Middle line. So anterior to posterior. Middle line. Because this middle line brain related to yourself.

56:24.000 --> 56:34.000
Perception. Self-processing. Yeah. Also there are study related to how the hypnosis is similar different from meditation.

56:34.000 --> 56:43.000
Yeah, it's interesting study. We also have a similar result. Yeah. So we compare the hypnosis and IBM T.

56:43.000 --> 56:57.000
So then we use a sjup task. So you name the red. But I can read the color, the word, or in green color.

56:57.000 --> 57:05.000
So you say the red color is faster. So red in green color is slower. You get conflict.

57:05.000 --> 57:18.000
Psychology is always make trick. So people try very hard. Yeah. So then many, many people find after, before after hypnosis.

57:18.000 --> 57:25.000
So you find that the brain change because hypnosis can block your visual input.

57:25.000 --> 57:35.000
Hypnosis said, yeah, you never see nothing meaningless. So your visual system processing back in the region, in the back region.

57:35.000 --> 57:43.000
So the blocked. So this white information cannot transfer to the frontal lobe, cannot process a conflict.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.000
This is the hypnosis study. So if you use IBM T.

57:47.000 --> 58:00.000
You find visual input still there, then the region, brain region that's responsible resolving the conflict, they work harder to resolve the conflict.

58:00.000 --> 58:08.000
Then behavior level, everybody perform the same. So brain level is quite different.

58:08.000 --> 58:20.000
So I like sports analogies. So running, swimming, golf, weight training, there's perhaps some common benefit.

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
But they're also very, very different. You can gain very, very different skills and use different muscles depending on what you do.

58:26.000 --> 58:33.000
And my sense is that the same is truth, meditation. That there's going to be some things that are common, but then each is going to have also things that are unique.

58:33.000 --> 58:42.000
And so I'm guessing with the prayer that there's going to be certain similarities that will be very similar to the Buddhist meditation, but other things will be very different.

58:42.000 --> 58:51.000
Doesn't make a difference. I don't know. I mean, it's more, I don't know, and I think it's important.

58:51.000 --> 59:01.000
I think sometimes the way the researchers portray a lot of the meditation research, there's a little bit of a holier-than-thownness with it.

59:01.000 --> 59:10.000
And like, oh, and we meditated, and we're better than you. And I'd really try to avoid that. Because I think it backfires, right?

59:10.000 --> 59:15.000
There is this huge anti-meditation movement now. There's anti-mon... Yeah, there's a lot of backlash.

59:15.000 --> 59:24.000
And I often get this question. What about prayer? What about touchy? What about other forms of meditation?

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
Because there is sometimes this sense of, oh, mindfulness changes the brain and it's only mindfulness and it's better than everything else.

59:30.000 --> 59:38.000
And I really try to convey to people that that's not the case. Like, this is what we're studying, so this is what we know about.

59:38.000 --> 59:51.000
But it's not better. It's not... I mean, it's just different, but it's not necessarily better than other types of prayer or other mind-buddy therapies like Tai Chi or yoga.

59:51.000 --> 59:57.000
And that each is going to have certain benefits and they're going to have things that are common, things that are unique.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000
But I think at the end of the day, they all have similarities of spiritual transformation and feeling whole, feeling one, these sorts of things.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And so I think that's... That's what's beneficial. And so I think... So for me, it's not trying to say, oh, meditation changes the brain.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's, oh, how does meditation change the brain so we can understand how meditation works?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So I think that's a slightly different goal in the research. It's not trying to say, oh, yeah, we're better because we changed the brain.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
What can we learn from this?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I wonder what would happen if you called it something different.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What do you mean?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Well, I mean, as an analyst, one of those days...

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Well, exactly.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
What's your reputation?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Repidation, yeah.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Right. I mean, you know, the question for me often is what's the fantasy about what this is going to bring you?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Right.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
What's the interest in that particular form or the thing you've heard about it?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Right.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That's a level that a lot of people relate to it on.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Right.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So, yeah, what if you said we're going to practice trepidation? I love that.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Well, that's an interesting question, you know? And because there's this whole idea of intention matters.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And actually, that's a huge thing right now. Even just within mindfulness, like, you know, if you go and you meditate for the purpose of reducing stress,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
if you meditate with the aspiration of inteding enlightenment, is the same thing that can happen to your brain?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Even though you may be focused on your breath, is it different?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Probably yes.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And as an analyst, we have to put all of that into question because you have to wonder what's the role of the unconscious?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Oh, yeah.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I mean, right? I mean, the neurological studies show that most decisions are made below the level of consciousness.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
So, I'm not sure intention matters.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Attention or intention?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Intention.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Oh.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You guess it does.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Well, but again, so begin, this is why meditation takes, you know, 30 years to, or more to attain a light.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I mean, usually, right? You could run an entire lifetime. But I mean, it's some, I don't know.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Well, I just, what I'm drawn to is the mythology around Buddhism. And who knows? We know that something interesting happened 2,600 years ago.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Maybe it was a person. But, you know, the mythology story that I like so much is that he was, you know, there was this guy.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Maybe it was a guy. Maybe it was a woman.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Probably was a woman, you know. And, you know, and there was a person there who was very secluded, right?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And trapped in their own little story that somebody else gave them, like most of us.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And then he goes outside of that story and encounters a sick body, a very frail elderly body, and a dead body.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And to me, that inspiration of like, oh shit.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
This is what's going to happen.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
This is what's inevitable. And then what?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And so to me, the motivation is, I always have very deeply resonated with that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So how, if your actions are your only belongings, how are you going to function?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And if we don't really face our vulnerability and frailty, what are we going to do?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
So, and it's easy to say. But hard to do.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yeah, related to the intervention.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yeah, related to the intention and the motivation, I think.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
We certainly have a consciousness. Yeah, we are weak right now.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
We also certainly have unconscious processing.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's for sure.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
In meditation world, even though you change the name, because the name certainly has a meaning,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000
because name is kind of suggestion.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Right? I have a Chinese name called the Yiwang. Yiwang means one source.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It's Chinese name. But people give me another English name, call me Mike.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Right? But I have too many close colleagues. They call Mike. So we get confused.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So you call me Yiwang, call me Mike. I'm the same person.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
It doesn't matter with the label, right?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But regarding the intention, I give a private study.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
A private study to share with you. Yeah.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So you know the smoking quitting is very hard.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Over 90% of smokers try very hard every year to quit smoking, but they failed.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
They have a strong intention, because therapy said, unless you have a strong intention,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
then you can succeed. Why this smoker has a strong intention over 90% fail?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Certainly there is some underlying reason related to the unconscious change,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the habit, lots of things. So we have a study, very simple study.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So we recruit a subject from campus, campus smoker.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
We never told them, we are going to help you quit smoking. No.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So we ask them, are you interested in improving attention?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
They say, yes. Are you interested in stress reduction?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000
They say, yes. So they come here. So we deliver the meditation, compare to relaxation training.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So before study, we compare a smoker, non-smoker, their brain.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Then we find that the smoker has a deficit in the self-control center in the brain here.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It makes sense. Lots of study shows. Behavior level, they have a 20-secret per day,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
all this stuff. So we deliver the training, nobody really knows the goal.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It's attention, right? Stress reduction, no quit smoking.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000
So after 10 sessions, 30 minutes per session, within two weeks, we scan the brain again.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Then we find their center, self-control center, the deficit change, the improved activity,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
the more control. Then we look at their behavior, even quit smoking.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So before, after we have a self-report study, we report screen everything,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:29.000
every day how you smoke one. So most of the smokers said, before 20-secret, after 20-secret, 20,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
so we are confused because we have a machine.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
The machine can measure their air in their lungs when they smoke, how they smoke, how many smoke.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So it's objective. So objective show, not 20-secret, only 10-secret,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
but a wide smoker always reports 20. It's a habitual response.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.000
So we show them this data from the machine. Can you check your pocket right now?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So they check, they say, oh my God, usually I should nothing call 20, but right now I got a 10 left.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:15.000
It means I only smoke 10-secret per day. So the smoker will not aware the behavior change.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So their study indicating smoker has self-awareness deficit.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
This why, they just have a habitual response, every day response.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So we also find over 60% smoking reduction, 30% smoker quitting without the intention to quit smoke purposely.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:47.000
So this study. So in conclusion, we have ongoing study, it means

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000
when you want to change the habit, we always think of the habit bad, I want to kill this habit.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So you actually put lots of attention. You emphasize.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But right now, we don't talk about a bad habit. We create a new pathway.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yeah, you build a new habit. You build something, then the habit is strong, strong, strong, then the old habit disappear.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Just like a river, go that way, I never stop the river, but I get another path so stronger.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:28.000
So seeing an unconscious mind and conscious change make a lot of things, but we are not aware.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Just idea. But I have a data.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:46.000
There is a lot of talk of mindfulness. Over the last two years, I hear it constantly.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And people who seem to practice it, I don't know exactly what it is.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000
But people talk to me about it, and they all seem to feel very positive about it.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And they feel it changes their way of looking at their life, at the world and so on.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So is this something we should be teaching children at kindergarten level

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
in order that they have a different view of the world as they grow up?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Do you know what hovering attention is?

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Oh, they can't do it. But you said you did it when you were six.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
No, no, no, no. Definitely kids can do it. Hovering attention, right?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
What attention? Hovering attention. Yes. That's mindfulness.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Right? So that's something that I told therapists know about, right?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Because it's ideas that when you're in a therapy session, right?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
That you're aware of what the person is saying, which are also aware of your own reaction to what they're saying.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And you sort of use the meta-awareness, right?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
The awareness of your awareness, awareness of what's going on. That's the mindfulness.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But my patients who are in analysis, they don't live after 50 minutes and think, boy, this was so fantastic.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
It changed my view of the world and the sky is bluer.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
In fact, sometimes the opposite is the case.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000
That's okay, right? Because that's what he was trying to say is that with meditation,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
it's not always, again, then this is where the intention comes in.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Because during the therapy session, you're focused on the other person. You're not necessarily focused on,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
you know, that what you would focus on with you were meditating.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And it is because it's also the non-judging. So there's the awareness, the hovering attention,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
but there's also the non-judging and working with what comes up in a very specific way.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So the mindfulness is both together.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
How would you relate Ellen Langer's view of mindfulness to this?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Very different.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Right, so the mindfulness word is tricky one.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Definitely.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I love her view and her work. It's totally different.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Right, and even, so there's John Kepitzen's definition, which is paying attention in the present moment

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
in a specific way, non-judgmentally, because even there's a ton...

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
It's a lot of words.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah, there's...

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
There's even that's controversial. Not even everyone agrees with that definition.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But that's one that most...

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
You know, is probably closest kind of sort of to what people are talking about.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
But it's sort of...

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
It's present moment and awareness of...

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I love it, but the sensory experience too, as opposed to...

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But it's also based on an early text.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.000
It all comes from a very early text, which is, you know, mindfulness is an aspect of the meditative path.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And, you know, it's also in the Sati Patana Suta, where that it comes from,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
is like a deep exploration of your decaying body too.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So I hope...

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And other things, yeah.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
No, but it's a pretty substantive part of it.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And I just...

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I like to advocate for that.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
When we talk about mindfulness, it's like to think about, you know, that you're going to die.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And actually, it really encourages you to...

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So when I think it gives a little fire to the whole idea of mindfulness,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
because I know many people come to our center, like,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I'm ready to get my Zenon, a little mindfulness on, and, you know...

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
And I'm like, okay, well, you know, let's look at this, you know?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And so I think in some ways the reality of our own death is also part of what makes you...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
You could say things become very vivid, or what you were talking about, or, you know...

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000
My Zumi Roshi, who's the founder of our lineage, is, you know, why he talked about the only thing that makes sense,

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
is to truly appreciate your life, because to be mindful is actually to realize we have just a short time.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And so in realize we have a short time, it's like, oh, right.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
All right, let's sit up here, you know, and pay attention.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
So I think also mindfulness has to have that component.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Just telling somebody to be aware of your mortality constantly.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
That's a stoner.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.000
That's not a bad way to go.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
But it's not that easy to be aware of one's mortality all the time,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
where other things are constantly happening.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
You'll have to sit in a room and just keep saying, I'm mortal, I'm mortal.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
How do you...

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
No, I'm in...

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
That's what they call the practice.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.000
How do you achieve a state where you are without really giving it a lot of effort,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000
that you are aware of your mortality constantly, when our general intention in life is to live.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Everything is about living the cells of our bodies, or living.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
We are living, we are looking to the future, we are looking to the evening.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Whatever we are looking forward to, it's all about living.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Not about the future, though.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
It's about the right now.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
That's the difference.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Like, right now.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Like, what if I told you, I knew, Bionna Shawad Dao,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
that video is going to crash down in 15 seconds and then wipe us all out.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Right? What would you do these last 15 seconds?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Right?

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
So that's the thing, the idea.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
The meditation is that...

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
One in 15 seconds is not enough time to do anything, but...

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Well...

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
And also, isn't the present moment basically a mythology?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Who is claiming truths around here?

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Yeah, not me.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I will say, I give example.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I appreciate your views.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Give example, let's test.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
So if everybody here...

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Is this going to change our views?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Yes.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
If everybody here...

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So you don't appreciate them that much.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
We can leave 100 years here.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Right now, we can leave 100 years.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Let's see.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Maybe not.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Right? Let's suppose we can leave 100 years from now.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
So 100 years means 36500 days.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Right?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
More or less.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
So now you calculate how old are you right now?

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
So you say, oh, I only have 10,000 days.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
So you calculate same truths, but you calculate differently.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Now you realize, you realize life is short.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Life is short.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You need to give yourself some time.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
At least the moment that you think, why, how, what I should do in a short life.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
We always suppose it's a long time I'm going to die.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
We never think.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
But you calculate the days.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
No more left.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
This is why we need to do important things in your life.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Right?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You do important things in your life.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Actually, you take responsibility for yourself.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
You help your family.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
You help society.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
American code is land with freedom.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Everybody wants freedom.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
In undergrad dorm, everybody in the mean night at 2 a.m.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
They still know this.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's my freedom.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
It's my right.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
They never consider others.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
So this country needs responsibility.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You think yourself take your responsibility.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Then without the meditation, you can still do good things.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I think this important doesn't matter.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You call it a mindful meditation, yoga, whatever you call.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But in the essence, the spirit remains the same.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
The reality is still there.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Life is short.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Too important and good indeed.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think this is important.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:49.000
You know, a lot of discussion underscores reflective capacities.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And I'm curious as to whether there's any research that looks at what the

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:08.000
meditative capacities or the abilities of people, let's say, what is this ever taught to people with mental retardation?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Are there certain cognitive and or other capacities of the mind that are required in order to practice these kinds of skills?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.000
And the same, you know, because Ed's question was getting at children, right?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You know, what cognitive and emotional capacities have come online that can make something like this possible?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Or is it not?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
No, definitely.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And there's several initiatives right now to bring it into schools.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
And so definitely it's being taught to kids.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Back in the day of the Buddha, they were supposedly seven-year-olds, you know, enlightened beings running around.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And they were, you know, and there's also some stories of, you know, of very mentally challenged people learning notation.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
And then you'd have them sweep.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
You know, just be mindful of sweeping.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
How do you understand those stories?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Well, they're stories, right?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So, but, well, yeah, I mean, so you have to take them with a grain of salt, obviously.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000
But I think the idea being that you don't have to be, you know, a genius to do it.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Because I'm curious what you meant by the present moment is a myth.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But because that's the idea with Buddhism, right?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Is that all you have is the present moment.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Everything else is a myth.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
The only thing that really truly exists is the present moment.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
It seems like a lot of rhetoric.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It seems like a lot of rhetoric.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Well, how is the present moment a myth?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I'm curious about that one.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I've never seen anyone operate without a reference to a sense of self, which is a historical thing,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
or to at least short-term past and future to people they know, which is embedded in memory.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So how does that make this present moment a myth?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Because there's no such thing that we could talk about as a present moment,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000
except as a device within a traditional structure to get someone to do something.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000
I don't think I've followed that.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I don't know if I've understood this, but I mean, the way of, of course,

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
of defining the present moment is that it's a moment between the past and the future.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.000
So in this sense, it's also nothing that can be found independently.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
So I don't know if this is what you're...

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I find that there are people that need to, for their own good, not according to my evaluation,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
think more about the future.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Yeah, but my understanding is that the emphasis on the present moment,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
being here and now and all kinds of metaphors in a way,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:51.000
it is to make people aware of how much of their time they spent ruminating,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
engaging with the past, engaging what is happening with what might happen in the future,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.000
rather than experiencing themselves in the situation, and for this,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
and this kind of metaphor of a present moment is used.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So be here, right, and all, but then if you look deeper, then where's this present moment?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I see it more like the pendulum often in our experience is so far either in the past or in the future,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
so that actually is also the relationship that happens or can happen in a certain situation,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000
doesn't happen because our mind is somewhere spinning in other realms.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And for this, then you say, okay, bring the pendulum a bit more towards what is happening right now.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And then if you say, right now, then you can't find it right now.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Right, and I think experientially or in a relationship, you can find that and you can experience it.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So you just think that the way that it's used is very different in the rhetoric of the religions we're talking about.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Well, but actually I think it's sort of interesting what you just said because the whole point is to be in the present moment,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:12.000
to lose that sense of self though. Like you said, if the present moment is a myth because you're always thinking about the past and the future, so...

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
You don't think us to express your true self?

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
To be in the present moment?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Isn't that to express your true self? Right, which is not your history or your future.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Why not?

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Well, that's the point, right? That's what they're saying, that if you get into that moment that it is not future or so,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000
that's past or future that is something different.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
No, we're talking about what other people say though.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Well, no, well, okay, I think I've had very brief moments of it, you know, and it is, it's different.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
You know, it's just like a pure awareness.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I think the present moment, just present moment, doesn't need to lots of discussion argument because from the theory you'll never understand the moment.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
It's just a moment.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah, you sit down on a chair, then you feel your body touch there, it's a moment.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
But many times we're not aware.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.000
So, but just you cannot meditate for 10 minutes, 5 minutes, but you can meditate momentally.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
That's it.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Right? In their moment, let's see, you forget past, put aside the future, their moment, so what's your mind?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
What's your body? What's your emotion?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
No thinking, just, I'm there, I'm here.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So you feel more space, more relaxed.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Right? But if you think now, thinking moment, you're still not in the moment.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I think it's based on experiential, experience feeling, this definition beyond the concept.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:05.000
So I think in Western world, when I move here, I realize, yeah, the Western world love language, love concept, then action.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
In Eastern world, they experience first, then they conceptualize later.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I think we can learn from each other.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So maybe, it's better. We label it's better.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yeah.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Okay, I think we can go to the questions from the floor.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:37.000
People could line up and please state your name and please make your comments brief in the form of question.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So, I guess the fun part.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Good answers.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Hi, my name is Nomi, I work in a library and I see what people choose to read.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And there is definitely an additive specificity to all the great traditions that we are discussing here.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Being mindful can also happen to a soldier, to somebody who is out there killing for the group that he or she belongs with.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So there is a suggestion that, you know, can mindful really evolve consciousness from eco-centric to ethnocentric to world-centric to cosmo-centric.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:13.000
If people remain stuck with the group, they were raised in or the narrative that they consider are more sacred,

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:20.000
or they have been, have they made a difference for the last so many centuries that all these great narratives have existed,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
have they created evolved human beings who are more world-conscious, more sentient, you know,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
are there non-meat eaters among Jews and Christians and Muslims because that's not part of their narrative,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
but it is part of Hindu and Buddhist narratives.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Thank you.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
So, okay.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Question for Peter.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I mentioned the question was the response.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I got a last about a long description.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
So, what's the actual question?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Did you reframe the...

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
All these great narratives have existed for a very long time.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Has it evolved humanity?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
We're spending more than two trillion on weapons to kill part of human beings from all these great traditions.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Has it evolved humanity?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Because there is definitely, religion is a very powerful force and meditation is an integral part of all great religions,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000
but is it making a difference to an individual in terms of becoming more world-conscious, becoming more sentient

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000
in terms of the way we live everyday life?

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Well, enough one, yes.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Certainly for me, it made a huge difference.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And also, you said, you know, the soldiers being mindful.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
So, again, this gets a little bit into different traditions, but at least in some of the traditions,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
the idea that one aspect of mindfulness is compassion.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So, they would say that a sniper cannot be mindful.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
They can be aware of the present moment, but they're not actually being mindful because they're having the intention to kill rather than

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
the intention to help.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But that's a limited definition of a sniper, I would say.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.000
In some situations, I would really hope there is a sniper.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Absolutely.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And it can be the most compassionate action to act as a sniper.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's not, I think, it's not the standard situation, but if we go to the extreme to condemn people who decide to put their life

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000
on the line to protect others, I'm not so comfortable with this idea, to be honest.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:27.000
So, in probably 99% of situations are 99.9%, so I agree, yeah.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
But there are other situations.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I think that comes into intention, though.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So, I guess if it's a compassionate person you're protecting versus the hatred of the person you're killing.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Yes, but you can be a very compassionate sniper, at least in theory, I think.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I don't know.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I don't know how it is practiced because I'm not in the army.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I mean, Steven Pinker, if we, you know, I don't know where the evidence is exactly, Steven Pinker thinks that there's less killing per capita now

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
than there has been in all of human history.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
So, you know, so that's a possible answer.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I don't think I have an answer.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
You have an answer.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Yeah, I'm deeply concerned about the world.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I feel like the world, the natural, as we know it, world is in deep trouble.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And I think that there's not a lot of meditative mind.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:22.000
If you open the paper in politics, there's so much polarization.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000
There's so much focus on what, you know, the transactional approaches to things.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
What am I going to get?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And I'm deeply concerned about those things.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I don't have the answer, but I'm concerned about it.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000
I can say that.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Me too.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Again, a question for Peter about the teacher whose brain imaging was clear to everyone that there was a differential between

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
arresting state and his imaging.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And also, of course, the students.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
What was the nature of that, of the activity image?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
For example, was it more of a pan-cortical activity?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Was there more synchrony between different brain areas that was persistent over time?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
No, it actually was across the whole range of parameters.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:27.000
If you want, including increased oscillary activities in the, almost in the whole frequency range that we usually look at

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:35.000
from very low frequencies up to, well, in this case, we looked up to 128 hertz.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
So across the whole spectrum.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And also, I'm seeing it was a few years ago.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Yeah, and this was actually also when evident in different meditative conditions.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Was there any, I don't have to get the name of the brain structure right now, forgive me.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:02.000
But there's something unique in the human prefrontal cortex, it's bilateral, that is, there's a recent paper about this,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:11.000
about six months ago, that is dedicated to projecting multiple potential futures

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:21.000
and enabling simultaneous evaluation, probabilistically of which is best to engage, best to follow.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And if I could remember that it would be easier, but remember the name of it,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I would submit possibly that that was actually lower activation,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.000
because that person would not be so engaged in planning either on a very basic level

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
or on a very conscious level, and it's just a speculation.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So it's a little more complex than that.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Okay.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Because what happens is so, yes, some area may get turned off during meditation,

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
but what's really clear is that the wiring is actually changing, and so,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and how that area may be wired to other areas is changing.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.000
And so, because it is the case that, you know, when you're not in meditation,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
you may need to be thinking about your future, and you may need to be planning, you know,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and seeing your three different possible futures or whatnot.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000
But when you do that activity, your brain's going to be wired a different way,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and so you're going to think about those three options a different way.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Okay, thanks.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And just to comment that if anyone wants to respond,

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
but I was thinking that the problem with the,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
the now doesn't exist, and the now is the only thing that exists,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
is that they're in different contexts.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
The former is really from physics, right, because time is continually flowing in a unit.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Well, there are some exceptions on the quantum level time reversal, but aside from that,

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
that it is the case that it's flowing from future to present,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.000
that moment is just a transitory entity, if you will, a passage,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
not a thing in and of itself, but from the awareness of the process of being a

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
temporarily aware individual, it is only the present moment.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
That's how I see it. Thank you.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Related to the question of biases that came up briefly,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:21.000
there's a major problem in many areas of psychology these days about reproducibility of results.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Journal's only one of published positive results.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:30.000
There's really no incentive for people to reproduce other experiments,

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
and I'm just wondering how this area of research is dealing with these problems.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That paper was debunked.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
No, it wasn't debunked.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh, yes it was.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Was that? No, there's a paper that just came out.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I know about that. I know about that.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
They couldn't reproduce their findings, and they found all sorts of problems with their signs.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It wasn't as bad as they did, but it's still a major problem.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Not as bad as they thought though.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Not as bad, but it's a problem.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Because the original paper said that only 30% of the science could be reproduced,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
but in truth it's closer to 80 or 90% that could be reproduced.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000
That's what they found.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
When they actually went in, and that's the thing, they said that the people who did the original study

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
used really poor methods, both in how they reproduced the study and tried to reproduce the studies

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
and in the math that they used.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000
For instance, one of the studies they did, the original study was done in the US with,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I forget, what age, and then the reproduction study was done in Europe with a completely different population.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000
They didn't reproduce it, but it was like, okay, well you didn't reproduce the conditions.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
We were even close to reproducing the conditions.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
So what do you do in Europe, and how do you reproduce it accurately?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Right, so we are doing reproduc- so good science usually what you do is you do a study,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
and then the next study you reproduce it, but you add something extra to it.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
So that's what we're doing.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
So our first study was we showed there were changes pre-post eight weeks of practice, right?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But that's all we did was show change in brain structure.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000
So now we're doing a study, you know, we're doing that, but then we're also adding additional measures

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
so that we will be able to hopefully reproduce what we did, but then we'll also be able to add on to it.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And I think a lot of scientists do do that, where there is replication inherent in the study

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000
because in order to build on it, I have to reproduce it to then do the next steps with it.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Yeah, and the other people said we produce your results, and you reproduce other people's results?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yes, definitely.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I mean, definitely, I mean, I think I've done some stuff that he's done, and there's definitely...

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:28.000
So that's the thing, I think that it was a very sensational paper, that original one, and it's got a lot of attention.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But in fact, I don't think the situation is anywhere near as bad as people are trying to make it out to be.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
There is a ton of reproducibility in science, and there's a ton of me too science.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So a lot of the stuff really does get reproduced.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:48.000
But we still think that, I mean, now if we apply this question of how much is reproduced with, let's say, within meditation research,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I think most of the results we have, they are still on quite shaky feet, I would say.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:03.000
We see some convergence, but most of it, for my taste, it's not sufficiently replicated,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and the evidence is not sufficiently strong, that we can really stand there and say this is exactly how it is.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
And I mean, even if this particular paper and so on, one can question it,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:24.000
I think it is, for me at least, it's a general concern of how the science economy functions.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:35.000
That's actually, I'm rewarded in my career if I do something sexy, and I'm not rewarded in my career if I do something really solid.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And I think it's a real concern. It's rather rushed to do something new to get into this particular journal

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
that only publishes it if it's completely new or you have very good connections.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And things like this, which is a real problem.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:00.000
And if now another problem I see, for instance, in this field of meditation research, there's so much attention,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
and meanwhile also money, funding going into particular programs.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And the most popular ones are mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
particularly in the UK, that actually this is where all the resources are sucked into.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
This is where all the people are trained in. This is where the whole attention is on.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And this means that at the same time, alternative approaches don't actually even have the chance to demonstrate

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
the very effectiveness and so on.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000
So actually what I think what we're seeing to a large extent in this field is a narrowing instead of widening.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And hopefully it's just a short term narrowing, then later on it gets wider. But I don't know.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:57.000
So actually, although I know there's a lot of discussion about this particular point, I think what they emphasize,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:06.000
something that's true for meditation research, I think, and that's also true for other areas, not only psychology.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:14.000
And I think most of the models in physics have never been replicated because there's no research to do,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.000
and they're just theoretical models anyway. So that's another question maybe.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
So the strength of the evidence, I think we have to be really careful.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.000
I totally agree with that. And my question about bias was, I like that counter question, but it was sort of philosophical

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:43.000
in the sense that I've never seen research go very far that contradicted the personal opinions of the researcher.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Right, I were to put it the other way around. Everyone that enters a given meditation tradition

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000
that has a good relationship with the people in it proved to themselves that that tradition is correct.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000
In other words, they get the results that they were looking for.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Well, I know, but that's...

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Then it just...

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Hi, my name is Jesse. First of all, thank you for all sharing your insights. I really enjoyed the discussion.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:24.000
My question is... I guess I'll start with... I've studied a lot of Buddhist teachings and various teachings

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
regarding that. A lot of meditation in them.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.000
And one thing that I've always came across is sometimes a lot of the teachings,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.000
either Russian way of parts of human being a human, or are they contradict themselves?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And one example is relationships. So the notion about attachment, whether the huge thing between Buddhism,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:57.000
or particular about being attached. But then there's also mindfulness jargon about mindfulness and relationships

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
and not being attached in romance relationships.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
I'm like, what the hell does that even mean? It's not there to have a attached or romance relationship.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
It doesn't make a country, so...

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000
So I guess my question is...

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
It doesn't just keep our avoiding the big elements in the room.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I was going to talk to him when we were talking about mindfulness and the fact that we are in perfect means

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000
and actually... I don't even know if I'm going to say it perfect, because sometimes I suggest this notion that

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
as we were talking earlier, this whole year than now, whole year than...

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
It's a whole year than now notion of being kind of guru that is above me.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Based desires like sexuality and the desire to really connect with people and be angry when in reality it's like...

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000
You know, if lust and anger and all of these other things that we...

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:06.000
that seems like so many times I hear put down are very real and feel them...

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
How do you address that?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Ah, huh.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
What a wonderful thing to explore.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
At least for a lifetime, I think.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I mean, I don't know how many answers, certainly, but I...

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I'm not even interested lately in answers about it, but...

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I think that one of the things that's a common misunderstanding is that there's this idea of non-attachment,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:43.000
which is really what it means, the original meaning in a clay show was that it's about not clinging,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000
which is very different from feeling an attachment.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:56.000
But when I know when I want to cling to something, it doesn't feel great.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Whether it's a person or a state of mind or some outer reality, wow, it feels shitty.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And also, when someone is being clinging towards me, it doesn't feel good.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And so, to me, it's about just, you know, one of my favorite Zen teachers, Uchi Amaroshi,

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:29.000
just talked about maybe the whole practice is learning how to open our hand.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000
You know, so in some ways about just noticing the moments when we're like this and learning how to open our hand.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:44.000
So it's we're not clinging to something. It doesn't mean you're not feeling a connection or love or desire

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
or anything, but it's not like mine, mine or yours, yours.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I don't know.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:01.000
So, another, because that's similar, for me, I think it's important, what was for me was understanding that

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:07.000
a lot of the teachings in the time of the Buddha were aimed at monks, you know, people who are not lay people

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
and he had very different teachings for lay people than he did for the monks.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And so the whole thing of, you know, extinguishing the fire is a lust and greed and hatred, that's for the monks.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You know, he doesn't expect the, you know, householders to be able to do that, because, I mean, you really, you need 30 years on a cave to do that.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So, but I think it's something to, you know, decrease those.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
And I think, by the way, he's talking of like, you know, not being so tightly attached.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
So it's not eliminating, it's reducing.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Thank you. Thank you.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Hi.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I like that somebody had said everything is natural.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And so my question is on anxiety disorders and kind of the unbalanced mind.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I had a panic attack, which I never had before.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:06.000
A few months ago, back in November, and kind of found myself stuck in a kind of fear of fear kind of place.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And I downloaded this app called Headspace, which is like guided meditation.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And that has really helped me find a balance of mind again and return to normalcy.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:28.000
And, but there was a push when I first went to the doctors for going for medication and stuff.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:34.000
And since there's like a history of depression and stuff in my family, they were leaning towards medication.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And I found that I didn't want to go that route because I've seen the effects of medication that I've had on members of my family.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So my curiosity is if there is any data that you guys have or thoughts that kind of reflect that kind of similarities or differences in the changes of the wiring of the brain or the functioning of the mind between medication and meditation.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
There are studies.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I mean, okay, I'm first not talking about the neuroscience, but more on the clinical data.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I would say before I mentioned actually the data is not very robust.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The one area that has whether data are most robust is actually the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for treating people with recurrent depression.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:34.000
This is the best established evidence in the whole area and there the evidence shows that it is as effective as medication.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:42.000
So and the basic what it actually means, I think you can choose between meditation and medication.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:44:02.000
So that's and then at least in the UK for now there's a big discussion with depression being such a huge problem in society how to generate the provision for this.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:11.000
So how to make sure that actually there are enough people who can offer mindfulness-based cognitive therapy because it's not something you can just pick up like this

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:14.000
to a weekend course and then you're there.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:21.000
But so from the clinical research, I would say this is the best established evidence that we have so far.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
So and maybe you want to say something from the neuroscience.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:34.000
So if you decide to go for the meditation or medication or physical exercise, actually it's your choice.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Yeah, for sure different medication may work on your brain on your body in a different way.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
They target different system.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000
They target certain system that also you influence the other system.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Let's see you use the term called balance.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Refer to your question balance.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Yeah, so you know if a person has a depression problem so the doctor tend to give the stimulants try to change.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:11.000
If more anxiety, more anxious tend to use the depressant, this kind of medication try to balance.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Right, then you will see how brain response, how physical response.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
If you overdose it or run dosage, go to another extreme.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000
So you go to the meditation or swimming or working or other.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
It's a natural way.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.000
But meditation is helpful but doesn't mean to feed everybody.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Nothing can feed everybody.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:42.000
So it's your choice but you need to study but the most so engaged in the concept data.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
There are so many things.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
You ask your good friend.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
You ask your family member. You ask people who love you.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Give you an idea.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Maybe much better.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.000
And it sounds like you found a good one.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Appreciate it.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
So my question has to do with belief.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I feel like in society especially western culture, I can't speak about eastern culture, I haven't experienced it.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
But the western culture, there is an absence of belief and faith in society.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
There's a decline of religion or at least classical forms of religion.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:33.000
And more interest in mindfulness or meditation, these different types of self-sustaining understandings.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So what my question really is, what is the importance of belief?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And I don't mean in the sense of like, yes, of course if you believe in something and you do it,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
then you are likely to obtain what you've set up to do.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.000
But in the actual meditative state, I mean, do you have to, we talked about being, right?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So, I mean is there a belief of being or is there an absence of belief?

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I'm a little confused in that regard and I just want to understand the belief relevance to the meditative state.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I got a point.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Actually, the being or doing or whatever other term is not the thought of process.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:22.000
It's action-based process.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Like if you're hungry, you got eating.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You feel thirsty, you drink, right?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:37.000
So I think Western mind wants to make everything precisely controlled.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Like we have exact language.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I'm going to visit London tomorrow.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I use I will then tomorrow.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Actually, it doesn't need will.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I go to London tomorrow.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Tomorrow everybody knows will, right?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:04.000
So we try to conceptualize everything in detail that we believe, okay, we can move from here.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But in reality, many, many things are beyond the concept.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
You learn language when you are a child.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
You just learn from implicit learning, right?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yeah, many, many things.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
We have two ways you can do explicit learning.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
So you want to find out the meaning, concept, reasoning, capacity.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Another part of implicit, most of God feeling.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:38.000
So when I train the people, I always encourage people to make decisions, to follow their own heart and feeling.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Sometimes you feel good.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You do it.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Not good.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I don't listen to others.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I follow my heart, my feeling.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Because most people are living in a small box.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:00.000
We are fixed train from previous experience, learning, school, education, parents, media.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.000
But we never think how we should do.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
But we only told what we should do.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
We never think why, how we can do.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
We can create differently.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
And in their part, you need your own thinking.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Confusion is a good step.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Confusion means you think in different ways, right?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
You think in different ways you compare, then you find a way.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:32.000
In this reality, actually, just based on your question, you don't need to worry, this is good, this is bad.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
This thing will help you.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Help others.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Know how others you can do.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
You learn from doing.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
This is the present moment.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I would just add, I appreciate what you are saying.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I know many people come to our center to learn how to meditate because they have a belief and faith that they are going to feel more peaceful and better.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
They are going to feel better.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And I usually try to raise the flag of like, it is not the place you want to come then.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Actually, it is not about that.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It is about being with whatever is arising.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:28.000
But if you are going for better or you have a belief in that you are going to feel better or peaceful or serene or whatever it is, you should go to somewhere else.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.000
So I think in some ways some of the beliefs I think sometimes get in the way of actual our experience.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Maybe going back to your point about just the path itself.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Yeah.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Thank you.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Hi, my question has to do with meditation and its effect on job performance.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Specifically, is there any study out there that has looked into how meditation has affected people's performance on the job and even looking at specific jobs such as ones that are high stress versus ones that are low stress,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:12.000
baseball player versus secretary, EMT professional versus lawyers, snipers versus carpenters?

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I don't know about that last part.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
There are definitely studies showing that impacts workplace.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
You might be interested in a book called Search Inside Yourself.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So out at Google there was a guy who was in charge of HR, started meditating, he realized this was really good.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:35.000
He tried to bring MBSR into Google. No one signed up, even though they are all stressed out.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:48.000
He realized, okay, well, so they called it mindfulness for interpersonal interaction or something like that because that's all the programmers really got something they were willing to know that they needed help with.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
So they all started to do mindfulness for that reason and of course they got the stress reduction benefits as well.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000
So there's also a book by George Mumford.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
He worked with a bunch of elite basketball players.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
There's several people who have worked with elite sports athletes bringing mindfulness to it and again it's been extremely beneficial.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
So George Berkeley and stuff like that have used mindfulness among other people.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:25.000
So definitely, so I don't know about every single solitary and is it better for this per-time person versus that per person but certainly even for high stress people for athletes, it's highly effective.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:35.000
There's also quite a few Wall Street bankers who admitted that the only way they could do what they do is because they're going to take.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Hi.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
I recently came across a few graphs.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I think it was of EEGs if I'm not mistaken.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:52.000
When the brain frequencies of the frontal mid and the hind are all at the same level, a certain magic happens.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:59.000
And I think I know for sure, trends in dental meditation and there are other methods out there that are lesser research.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'm wondering if anyone here has input on what exactly comes of that magic so to speak in the short and long term over someone's period of life.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Whether it accumulates, accelerates, exponential, anything having to do with just when all the brain frequencies throughout the brain are evenly balanced.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.000
You'll go first.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You'll go first.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I don't know about this.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I'm not sure about the magic to be honest.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Maybe we should not use the magic.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I think if we talk about the brain wave, we use EEG.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Peter has done lots of work using EEG on mindfulness meditation.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
We also have some study.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Our brain always sends the message through the electric wave based on the neurotransmitter.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
They always work.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
One person receives meditation.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
There are various meditation.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Many years ago, one kind of meditation can improve the pathway from the back of the brain that moves the front.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000
There are recent messages that also find the sit-away.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
The pathway is when you close your eyes, the pathway increases a little bit.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
When people age, the pathway decreases.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Sit-away means the result in the attention state, but they also relax.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
It's a little bit slow.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Some meditation study also found a gamma wave very fast.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I think this is just one index of brain activity.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Something happened in the brain.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Some people explain, you are more attentive.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
This is why after a wave was sit-away.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Some people said, the brain more synchronized.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
This is why gamma wave.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
It's just like we sleep every night, so you bring with change.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:19.000
The integration is that gamma or theta, or when there is the integrative effect, what wave would fit that description.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I think we are talking about...

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
It's not conclusion.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000
I think what you are talking about is the study that Ritchie did in Antoine many years ago, where they had the monks.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:36.000
When the monks go into their meditative state, they have what you are describing, which is a high-emblety gamma across the entire brain.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I don't know if they called it magic, though.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
They said that when the monks are meditating, that's what happens.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
You want to say something?

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Peter, you want to say something?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
What did I want to say?

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Sorry.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Something about the magic, I hope.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
About the magic?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
That's what we want to hear about.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I think I just wanted to add, because it was a question of synchronization for any oscillating activity, for any brainwaves to be picked up.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
This means that this is an indication that there is synchronization.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Otherwise, if every neuron was firing randomly on its own, we wouldn't pick up anything from the surface.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
It doesn't matter which frequency range we look at.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Whenever we see a clear oscillating activity, this means that there is a large...

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
The wave is a synchronization.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
This is an index that there is synchronization.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Then the general idea is if the higher frequency range is like gamma and so on,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:51.000
from 35 hertz upwards, that this is synchronization that happens more on the local level.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.000
It's more close in specific brain regions, more or less,

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:06.000
a closely related brain, a located brain region, and then the slower oscillations

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
that there are more related to long-range synchronization.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000
This gives a bit of an idea, but for anything meaningful to happen in the brain,

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
we need this synchronization.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
We need a lot of neurons doing the same thing at the same time.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
This then actually shows up as electrical activity on the brain,

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and one cannot draw conclusions from seeing that there is a wave.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000
What the content of the experience is, of course, we cannot see at all.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000
One cannot necessarily say that an increase is better than a decrease,

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000
or the decrease is better than an increase.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:57.000
We just see maybe some changes, and then we need to introspection,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:06.000
the subjective experience to actually link what we observe in brain activity,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
to link it, what actually might be happening.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Then we can get some understanding what these different signatures might mean.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
There we are still very much at the beginning.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Linking so-called third-person data to first-person data.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:27.000
There are some discussions how we can do this, and a few attempts are doing this,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:30.000
but it's still quite limited.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Can I just add this?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
I'm just thinking about your bias question, much earlier on.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Another way of looking at it is actually that we're using first-person data there.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Of course, you can see there's a bias, but actually, for studying meditation,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000
ideally the researcher has some idea what they're studying.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:02.000
In the same way that maybe somebody who studies sports has some idea what the sport is.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Just in some disciplines, people are more skeptical about biases than in other disciplines,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:16.000
because maybe it looks more subjective, because it's not so easy to observe it from outside.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Just at one point.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I think people tend to interpret certain neural markers of physiology index as good or bad.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
We turn to, because from our belief, experience.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Just like Peter said, the increase or decrease in the brainwave, certain things,

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
it cannot include, increase good, decrease bad.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
So decrease, just hormone, we think is good.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Yeah, increase brain activity seems good, but some study also show the increase in the

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.000
process of effort.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
You are not in relaxed state, not safe in the energy.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:04.000
So related to bias, so everybody has bias, including researcher, because everybody is in learning

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
journey for the whole life, we certainly have bias.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
We acknowledge.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Also science, it doesn't mean it's a guaranteed way.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
You can show the absolute truth.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
It's a relative truth.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.000
We just try to track the truth.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:27.000
We are on the way, in other conclusion yet.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Yeah.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Yeah.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Yeah.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Yeah.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Yeah.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Sarah, unfortunately, the future is now improving.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Sarah has to catch a train.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Thank you, Sarah.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Thank you.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
That's a pleasure.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Thank you.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Okay.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
You can, we are not stopping.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000
You can leave.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000
You can ask your question.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I come out of the extreme western edge of the eastern intuitive traditions.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And there's a formulation from Philip Capo, Capo Roshi, that unlike what you said, the

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Buddhist path depends on three pillars, one of them being faith in the record of transmission,

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
that there is something to be reached.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:41.320
It can't necessarily be accurately described in language, but that faith as a structuring

02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.720
in his view was imperative.

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:53.400
And I was sort of disappointed in his disciple or the son of one of his brother disciples,

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:57.400
not bringing that onto the floor.

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:08.160
In regard to the reworking of negative emotion, what Philip Capo Roshi also was very clear.

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:17.240
And I heard him in person advocate one hour of meditation a day to keep a practice going

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:23.520
in his mind that was sufficient and two hours to move forward.

02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.480
And once I started to practice that, I realized that it was like clockwork, that there would

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:33.000
be a shift of experience.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:42.120
And it would last the first shift in experience into a relaxation kind of thing, an a calmness.

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:49.040
Wouldn't really shift my experience the rest of the day, but what would happen at the second

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:57.400
and third increments were decisive in reworking my emotional life for the entire rest of the

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.720
day.

02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:07.240
And that's talked about in the western edge of these traditions in the Kabbalah as being

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:12.400
as each of us having levels of soul or five levels of soul.

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:19.400
And when you activate a higher level in that mapping, it's just a mapping, then the energies

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:25.080
are still there, but they reworked in a greater integration.

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:35.080
And okay, so now I wanted to ask the panel about something related to that teaching of

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:41.120
Philip Capo Roshi, who was really the first American Zen master.

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:48.920
In advocating an hour a day of meditation as a minimum for keeping a meditative practice

02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:58.600
going, what I hear around me for the last decade in the Buddhist world and also in the TM

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:02.640
world is 20 minutes a day we'll do you.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.000
And that's not my experience about something.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:13.320
It's neither what I heard from a master or in my experience it's not borne out.

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.240
So is that just marketing?

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:16.240
What is that about?

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.760
And what's the research about quantity and quality?

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.880
So good question actually.

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:32.480
You ask the quantity and quality of practice and what this quantity and quality can benefit,

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:36.040
can you influence the life, right?

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:37.320
Just my experience.

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:45.520
Yeah, when I started my training, when I was young, so it pushed me hard.

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.960
Similar to you, we do at least two hours per session, try to build the foundation of your

02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:54.120
physiology change.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.840
It's my experience.

02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:03.680
And later on, when you build this phase of the change, like very intensive training,

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.480
make something change, right?

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:14.480
This kind of change can transfer to the daily life, but you need to be aware.

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:22.040
So our study also shows the lens of training, lens of practice really matter.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:25.600
It means lasting effect can influence.

02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:29.600
Also the quality of practice is most important.

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:32.440
Like you sit an hour, but always man wandering.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.920
So the quality of practice maybe just five minutes, ten minutes.

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.080
It happened.

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.600
So in market, I think everybody's busy.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:47.360
When I moved to US, I was told New Yorker is a busy street, right?

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:52.320
Yeah, this is why American love the fast food, fast life.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:59.160
So certainly the person cannot practice an hour to hour per day, but they can do 20

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:01.840
minutes, 30 minutes.

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:09.280
Like I don't have a five star hotel room to leave, but I can leave a three star.

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:14.760
So I just, I think it's the flexible way, it's the compromising way, but if a person

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:23.080
really want to become a professional, whatever trainer, master practitioner, as I learned

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:29.880
from my teacher, my master, they practice over two hours per day, over.

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:35.360
And they enjoy, they not just a first time to do, I need to one hour to hour, no, they

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.360
enjoy.

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.400
You can't not do it once you start.

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:42.960
It's just the quality of life is just, it's something different entirely.

02:06:42.960 --> 02:06:47.280
It's the world to come, that's the way it's talked about in the Western tradition.

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:49.600
It's entering the world to come while you're here.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:54.000
Yes, I think you may have a different idea, right?

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.720
I've met many people who have meditated for decades, many, many long retreats and long

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.400
hours and are complete assholes.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:11.520
Well, because I've met myself, you know, but the quality versus the quantity thing is

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:12.520
important.

02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:17.360
On the one hand, on the other hand, I do think to get good at something, if we think of

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:21.160
it as a skill or a tool, it also takes practice.

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:23.840
So I think both of those things are true.

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:25.400
The faith question is a different question.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:32.640
But I think it's dangerous to think about if you just clock in enough hours, then you're

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:33.640
good.

02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:37.480
I think that's, I'm always worried about that.

02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:43.360
And so I think it's more about dedication and relationship.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:50.400
But the suffering of the quantum leap kicks in, that's better when you have, when you

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:55.440
see how long it takes, you can let it say.

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.800
There's nothing to argue with, it's just so exciting.

02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:06.440
These are the last two questions and please make them brief because we are over our time.

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:10.600
So this question is informed by two of the conversations that have been.

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:15.160
One of them was the conversation about intention when, I forget, I don't know, I don't remember

02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.040
the lady's name, but was talking about the importance of intention when you're meditating.

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:22.800
And then the other conversation was the one where, sorry, I clearly don't know anyone's

02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:28.280
name, but when you were talking about the Buddha, the Sangha, and the Dharma, and how

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:30.680
it's more than just meditation.

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:35.920
And that got me thinking because in theory, if I were like an evil person or like very

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:42.280
selfish, I could just do concentration meditation, get very good at concentrating, make myself

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:46.960
more effective at getting rich and powerful and harmful or whatever.

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:54.080
So if you look at meditation or how meditation is studied in labs, is it just extracted from

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:57.600
the greater picture that it is of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha?

02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:03.360
And is that a fair, are we short-changing the tradition from which it's steeped?

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.360
That's a good question.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.480
Well, I think when you take the Sangha out, you're short-changing the tradition.

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:16.400
You're actually leaving out like the third leg of a stool, which doesn't stand well.

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:26.720
And for me, when I don't have relationships with peers in a process, I get pretty in

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:28.320
my head.

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:36.440
And so I think to stay in relationship is so, for me, has been really essential for my

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.800
process and my path.

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:39.800
And it's not easy.

02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:41.600
I think it's a hard one.

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:47.960
But I think that I'd be so curious if that's ever even brought in as a variable for in research.

02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.960
Go ahead.

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:50.960
Yeah.

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:58.000
Of course, as when we're doing empiricules or scientific research, we somehow, we have

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:04.960
to kind of define and limit the conditions that we're working in.

02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:09.520
So the one question is, how are we investigating this?

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:15.920
And I think another question is, how is meditation practice applied in the world?

02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:23.040
And for some research, we try to isolate the meditation more so especially if we're directly

02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:30.560
interested in what are the, for instance, neural processes of what is going on.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:39.040
If the influences are so complex, including other people, then actually we might not see

02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:44.000
such pure signals if you want.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.920
So that's the one thing.

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:53.640
But as long as the research, the science is aware of it that we're kind of like we do

02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:58.440
in many other fields as well, that we isolate it to study it.

02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:02.320
But then that it's about putting it together again.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:03.320
And I think this is fine.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:13.120
If one then would take it to mean that meditation practice in isolation, on one's own, without

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:21.920
any framework, without intention, without just doing it as an isolated technique would

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:25.640
be the way, then I think we would make a mistake.

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:32.160
I think it's a great question and I would want to look at it both in its historical

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:38.520
context but also outside of it because those three words are specific to the Buddhist tradition.

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:44.200
So if you say, well, how is that going to be applicable to everyone?

02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:50.040
I translate it as something like the Buddha has to do, that orientation has to do with

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:52.880
the transparency of your own awareness to yourself.

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:57.000
In other words, a kind of a self-knowledge that maybe comes about through meditation

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.960
or maybe through something else.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:05.760
The Dharma is the law of the psyche or the law that you find that works in terms of the

02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.200
structure of how you are in the world.

02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:10.680
And Sanga is your community.

02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:13.240
So that might be two people, might be five people.

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.240
It doesn't have to be a religious community.

02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.960
It's, you know, we're all embedded in community.

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:22.480
So the question is how do we relate to each other, you know, dare I say in the here and

02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.480
now?

02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:25.480
Just to contradict myself.

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:26.480
Thank you.

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:32.160
I had one thing related to the individual group.

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:39.360
Yeah, research certainly wants to limit the factors, so want to get something then try

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.000
to add more.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.920
But in reality, my data shows.

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:54.400
So actually the tuner, the teacher also is an active ingredient in the meditation.

02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:59.840
Then the group setting, like community, we use the group relationship, the dynamic,

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:05.160
we also important in supporting some people, not everyone.

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:08.440
Some people prefer individual practice.

02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:11.720
Some people benefit more from the group session.

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:13.480
We find a bold situation.

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:14.480
Yeah.

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:20.280
So some people even said this culture more individualized culture than Eastern more

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.960
collective culture.

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.760
But I find the all difference.

02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:25.240
It depends on the person.

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:26.240
Yeah.

02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.520
I would agree.

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:37.360
I was hoping that some of you would have discussed the benefits of meditation.

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:44.680
In meditating, it helps me bring my awareness and my attention into a single moment, focusing

02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:46.680
on the breath.

02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:53.120
And I can, when I apply it to reading, to bring that same degree of concentration to

02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:58.720
reading, it not only speeds the rate at which it wouldn't raise, but it improves recollection

02:13:58.720 --> 02:14:01.640
and cognition.

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:09.960
Another thing is that meditation helps me find my own center.

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:16.400
It helps me focus on what other people are saying without my judging and without my thinking

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:20.160
about what I'm going to say in response.

02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.560
I've been hyperkinetic, from the time I was a child, I'm still my old age.

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:27.120
It's very difficult to sit still.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.640
But in meditation, I can find the stresses in the various places in my body.

02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:38.920
And I can focus on that and make peace with that and let it, you know, I can sit still

02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:42.920
in meditation where it's very difficult to do it at other times.

02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:50.120
And there were so many things that meditation really helps in dealing with my daily life

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:54.560
and I was hoping that, you know, this discussion would have included more of that.

02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:57.120
But nonetheless, thank you very much.

02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:58.120
Thank you.

02:14:58.120 --> 02:14:59.120
That's it.

02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:00.120
Thank you.

02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:01.120
Thank you.

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:02.120
Thank you.

02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:27.120
Thank you.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:34.120
Thank you.
