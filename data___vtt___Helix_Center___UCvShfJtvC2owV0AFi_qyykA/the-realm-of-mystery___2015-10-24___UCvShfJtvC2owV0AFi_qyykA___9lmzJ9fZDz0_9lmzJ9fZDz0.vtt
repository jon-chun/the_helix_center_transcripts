00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
She at one point wanted to be a physics major, but so the only complaint was that physics

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
in particular so much that if you don't decide to hear, some more year, it's almost hopeless

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
to major.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, we're going to get started.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Welcome everybody.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm Rob Penzer.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
I'm the Associate Director of the Helix Center.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome to today's round table, The Realm of Mystery, which is funded by a John Templeton

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Foundation grant.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Before I introduce today's participants, I have a few announcements.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
It also gives you the opportunity to use our discussion board and leave comments.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
We really want a lot of feedback from our audience.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
Following today's program, on Saturday, November 7th, we have Speak Memory with NYU neuroscientists

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
Then on December 4th, 5th, and 6th, a Freudian perspective on what ails the world today.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.000
This is a special colloquium of the helixcenter with the association as

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Dez Amid Passaj, Committee Freud.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
And please go to our website for more details.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.000
We have something like 18 and counting participants, an international roster,

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
which should be very exciting.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
So I'd like to introduce today's participants, and please refer to the handouts

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
or for those of you watching on the web to the event page to read more on our participants' biographies.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And please raise your hand when I introduce you.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
Mr. E author Megan Abbott, Philosophy Professor Cal Rovane,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Theoretical Astrophysics Professor Michael Turner,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Jewish Studies Professor Elliot Wilson,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and English Professor Susan Welfson.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
So now we'll begin.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
You want to start?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I'd be happy to start. Is everything okay?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yes?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Is everything okay?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes?

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Is it okay now?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes? Okay.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
So Ed said this would be a conversation, so I'm told not to be too didactic,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
so I'm not going to speak for too long, but just suggest a few things we could come back to

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
insofar as they provoke a little conversation, but I'm not sure what among the things I mentioned

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
will be most interesting to this very, very varied group in the inner circle

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
and I assume throughout the room. Right now in contemporary philosophy,

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
that was spooky.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
In philosophy, if you asked a working philosopher,

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
do you think you're confronted with any mysteries right now?

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
They would probably say, yeah, too, consciousness and freedom.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
But you probably shouldn't just dive into those topics,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
but rather ask them what they take a mystery to be.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
And the question, what are limits on human understanding

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
and how do we know about them?

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
It's been a very long-standing question for philosophers,

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
and I suppose Immanuel Kant is a very big pioneer in this enterprise of thinking about it.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
The old way, Kant's way, assumed that we know from the inside the nature of our own minds,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
because we can't think without knowing what it is to think,

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
and somehow from the inside knowing what you're doing is a thinking being,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
you could work your way to conclusions about the limits of what you're able to do that way.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
And he really thought he could do that, so that's topic number one.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
How could you just, from your armchair, know these things, which Kant thought?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
So pure thought.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Pure thought, yeah.

04:54.000 --> 05:02.000
But another model for thinking about these limits would come from a more naturalistic perspective,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
like the perspective of Noam Chomsky.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
And a lot of philosophers are very taken with a fairly scientific worldview,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
and that's why they regard consciousness and freedom in particular as mysteries,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
because they don't know how to integrate those things within their scientism.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
But Chomsky's view, I think, is really worth taking seriously, because it's very clear-headed.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Even if you don't agree with it, it's very clear how he gets to where he's going,

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
and he's not waving his hands.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
He suggests that cognitive abilities are basically biological abilities,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
and that it's in the very nature of a biological ability to be limited.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
So he thinks take a motor ability, like running.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
If you're built so that you can run, you're probably not built so that you can slither like a snake.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
You know, it's just one of those things.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
The things that enables you to do, it makes you suited to do those things in contrast with something else.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
And so his working assumption is that there's no reason to think cognitive abilities

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
are any different from motor abilities.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
And so if we have cognitive abilities, the tasks they suit us to do

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
will be the ones we can do, and in being suited to do those tasks,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
we will not be suited to carry out other tasks, which could still be called cognitive

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
and would deserve to be called cognitive.

06:18.000 --> 06:28.000
And so that picture really does give something besides armchair reflection,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
I like to stand on when you start talking about limits on human understanding.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
This is known as empirical hypothesis that we are limited beings.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
And then the question is, still, even if you have this scientific basis for thinking you're limited,

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
how could you know which of the things you're now thinking about

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
and can't understand, or ones you can't understand because you lack a good theory

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
as opposed to don't have the right cognitive structure.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
Right, so that would be the framework within which I would pursue these questions in conversation

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
and add in that Columbia, where I teach, is the home of pragmatism.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
And pragmatists always say never throw roadblocks in the path of inquiry.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
So their ideas, even if there are limitations, proceed as if it's not true.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
And there's a question about the merits of that attitude, which would be worth discussing.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
So I like the pragmatic approach, and I'll add the word arrogant,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
because the last thing you were saying is, I mean, cosmologists, I'm a cosmologist.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And cosmologists are extremely arrogant.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Why? Because we think we can understand the universe.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And that's kind of what you were saying, is it may well be that we can't understand the universe.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
But it is certainly true that if we think we can't understand the universe,

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
we will never understand it even if we could.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Right. Did that make sense?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Yes, it did. Yes.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
And our questions are a little more pragmatic.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
And they're more along the lines of a mystery.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
So there are mysteries that we know that we need to solve.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
So going with the known unknowns.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
What is dark matter? What is dark energy?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We don't need to really talk about them.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
But those are mysteries that we really know.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
Then there are the unknown mysteries.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
And I won't give any examples of them because we don't know them.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But dark energy would be one.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So that was a mystery that we didn't know.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
And it came upon us when we found that the universe, the expansion was speeding up.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
And then the last bucket also sort of aligns with what you were saying,

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
which is the mysteries that may be unknowable.

08:47.000 --> 08:57.000
And so one of the ones that's easy for me to articulate is the laws of physics.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
So I'm quite confident we will figure out the laws of physics.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm quite confident. I'm not telling you when.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
But I'm saying that we live in an ordered universe and we make observations and do experiments

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
and we'll figure out the laws of physics.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
But the one that may be unknowable is where did they come from?

09:17.000 --> 09:24.000
And I don't think there's any experiment that you could do,

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
or that I could even imagine, where you could differentiate them coming from God,

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
whatever that means, or that they came from a freshman physics experiment

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
of a very advanced civilization where all the students were asked,

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
right down a set of rules and make them go and see what happens

09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
and maybe we're the C plus universe.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And so there's a category, the other one that probably everyone has heard of

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
is the multiverse.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So the idea that the universe is disconnected pieces,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
and that gives people like me a headache because our brand,

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
the science brand, is falsifiability.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
And when you deviate from your brand, when you get into matters of faith,

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
well, I don't need to prove that there's a multiverse because I know it.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
So that's not our brand.

10:20.000 --> 10:25.000
But so here the multiverse is one of those possibly unknowables

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
that could be the biggest idea since Copernicus, right?

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
So not only is Harvard not the center of the universe, or even New York City,

10:35.000 --> 10:43.000
but there's many universes, but that might be an unknowable thing.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't think of yourself as Aragon, I think of yourself as the little engine that could.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, no, I don't know, is this working?

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
I think because I...

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Now it's working?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
What am I pulling closer to my mouth?

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
I'm pulling closer to my mouth.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
It's okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Is that better?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
So I know I was introduced to some of the Jewish studies,

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
which is a label that is difficult for me because while I did decide

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
to put my philosophical training to the study of, in particular,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism, it's also the case that I do, you know,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
comparative mysticism.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
And I think from my study, here's where I think there is a little bit of a difference

11:50.000 --> 12:02.000
between the approach of religious studies and both the philosophical and scientific viewpoints.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
And I want to loom that with a statement of Freud because of the building we're in,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
which is very often forgotten, and I actually wrote it down, if you don't mind,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I'm going to read Freud's It Got Words.

12:16.000 --> 12:24.000
Every dream has at least one place where it is unfathomable, the navel, as it were,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
by which it is connected to the unknown.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Now this is Freud.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
So there's no way that he understands by the unknown some appeal to a transcendent being.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Call it God as we do in the theistic traditions.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
So his unknown is not some entity which we could pursue through knowledge or through faith,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
but could never know.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
What he's really saying here, that there is some kind of knot, which is the navel.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
And the metaphor of the navel is kind of significant because it conveys the paradox of being bound

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
and unbound.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
So the dream is both connected to yet separate from the unconscious.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
And to me, this is where Freud is at his most mystical.

13:12.000 --> 13:20.000
I wouldn't necessarily say religious, but his most mystical, because what I found over and over again in the case of

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
mystics and different traditions is that the mystery of the secret is like a dream,

13:26.000 --> 13:35.000
in that it's positioned somewhere between conscious and unconscious, between concealment and disclosure.

13:35.000 --> 13:44.000
And to me, that's, I think, the greatest lesson I've learned about the sense of the mystery from the text that I study.

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
I think it's a slightly different model because it means, you know, it is a little bit arrogant

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
to think that somehow we'll ever be able to peel away all the veils.

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
And let me conclude by saying one other thing at this moment is that what I learned from the Sufi tradition,

14:05.000 --> 14:13.000
the Sufi tradition, the Islamic tradition, the task is to unveil, to pull away all the veils to see the face of truth.

14:13.000 --> 14:26.000
But when you read deeply into the Sufi masters, they've articulated over and over again that the greatest veil is to think that we can remove all veils.

14:26.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, speaking of arrogance, I'm the one who's supposed to be creating the mystery, which may be the most arrogant position of all.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
But it's interesting, we talked a little bit about this when we were getting ready, but if you look at the history of the genre,

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
which is not a very old genre, as far as genre goes, if you date it back to, you know, post detective novels or certainly Sherlock Holmes,

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
the original tradition was to create a puzzle box for the reader, where, ostensibly, the rules that post that out were, you couldn't cheat as a writer.

14:58.000 --> 15:05.000
There had to be a way that you could actually figure it out and that there would be a solution at the end.

15:05.000 --> 15:12.000
American crime novels and mysteries of the hard-boiled era really sort of exploded this notion.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
They were not so interested in the puzzle box or the drawing room.

15:16.000 --> 15:25.000
They were really more interested in what I see as psychology as the detective like Philip Marlow, Raymond Chandler's famous detective,

15:25.000 --> 15:34.000
as a sort of, you know, a damaged man and what matters more is his personal psychology and our attachment to him.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
And often the plots don't quite line up. There is an answer to why, you know, how the bullet got in the body in the room,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
but other issues, larger ones are unanswered.

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
And Marlow famously says at the end of the big sleep, the first Marlow novel that, you know, he who tries to be this knight

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
amid the corrupt rich and the gangsters that he had become a part of the nastiness now by entering into that mystery.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
And I think, you know, when I create, what I think is becoming, those of you who read more recent mysteries,

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
the ones that linger with us, the most are the ones that, you know, I try to do this or I do both,

16:12.000 --> 16:19.000
that try to have some, for the person that's reading it to feel that they have, that there's an answer to the puzzle,

16:19.000 --> 16:26.000
they will feel satisfied. So, you know, if you're differentiating in terms of secrets and mysteries, the secrets are revealed.

16:26.000 --> 16:33.000
But then you want to leave something for the other readers who don't know why they care so much, but they do.

16:33.000 --> 16:42.000
And mystery readers are like this. And you somehow, you're trying to find a way to hook into something in there, in themselves.

16:42.000 --> 16:50.000
If you look at the success of something like Gone Girl, one of the most recent, you know, smash crime novels of the last 30 years,

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
people, you know, they liked the twists and turns, but essentially it's a novel about marriage, and everyone was seeing their own marriages,

16:57.000 --> 17:06.000
and it somehow, or their own relationships. And that's what makes it linger larger. And in that case, the unknowable becomes a question of the reader.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
What is the reader? Why the reader feels care so much is the real unknowable that me as the writer can't guess.

17:15.000 --> 17:23.000
I just try to tap into that. They think there's a reason I always teach Freud's Dora in mystery novel classes for the same reason.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
That's so much about levels of your investment in this thing.

17:29.000 --> 17:40.000
I'm thinking of Robert Frost's two-line poem called The Secret. We dance around in a circle and suppose, or as a ringing suppose,

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
but the secret sits in the middle and nose. And it's a big joke about what actually knows it's just a placeholder.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
The important action is what the effect it produces of dancing around and trying to suppose.

17:56.000 --> 18:04.000
And suppose is to project an activity of mind that is conjectural, investigative, intuitive.

18:04.000 --> 18:13.000
I've loved your bringing up that Freud quotation because I've actually used that in my own literary criticism about William Wordsworth,

18:13.000 --> 18:20.000
who writes his great epic poetry, and trying to come to terms with the freak-out mysteries of his boyhood.

18:20.000 --> 18:31.000
Very powerful memories that he calls spots of time that are enshrouded in mysteries. He steals a boat, goes for a joy ride in moonlight, in the lake,

18:31.000 --> 18:39.000
and then returns the boat. But he has an optical illusion as he's rowing out to the middle of the lake that there's a big peak

18:39.000 --> 18:49.000
that is suddenly risen up to come after him. And after that event, for many days, he's troubled by uncertain and unknown modes of being

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
indistinguishable shapes. He's writing epic iambic pentameter, and only Wordsworth can put indistinguishable into epic iambic pentameter

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
and get away with it, but he could do it. And he spends his entire life wanting to write about those mysteries,

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
and it's not solving the mystery, but the activity of being possessed by it, wanting to write about it,

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
turning it into his poetic muse, even though he tells himself that the reason he's writing this autobiography is to prove to himself

19:17.000 --> 19:23.000
that he is the epic poet for the 19th century, not the dark poet of the 19th century.

19:23.000 --> 19:31.000
His best reader in the next generation of romantics, John Keats, who didn't read the prelude, but read other Wordsworth,

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
said that Wordsworth's power was in the dark passages, not in the light, and not in the didactic poet.

19:38.000 --> 19:48.000
That Wordsworth was trying to shape himself into. And Keats formulated a phrase that has really been taken up called negative capability.

19:48.000 --> 19:57.000
It is a capability of being in a state of negative knowledge, and he thought Shakespeare was the one who exemplified this most powerfully.

19:57.000 --> 20:06.000
It's what went into literary achievement. It's when a man, he was gendered about this, is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts

20:06.000 --> 20:17.000
without an irritable reach after fact and reason. You will always reach after fact and reason, but it's the irritable reach that dispels the creative power of mystery.

20:17.000 --> 20:27.000
At the same time, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote the rhyme of the ancient mariner, his most famous poem, talked about the genre of that in another famous soundbite,

20:27.000 --> 20:40.000
that he wanted to procure for these shadows of imagination, these dream states, that willing suspension of disbelief, which for the moment constitutes poetic faith.

20:40.000 --> 20:51.000
Now, it's not just being diluted. It is a contract that you make when you read to enter into a willing suspension of your normal systems of understanding

20:51.000 --> 21:03.000
in an act that's called poetic faith. Poetic faith is really important because faith in an absolutely transcendent God, who is the explanation for everything,

21:03.000 --> 21:12.000
was being dislodged by the end of the 18th century and probably well before, and other kinds of propositions about the mind's search for understanding

21:12.000 --> 21:23.000
were becoming the fuel for literary and scientific endeavor. The vitalist debate was really strong completely across about whether consciousness was a biological epiphenomenon

21:23.000 --> 21:34.000
or was a kind of super-added electricity in soul. Huge debates on that. People lost university positions for arguing the more modern side of that,

21:34.000 --> 21:46.000
which was a kind of chemical epiphenomenon. Inheriting a lot of this was Mary Shelley in a spectacular month of June in 1816,

21:46.000 --> 21:55.000
that people in my field are going to be celebrating the bicentenary of, but it was about a young undergraduate student who doesn't keep in touch with his advisor

21:55.000 --> 22:03.000
and decides to create a life form to overcome a trauma of his life, which is the loss of his mother to Scarlett Fieder.

22:03.000 --> 22:12.000
So he wants to create a human being or a creature immune to any kind of destruction except some sort of violent physical catastrophe.

22:12.000 --> 22:23.000
And this turns out to be Victor Frankenstein's creature. That is a search for the origin of life that is hooked by Mary Shelley to a question that we haven't yet put on the table,

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
which is the social responsibilities and social consequences that come with the enthusiasm for scientific research.

22:31.000 --> 22:43.000
So that's what I've been thinking very hard about as we get ready for all sorts of bicentennials next year.

22:43.000 --> 22:55.000
I have a question about mysticism and its connection with the idea of a mystery and how the word undergoes some kind of change in meaning

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
compared to say when someone like Kant is using it or a Chomsky.

23:00.000 --> 23:16.000
So people like Kant and Chomsky think of cognition, I would say, as an attempt to really find order in a way that presupposes a whole lot of control.

23:16.000 --> 23:26.000
And so cognitive success of some kind really is making sense of it in a way that doesn't resist you or get away from you.

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
It's going to now be very predictable and yield to technology as well.

23:31.000 --> 23:41.000
And my understanding, which is limited of mysticism,

23:41.000 --> 23:52.000
seems to want to dispense with that notion of control. So especially if there are techniques of meditation or other kinds of discipline

23:52.000 --> 24:01.000
that are used in order to get into the kind of state that only a mystic can achieve, say the Sufis were very interested in that.

24:01.000 --> 24:11.000
It sounds as though you have to give up a certain aspiration to control even if you use discipline to achieve the kind of experience that mystics aim to achieve.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And that's very different from letting go of something in a scientific sense.

24:15.000 --> 24:23.000
So the scientist might well say, I've got a good toolbox, I can find a lot of order by using the scientific method.

24:23.000 --> 24:29.000
And you know what, it doesn't answer the ultimate why questions, but those turn out then not to be scientific questions.

24:29.000 --> 24:39.000
And maybe we're not as gripped by them as we once were partly because science seems to do so well in the things that tries to do.

24:39.000 --> 24:47.000
Anyway, I think people are less gripped by that root into mysticism, you know, that well what is the ultimate answer?

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
Because if it's through mystical experience that you're getting a different relation and getting into a different relation to these issues,

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
it's not as though the things that used to resist control of intelligibility now yield to it.

25:02.000 --> 25:13.000
Right, it strikes me that it's a different aspiration, but I'm not sure and I thought maybe you could illuminate me about that contrast.

25:13.000 --> 25:31.000
Well, I do agree with the distinction you're drawing. Clearly, what mystics, well it's a little complicated because of historical contextualization.

25:31.000 --> 25:44.000
So, you know, and like there's so much now running through my brain. But if I bring it to this moment, I would agree with you.

25:44.000 --> 25:59.000
There is a relinquishing of control in the way that the scientific quest demands and succeeds quite well,

25:59.000 --> 26:13.000
of course we should have a footnote here. For the vast majority of human beings, there's no understanding of all the changes that have been brought through science.

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
I mean, who understands how anything really works. So that's something we also have to keep in mind.

26:20.000 --> 26:40.000
So from a point of view, if you're looking at a larger swath of humankind, I'm not sure that the scientific actually has, you know, has really imparted to people,

26:40.000 --> 26:48.000
a real sense of control over their lives. And I guess I would just say this, that from the mystical stamp,

26:48.000 --> 26:58.000
what does mysticism have to contribute? Well, you're quite right when you say that there is a loss of some kind of control,

26:58.000 --> 27:17.000
but it is a matter of great discipline. And I just think it's a sense of, there is a kind of humility here that the mystical path introduces.

27:17.000 --> 27:28.000
And somehow it does, maybe like poetry or dreams, it somehow does relate to something very fundamental about the human experience,

27:28.000 --> 27:40.000
which can't simply be discarded. And I think that there's something about paradox, which is very powerful.

27:40.000 --> 27:49.000
And here might be a point where mysticism and science do have something to contribute to one another.

27:49.000 --> 28:01.000
So from my standpoint, the secret, a secret, can only be revealed to the extent that the secret is concealed,

28:01.000 --> 28:08.000
because if the secret is truly revealed, it's no longer a secret that's being revealed.

28:08.000 --> 28:18.000
And mystics have lived, as I put it, they live in this kind of liminal space between concealment and disclosure,

28:18.000 --> 28:30.000
and it's not a linear process going from concealment to disclosure. It's much more paradoxical that the mystery is disclosed

28:30.000 --> 28:41.000
in the concealment of its disclosure and concealed in the disclosure of its concealment.

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
I have a question for every book. Something I think about a lot is I grew up as a true crime aficionado.

28:47.000 --> 28:56.000
And what about the mysteries that we actually may inside not want solved, which I think is the cases that haunt us?

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
And once you know Jack the Ripper is definitively identified, that's gone forever.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
And I've talked to some people who have devoted their life to different cases,

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
and you do have this lingering sense. I think the movie Zodiac touches this very well,

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
that there would be a grave disappointment to actually have an answer, because that pursuit has consumed them.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
So I'm going to get some of what you're talking about.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm not going to be made in this state of not knowing, but always the possibility of reaching an answer in this case.

29:26.000 --> 29:33.000
But to be in that suspended state, it can't be true for science as a discipline,

29:33.000 --> 29:42.000
but certainly seems that remaining in that state, because if it's obsession from a psychological point,

29:42.000 --> 29:48.000
if you have an answer, you have to let go of the obsession, presumably.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah, it's interesting that the one question that's often asked of scientists is,

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
do you think we'll understand it all by the end of your time?

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
And would you want to be that way, because the adventure, the quest,

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
but I want to come back to the isn't the grand mystery that's driving all of this,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
kind of like in a play, right? So why are we here?

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
So all of a sudden we're in this room, well, we're in this universe,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
and we're trying to figure out why we're here.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
And as scientists, we're kind of the low brows, we're the plumbers,

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
so we're going to figure out how it works, because I think that's going to shed light on things,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
that number one, it's orderly.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
There are rules, it isn't random, and the rules are very, very precise,

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
and we were talking about this earlier, well, do the rules hold everywhere and all times,

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
and that's an answerable question, and we've tested that,

30:46.000 --> 30:51.000
that the rules are the same here as they are 20 billion light years away

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
and back in time 13 billion light years, that's pretty amazing.

30:57.000 --> 31:05.000
And so isn't that the grand mystery that we're all trying, that we all want to know why we're here?

31:05.000 --> 31:12.000
And the other thing you were saying is that science doesn't affect people,

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
and not everyone is...

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
I'm not sure it imparts orderliness in so far as, you know, it's so beyond the reach of most people.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
It is beyond the reach of most people, but we set the...

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
I mean, not everyone understands quantum mechanics, including myself,

31:33.000 --> 31:41.000
but we do set, I think, you know, a large fraction of the people know we live in a big universe,

31:41.000 --> 31:48.000
and there are lots of stars and there are other planets, and that sets a very big context that...

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
And I think a large number of people think that it's a very interesting question

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
to know if there's intelligent life elsewhere, and oh my goodness,

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
so if we plumbers came back and told you, guess what, there's intelligent life elsewhere,

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
that changed the framing of a lot of the... So then I'm going to be so lowbrow on...

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
I shouldn't look at Elliot here when it comes to religion, so then boy, does that affect religion?

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
You know, so we have all of our religions that are kind of based here and now, right, or...

32:24.000 --> 32:32.000
are about us, and so, you know, if you take the Christian face, so do Christ visit all the planets?

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
I guess if you're a Mormon, that's kind of built right in, but...

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
So... but we're all struggling to answer this grand question, and the mysticism...

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
So I didn't like when you were saying that... Well, actually I liked everything you said, but the scientific method...

32:53.000 --> 32:58.000
How many people here know the scientific method?

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
I'm going to put my hand down, because I don't know... If you ask most scientists, we don't know the scientific method.

33:04.000 --> 33:11.000
If you would ask them, it involves falsifiability, and it's not so linear, and some of it involves...

33:11.000 --> 33:19.000
I don't know if it involves mysticism, but getting... when you're exploring the unknown, you need crazy ideas.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
So we know how to test ideas, and that's why the older scientists like myself are really good at testing out...

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
anybody can test an idea. There's a list, does it agree with that?

33:29.000 --> 33:35.000
Getting the new ideas, and... you know, that's where the brain... you have to free the brain to think crazy...

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
to think... to leave.

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, Feynman was one of my teachers when I was an undergraduate, and I just absolutely worshipped him, so anything he said, I just...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh, yes, yes, sir.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
And he said, you know, I really envy you, because you're so ignorant.

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
And it took me about 20 years... well, actually, it didn't take 20 years, but it took me a while to figure that out, is that I had an open mind.

34:00.000 --> 34:08.000
And so I could create new ideas, and the trouble... and I see this, a graduate student comes to me, or a postdoc comes and says, couldn't things be like this?

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
And before the words are out of their mouth, no, no, no.

34:12.000 --> 34:19.000
Instead of, well, maybe... you know, maybe that's not quite right, but if you know too much, you...

34:19.000 --> 34:28.000
sometimes it's the tyranny of knowledge that if you know too much, you can't get to the next big idea.

34:28.000 --> 34:36.000
And so maybe freeing the mind... so I think the scientific method, where I was disagreeing with you a little bit, is...

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
we don't have a book, and we don't carry...

34:39.000 --> 34:44.000
Let me... let me... okay, let me say something with greater care than...

34:44.000 --> 34:52.000
When I... I used this word... I'm not a photographer being... I didn't... Oh, no, philosophers like it. I mean, that means you were listening, and you... you know, engaged, and so...

34:52.000 --> 35:03.000
Actually, we're the ones who are always rude, you know, because we think it's a nice thing to say, actually, I'm not convinced by what you said, because, you know, I mean, that's what we do for a living, is talk to each other that way.

35:03.000 --> 35:16.000
So, when I brought in the idea of control, I was bringing in an idea that I don't have full control over, in fact, and I was being a little bit speculative.

35:16.000 --> 35:32.000
But the thought I had was that there were definitely goals in science, and the goals have to do with explanation, even if there's no one uniform method for coming up with an hypothesis, or the form of a theory even, or even the form of a theory.

35:32.000 --> 35:43.000
Or even the form of a good question, there's still our goals that drive scientists to want to find order where they couldn't see it before.

35:43.000 --> 35:52.000
And you keep saying the universe is an ordered place, and we know that it's an ordered place, and finding that order, and putting it in a way that makes it very usable by us.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
I think of that as kind of a form of control that scientists aim at.

35:56.000 --> 36:02.000
Well, we should have did a little bit and say what we're really interested in, we've discovered that there's order and that there are rules.

36:02.000 --> 36:07.000
But I would say what science is all about is how the universe works.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
But you wouldn't take it as finding out that there is no order.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Sure we would.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
You would?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
Absolutely.

36:17.000 --> 36:26.000
And there are systems that don't have order where the chaotic systems and systems that are very difficult to describe.

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
But I would say if you had to put it in, you know, what is our mission, it's to understand how the universe works.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.000
In a way that renders it intelligible, or not?

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
No, I think I would just leave it at that, understand how the universe works.

36:44.000 --> 36:55.000
I would not be as far from mysticism as I thought then, because it strikes me, and maybe because philosophers always are using old science, you know, we're but mind.

36:55.000 --> 37:13.000
But I think of science when it inspires philosophers to say things in a scientific spirit, as not just openness, but pretty confident that you can find

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
stuff out rather than be permanently mystified.

37:17.000 --> 37:26.000
And when you find it out, you have, I mean, a theory is something that's taking a lot of things and bringing it under something general, right?

37:26.000 --> 37:35.000
There's something going on which is, I was using this metaphor of control, and I don't want to dominate too much.

37:35.000 --> 37:49.000
But it strikes me as a very active form of submitting to understanding in so far as I can, which is rather different from a mystical aspiration.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
I was just trying to draw a contrast between the two.

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
We think we go in open-minded, and we found order, and in science you build upon what you know.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
But would it be recognizably science if you said, well, there's no order?

38:02.000 --> 38:15.000
I think so. I think that natural philosophy, observing the world, doing experiments, finding out how it is, finding that it's not, finding that there aren't rules would have been a path, but that's not the path we found ourselves on.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
And so that's the way it was...

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
I would say that would be the end of science. I guess that's my little assumption.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Well, it wouldn't be the end of science, but we might not be as successful as we are.

38:23.000 --> 38:31.000
I mean, if we're successful because we can predict stuff, and if we couldn't predict, it started with eclipses, right?

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
And astronomical things. People wouldn't have called us up if we couldn't predict.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
And so part of our power is that we're good at doing plumbing.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
I mean, if you had a plumber who couldn't fix plumbing...

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, but that's control.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Or if you didn't have plumbing, you wouldn't need a plumber.

38:46.000 --> 38:54.000
But surely you would acknowledge that part of the orderliness is disorliness, or randomness.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
I mean, that's basic to our experience in the world.

38:59.000 --> 39:09.000
The remaining things that are inexplicable, even within the parameters of orderliness and scientific verifiability.

39:09.000 --> 39:16.000
So you can have a system that's governed by rules, and we think our universe is governed by a simple set of rules that we can put on a t-shirt.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I should have worn such a t-shirt.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Oh, you might have been better.

39:20.000 --> 39:30.000
And the rules are so rich that the outcomes are remarkably...

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
I mean, so a game that isn't rich is tic-tac-toe, right?

39:36.000 --> 39:43.000
So it has very simple rules. It's a trivial game. The outcomes are not rich. It's not interesting.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
A game that is rich that also has simple rules is chess.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Our universe is more like chess. The outcomes are very rich and hard to predict.

39:52.000 --> 40:00.000
And so having fixed rules doesn't mean that you have outcomes that are easy to predict.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
And then sometimes they can look random. And I would just call that richness.

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
If we could... I mean, if we go from the deterministic, you know, the Newtonian Descartes...

40:11.000 --> 40:20.000
So Heisenberg's in the two-nurses. Is that no longer feasible in the mind of any scientist?

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
Well, Heisenberg is different because, again, it's rules.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
But what we discovered in quantum mechanics is that what we can predict, and I don't want to go off on this tangent,

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
but is correlations. But it's still predictable.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
But even if you go back, let's forget about quantum mechanics because this unpredictability,

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
if you have a sufficiently complicated system, even though in principle you can predict the outcome,

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
its behavior is chaotic and so in practice you can't. And that allows richness, which is a good thing,

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
because if there are only five personality types, if there are only five human behaviors,

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
that wouldn't be a very interesting world. But the laws of science...

41:03.000 --> 41:10.000
The laws of physics and science are rich enough to allow for what seeming...

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
Allows for what appears to be free will, whereas if...

41:16.000 --> 41:22.000
You know, it's governed by rules, so how could it be free will?

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
So what is the definition of mystery? Just something we don't have the answer to yet,

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
and that once we find the answer to that, then that mystery is out of the way,

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
then we go to another mystery. Is that the idea of mystery?

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
Is that what Wordsworth has in mind?

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
I think what Elliot says is once a secret is explained as a secret, it ceases to be a secret,

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
but what it also may do is generate the next question.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
And so a lot of these searches, I mean, you bring up Heisenberg as well,

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
is that it's the structure of inquiry, that...

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
And the structuring of inquiry, that has a lot to do with the object of inquiry.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
So you like to use metaphors of plumbing and how it works.

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
And that is a kind of grammar that assumes an it and a working.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
And the... So the question is, you know, that in some ways the kind of question you ask,

42:18.000 --> 42:26.000
the structure of the question you ask is also going to be involved in the object that you discover.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
So that... Heisenberg is part of that.

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
The romantic poets that I work on are very interested in the relay between question and answer,

42:35.000 --> 42:42.000
and the way in which the part of the paradox is that one constantly transmutes into another,

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
that the answer becomes the ground for another stage in questioning.

42:47.000 --> 42:53.000
And then even a paradox, as Wordsworth knew, you know, we fall asleep in body

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
and we see into the life of things, that's about as mystical as that guy gets.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
But when he says we see into the life of things, that's also like the worst line of poetry he ever wrote.

43:03.000 --> 43:12.000
I mean, that language becomes impossible when you imagine a state of... of kind of consciousness that is beyond language.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
And it's the language that gets you there, that is often the more powerful experience,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
whether you're talking about science or religion or mystery writing.

43:21.000 --> 43:29.000
The prehistory for your kind of mystery is the first independently self-sustaining Gothic novelist,

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
some of you may have heard of her, Anne Radcliffe.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Epic, her big one was the Epic Mysteries of Udolpho,

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
a thousand pages of unspeakable horrors and mysteries,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
and then she solves them in the last page.

43:43.000 --> 43:49.000
That was her sort of signature, and it's just some very reductive practical explanation.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
That wasn't a ghost, it was a fire in the tower by a demented nun, or something like that.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
But that once you have the answer, you don't have the answer.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
You have a scientific explanation that is no sooner proffered than subverted,

44:04.000 --> 44:13.000
and you leave the novel thinking, well, was the novel about the 900 pages of the phenomenology of terror and mystery,

44:13.000 --> 44:16.000
or was it about the explanation at the end?

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
Radcliffe is wonderfully double-parked on that.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
She does both things simultaneously.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
The rhyme of the ancient mariner beckons us to come to all sorts of simple conclusions,

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
not good to kill Albatrosses, good to bless snakes.

44:33.000 --> 44:43.000
But if you're in a Christian universe, blessing snakes is a very peculiar pivot into kind of moral unity

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and reintegration to the universe.

44:45.000 --> 44:53.000
The whole process of the ancient mariner, of telling his story, is that he is finally interviewed by the

44:53.000 --> 44:59.000
rower of the boat who comes to pick him up from the ship, and he says, what manner of man art thou?

44:59.000 --> 45:08.000
And at that point, a fearful agony wrenches his frame, and the only way you can answer that story is to tell it all over again.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
And it always ends with that question, what manner of man art thou?

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
So it is this constant repetition of the process of trying to understand

45:17.000 --> 45:27.000
and the perpetual alusiveness of the object, of knowledge, that becomes the powerful, imaginative and poetic motor for that poem.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
And I could give you any number of examples, but it's very much...

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
It's just what you have been saying, because you've been able to end, so it goes back to the original point to that.

45:36.000 --> 45:43.000
And then the end of the mystery is just the realization that that wasn't the real mystery, that super petuates,

45:43.000 --> 45:52.000
and I think that the teller, or the detective, or Freud, bare land then changes the nature of the mystery ultimately.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
Once they put their lens on it, we have a whole new layer of mystery.

45:57.000 --> 46:02.000
You start out wise, door coughing, or whatever your question is at the beginning of that case study,

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
and then it becomes through Freud's endless footnotes and the way that he's viewing it,

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
and his sort of lens, how does this work, then adds a whole other mystery.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
So you end at the end of something like Dora, or in a lot of mystery novels, with ten new mysteries that have sprung up,

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
that are not about who put the bolt and the body and the room.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
So there's the sequel.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
And actually, so science is the same way, is that we often ask the wrong question.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
So I told you what dark matter and dark energy are two mysteries, which I won't tell you that much about.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Probably everybody has heard of them, and they may be the wrong mysteries.

46:42.000 --> 46:50.000
We may be asking the wrong question, but usually we get an answer, and what's wonderful about science is,

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
as soon as we get an answer, we get new questions.

46:53.000 --> 47:01.000
And so we get sequels, and since we enjoy the process, the sequels are really fun.

47:01.000 --> 47:09.000
But the other thing that you said that I found fascinating is that the way we exchange consciousness is through language.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Is that more or less right?

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
It is, yeah, it's what gives consciousness accessibility to a reason.

47:18.000 --> 47:27.000
And what's fascinating about that is language has its limitations, and I thought I heard you say that it may well be that language is not rich enough

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
to fully convey the consciousness that's going on up here.

47:31.000 --> 47:42.000
Though language can figure that limit, and in other words, language can become a description of its own limitations.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
There are all sorts of epistemological and religious and poetic traditions that push language up to the limit,

47:49.000 --> 47:57.000
where the disorganization or inadequacy of language is the powerful operation of imagination.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
So that, I mean, science, for instance, will leave language behind and use mathematics.

48:03.000 --> 48:09.000
I mean, when Wordsworth has a nervous breakdown, he doesn't pick up Milton, he picks up Euclid.

48:09.000 --> 48:18.000
And he finds great solace in geometry, precisely sort of along the lines that you talk about, science, that it's universal, it's impersonal,

48:18.000 --> 48:26.000
it's the same everywhere, that it is free from the corruptions or inflections of emotion and passion and personality.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
But it's not language, it's a symbolic form.

48:29.000 --> 48:38.000
And in Wordsworth anyway, he doesn't write the 13th book of Euclid's elements, but he writes about it

48:38.000 --> 48:45.000
in the middle of a crisis of confidence and human perfectibility after the French Revolution.

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
So the language being an imperfect way to communicate the consciousness of one to another

48:52.000 --> 48:59.000
brings up this thing we were talking about earlier, which is, I believe that, based on what I said earlier,

48:59.000 --> 49:03.000
that everyone would agree that a dog can't understand quantum mechanics.

49:03.000 --> 49:09.000
And if I ask a neuroscientist why, it's because it's not just that they haven't been trained,

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
it's they don't have a prefrontal cortex, is that the right answer?

49:14.000 --> 49:23.000
And so is our brain powerful enough to understand the universe, just like we, I think you were agreeing

49:23.000 --> 49:30.000
that language may be imperfect in transmitting one's consciousness to another?

49:30.000 --> 49:38.000
And so our brain may not even be capable of understanding why we're here, which is, would everyone agree

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
that's the big question?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Or no?

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
How you get to that question as a human being is another question?

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
Don't we all, I mean we rephrase it a different way, but don't, isn't that kind of, we want to know

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
why we're here?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I don't wake up every morning with that question.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
I mean in some ways I mean that may be the big question, but it's one question that...

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Why is it?

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
It's very rich, right?

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
Yeah, it's very rich, but I mean take the end of Keats's own on a Grecian urn.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
Oh okay, beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is all you know on earth and all you need to know.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
And it's a complete tautology.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
I mean it's, you know, it's sort of, it's a syntax, it goes around and around, like the Grecian urn itself,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
whose images are...

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
Alan Gibbsberg cited that to his father on his dying daddy.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
His father said, Alan it's beautiful, but it's not true.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Well you have to do your own work with those words, right?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I mean they're two of the big three.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
But he goes...

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
And they seem to say, okay this is the stuff of answers, but in Keats's management it's the stuff of an answer

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
that really harbors another question about what those terms mean, why we care about them,

50:47.000 --> 50:58.000
why we want to tease them out of a work of art from 5,000 years ago and think that that's going to be a comfort to human knowledge in 1819.

50:58.000 --> 51:05.000
It's very teleological, I'm surprised that I'm a little surprised because I'm...

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
What the big thing seems that, you know, why are we here is a very teleological question.

51:11.000 --> 51:20.000
And maybe we need to embark on a path which does away with the teleology.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
There is no.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
I mean I think this is probably a great contribution of Buddhist thinking.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Does that involve origin as well?

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
I mean so that you would say origin and telos are...

51:34.000 --> 51:46.000
In Niana Buddhism there's the tasata of all things, the satshnas of all things is identical to the shunyata, the emptiness of all things.

51:46.000 --> 51:53.000
So come to the point of the realization that the satshnas...

51:53.000 --> 52:01.000
What is is what it is and that's simply the nothingness of being.

52:01.000 --> 52:10.000
It's like a womb, it's fakhandi, it keeps generating itself over and over again, but there is no why.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.000
There is neither an origin or a telos.

52:14.000 --> 52:21.000
Well the way we would word the question and why, how we would word it is, so everyone's heard of the Big Bang.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.000
We can trace our origin back to the Big Bang and we are now...

52:26.000 --> 52:32.000
We feel like we can actually address the question of what the Big Bang is.

52:32.000 --> 52:43.000
You can say it literally in a Big Bang or do you say that's a metaphorical way now that physicists can handle the question of origin.

52:43.000 --> 52:51.000
Well the Big Bang we can describe it mathematically, it's the creation of matter, energy, space and time.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.000
But it wasn't a bang, that's what I'm saying.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Was there a noise?

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
It's still a metaphor.

52:58.000 --> 53:12.000
So our big question, if we have an answer, how matter, energy, space and time were created, but we can trace ourselves back to a simpler state, smaller that we call the Big Bang.

53:12.000 --> 53:23.000
But the next level of question which maps on to the sort of English version I gave that I thought everybody wondered about is why is there something rather than nothing.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
It's the ultimate metaphysical question.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
And of course if there were nothing we wouldn't be here to ask.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
Well maybe there is nothing and that's why we're asking.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
When I sensed that it was frustrated that we're not nailing down this...

53:44.000 --> 53:52.000
No I was frustrated, I was just wondering, is there something more to the notion of mystery than what...

53:52.000 --> 54:08.000
...seem to be happening which is essentially saying, well it's a mystery, like the mysteries we read because we don't have the answer yet, that when we have the answer then that stops being a mystery.

54:08.000 --> 54:16.000
So now we focus on the next mystery and in science we move that way, we answer this and this then leads us to this other question.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
So we keep answering mysteries, but is there something more fundamental about...

54:22.000 --> 54:28.000
So why do we call it mystery as opposed to just calling, we don't have the answer yet.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Right, an unsolved problem.

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
As of now, it's an unsolved problem as of now.

54:34.000 --> 54:47.000
I think a number of the comments also allude to the etymology of the word which was all about initiation.

54:47.000 --> 54:54.000
And in a sense what you have been talking about both in the scientific and the mystical realm is that there is a kind of initiation.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
It's not so much about the answer to the mystery but it's almost a way of experiencing and thinking.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
I mean that's what's the scientific method, it's really more about an attitude than anything.

55:05.000 --> 55:16.000
But I was trying to articulate something different, that the mystery isn't an unknowable X, that at some point will become unknowable and then we move on.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
It may itself generate another question.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
I was trying to elicit from the study of mysticism a different portrait of the mystery.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
No, I understood that.

55:30.000 --> 55:37.000
It's not religion the idea, for example of God that Michael mentioned, that's real mystery.

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
That there is no answer or solution to that and that you have to live with that.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Yeah, certainly.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Not just because you're too dumb but because it is an admitting.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
Well, sure.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
That's real mystery.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
That it's not something you then find the answer and stops being one.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Right, in the Christian tradition.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
That's where the arrogance comes in.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
And arrogance is very important in science.

56:01.000 --> 56:16.000
The idea that you could actually know something that you may not be able to but if you didn't have that hutzpah, if you didn't say, well I could figure out how the universe began or I could figure out if there's a multiverr.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Or I could figure out why there's something and nothing.

56:19.000 --> 56:27.000
And I guess we don't know that we certainly don't know and we know from experience that most of our questions are the wrong questions.

56:27.000 --> 56:31.000
But as we tell our students, the most important thing is asking the question.

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
And then that leads to another question.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And I guess some of them are unanswerable.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
Or maybe we don't know that for sure.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
But you're saying, I guess that's what you're saying.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Yeah, I think there's a difference.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
I think mysticism embraces a kind of inherent unknowing.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
Or let's go back to the language.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
You know what?

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I was thinking before as you were speaking.

56:58.000 --> 57:02.000
Blanchot has this idea of the limit experience.

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is unique to the human species.

57:07.000 --> 57:14.000
And Blanchot says, we are capable of thinking that which exceeds thought.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
We are capable of speaking of that which exceeds language.

57:18.000 --> 57:24.000
And that seems to be something, you know, I think, distinctive.

57:24.000 --> 57:31.000
And so it's in that sense that mysticism speaks of the unknowability.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
Or the more technical term is the apophatic, apophosis.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
But apophosis, which means unspeaking, is a gesture of speaking.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
It's speaking not as opposed to not speaking.

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
If mystics truly adhere to silence, then we would have nothing to talk about in relationship to them.

57:54.000 --> 58:04.000
So in fact, you know, through the ages, mystics have tried to articulate this unspeakability, this inessibility.

58:04.000 --> 58:12.000
But it's a gesture of speaking, just like analogously, the thinking of the mystery is a gesture of thought.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.000
It's a path of thinking.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
That's like what Warz wrote in the intimations of immortality.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
So we thought that lie too deep for words.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Yeah, it's a state.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
I mean, Warz wrote this intensely interested in states of consciousness that are inaccessible to us.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
That idiot boy is, you know, is a poem that he loved that his friends hated.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
But when the idiot boy speaks, Warz wrote was the first one to put the word burr into English poetry.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I went to the OED for that one.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
But that's just a sound rather than a signifier of sense.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
Finally, when the idiot boy comes out of the woods at night, I mean, that's a sort of little epic right there.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And his mother says, what did you see?

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
He said, the cocks did crow to woo to woo, and the sun did shine so cold.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Now that's language.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
It's a bit of a riddle.

58:59.000 --> 59:13.000
In other words, I heard the owls and I saw the moon, and he's relating it in the way that the chimpanzee made the word out of candy water, made the word candy water to describe watermelon.

59:13.000 --> 59:22.000
You can kind of do the math, but the mystery of what's going on in that consciousness is inaccessible at that limit of language.

59:22.000 --> 59:37.000
So that what in Warz was intensely interested in mad women and idiot boys and people at the very end or very limits of human language who makes sounds that may or may not be language.

59:37.000 --> 59:48.000
While Stevens takes us into the snowman, who has a mind of winter and can see nothing that is not there and then nothing that is, which is very close to your territory.

59:48.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But what I want to say is it takes a human imagination to be interested in that kind of problem and want to push language to the point where nothing both signifies something that's positive and something that is completely the opposite of positive in the very same word.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And to ask us to think about a state of mind that can do both things at once. That's a paradox, that's a mystery, and that's poetry from human imagination wondering how far words can become explanatory instruments, when they just become sounds, and when they

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:31.000
recede from legibility altogether into something that we would call mystery because it is the kind of initiation right into something that we don't have access to.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think mystery essentially means etymologically, it's the closed eyes of the hierophants that are turned inward.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And we just see the spectacle, is that right? I mean, I wouldn't know.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Oh, okay, no, I'm happy to be corrected. But I thought, I mean, yeah. The eyes are the mouth, there's a debate. Yeah, but whatever it is, it's closed in.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I mean, so you see the spectacle of something to which you have no access.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:12.000
What is language? Always a limit? I mean, can't you imagine, is it a permanent limitation or maybe we'll figure out a way language turns out 200 years from now to be very primitive, that actually what we do is we have a box, which is a computer and you put it on your head

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
and it sends electrical impulses. That's the interest in symbolic form that words would have.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And so it's not language anymore, but we're communicating on it.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:29.000
But it's a symbolic form, yeah. So maybe we won't need that at all if we get to the perfect technology that dispenses with language and then dispenses with us.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:41.000
But on this question of inaccessibility, it's interesting to see the slides between something being inaccessible to language and expression in a language and being inexorable.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And being inexorable period. Those are two very different things.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So I have access to the way things feel to me, which I can't put into words, but I have no problem of access.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I only have a problem of access when it's someone else's feelings.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000
As William James said, the breach between one consciousness and another is the deepest breach in all of nature.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And he was right. But that isn't just created by the fact that some things are hard to put into words.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's something else. And I would also suggest that worrying about that.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:31.000
We don't always need to go to the thing that resists rationality, the areas of madness and disorder and so on.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And even things that are perfectly orderly can't be put into words sometimes. It's kind of strange.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And when you were asking about what are the things that really mystify us and your one is why are we all here?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And I can tell you that mine, and it's not an unanswered problem, I don't think.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It is really just that I don't understand point of view.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And I said in my little blurb that I think about it all the time.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And I just want to share with you how I knew I was a philosopher without knowing what a philosopher was at the age of ten,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
just sitting on the playground with my little friend Susie McDonald.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And I suddenly had this moment when I said, oh my God, I can see her eyes.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
But she can't see her eyes. And she's looking at my eyes and I can't see my eyes.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And how strange it is that we have this vantage point which invites us to think we're disembodied,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
but it's precisely an embodied point of view.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
But it's simultaneous. It's a lot like what you were talking about.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
You simultaneously get that you get it, but know that you can't get it at the same time.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So I think almost all interpersonal engagements has this dimension of not fully grasping

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
and knowing that you don't fully grasp the other point of view,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
partly because you know how much is there in your own that can't be grasped.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But that's only temporal because Galileo invented the mirror

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
so that Susie McDonald could see her eyes.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But I'm speaking metaphorically, so Galileo said, measure what's measurable and make measurable that which is not.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And so that's why I ask the question about language is so we can't perfectly communicate my consciousness to you and vice versa.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.000
But we invent things that allow us to extend our capabilities and we continue to do that.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
The mirror is a trivial one.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But that's really important though. I think it's not seeing your eyes. I beg to differ.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
If I put a mirror up, I can see my eyes.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
You can see what they look like.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Oh, you might see into your eyes.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
See your eyes.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
That's the difference between science and philosophy.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
But we're actually getting there because if you take Galileo's words seriously,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
measure what is measurable and make measurable that which is not measurable.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:13.000
So you have to tell me, oh, I didn't just want to see my own eyes or I wanted to see into the eyes.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And then I could ask you, well, could you be a little more specific there?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I didn't say I wanted to. I said I couldn't. And I was happy with that.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Well, but I was going to say, oh, you're happy with that.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, I'm not happy with that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
See, that's the control thing I was talking about.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Galileo is not happy with that.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And I'm not happy with the...

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
See, it's the dolphin's eyes. You're seeing yourself ultimately, right?

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You're projecting everything into looking into her eyes.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Isn't that the ultimate limitation that you're only seeing yourself reflected back literally,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
but also that you're imagining things that are coming from you?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You're projecting things from your own case because you can't take up someone else's point of view.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000
It's very profound that you can not do it.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And that's mysterious to me, but it's not because there's an unanswered question.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
It's just a brute fact.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
But I'm still emistified.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
But is it a fact forever?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Because you're just building a...

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
You're building a problem with Carolyn said, which is that we can't...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Language doesn't communicate everything that's up here.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
But we're not done. We invented language.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
We can invent something else where we...

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You just have to watch Star Trek.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You put the Vulcan mind meld on...

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
That we can...

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's not a permanent limitation, is it?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Well, look, you can try lots of things.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You could try philosophers dream up impossible ghoulish experiments like...

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
What is this one called?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Where the states of the body next to me are ones that I'm now able to track with my brain

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
because of some hookup so that now I can see what it's like for another.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I use my brain, but I'm getting neurological messages from another body.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
That's the kind of thing you're imagining.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And I just am not sure when you're imagining things like this,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
whether you're imagining that it's yourself experiencing another's body,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
or you cease to feel like yourself.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And so I think there are real problems about what it is to even identify a point of view

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
as you have the point of view and whether that could be a stable thing

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
when you're imagining ways of having access to a point of view not your own

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
and just the way you have an access to your own point of view.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000
That's very murky territory because you'd have to distinguish the others as the others.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000
What's sort of interesting if you look at evolution on Earth,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
it started with single-celled animals, or single-celled things,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
and then they decided, you know, striving to survive and all that.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And then they decided that coming together was more valuable

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
and that even though you were going to sacrifice your self-ness,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
if you came together you could compete for resources better.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I mean, I'm not sure they decided that, but it was decided.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
People from the other universe on that computer, no kids.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah, the kids decided it.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
But aren't we, do we think it's stopped right here that we're,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
this is the biggest entity that's going to be made,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
that we're not going to make bigger things where we...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
No, that's good. I don't want to dominate too much,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and we should probably get back to mystery,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
but I'll just say I work on group agency.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I think human beings can function as of from one point of view,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
in a rational sense, or a practical sense.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
A philosophy department can reason as one.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That I've never seen.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Well, I taught my...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
A physics department can't, I should say.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I taught my department that there's a difference between voting

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and reasoning as one.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It's impossible.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Yeah, but they can.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And so you can think of individuals as rational agents with a...

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Are we on?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Yeah, good.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Okay, as rational agents, as things with a point of view

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
in which they deliberate and act,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000
and those don't have to be human size, they don't.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And so I'm not saying that there are in super-group barriers

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
between human beings, but I am saying that that is not the only notion

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
of a point of view.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And this other notion of a point of view,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
when I had my crisis on the playground, is a different kind.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And finding out that organisms can glom on to be larger units

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
is not the same thing as contemplating how one point of view can think another.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
One way one point of view can think another is through words and literature.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.000
One thing literature does to you as a reader is that you inhabit the subjectivity

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
of the person who's writing while you read, I mean, especially for novels.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Well, that's what provoked my comment when you were talking about what is

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and isn't accessible to language.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
That... I mean, it's imperfect.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And you would say that everyone will read a Dickens novel differently,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
but everyone will have the experience of what it's like to be...

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
what it's like to be Pip and to see the world from his point of view.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So it's not empathy, but it's sympathy.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It's an extension beyond your normal frame of understanding.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Even that mirror scene.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I mean, Galileo may have invented mirrors,

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
but mirrors were not popularly available, widely available,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
until the 1830s when they figured out how to do cheap backing.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Before that, you had to go to Versailles, and that was a very exclusive invitation.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And it was really, you know, Louis XIV saying,

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
look at all my mirrors, you Monarchs, and, you know, suck on that,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
because I have more mirrors than anybody.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Milton was very interested in a mirror scene in Paradise Lost.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Before Eve is taken to Adam, she wakes up in Eden

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
and looks at a pool of water and doesn't recognize her reflection as herself

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and falls in love with it.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Now, there are lots of ways to read that scene.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
The default position for a very long time is, oh, it's narcissism.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It shows that she's fallen before she falls.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
But another way to see that is that she actually sees a female creature in nature

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
before she's taken into the all-male world of creation.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Mary Shelley was really interested in this because she has the creature in Frankenstein

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
first behold what he looks like to everyone else in a repetition of that mirror scene.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
The creature looks at himself in a pool of water in a pigsty, next to the pigsty,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
where he's been living and sees that he is hideously different

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
from every other human being that he's encountered,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
and he said, I was mortified by my deformity.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And deformity is a relative term, but mortified means that he was killed.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I mean, he understood that he was dead in the world because of that.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
In autobiography, Wordsworth has himself compare what it is to try to write your autobiography

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
to discover the mystery of your past, to hanging over the side of the boat

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:24.000
and trying to see down to the past years like looking down to the bottom of the lake.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But the kicker, as you can see, is you can't separate what's at the bottom

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
from the reflection of yourself looking for what's at the bottom.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
So even mirrors, which would seem to promise a kind of clear view of the self,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:46.000
especially the eyes, are very complicated by the Heisenberg principle of catching yourself

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
in the motion of desiring to see yourself.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And those are inextricable. And that's a narrative issue again.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So, yeah, I'm caught by what a precocious ten-year-old you were,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
that you really had a vocational moment.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
That's great. I mean, that's a peculiar.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Well, when you're actually writing a crime-alver mystery, one of the goals,

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
inevitably, particularly because they do derive from sensation novels, you know,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
if you can, the Moonstone, through the first mystery novel,

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
the Kowlans who wrote sensation novels. And the idea, you know,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
behind the name of a sensation novel that you would be held in its grips.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So the goal with characters, particularly if you have a main character,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
first person, is to, you need the reader to identify with that character,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
especially if they're going to dark places.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
So the goal there is to not cut off any access points to,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
you're trying to keep the narrator, the protagonist,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
you're not trying to be too specific with these novels,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
because you want the reader to fill it with him or herself.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And therefore they become the solver of the mystery too, and therefore they

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
undergo, as the protagonist, the realization that there are these larger mysteries.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So it is like that's sort of the trick or goal.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
One of the reasons in literature right now, the unlikable character problem

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
has become a major one, and that's that moment when the reader says,

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
no, no, no, and that's fascinating as a writer,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and I'm sure it's fascinating for all their therapists, because, you know,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
why are you so bothered by this character?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
But that's also, you know, that's the balance you're trying to strike as a writer,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000
of these sort of more visceral kind of fiction.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So we all agree that human beings like mystery for different reasons.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I think we're violently agreeing that we like mystery,

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
but for different reasons. And so why is that?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Why do we like mystery? I mean, shouldn't we like certainty?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Well, Kohler says that's where the mind closes down.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Well, you're hovering between possibilities.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
That's the strong working of the imagination.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And as soon as you resolve on one or the other, it's understanding,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
and it becomes fixed and dead.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So it allows possibility.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It's possibility, but it's also propulsion.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah, so that...

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
For us it's propulsion, that we want to go out there and solve that mystery.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I mean, I was even interested in how many negatives that we have to use,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
like unknowable and inaccessible, which are the sort of negation of the positive state.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And that's one way you propel yourself as you take something that seems to be

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
in the world and attach a negative prefix to it.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I mean, Percy Shelley talks about the human life to come as the unwritten story,

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000
which is an imagination of a possibility that is different from the historical here and now.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And for him, that was a very important political act of buying in moments of horrific oppression,

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
is to be able to imagine something else by the negation of what you know.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
So inaccessible might mean that there's something ultimately accessible,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
or it might mean just the negation of your normative habituated understanding

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
of what accessible means.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Well, it's funny you should say that because Descartes, when he was thinking about

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
whether he could know something besides himself when he was in a state of hyperbological doubt,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
reasoned his way to God's existence, right?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And he said, and don't think that you can arrive at the idea of God by negating the idea of yourself.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Like, you know, he says, you can't do that.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And what's curious is that in English, he described God as unlimited, which is a negation.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Unlimited looks like the positive term, but Descartes insisted, no,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.000
limited is the negative word, even though our English word is the negative word,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
and that himself is a limited being as a negation of a positive idea that he required.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And so instead of thinking of it as mystery, he thought of it as a definite presupposition

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000
of his own self-understanding, a quite definite positive beyond himself.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And not negative, and therefore not a mystery.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And that's very different from the way we're talking about it.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Well, is that sublimity, rather than mystery?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
It was almost mathematical.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I mean, he was able to think the Cartesian coordinate system.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:29.000
He was able to distinguish indefiniteness, which is the way he tried to get at the cardinality of the integers,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
all if not, but then he said, they just go on and on and on, and I can't understand that unless I have a positive notion.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Well, that's not a mathematical.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.000
The cardinality of the image, you know, that...

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
To answer your question, I've been, as I'm sitting here thinking, it seems to me

01:17:49.000 --> 01:18:01.000
that do dogs worry and think about mystery, just as you asked about them and quantum mechanics.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
So, or is it something that we humans have?

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You had that sense of mystery when you were ten.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So, and you talked about mystery and these novels that had to do with feelings and emotions and sensations.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:31.000
So, is it possible that because the humans take so long to grow up, so long to understand what's around them,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:43.000
so long to be able to become independent, that mystery or the issue of having emotions about the unknown are so powerful with us?

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Well, it might be put a more positive word on it or a different connection is curiosity and mystery are very deeply connected, I think.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And I think human beings are... I don't know if other creatures are curious, but human beings, we scientists like to tell everyone

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:06.000
that human beings are naturally curious about our environment.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
We are trying to figure out new ways to exploit it.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
If you think about how we've survived, it's not because we're the strongest.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It's because we use our mind and a powerful tool of the mind is to be curious, oh, what if I ate that berry over there?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Or what if I moved north? What if I did, curiosity is connected to mystery?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Let me add one quick footnote to that.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
The person who invented the word curioser out of curiosity, curioser and curioser is the master chess player,

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and of course curiosity is the embodied muse of Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
But the curioser, I mean, I'd like you to sense, curiosity is a process and Carol understood that by making that a kind of comparative

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:15.000
that doesn't reach its superlative but is just self-perpetuating. Curioser and curioser is the syntax.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:24.000
But it's had a neuroscientist have had some interesting things to say about the whole capacity for curiosity

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
and for reducing prediction errors.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:35.000
We had a roundtable on consciousness here some time ago, and Carl Friston, neuroscientist from England,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:49.000
has a theory about the mind as a Bayesian probabilistic anticipator in order to reduce and minimize prediction error.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And that this has obvious adaptive advantages.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:06.000
There's an affective neuroscientist, Yoc Pangsep, who has identified specific areas in the brainstem

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:18.000
across mammalian species and even some birds, one of which is a seeking system that kind of propels the mammal to kind of explore.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And it's something that is mediated through immediate affective consciousness.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000
I was thinking about this when you were talking about the nature of consciousness.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000
His idea is that consciousness is not dependent on the brain.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
On the cortex, clearly you have these ancephalic children who seem to have very real evidence of consciousness,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
but it's all affective. It's not dependent on language.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Language, of course, enhances the experience of consciousness because it's not just the primary experience of it,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:03.000
but then there's a reflective capacity, there's awareness of our consciousness, but the immediacy of consciousness in his idea is purely affective.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And I think that has relevance in terms of how we think about scientific processing, mystical processing,

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
that these may also be engaging different levels of the brain.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The thing that keeps coming back to me is that the one thing that we know for sure in science is that things are changing.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
We live an evolving world and human beings will evolve.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.000
So when you talk about limitations, undoubtedly the limitations will become smaller.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
And so...

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Sorry?

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Why do you assume that?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Well, let's just take language, which I think I learned today.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I'm actually fascinated by the idea.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
It's a limitation and it leaves part of our consciousness.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Inaccessible language has evolved.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
So if you think of the beginning of language, the ability to...

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000
The amount of your consciousness that was inaccessible was much greater than it is now.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I would argue that the more it has evolved, the more of its inadequacy is revealed.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And also, can I go back?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I may have missed a moment, but the whole point of the mystical understanding of what I'm calling you the apophatic,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000
it's not my term as what scholars have missed this is and also, you know, it's in the opal tonic tradition.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
It's precisely to get away from the binary that you articulated.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So the unspoken is not simply the negation of what is spoken.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The negation is not the negative...

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
It is a problem of language in the end.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But that's the point of...

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And that's...

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
In a measure what I've been trying to articulate here.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:59.000
There's a different approach to the mystery in mysticism, which tries to get us beyond this binary thinking.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
It's an undermining of the binary thinking.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And that would include...

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I have to say, would also include this idea of progress.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It's pointed to something more intrinsic about the human experience.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I'm not going to be grandiose and say truth because I don't know what that is.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
But at least I could say in a more humble way.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:31.000
It's pointed to something about the human experience of which that will persist.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
No matter how much we conquer.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
So I withdraw the word progress because it's subjective.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I would keep the word evolving in there because the human capability is going to change.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
We know that for sure.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But who be poets better understand language?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And they continuously articulate the ineffability at the core of effibility.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Not all.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
What? Okay.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Time for a question.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I wish we could go on for hours.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
I'll end it up to questions from the audience so if you could line up.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And please keep your comments in the form of a question.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
But we don't have to keep our answers in the form of an answer.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Right?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
More questions.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
That's the thing.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000
There were certain phrases that really interested me entering into the mystery.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Control.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:47.000
These interests to me because I think mystery is a given in all the forms that are the initial quote for this meeting.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000
From that unnamed politician that we better forget about.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Anyhow, so what seems to interest me is the question of entering into the mystery of what forms there are.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:26.000
So in science in addition to the scientific method we have historic accounts of dreams, intuition, unexpected associations leading to insights and solutions and furthering of answers to scientific problems.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:37.000
So what do we have to say about that?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:46.000
What can be done if anything to train us as one is trained in the scientific method to find forms of control or I would say frames of reference?

01:26:46.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Because in the mystical tradition there are lots of controls, fasting, there's one, meditation is another and so on, that are non-language forms of entering into the mystery and returning with some answer.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So I guess my question is, isn't this about the advance of how we find ways, maybe psychoanalysis could be looked at as a way of entering into the mystery and what kinds of responses or answers or clarity or whatever you want to call it come from preparing ourselves in a relationship to the mystery?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Is that directed mainly to me?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Yeah, okay.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Well that was a very rich question which doesn't leave me any very clear path of answer.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
You provoked a lot of thoughts as you were speaking.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:06.000
It struck me that when you said what is it to enter a mystery, that it's not really very far from what I was thinking about when Ed was asking, well what's the difference between the dog and the human being?

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:30.000
We do have this incredible capacity to anticipate things that haven't happened and the dog anticipates things that have happened as things that are going to happen again but we have a different way of anticipating that goes beyond that and it's very closely tied to knowing we don't know things

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:49.000
and I think entering into mystery is bound up with this very peculiar, distinctively human capacity to be open to possibilities which may be actual in the future or maybe just imaginary that are not present.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It's very odd and I don't think other species do that that we know.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Okay. Hello. Hi. So my question pertains to synchronicities.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I don't know if there was a panel through helix on synchronicities or if there will be.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I'll be exciting. There was.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Okay. So I guess if the conversation was for ours, the word would have come up but I'm wondering.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Obviously there's no news or science behind synchronicities, the latest that the panels can share but is there anything on that note that you want to just speak of top of mind?

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I don't know. It's a very open-ended. If there's nothing, that's fine. I just thought it was an interesting thing to explore.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:50.000
There's a French physicist who writes about the Paulie who was here and I think he's going to be in town if he hasn't already been and talking about that again.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And he has a book on that but I don't remember his name but he writes about the young Paulie meetings I think.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Oh. Yeah.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
That's a mystery.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
It's a mystery that's based in reality I guess as in our own experience.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Thank you.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Hi. What struck me today was the elephant in the room and that was the fact that no one in this panel has mentioned the ultimate mystery.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:49.000
You know Woody Allen and I want to know what you think about the mystery of death and how this ultimately unknowable besides the people who claim to have told us things from beyond.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:04.000
How this mystery informs or leads or hovers over all the other quests for certainty whether it be in human communication or in knowing how the universe works.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
But how did I just like to know what your thoughts are on this topic?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I have an incredibly simple answer. I think death is what makes life worth living.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:30.000
That if you imagine that there is no death then you have an infinite amount of time and time is not valuable and why would you do anything.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Which anyway that has nothing to do with.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
So I didn't explain the mystery.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I understand that these other things are activities that make life worth while but how does this ultimate mystery inform the other mystery?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Well there's a great literary subject. Milton begins Paradise Lost by wondering about what brought death into the world and all are woe.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:05.000
When Colerge writes about the imagination is hovering between images the text he goes to is Milton's great description of death and Paradise Lost.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Which is both an allegorical figure but a literary event that defies understanding.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Shape it had, if shape it might be called, maybe shape it had none.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Fierce is ten furies.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:27.000
You can't even think what one fierce fury would be but fiercest ten furies is a kind of sublimity of comparison.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Milton is interested in the way in which death as a language defies language.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Edmund Burke takes this up as the text that is the poster boy for his theory of the sublime.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Of when the imagination when the human intelligence reaches the limit of its ability to grasp anything he brings in Milton's death.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:58.000
Colerge brings in Burke and Milton's death to talk about that hovering of the imagination so that death becomes one of those events in language.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
We don't know it without the language even with the capital D. Death.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.000
That is there but I think you're right that it is whatever it is it's the opposite of what we do know.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And so the work in language the excitement and dynamism of language around death is that it offers you what you do know and then it takes it away.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So you have that strong working of the imagination in relation to what you know and what you don't know.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:32.000
And it's you know I mean that you're right you and Woody Allen are right I mean that's the limit and it's the limit beyond which we can't know but which we keep trying to know.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So when Wordsworth says visionary power is embodied in the mystery of words and he really means something like how we use words to get to what we don't know and how we understand that word's far away.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:52.000
That words finally are not equivalent to the states that we're seeking.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
I just add to that.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Yeah go ahead you want to crime.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Crime novelist.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:11.000
There is an argument they all crime mystery novels that's really what they're about and many of them play with Persephone or Dante and the detective is doing this descent you know and eventually reaches the larger question.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:27.000
There's any crime series with the recurring detective eventually that's the end you get in the series so I think they could easily make the argument that's the only thing that crime novels are about which it seems very telling based on your question.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Thank you.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Thank you for the wonderful discussion.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:42.000
It seems to me one of the primary tensions in this discussion was between Mr. Turner's desire to understand more and some of the other palace desire to preserve greater mystery.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:57.000
My thought is as Edmond Burke wrote in his inquiry into the beautiful and the sublime as Emmanuel Kant says in his essay on the sublime that you know one of the reasons we want mystery in our lives is that it leads to this sense of the sublime.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:06.000
As they also say in those works other things beautiful harmony things on a large grand scale can also inspire that sense of the sublime.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So the night so I am sort of drawn to moments where understanding coexist with the sense of the sublime.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:25.000
So the night sky is no less sublime to me for my knowledge of astronomy Yosemite is no less sublime to me for my knowledge of geology.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So I'm interested in what the panel thinks about the relationship of mystery to the beautiful and the sublime and how people fit that moment of simultaneous understanding exaltation when you look at the night sky or Yosemite Valley into your paradigm of how you think about the mystery

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
and the sublime.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Well when Humphrey Day has his introductory lectures on chemistry he uses the vocabulary of the sublime to express his enthusiasm for the progress of scientific knowledge.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I mean for him those things were not opposites they were the the sublimity of human desire and science and human curiosity was tied absolutely to the progress of scientific knowledge and it was the alternative both to the old time God

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
who explains everything or the French Revolution which promised and didn't deliver.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:34.000
So when he's doing this in 1802 it is exactly what you're talking about it is the language of sublimity and religion and scientific progress and human progress all on the same track.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
But I think the more knowledge you have it makes the mystery more interesting.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:59.000
It sharpens it and I think to take it even to a higher level I've often told people that I thought Einstein's God is much more interesting, I'm using a value statement, than a simple person's God because more curious.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:10.000
So you know so God doesn't have to keep the planets in the you know moving around orbits and stuff like they just have to run the universe.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So how did he create space and time and the laws of physics and I'm not saying that's the ultimate thing but the sublime becomes more sublime the more we know.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:30.000
When he doesn't have mystery in mystery novels it's the same thing. So you start out there's a dead body or something.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.000
You got a mystery it becomes much more interesting the more you know.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Next. I'm from a former named Joshua Heschel. I don't agree with Heschel's acceptance of a transcendent God but he's talking here about a nigma and he defines it as the unknown within the noun.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:07.000
The infinite within the finite mystery within the order. So that would seem to go on with what you just said I think.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Next question.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000
So just a comment first. I don't know that if our prefrontal cortex was larger that we would then grasp.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I think the issue with grasping is grasping a system of which we are apart and that would be true no matter how large our prefrontal cortex becomes.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That's just a side comment.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:35.000
The two things that kind of occurred to me over and over.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:53.000
One of them is the idea of humans as creators of meaning. So the chair or even the concept doesn't have inherent meaning except as we create it for whatever neurotic reasons we create it.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Or creative reasons we create it.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So it makes me wonder that perhaps mystery is as much a creation as meaning is. Is as much a human creation as meaning is.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
And perhaps it's simply a way to describe our discomfort with our own limitation.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And that's another motivation behind discovering mystery is discomfort.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Or another word for that is insecurity or fear.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So that's something that kind of goes over and over in my mind is meaning and mystery both simply creations of the human mind.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And then I'll say the second one and whoever wants to comment on either one. It would be wonderful.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:44.000
The second one which for me is a little more gnarly is actually maybe it's equally gnarly is the issue of continuity versus discontinuity.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So continuity would hold and this is kind of to my limit on understanding the more Asian concept that everything in existence from the imminent to the transcendent simply exists along a continuum.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000
So it exists continuously in broader and broader or more sublime forms.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:14.000
So whatever we grasp today the higher thing is a mystery we grasp that the next higher becomes a mystery and it's pretty much an even process.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Whether we ever completed or not we probably don't.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Discontinuity I think of as being more than a Judeo-Christian paradigm.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And discontinuity holds that there is not simply a quantitative difference between the imminent and the transcendent.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:38.000
But there is actually to use a limited word for us limited people a qualitative difference.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:51.000
So for example from one of the mystical traditions it says that the original being withdrew created an empty space and created into that empty space.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
There's very clearly the sense of discontinuity.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So I'm interested because for me the mystery the idea of mystery is also do we exist within continuity or is there a discontinuity between imminent and the transcendent.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
And whoever wants to comment I was thinking of Elliot but whoever else please feel welcome.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Thank you.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Thank you.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I'll comment on the second.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:27.000
And so I think it's more complicated than that and even the example you used is actually from Loreana Kabbalah for all those who may not be familiar with it.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I was aware I just didn't want to get all linguistic.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Yeah no I understand.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I know you whoever just to bring everybody into it.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:45.000
So the idea that the primal act is not a projection of the infinite but rather the withdrawal contraction of the infinite.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
To make space for that which is other than its infinity.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:06.000
But I'm going to use this to point to the complexity that in fact the ultimate paradox there is there is a withdrawal of infinity from space.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:17.000
It's an empty it's an empty emptying out of the fullness of infinity but within that space that is created there is still a trace of the infinite.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Went all things other than the infinite come to be.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
So that means there is a continuum.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
There is a continuum.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And I think one of the things certainly in Jewish mysticism I don't want to speak about Christian mysticism to glibly here but certainly Jewish mysticism complicates the more ordinary or typical conventional understanding of Judaism

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000
whereby there would be this radical break between the transcendent and the imminent.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:07.000
It complicates that to the point where many Kabbalists are actually seemingly guilty of something like a pantheism or panantheism and somebody else could take this first or the second.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
But that's what I was going to say.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.000
It says there is no place devoid of him which is to say there is continuity within the discontinuity.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Right.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
We could render that.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
The language allows us to say it and not him.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:30.000
So the infinity there doesn't need to be gendered as masculine actually.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And the idea of mystery being a human creation and meaning being a human creation.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Yes, and everybody wanted to respond to that.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I guess I would think that lots of particular mysteries are human creations but the capacity to conceive something as mysterious using the terms of the human creation.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Using the terms I know there is something I don't know, something reflective of that kind isn't available to things without the right cognitive constitution like a dog wouldn't be able to do it.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:13.000
So even if we make lots of particular mysteries I would think that our capacity to be struck by things as mysterious is given.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Okay, thank you.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Thank you so much for a great discussion.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:32.000
What brought to my mind is a little exchange about the eyes and looking at the eyes of the mirror, etc.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000
And the thing that came to me was actually looking through, not at.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:47.000
And I was wondering how from your different disciplines you feel about the ability of looking through.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And I'm very interested in the energies and I was wondering what everybody from their own disciples feel about energies out there.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Psychic, whatever you want to call it, people who are able to do something that we cannot touch and certainly a great mystery.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.000
And what you thought about this.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Anyone up for that?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Sorry.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Next question I think is the...

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
We have two questions. The first one is for Elliot.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:42.000
When you talk about Sufism and the task of Sufismaster is to leave the vow and the biggest vow is the one that helps you see only the other vowels and remove only the other vowels.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
What is that? I'm curious about that biggest vowel.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
My second question is for Michael and the rest of the panel as well.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000
So Michael talk about is our brain powerful enough to understand everything?

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And I was thinking the context of the mystery discussion today seems to be based on our brain only.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:16.000
How about our heart, our soul, our intuition, the neurons in our body, the thing that we can't even, with the limitation of language we can't even talk about.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:29.000
So how does our view about mystery change if you think about all the capacities of all the functions that we can see or unsee?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Well, mystery.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I'll do this one is really the easier one.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Mystery has to do with your capacity and we can bring dogs in here.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So there are things that dogs must think are mysterious because they can't understand them.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So when humans do simple tricks or a magician does a trick and all of a sudden a ball appears and so that's a mystery to you.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And so clearly things that we don't understand I guess that we would put in the basket called mystery.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And the previous, so I don't think it's the size of the prefrontal cortex that's the issue.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
It's the existence of the prefrontal cortex.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:20.000
So probably making it twice as big is not going to really do qualitatively anything different.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:30.000
So maybe we'll be able to do differential equations faster or read Yates faster or whatever.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But so what's the next big thing in evolution that extends our understanding?

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:42.000
What's the next prefrontal cortex that takes us to a higher level?

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.000
And I can't imagine that this is the highest level of understanding that we have.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
So this is good.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
It leads right into the answer.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:48:05.000
So it's very typical for Sufis to speak of the past as a polishing and this involves techniques, testing, meditation and all the rest.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Polishing the heart so that it is a pure mirror.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So actually the imagery of mirror is much older than the modern period.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.000
And in that mirror, the truth will be manifest, will appear.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And the truth, Ahak in Arabic, is the word that they use for the ultimate reality, which is even greater than Allah.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000
It's greater than Yawah, it's greater than all the theistic gods.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:53.000
But when you really go deep into their language, again you're confronted with the paradox that the final veil that is lifted is the veil to think that a final veil can be lifted.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:04.000
That we are always embodied, that's our condition, and there's also something here that's very important with the relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:15.000
So that final veil that cannot be lifted is not only each of our embodied states, but it's the grand embodiment of the cosmos.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And so that the cosmos is concurrently both the manifestation of this truth and its concealment, because that truth cannot be manifest in anything limited, even something as great as the cosmos.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000
It's greater than that.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Yeah, that's the ultimate mystery for us.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Can I say something just quickly? I've been thinking about the image question, and I mean I don't think it wasn't that we weren't interested in it, but that it was to the side of what we were thinking about.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:05.000
And it's true that before language that images are the perceptual material, and we don't know about that because we have only language to get us there.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:16.000
But Yates was particularly interested, I mean, in something like a world of images that precedes language that may even be beyond language.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:34.000
That it's not an irrelevant question, it's just, it's sort of to the side of mystery, but it's a mystery insofar as we can't describe it or communicate it, because it doesn't exist in the materials of our communication, though Yates was certainly going to try.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Even the veil, right?

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Shelly says veil after veil may be removed, but we'll never get to the inmost mystery, that it is the removal of the veil and the tease of the veil, he's quite aware of that as an erotic operation as well.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:51:14.000
When Humphrey, Davey uses that metaphor of science as unveiling and removing, it is the male investigator and she nature that is being unveiled, so that these images are also historically and culturally embedded in ways that bring our critical thinking into play.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
So, I think we wouldn't use that metaphor system now without certain liabilities.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:26.000
So, I just wanted to add that I think the question about images was very important, just to be well yet my mind around it.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But since she said images, in terms of communicating, how come we only use language and not art and music?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Well, I think we do, I mean, music is always interested philosophers because it is wordless and it is sensual.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Yeah, that is not okay. I was going to bring up images and I'm always interested to hear how the scientists and the writer and all the different fields come together on this issue.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And there is an aspect of the collecting of knowledge in order to unveil mystery by history, by the past, by other intellects working on it.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:14.000
And I was just thinking of the problem of in the, around sometime in the 20th century, there was the fascination with artists to start with the tabla raza, instead of preconceiving something,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:26.000
instead of starting where the end is known in the beginning, the concept of working with the naked canvas and seeing where, what you know, where you can go, where is the end result.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:40.000
And many, many writings of artists are always speaking about wanting to start where they let go of everything they've ever heard of all the knowledge they have and even letting go of the self in order to arrive somewhere.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:48.000
They don't know where that somewhere is, but they believe there is a somewhere where something will be revealed that hasn't been revealed yet.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.000
So it's a different kind of process and I'm just, and this now I'm speaking in terms of images.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:11.000
And so maybe any of you have any comments about this concept of the tabla raza wanting to start, and I guess writers too sometimes will want to start somewhere without any preconceived ideas.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Of course, that's not, but it will lead, they believe, somewhere to the new.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I can say as a writer, absolutely, even though I work within a genre, so there are certain expectations within that there's the mystery within the writing of the mystery, which is the moment that it takes a turn.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:46.000
There are some often writers will talk with street writers, I know we'll talk about different characters becoming other things, other than they intended, and it's sort of the, I guess it's the romantic notion of the, or automatic writing or other devices to sort of break free of the traditional

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000
expectations you even had for yourself or the book, much less what the genre expectations are.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:12.000
And when you, when it happens, it feels like you're accessing, you're unconscious in some way and a character does something you didn't think that they were going to do, and it feels like you started over again, and the book has opened out into a whole other area, so the mystery becomes a second mystery to go back to that point, which is great, which is what you write for.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Thank you, next.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Ernie, are you going to be asking a question? Dr. Kafka?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Are you also going to?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.000
I was thinking about it, but I'm still making it.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Because otherwise, the odds will be the last question.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:41.000
From the Buddhist perspective, the phrase, the realm of mystery is a non-secretory, because it presumes that mystery is an ontology rather than an aesthetic.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000
When you use the phrase, cognition.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Cognition is as much faith as it is a method of reasoning.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And when you are referred to the arrogance of science, the presumption that we could know more than our experience in this moment, after all, my experience of you, in this moment, is my creation.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And so, did God create man, or did man create God?

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And there are many people who feel that that is more the reality.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:28.000
So I don't think you've really reached an understanding of what mystery is.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's very personal. My sense of mystery, my sense of awe, my sense of the aesthetic is very personal.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I don't think I could generalize that.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.000
And your presumption is that it can be generalized. I object to that.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Okay. I think we wanted to talk about a topic, so one tried to think of it as a topic to be talked about. That does not preclude your being right.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:09.000
That we tried. Dr. Kafka, do you have a question, Randy?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:25.000
The problem is not having a question. The problem is having too many questions. First of all, it seems to me that if you want to be able to talk about something, you have to limit the subject.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And that was not something that it's easy to do. It's very difficult for me to do. If I could say what the question is, first of all, the question of language, how do you arrive at the definition of what you call language?

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Is it all lexical or inclusive of art, music, painting, etc.? Bob Motherwell once said on a television program when he was asked, yes, I understand what you're doing.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Your actions are supposed to reveal something or communicate something about what your experience is to other people. But tell me, what does it represent your work?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And Motherwell turned to the interviewer and said, what do you represent? Is it a representation that we're looking for in art? Or is it something that one can represent?

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:38.000
And the communication aspect is very important. Now, as far as non-lexical language is concerned, the behavior of crowds, the behavior of animals, the relationships between dogs and humans,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:46.000
dogs can read our minds. They can experience our emotions. And they respond to them according to the way they experience.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Now, whether they ever have invented the idea of what does it all mean, this is another thing. Where does this come from? This idea of meaning.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:13.000
We hear a lot about science, which seems to be an exploration of mechanics. How does something come about what goes into it, whether the physical or whatever laws that are involved with it?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:24.000
But it doesn't explain meaning. I don't think that there is a science of eliciting meaning. And I'd like to know what people think about this. Could we go into it a little bit some other time?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Does anybody want to give a quick answer or are we stopping?

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Science doesn't do meaning. I think we had this discussion earlier, science is about how the world works. And I think we do that very well.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:49.000
And if you, it's like the plumber, if you want your living room decorated, you don't call the plumber. You call the interior decorator. So we do the plumbing very well.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And we do how the universe works extremely well. Okay, thank you very much.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Thank you.
