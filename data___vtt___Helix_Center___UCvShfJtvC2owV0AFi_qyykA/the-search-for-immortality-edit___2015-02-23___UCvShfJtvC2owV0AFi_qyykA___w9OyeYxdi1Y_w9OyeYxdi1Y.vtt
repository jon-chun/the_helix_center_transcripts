WEBVTT

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
They seem quite eager.

02:05.000 --> 02:14.000
But the advent of the mean of the very eager,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
the planet could be made for.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
And we'd have to really do that and look at the mean of it.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Look, I'm going to make a new image,

02:30.000 --> 02:43.000
I need going to change.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Okay.

Yeah.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Okay, we're going to get started.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
healing power of love in the face of early onset Alzheimer's.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Having taken formal Zen vows in 1971, she's interested in the

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
dialogue between two meditative and contemplative practices,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Buddhism and psychoanalysis.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
She maintains a clinical and consulting practice in central

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Vermont and now without further ado.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
I can't move.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Can you turn the recognition off?

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Okay.

06:03.000 --> 06:12.000
I'll start and provoke by saying, my opinion, immortality is both

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
impossible and a bad idea.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But not to be Debbie Downer out of the gate.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
Let me just throw out the idea that the container for immortality

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
is a universe as we understand it, all space and time.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
And we've learned some solidly uncomfortable truths about

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
the universe in the last 50 years, among which is the eventual

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
fate of the universe being a sort of entropic, cold death as the

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
universe fins out, gets sparser, matter decays, galaxies evaporate,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
black holes even evaporate and so on.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
So however we conceive of a continuing conscious entity or

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
entities, it's within a larger context where you're swimming

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
against a pretty fierce current whose name is the second law of

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
thermodynamics.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
And the last point I'll make on that is that Sir Arthur Eddington,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
probably the greatest theoretical astrophysicist of the 20th

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
century, wrote a popular book on thermodynamics and he said,

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
you know, if your pet theory disagrees with observation,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
well, these observationless bongles sometimes.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
But if your theory disagrees with the second law of thermodynamics,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
I get to give you no hope.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
You should kneel an abject humiliation.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Just a little up on that.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I just wanted to sort of put a distinction on the table.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I think that when we talk about immortality,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
we tend to talk about two very different things.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
On the one hand, I would say a lot of things that are classified

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
on that root big would be forms of what I would call living on.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
I'd just say ways in which we search to prolong our lives,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
so the lives of those we love were in these days of climate change

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
for prolonging the life of the planet itself.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
But that form of a desire to live on doesn't seem to be a search

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
for immortality at all.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
That is to say, it's a prolongation of a life that is subject to death

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
and also and it's actually partly animated by that.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
That is part of the reason that I want to prolong my own life

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
and the life of someone I care about is precisely because I say that it can be lost.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
That dynamic of searching to live on or to find ways for us to prolong

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
and enhance our lives is very happening to us.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
But the other thing we talk about, I think when we talk about search for immortality

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
is to search for eternity, which would not be life living on in time,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
but it would be a timeless state of being.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And if you're aiming for eternity, you're not aiming to prolong your life,

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
you're aiming to escape it to a totally different state of being.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
And that doesn't seem to me not only, as you said, impossible, but also undesirable.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Let's say if I were no longer subject to the strictures of time,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
I would no longer be myself, so it wouldn't be form of survival for me at all.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And it doesn't even seem to me to be a consolation.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
So I think that we'll see where we can go.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
But that distinction, for my thinking on these issues,

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
that's a very important primary distinction between like,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
when you're talking about immortality, or you're talking about

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
the site to live on or the site to be eternal.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
So, something to go up there.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Were you saying you were opposed to both of them?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
No, no, no. Just the second one.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't think if I was opposed to the first one,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I probably would be breathing right now.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
So I'm very engaged in the first one.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I think that's a constitutive engagement.

09:43.000 --> 09:54.000
But the idea that it would be desirable to leave behind that condition altogether,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
the condition of mortality altogether, in favor of timelessness of eternity.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
That seems to me something that should not just be held to be impossible,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
but should also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
not even desirable.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
But the fact that I affirm mortality doesn't mean that I want to die.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It means I want to keep on being mortal.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I want to prolong my life in various ways.

10:15.000 --> 10:21.000
The Greeks seem to characterize us as mortals, right?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Right, but it's very interesting.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
It's very interesting shift that happens, though,

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
because you have in, say, Homeric Greek religion.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
You don't have any sense of a salvation through eternity of timelessness.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
On the contrary, the emphasis on the goods of this life, right?

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
But this is precisely what Plato will criticize with Homer,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
saying that, like, well, if that's what you're attaching yourself to,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
you're also attaching yourself to all these forms of suffering,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
and the aim should actually be to exit from that.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And you have something similar happening with the emergence of Hinduism and Buddhism

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
in the East, that is, say, in early Vedic religion, immortality in Sanskrit,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Amatam, just means living for a really long time,

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
or not like 100 years, say, to live on, in that sense.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
Whereas, but then when you start having sort of salvation,

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
religion is emerging, what would eventually become like the Buddhist notion of Nirvana,

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
is precisely saying, no, the wisdom would be to try to exit from that struggle

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
to live on in that sense, and instead enter sort of timeless bliss or eternity.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
So, I think the distinction comes up.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
I would argue a bit about the notion of Nirvana,

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
because in later forms of Buddhism, Nirvana is also subject to impermanence,

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
both Samsara and Nirvana, but just not to enter into casually.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I was just so agreeing with what Chris said,

11:45.000 --> 11:55.000
and that immortality, whether it's an individual immortality for one's own consciousness,

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
or immortality on some other scale,

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
seems to me to be both impossible and undesirable.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
And I know for myself personally, I wouldn't have any investment in being

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
poly young eyes and breath forever.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
I mean, it seems bad enough to be engaged with it, you know,

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
on an ongoing day-to-day basis, and to have and to see the nature of one's limitations

12:23.000 --> 12:29.000
and difficulties, and to think that those would be going on, you know,

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
add infinite about what it seemed to me to be not a very good proposition.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
So, yeah, I was kind of curious about why the subject came up at all,

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
you know, the subject of immortality, because, you know,

12:46.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't know if there are people who are here who are in favor of it.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
I don't know how the subject came up, but it came up.

12:56.000 --> 13:04.000
In your first classification, the first group of immortality.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
But I would just be clear, but, Paul, I'm not saying living on forever.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
I mean, part of the difficulty of that is that, of course, if it would go too long,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
it can become unbearable, et cetera.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And, like, so the first, I'm just saying a lot of things that are often classified

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
as testifying to the sci-fi immortality, already in the OTMA speech symposium,

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
like, to decide to have children, to procreate, all these things are supposedly testified

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
to our innate decipher immortality.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
I think I better understood as a desire to prolong a life in time, not to become eternal,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
and not even to live forever in time, which I think would cancel itself out and become impossible.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
So, but, so I just want to draw that distinction.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
I'm not clear when it stops.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Where it stops?

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
The first distinction you make at which point does it stop and you say,

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
well, I had this much now, I don't want to go any more time for a few more years.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Part of the difficulty, I think, is that there's no fixed measure for that.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That's part of the difficulty of living in time.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
You know, you can die too soon, but you can also die too late.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
And what is too soon or too late, there's no external measure for that.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
That's part of an internal dynamic.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
And it can be this wonderfully smooth sliding scale.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
There's a brilliant press of paper by Freeman Dyson,

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
his studio of advanced studies in the late 1970s.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
It was life in an eternal universe, and he made the point,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
alluding again to thermodynamics, that even in an ancient, you know,

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
an ancient old cold universe, future civilization or life forms could

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
continue almost indefinitely by drawing down,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
by essentially just pacing themselves, you know, diminishing returns

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
into the almost infinite future, and asymptote, as you draw down on the

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
energy of the microwave background radiation, which is free and out there,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
but diminishing in strength.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
So, I mean, that's a continuous, there's no place to put a demarcation and say,

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
this is enough or this is super long and this is immortal.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
And that actually, he was almost making a plausible scenario for how

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
some civilization, not ours, might actually endure for,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
what would seem like a very long time, trillions of years.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
But I would, pertinent to that distinction that you're making,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
is would be the idea of indefinite prolongation, that if we were to know,

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
and we believe we know that the universe will end at a certain,

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
in a certain inconceivably distant time, although I would ask,

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
we've known things with equal certainty in the past that turned out not to be true.

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
So, it's possible that we will know something different in 500 years or 1000 years.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
But if we were to be able to say, on such and such a date,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
this will be the end of the human race.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
What would that do to all human endeavor?

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
There's a wonderful book and movie called Children of Men,

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
whose premise is, at a certain time, human beings stop being able to reproduce.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
And so the people who are alive in the near future know that they're going to be the last human beings.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
And what that does to society and individual psychology,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
it would be, I think, a complete disaster.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
There would be no point in doing anything.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
There would be no higher ambitions, no art, no culture.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
There would be no science.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
There would be no need for any of those things because,

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
sort of, built into the basic structure of our experience of the world is that it goes on.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
And in a certain sense, we can't truly understand the idea of a mortal world, I think.

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
We can't truly accept the idea of a world that's going to end.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
We can accept, to a certain extent, although maybe we can't truly know what it means to accept the fact that we

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
individually, each one of us is going to end.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
But the idea that the entire thing is going to end, all humanity,

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
I think, is as close to unthinkable as we can get.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Well, that's a very important other distinction in the discussion.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
You know, we talk about immortality in the sense of the self,

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
and we're totally attached to the self as a notion and as our actuality that we live with.

17:23.000 --> 17:29.000
But that example is where the collective enduring is what matters.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
And if the collective enduring has no meaning or will be seen to have no meaning,

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
then the personal enduring becomes equally meaningless.

17:39.000 --> 17:48.000
I wonder if there might be something also about the distinction between immortality and eternity

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
that has to do with, on the one hand, the human experience of the unbearability of change,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
and what might happen in the unbearability of the absence of change.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah, I mean, that's part of the dynamic that is captured by what is involved in the horizon of a living on,

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
which ties into what Adam was saying.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
I would just add one thing, but I think that it's true on the one hand that you need to have the sense,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
you need to have a sort of futuro-horizon for our actions to make sense.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
And in that sense, that has to be somehow indefinite.

18:21.000 --> 18:30.000
And that is to say, along with dynamics, but on the other hand, I also think you need to have the sense that it can end.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
And also certainty when exactly it will end.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
So the flip side of what you're describing is that also, yeah, if I had the sense that whatever I care about,

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
I invested in real just endure by itself, the intensity of my commitment to it would also be lessened.

18:46.000 --> 18:54.000
So why it might be true that contemplating the complete extinction of that temporal horizon is something.

18:54.000 --> 19:01.000
You also, part of that dynamic representation is also the sense that it can be lost, and hence has to be sustained.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
And that would go both for individual actions, and I think for a more collective horizon,

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
that part of even when we devote ourselves to a project that extends beyond our conceivable lifetime,

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
part of the reason why we are devoted to it is the sense that, because we have the sense that it will not exist just by itself.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
It has to be sustained by effort in the visual or collective.

19:22.000 --> 19:34.000
So you need your horizon of possible prolongation, but also possible end for the sort of motivational dynamics to be at work, I think.

19:34.000 --> 19:42.000
I also think there's an assumption about life becoming meaningless in the face of impermanence,

19:42.000 --> 19:52.000
and the end of our existence or our world, and that both in Chinese and Japanese Zen,

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
there are forms of practice that would specifically go against any sort of forward thinking.

20:00.000 --> 20:09.000
And to practice with the immediate arising and the impermanent nature of our experience and our perceptions

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
gives a very different feel to life, a very much less future oriented.

20:15.000 --> 20:24.000
In the geography of thought, Richard Nesbitt talks about the real contrast between the Chinese worldview and the Greek worldview,

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
and how the Chinese were never striving for the eternal or the stable or the permanent as the Greeks were.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
And we've been very much more influenced in Western culture by the Greeks,

20:36.000 --> 20:46.000
and we don't have in many ways a frame of reference for, say, the fourth and fifth century Chinese poets,

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
some of whom lived in the mountains by themselves and created art that would fade overnight

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
because they were interested in that experience and not some other enduring experience.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
So I think you can become interested in and sensitive to a deep impermanence

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
that doesn't leave you without meaning if you knew that everything would go away tomorrow.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.000
And yet some people might think that the culture we're embedded in right now is, you know,

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
it's the height of impermanence and evanescence. The clock of the long now, the Stuart Brand project is notable

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
because it's one of the very few endeavors designed to create something that will last hundreds of generations.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
And then in our culture where we have almost impermeable, and durable technologies and materials, we do almost none of that.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.000
I mean, I don't know, it's somewhat paradoxical, the whole issue of permanence and impermanence.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
I mean, within any larger framework, everything is impermanent.

21:52.000 --> 21:58.000
But within a moment-to-moment engagement, it does matter whether you take one position or another

21:58.000 --> 22:09.000
favoring something like a limitless future versus a very, very short moment that arises and passes away.

22:09.000 --> 22:17.000
And, you know, so in many of the Buddhist forms, and again, particularly the earlier Chinese,

22:17.000 --> 22:25.000
there are practices to, you know, focus you on this kind of deep impermanence,

22:25.000 --> 22:36.000
and that that is the value of becoming aware of that, which, you know, if there were some greater understanding of it in our society,

22:36.000 --> 22:48.000
perhaps there would be less fear of one's own death, and less engagement in exhaustive health interventions right at the end of life,

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
which is something that I thought you were kind of going after in something that you said earlier,

22:54.000 --> 23:05.000
that there are pragmatic reasons to maybe revision what it means to die, you know, at this period of time.

23:05.000 --> 23:17.000
Because so many people invest in extending their lives by a very short period of time right at what they take to be their dying time.

23:17.000 --> 23:30.000
They want to go for a month more or two weeks more or whatever, and it's very, very expensive and often also very costly in terms of pain and suffering.

23:30.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah. Just to put a little bit of pressure on what you were saying first. I mean, because there's a version I think where the embrace of impermanence,

23:40.000 --> 23:49.000
the supposed embrace of impermanence is actually a very established way of trying to gain eternity in the sense of like becoming

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
immune or invulnerable to the experience of loss, starting to say like, so a lot of these strategies, we have them in Western stoicism for example,

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
where like the reason you're told that it would be wise to stop being future-oriented is because when you're future-oriented,

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
you're giving hostages to the future to something that's unpredictable, and you're attached to something that can be taken away from you.

24:11.000 --> 24:22.000
And I would say that's the real experience of mortality. And the aspiration to be more talented aternities is to try to get a state where you would be invulnerable to that type of loss.

24:22.000 --> 24:29.000
So the sort of Buddhist practice you're talking to me, for me, like for example, trying to gain eternity in the sense of not living forever,

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
but of being immune to the experience of loss. Because if I don't invest in the future, I can't lose anything. I'm just in the moment.

24:36.000 --> 24:46.000
But I think, for me that's not really embracing impermanence because that's actually for you to experience something as impermanence

24:46.000 --> 24:54.000
and to have like sort of a pain and a force to it. You have to be projecting towards at least the temporary permanence.

24:54.000 --> 25:03.000
And I think that this attempt to be in the moment is another attempt to be exempt from time or exempt from the sort of pain of mortality.

25:03.000 --> 25:11.000
Maybe in early Buddhist practices it was initially, but as Buddhism evolved over time, especially in the Chinese forums,

25:11.000 --> 25:20.000
that shifted somewhat. I think in the early Taravadun forums there was a desire to get off the wheel of Samsara

25:20.000 --> 25:29.000
and not to actually continue. And as you get into the Mahayana forums, they really are more about staying in experience,

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
but recognizing its impermanence and staying with that impermanence. So it does change over the history.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
I mean, I would agree with you about early Buddhism that it was.

25:41.000 --> 25:47.000
I think it's true of my own. It's the thing, I think it's still in that end, but we can have that discussion.

25:47.000 --> 25:54.000
I was going to ask from, if you could take a cultural perspective on, you know, it doesn't have to be purely Western culture,

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
but the dominant culture and economic force of the planet where a femmer are all around us.

26:00.000 --> 26:06.000
And yet we sort of act as if we have infinite resources, etc. What is your take on that?

26:06.000 --> 26:15.000
Well, I mean, one way to think about it is that we've moved from a long period, maybe all of human history,

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
until the last two or three hundred years, in which people were confident of some kind of personal immortality,

26:22.000 --> 26:34.000
even if the, let's say from Christianity, we have the West, very invested in the idea of personal immortality to the extent that

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
it becomes impossible to think outside the idea of immortality.

26:37.000 --> 26:45.000
So I think of someone like Maimonides, for example, Maimonides develops a highly intellectualized idea of what it means to be eternal,

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
that you're eternal if you think about God that you participate in his eternity,

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
and that it's sort of an intellectual eternity, and that's something that Spinoza picks up on later.

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
But even in that sense, there has to be some accommodation to the idea of eternity.

27:01.000 --> 27:09.000
To a materialist view of the world in which eternity is the one thing that we are not allowed to imagine or envision for ourselves.

27:09.000 --> 27:17.000
And I think that the idea that you would want to prolong your life, for example, even for a week or a month,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
doesn't that make perfect sense if life is the only value?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I mean, outside of life there's no value.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
So if there's no eternity, if values are something that we create and posit for ourselves in the course of our lives,

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
then not to be alive is to lose the chance to participate in that process completely.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
It makes perfect sense that you would want to stay alive as long as you possibly could, even under adverse circumstances,

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
even from a sort of prudential point of view, then from a metaphysical point of view, it makes sense.

27:45.000 --> 27:54.000
And that goes hand in hand with the decline, I think, of the idea of immortality as a form of glory.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
In other words, the idea that you would create an artwork that would outlast time,

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
that you would have permanent glory from something that you had made or done, that your name would live on,

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
I think is an ambition that very few artists today share.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
When you're talking about self-destructing artwork, so there's a thing of tangoly and the idea that you would make something that's designed to decay.

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
Again, something that would have been quite foreign, at least in Western tradition, up until the last hundred years,

28:21.000 --> 28:27.000
but now we're sort of forced to confront it, it's a major change.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
It's a change that goes so deep that it's, I think, even hard to conceptualize.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
And in a way, alienates us from a lot of our own cultural heritage, because it depends on assumptions that we can no longer truly share.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
This is a little random, but I think physicists of my acquaintance, and that was my original training,

28:47.000 --> 28:54.000
they sort of reached for immortality through mathematics, because they believe it to be, in a platonic sense,

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
an ideal that holds not just in this part of space-time, but elsewhere, could be discovered by other sentient creatures

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
and creates in the practitioner at some level, transcendental experience, and so on.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
It's an interesting thing. I haven't reached that level, but I've got close to people who haven't explained it well.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
So you don't? I mean, I was listening to Brian Green and one of these things talking at the Rubin Museum,

29:20.000 --> 29:30.000
and he was advocating that position, but it always seems to me peculiar, because my background is as a developmental psychologist,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Piageti, and that kind of thing.

29:32.000 --> 29:41.000
And so I don't understand how mathematics, then, as a practice, falls outside of subjectivity.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
How could it, because human beings have practiced it and invented it?

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
So how could it be the language of God, for example?

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
No, you're right. There's overreach there, and I think Max Tegmark, who's a colleague, I like him and know him well,

29:59.000 --> 30:08.000
he espouses the layers of reality and awareness and the fundamental, you know, Pythagorean idea of a mathematical universe,

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
and it's an aesthetic. I mean, it's a pure aesthetic, and as an aesthetic, I agree.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
It's locus, is it an arcychean and an arcycology?

30:17.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah, I don't, I think that's a conceit to imagine that it's universal in the way that that's sometimes presented.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That's really...

30:26.000 --> 30:35.000
Just a full of what Adam was saying. I mean, I agree with a lot of the sort of canvas that you painted for us,

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
but again, I think once one distinguishes between aspirations to live on with specializations to eternity,

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
I think some of the discontinuities that you outline are less forceful.

30:47.000 --> 30:56.000
So as distinct from, say, Christian aspiration to eternity, the ambition for the artwork to live on,

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
you know, I mean, if you think about the poetic expressions of this in Shakespeare, or Keats, et cetera,

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
there's an intense awareness, both of the possibility to live on, say, through the breadth of the speaker

31:06.000 --> 31:11.000
who will reanimate the poem, but there's also an intense sense of like, this is not a given,

31:11.000 --> 31:19.000
it can just be left to die, not reanimated by the reader, and even if it is reanimated, that's not about eternity.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
It's precisely about prolonging its capacity to speak across the ages, you know, and so that's an investment.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
What we call poetic immortality, I think, is actually an investment in a certain form of living on,

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
and I think we can, and which is, you know, another version of that is what you yourself recognize as relevant in contemporary world,

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
that I want to live for another week or another two weeks.

31:40.000 --> 31:48.000
So that dimension of our aspiration to live on, I think we can recognize across the ages much more,

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
and I think that maybe we can have it more explicit now because we don't have to be the same extent

31:53.000 --> 32:02.000
of investment in an opposing concept of eternity, but I do think that, I mean, I'm someone who works professional literature,

32:02.000 --> 32:12.000
and I, as you do too, and I certainly don't feel alienated from the pathos of key, so Shakespeare, in their investment in poetry's capacity to live on.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
I just don't think that has anything to do with a commitment to eternity or a norm, in very many ways,

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
a materialist conception because it depends on the material of the poems, surviving, reanimated, etc.

32:24.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, well, maybe it's because in the classical or Christian world you had a confidence in the perpetuity of human civilization.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
In other words, you didn't envision a catastrophic end to your civilization,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
whereas we live with that possibility all the time and basically take it for granted in a certain way.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.000
I think if you asked most people today what they believe will there be civilization in a thousand years,

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
I don't know what the answer would be, but I assume that many or if not most people would probably say no.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
And then the question is, what are we, what are you doing it for?

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
I mean, the Romans, for example, so Horace says,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
Horace says, non-omnus moriara will not, not all of me will die.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
The part of me that lives on is the poem, but if you know that the poem is going to die,

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
then in fact all of you does die.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
And that's the situation that I think artists today are faced with.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.000
So there has to be a much more, I mean, that's a sort of postmodern aesthetic,

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
the idea that what you're doing is not for the ages, it's not for eternity,

33:26.000 --> 33:34.000
it's not meant to synthesize all of human experience, but it's an intervention, it's playful, it's rearrangement,

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
something like that, which can look sort of like you're playing in the ruins of a culture that we no longer

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
really sustain.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
I guess it's still different from me between the ages and for eternity, I would say, like,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
I guess I don't, especially in Shakespeare and Keith's,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
great examples of this sort of aesthetic.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
I don't see their investment in say, poetry's capacity to live on,

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
to be dependent on a notion that they will always be someone to read.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
It's just the horizon that someone can read it and reanimate it.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
So, so...

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
But there always has to be at least someone, right?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Right, but there could also be no one.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I mean, I think that's a part of the pathos of these, there's a sense in both Keats and Ticks,

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
but it's also possible that like, that me having written this does not guarantee

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
that it will be reanimated, there's a chance.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
But there's also the possibility that no one would read it, and that would be left to its own

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
or even destroyed in its material support.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
And I don't think that prospect would have dissuaded them from their investment in poetry.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
If you think about the sonnets, I'm going to take some intense,

34:45.000 --> 34:50.000
an intense sense of absolute mortality there is in the sonnets, you know?

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
And just as the father of the second author, it generates a counter response.

34:55.000 --> 35:00.000
But that counter response is partly animated by the sense that that threat is very real and irreducible.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
So...

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
Was that why they were doing it? Was that important part of the rationale on the motivation?

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Absolutely.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
And just as I think that like, whatever we do is informed by a sense that if we don't do it,

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
it will not be, and even if we do it, it might not last.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
And that's both an inspiration and inspiration to fear.

35:22.000 --> 35:29.000
As opposed to just being able to express in the moment a truth of a culture or a human truth

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
and convey it to others, that's not sufficient.

35:32.000 --> 35:35.000
I think we never live in just a moment.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
We all live in a sort of future horizon.

35:38.000 --> 35:48.000
I wonder if there has been a change though in our aesthetic as well as what might take to be sort of an

35:48.000 --> 35:56.000
assumptive framework since our understanding of entropy and uncertainty, principle and

35:56.000 --> 36:04.000
relativity, all of these things that have come about through the natural sciences and have

36:04.000 --> 36:15.000
essentially given a kind of an umbrella to our culture for understanding its devolution or whatever.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
If that's sort of permanently changed our perspective in a way that then we could read back into the

36:23.000 --> 36:36.000
semantics even more of this sort of engagement with something that would be like the conflict

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
between permanence and impermanence.

36:39.000 --> 36:47.000
I feel like we've changed a great deal in this recent period of time since modernity basically,

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
and that we're still reacting to those changes as a culture.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
I wonder if they could lead to a place where there would be, and maybe this is making a big leap,

37:01.000 --> 37:06.000
but a greater acceptance of individual death.

37:06.000 --> 37:12.000
That it is not something to be fought so strongly.

37:12.000 --> 37:20.000
I saw the movie Interstellar recently, and I was really kind of unhappy with the second half of it.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
I thought it was kind of a mess even though it had a lot of consulting from physicists and so on.

37:26.000 --> 37:38.000
But there was the Dylan Thomas poem weaving its way through there about not going gently into the night.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.000
I was thinking, gosh, that seems out of line with the movie somehow.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
I don't know.

37:45.000 --> 37:53.000
It seems to me there are sensibilities that are arising, and not just in academic frameworks,

37:53.000 --> 38:02.000
but in the popular realm as well, that would say it might be possible to accept endings,

38:02.000 --> 38:13.000
accept one's own death, accept the deep uncertainty of our existence, that that might be kind of cool.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
That seems to be a change.

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
And yet it exists in parallel with a quite well-funded research agenda to reproduce us in Silicon,

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
as well as that can be done, or computationally in some generic sense that we don't quite understand, but it's motivated.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Who funds that?

38:32.000 --> 38:43.000
It happens a lot in California, the military industrial complex funds part of it, the NSF funds some of it.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
It's funded all over the place.

38:45.000 --> 38:53.000
Up the road from where I live in Phoenix, Alcor has 250 frosties on liquid nitrogen lasting first out.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
You just hope the technology gets better.

38:56.000 --> 39:02.000
I mean, this may be just, again, a sort of stupid sideline, but are those just very wealthy individuals?

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
Who want to be, who get a chance to leap in?

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
I met a very wealthy Chinese man at a conference that I did in Switzerland this summer, and he said,

39:11.000 --> 39:21.000
oh, there's no question that we'll be able to extend human life to at least 300 years, and there are a lot of people signing up for it.

39:21.000 --> 39:28.000
And there are a few of those, but they're mostly sort of tech-age programmers, visionaries, slash nerd, whatever.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
And there are a few, although this is illegal and not subdue to see that it sort of knew that they didn't want to go out old,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
so they euthanized quite young.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
So there are some that are frozen who are in their twenties.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's a true romantic sense.

39:41.000 --> 39:48.000
But isn't it, I mean, there is much less anxiety about being immortal than there is about being mortal.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
Less anxiety, did you say?

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
But being immortal, I don't see people being afraid that, oh, you know, I'm panicked because I'm going to be immortal,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
but people are scared about that.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
They don't want to look at dying, they don't want to look at mortality.

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
It's avoided constantly, except in an intellectual way.

40:07.000 --> 40:17.000
So even though you say, the eternity and so on is not something that is sought after, but people want to live forever.

40:17.000 --> 40:32.000
And I'm not so sure at which point somebody, if you could take a pill that you took it once a day and after the age of 25, 26, 30, you didn't age,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
you stayed the same and you kept going.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
At which point would you start taking the pill?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
Thank you because that ties into something.

40:40.000 --> 40:50.000
So part of the point of the distinction from me is it's very important just because I don't want to be eternal doesn't mean that I want to die.

40:50.000 --> 40:59.000
In fact, the reason I don't want to be eternal is that that would be the death of me, that there would be no life left for me to live in eternity.

40:59.000 --> 41:08.000
So personally, I don't think, I want to distinguish very sharply, and maybe this is a different point, between the rejection of eternity and the so-called acceptance of mortality.

41:08.000 --> 41:22.000
I'm not sure that we know what we mean by accepting uncertainty or accepting death, because if that means being able to embrace it fully, then I would say, if I accept uncertainty in that sense, there is no longer uncertainty.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Part of the difficulty of uncertainty is that I can't embrace it because I don't know what it's going to be.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
It's not something I can accept in advance.

41:28.000 --> 41:37.000
And similarly, if I can accept death in the sense of I'm fine with that I die or that my beloved dies, I no longer have a relation to death as death.

41:37.000 --> 41:46.000
So I think that it's not a matter of accepting death, but accepting that I will never accept it.

41:46.000 --> 42:03.000
That is to say, and that you can't settle that limit in advance, that again, I could live too long, I could live too short, but there's no way in which I can adjust my status in such a way that I'm prepared in advance to the difficulty in pain or uncertainty in death.

42:03.000 --> 42:16.000
I think that the idea that we could master that relation to uncertainty and death through some sort of acceptance, I think I'm very very about that way of thinking.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
I mean, though you seem to make this contrast between uncertainty and living.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Like living seems to have a lot of uncertainty and not just death.

42:26.000 --> 42:46.000
So living actually means facing uncertainty. So the degree to which one faces that uncertainty is actually perhaps related to something of one's engagement with life itself, rather than with the rigidities of self protection.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Absolutely.

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
And so it doesn't seem to me to be the case that uncertainty is necessarily connected to death.

42:54.000 --> 43:04.000
No, absolutely not. I mean, but uncertainty is a lot of talking about, but my point is precisely it's because I'm engaged in living that uncertainty is difficult.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
You know, I mean, it's part of course what Mike's life worth living.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
It's absolutely certain nothing could happen.

43:09.000 --> 43:18.000
But it also means that there is no way in which I can just accept that uncertainty.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
If I could accept that uncertainty, I would be ready for anything come with me, you know, and I wouldn't be particularly engaged in something.

43:25.000 --> 43:43.000
So I don't think that part of, to use the word, accepting the necessity of being engaged in life is also accepting that that exposes me to an uncertainty that I cannot master in advance.

43:43.000 --> 43:51.000
And I'm worried about them saying like, well, that very thing itself would allow me to master it by saying I won't try to master it.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
I don't think that works.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
No, well, it depends on what you mean by mastery.

43:54.000 --> 44:06.000
But, you know, this is another movie reference and I didn't actually see this movie, but just had a conversation about it today, which is only lovers left alive.

44:06.000 --> 44:18.000
Is that the right title? About the vampires? And so these are people, these are beings, vampires, and they often seem to me cast in this way who can go on living from life time.

44:18.000 --> 44:29.000
They're taking the pill every day so that they can remain, you know, they age slowly, I guess, but they remain alive for a very long time.

44:29.000 --> 44:38.000
And as I understand the movie, the main protagonist, a couple, they're rather bored with it.

44:38.000 --> 44:53.000
I mean, they've seen everything, they've done everything, they've been around for centuries, they've engaged all the great thinkers and all the great art, and they're kind of like, yeah, okay, you know, because there's no novelty anymore.

44:53.000 --> 45:04.000
And novelty is so motivating for all of us, and when it wears thin, well, you know, life doesn't seem so wonderful.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
I don't know why they would assume that there is no novelty, since there is novelty constantly.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Since I didn't see the movie, I can't.

45:12.000 --> 45:22.000
Right, and so I'm not that argument about getting bored, unless one experiences it, I don't see how it would be the case.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
There will be new things constantly just in the last 20 years.

45:26.000 --> 45:44.000
In fact, when I think about the only times I think about dying with any kind of negative feeling is when I think, gee, look how far we came in technology the last 20 years, I'm going to miss what's going to happen in 25 years.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
I won't know what great thing is going to happen next.

45:48.000 --> 45:55.000
Just to be clear, I have nothing against the pill. I think it sounds great.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
I mean, that is to say, like, because that pill is, I don't have it on foot.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
No, I have it to you.

46:01.000 --> 46:17.000
But, I mean, that pill is a means towards the end of living on, and look, and it has more talent to build into it, because it's very important that you have the capacity to not take the pill, if you come to a certain point where you no longer have that desire, but I don't see, I'm not making an argument against the desire to live on again.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
And I think we could live for a really long time without it becoming unbearable.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
That would depend on a lot of factors.

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
But living a long time has nothing to do with being eternal.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Being eternal is not living a long time at all. It's being outside of time.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
And to the side of that, that I'm calling into question.

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
So I think, you know, I don't have any principle objections to all sorts of medical attempts to prolong our lives.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
But I don't think that.

46:40.000 --> 46:47.000
You don't think ideas, especially religious ideas about eternity have to do with living a long time?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Absolutely not.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
And all religious authorities are extremely clear on this.

46:51.000 --> 47:01.000
At least all so-called post-axial religions, which we're calling, were very clear distinctions between analogous to what I'm saying, living on an eternity, that it's not a matter of prolonging this life.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
It's a matter of, like, sighted being that life to an end, of, like, resting in peace.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
This is what Augustine says about being god.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
But there are religions where they say, when you die, you then meet your family.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
No, that's not a promise. That's not a promise that any religion makes, actually.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
Mormons do that.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
I mean, like, in the sense, like, Mormons make that it's very much part of the Mormon religion.

47:24.000 --> 47:35.000
I see what you mean by that, but I think you have to distinguish, first of all, between the most advanced philosophical statement of religion and the way it's commonly lived and perceived by people.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
And so, for instance, the other day, the Pope ostensibly said that pets would go to heaven.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Although, then, today, there was a story saying, in fact, that's not what he said.

47:44.000 --> 48:00.000
But the idea that your pet would go to heaven, or what we sometimes hear about Islam, that you would get sex slaves in heaven, we think of that with disdain, because we think of that as a category mistake, exactly the category mistake that you're talking about, the difference between living on an eternity.

48:00.000 --> 48:08.000
But there's also the idea of a last judgment that you resume your body, that your soul will find its body in Judaism.

48:08.000 --> 48:16.000
You're not supposed to cremate or sever someone's body, because it has to be whole for the resurrection.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
So, I think that there's a tension there.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
It's not strictly true that religion doesn't teach that.

48:21.000 --> 48:29.000
Although, if you were to talk to, again, a maimonities or an Aquinas or something like that, they would have a much more sophisticated idea, but I don't think that that's probably what 95 percent of religion is.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
That's just what the Alcor people are hoping for.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
And it's a cut price. It's only 80,000 for the head.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
Why would you pay 150,000 for the body? You'll get a much better body anyway.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
There's a big difference, though, because it's the incorruptible body.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
It's very key to saying, it's not the same.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
So, if what I want is my corruptible central body.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
But there's an identity as the key thing.

48:53.000 --> 48:59.000
Exactly how that identity should be fought is a very difficult issue.

48:59.000 --> 49:10.000
When it comes to the idea of this existential consolation, anyone who takes their religious belief in turn seriously will run up against that problem.

49:10.000 --> 49:19.000
Because even then, the one who stress the compatibility of, say, love of God as we have Christian strength with the love of your neighbor, you'll love it.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
The means and distinctions are very important. You say, you don't love your beloved or someone else.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
You only love them as a means towards the end of loving God. You should not love them as an end in themselves.

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
Because if you do, you're bound to experience irrevocable laws.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
Because them as an end in itself will be lost.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
You can love them as a means towards the end of God.

49:37.000 --> 49:45.000
So, I think that the reason, of course, in popular ways, because people tend to be invested in this living on rather than eternity.

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
What I'm saying is that that's not something that a religious notion of eternity actually promises you.

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
And I have nothing against the pathos of wanting to see your beloved again.

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
I sympathize with that. But I think that's very distinct from the desire to be eternal.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Sounds like a good light, though.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Say what you think.

50:06.000 --> 50:13.000
No, this is all very earedite. All I would say is just from as a psychologist and an egghead researcher,

50:13.000 --> 50:22.000
you most, quote, average people don't really make subtle distinctions.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
I would argue that the essence of humanity is a disinclination to die.

50:27.000 --> 50:35.000
And that, since minute one, a central dynamic that has motivated just about everything that people do,

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
whether they're aware of it or not. And I would argue on empirical as well as theoretical grounds,

50:40.000 --> 50:50.000
as we're in Freud's house, that unconscious death anxiety is what underlies the urge to immortality

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
in the sense that Martin refers to it, not prolongation, but eternity.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
And I agree with what everyone has been saying that this was not a great idea.

51:01.000 --> 51:09.000
Moreover, I would argue that one way to think about conditions in modernity is that

51:09.000 --> 51:18.000
ways of managing death anxiety in the form of different kinds of what Otto Ron called immortality ideologies

51:18.000 --> 51:29.000
that have served us well, no longer do so. And we now see the urge for immortality manifested in a variety of

51:29.000 --> 51:38.000
distinctly negative ways, you know, including degrading the environment, just a persistent pursuit

51:38.000 --> 51:47.000
of money and stuff, you know, protracted ethnic hatred and violence, not to say that the urge to immortality

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
is the sole explanation of any of those difficulties. But I don't think we can understand any of those

51:53.000 --> 52:01.000
without considering the malignant effects of the urge to immortality gone awry.

52:01.000 --> 52:09.000
It's interesting to consider the distinction between the fear of the loss of the corporeal being and the loss of the self

52:09.000 --> 52:14.000
and just as a hypothetical because it's, you know, people write and talk about it.

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
You know, suppose that the mind uploading concept, you know, has some traction.

52:20.000 --> 52:25.000
Just imagine people start trying to play that out. We could disbelieve it completely, that's fine.

52:25.000 --> 52:33.000
It's just a rhetorical device. And then is that what, is that going to satisfy that fear, appease it?

52:33.000 --> 52:42.000
What if the same capability to disconnect ourself from our physical body goes along with a completely plausible

52:42.000 --> 52:50.000
technology to pool the consciousness? What if we gain an ability to not be solotons in our bodies through that

52:50.000 --> 52:58.000
reality? That would recast some of these debates in an interesting way. I mean, I would almost, I don't, as a, the humanist

52:58.000 --> 53:09.000
in me, of course, has some significant abhorrence, but the, you know, the curious, curiosity driven scientist wants to see what happens, you know.

53:09.000 --> 53:17.000
Well, I think that for these anxieties disappear or they're the best therapy for them is a belief in the transcendental.

53:17.000 --> 53:25.000
But it doesn't have to be personally mortality. If you were to be convinced that, as people speculate now, say that our reality is a

53:25.000 --> 53:32.000
simulation and that there's a higher order of reality for which our reality is a simulation. That, in and of itself, would

53:32.000 --> 53:40.000
alleviate a lot of death anxiety because then you would be positing a higher order of reality that our existence serves in some way.

53:40.000 --> 53:47.000
And that's only a contemporary, you know, 21st century metaphor for the thing that religion is always offered, which is the sense that there's a point to

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
it. And it's, in a sense, it's the pointlessness or the meaninglessness that is really intolerable rather than finitude.

53:55.000 --> 54:05.000
Because as you could say, we're born towards death. We have our being towards death always. It's impossible to imagine a form of life that isn't about death

54:05.000 --> 54:12.000
and dying. It's impossible to imagine that. And that's why the idea of freezing your head seems so childish and so sort of stupid is because

54:12.000 --> 54:19.000
it's like you're making a mistake. You don't understand what it is you're really afraid of. If we could believe that the death has a

54:19.000 --> 54:29.000
purpose that it serves a higher purpose, that would take much of the sting out of it. But that's the faith that I think we've lost for the last couple hundred years.

54:29.000 --> 54:37.000
The most important thing on that is the moral philosophers have weighed in on the simulation hypothesis. And there is a completely

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
reasonable philosophical argument for a golden rule and the fact that you would not be an e-list even if you thought you lived in a simulation.

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
So that always makes me feel a little bit better about living in a simulation.

54:48.000 --> 55:00.000
I agree with you completely on all of that. And that really the deeper anxiety that's called death anxiety is about meaninglessness.

55:00.000 --> 55:11.000
And also, in talking about how, I think it's wrong to generalize also about people in their attitudes towards their own death or dying.

55:11.000 --> 55:23.000
And certainly, because ideal, I supervise a number of psychologists and have recently supervised a case where there was a suicide of a young person.

55:23.000 --> 55:35.000
And it was one of these situations where everything seemed ideal. And it was really difficult to imagine. And it seemed ultimately that maybe there was

55:35.000 --> 55:51.000
really an insult to this woman's ideals. And that was the reason why she killed herself. And so people can kill themselves over what looks like from another person's point of view as a pretty trivial offense.

55:51.000 --> 56:01.000
Now, of course, there can be other things like the Robin Williams suicide where there maybe are multiple factors and things that anyone could fairly well identify with.

56:01.000 --> 56:25.000
But the issue of some sort of transcendental meaning or something that gives meaning that would go beyond death seems to be a very important issue that perhaps needs to be looked at from the more pragmatic point of view again of the situation that we're in as a society,

56:25.000 --> 56:42.000
having so many people who are going to be going through the dying and death process. And the tremendous overload that can make on our system if everyone is terrified and wants to live that extra one week or a month or whatever,

56:42.000 --> 56:59.000
is really because they have no means of seeing death as an interesting adventure, as a developmental point, as a process that is meaningful in itself. And it seems like we have tended as a culture to,

56:59.000 --> 57:18.000
again, I don't want to overdo this because when I'm saying we here, I'm talking about educated, fairly elite people have tended to see death as kind of the end, like not very interesting, not really the next adventure, just the finishing point.

57:18.000 --> 57:39.000
I mean, I think there's still plenty of people in our culture who don't see it that way, but as a certain kind of living in a certain sort of more educated intellectual environment, one can see that there's been this turn towards the meaninglessness of death, rather than it being meaningful.

57:39.000 --> 57:50.000
People who want to do it on their own terms, over 20,000 people signed up with Mars one for a one way trip to Mars, mostly young people, equally male, female.

57:50.000 --> 57:55.000
And that's a perfect example of everyone who's going to die if there's a meaning.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Yeah, that was a meaning.

57:56.000 --> 58:08.000
So, magnetically and philosophically though, I want to question the idea that we should try to overcome the anxiety of death. I mean, I attenuate in various ways, sure, but I think that it's,

58:08.000 --> 58:19.000
yeah, yeah, yeah, because I mean, if you take that idea seriously, that one would see death as not as the end of a person's life, but as an interesting adventure, the next step.

58:19.000 --> 58:31.000
I mean, it seems to me like the most irresponsible view possible, that is to say, like, I mean, part of the reason why I have responsibility for someone else's life or for my own life is that it can irrevocably end.

58:31.000 --> 58:40.000
That really is destructible. And I think, and that should, and if there was no level of anxiety before that, there would also be no level of care for that life.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
So I don't think that, this is, I don't think that we should.

58:43.000 --> 58:48.000
This is really overstating it. I mean, I'm a psychoanalyst. There's anxiety in everything.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
I mean, you can't escape anxiety. There's no ending of anxiety. There's just a working with it in the different way.

58:54.000 --> 59:02.000
I'm saying, but the idea that that's a shortcoming that we can't overcome it, that I think is a mistake.

59:02.000 --> 59:11.000
I mean, I think we should recognize that anxiety is both productive and debilitating, but it's not something that one should even in principle try to eradicate.

59:11.000 --> 59:20.000
You can't, the truth of the matter is that you cannot leave without anxiety because all anxiety is a signal to you that there is danger.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
Yes. And without it, you cannot, well, without it, you can't survive.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Now there is, however, this issue of anxiety about dying.

59:28.000 --> 59:40.000
And I wanted to see if your feeling is the same, that that anxiety in terms of the ideas that attach to them varies throughout life.

59:40.000 --> 59:55.000
That for a 21, 20 year old, the anxiety about dying is attached to different ideas and different fantasies than it is to a 40 year old or a 60 year old or an 80 year old.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Let's say a 40 year old, the anxiety may be very much connected to leaving his children. What will happen to his children? What will happen to his wife?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
To a 20 year old, it may be that he didn't have enough fun and didn't go enough dancing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:21.000
So the anxiety is fundamental. It's part of, I think, being human, and I probably also in the animal, certainly also in the animal kingdom.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The anxiety is fundamental. The ideas attaching to it vary.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And I think what you are talking about is that if he's possible at some point in life based on disease or mental deterioration or whatever, to contemplate that I can somehow surmount this anxiety and end of life.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Sorry.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But through a cognitive effort, you can't silence the anxiety. It can't be extinguished, but it can be cognitively softened or modified.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Well, what Adam was saying about meaning is really what I was saying. So anxiety is present, uncertainty is present in all aspects of living and dying.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:23.000
But what does the activity mean? Why are we investing ourselves into something like becoming a parent, for example?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:34.000
You know, you know that you're going to be poor, you know that you're going to be worn out by it, you know that in the long run, your friends who don't have children are actually doing better than the ones that do.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I mean, there are many reasons why you could say to yourself, that's not a very good thing to invest in.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But there's some larger meaning that is active in your investment.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And it is coming sort of, it mixes with or integrates into the anxiety.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:09.000
The anxiety then really is, as Freud said, it's not, anxiety is different from fear in the sense that it's the sense of being threatened by a person.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And it's not a clear and present danger, whereas fear is the response to something that is a clear and present danger.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So that sense of being threatened is, you know, I think that whole issue of the distinction between anxiety and fear is a big, both neuroscientific and psychoanalytic problem that has not been resolved.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But it's just a meaning that's connected with that engagement, you know, and so if you're going to engage with death in a meaningful way, you're, yes, you'll be anxious and so on, but you'll be heading into it with more the sense, you might say even enthusiasm, you know, than if it seems like a meaningless

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:01.000
and stupid end to your existence after which there is nothing or, you know, after which there is just the loss of everything and whatever else.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So the way that you imagine it, I guess, you know, the way you understand it within whatever your collective framework is for the meaning of death.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I think it's very significant.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But part of the problem in that in terms of meaning is that it's very hard to not carry it into death, the feelings and ideas that we have while living.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So we have the fantasy that when we die, even though we don't say it that way, but emotionally it's almost as if, well, I'll miss my children.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Well, you're not going to miss anything. There's nothing to miss. There's nothing to recognize. There's nothing to realize. It's over.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:03.000
But it's very hard to think of it that way. Spontaneously we always think of somehow we are going to feel some pain because of something.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So what I'm taking from this is that the desire, the natural, the fear of death mapping into a desire for life extension or longevity, extreme or otherwise,

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000
absent a known strategy for coping with the anxiety and fear themselves is completely irrational, right?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
You shouldn't have those two things going together.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Oh, say that again.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The natural desire for life extension or increased longevity, if it's not coupled with an aware strategy for mitigating or dealing with the fear of anxiety that is just going to be present even more as you live longer,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
it would make an international viewpoint.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But the meaning of question though, doesn't have to be something that I believe is itself immune from destruction.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So the fact that I have children and thereby I invest in something that goes beyond my own death and that might give my life greater purpose,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
that meaning doesn't depend on me. I think that my children in turn will live forever.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
The greater product that Adam was mentioning, I do think that our lives need to be tapped into a greater project.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:20.000
But that project itself does not have to be conceived as itself indestructible as opposed to my destructible, finite existence.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:33.000
The idea that meaning requires on some level indestructibility, I think that's an inference that we don't have to accept.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But that also means, if you don't do that, then it also means that if it will be destroyed and you're investigating it continuing,

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
then you will have some level of anxiety and fear of death, which is not irrational.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:56.000
That would be rational in that case. If I want something to persist, it can be the political product I'm invested in, the community, etc.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That doesn't have to do with that. I will persist. But I still have a rational fear of the possibility that I will not persist.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And that's not something I think you can.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And the idea that we should try to overcome that sort of fear has always been starting with a Socrates-Fato, that the Plato's-Fato,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000
that the idea that the proper philosophical idea related to death would be equanimity.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:29.000
The wise man thinks at least the world about death, Sespenoza, and whether you're an Epicurean materialist or a Platonist metaphysician,

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:37.000
in relation to death, you still think your task is to overcome the fear of death, somehow proving that it's irrational to fear death.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Whereas I actually think that there are certainly irrational forms of fear of death, but I think there's a rational kernel to the fear of death,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:49.000
which proceeds from the desire to live or decide for something to live on.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And that is irreducible and incurable. And we can develop various ways of coping and negotiating and attenuating that.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
But I don't think that.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:08.000
The desire to live essentially means that from the time you are born and you keep moving in life, your investment is in life.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Your investment is not in death.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And that's what I'm saying. That's what irrational is.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So what about another hypothetical pill that by some clever psychochemistry removes the fear and the anxiety?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
How does that change the individual and the culture, even more interestingly?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The lender of the vegetables.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Yeah.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Completely.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Don't tens of millions of people try to take pills like that all the time.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I mean, there are pills like that that are supposed to relieve anxiety and depression.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Whether it's supposed to.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Yeah.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And they haven't worked that well. The thing that I guess I keep coming back to is that I have, you know, really, I've been engaged with many people who have wanted to commit suicide, both in my own direct practice, but then recently through supervision.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And in two cases, and I don't want to say much about them, but these were very successful people. At the peak of their lives, both women, one of them with young children and the other one without public figures, well known, attractive, you know, educated professionals and so on.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And so is that a completely irrational? You're saying that that goes against the nature of life.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I don't want to commit suicide.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I know. It's part of finite life that it can become unbearable.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And I'm not saying, I'm just saying, insofar as you want something, insofar as you have a probability of what to sustain, you also want to live on.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
But it's possible for that to be short here.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
It's possible for it to become unbearable.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
That's part of the radical vulnerability of being finite, that it's possible that you won't be able to take it.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And that's not necessarily irrational either.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:12.000
But it's symptomatic, right, that's the same as the end of any project, then, the end of any commitment, except the commitment to end the possibility of any commitment.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I think the motivations are usually complex, very complex.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I took it used to mean that someone who actually wanted to die, that was a hypothetical example.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:33.000
They want to die and they go about making it very clear that they found a way to do that and they do it in a way that works well.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And so I think there are people who are more afraid of life than of death, and that they seek that because the meaning of life seems to be unbearable or at least terribly disappointing.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And so they seek instead to die.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And there's no real good argument against suicide.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
And the implication of that is that there is no reason not to commit suicide.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Because precisely because when you die you don't feel anything.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So once you're gone, there is no you anymore.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So there's no you to feel good or bad about your decision. It's a completely incommensurable idea. It intervenes into our life.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Death sort of comes in at an angle. It's not necessarily part of life. It's a termination.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:38.000
So the only conceivable good reason would be to avoid causing other people pain.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If you accept the sort of modernist perspective in that regard.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:52.000
If you have people who would be very hurt by your death physically, economically, or emotionally, then you could say for their sake you wouldn't commit suicide.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But it's very hard to come up with a good argument against suicide as it relates to me as the person who is.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:10.000
So if you're starting point is someone is this completely abstract person who's not defined by his engagements in the world, who's not that is primarily caught up in caring.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Because if you are, what you fear with death is not the state of being dead, which is nothing.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
What you fear is the loss of what you want to keep.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Unless you don't want to keep it.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Because there are moments when that's high-degree anxiety.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000
The angst is when everything recedes. The world recedes. When it's no longer your world.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000
It becomes no longer attached to you and you're no longer attached to you.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But for high-degree though you still care about not caring. You're still invested in the...

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You still care about not caring. So you're not at that point where it would look rational to kill yourself.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
It's exciting that you want to care and there's nothing which you care can attach to.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Right.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Sheldon, what's your experience with that?

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I have not, but I like Kamu. And he said in his notebooks come to terms with death thereafter, anything is possible.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So, you know, on the one hand there's the view that Adam raises about suicide. And I agree with.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But on the other hand, you know, I think Kamu and his more uplifting, optimistic moments had some...

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I think some hopes, let's say, for humanity.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And I think it's long lines of what Martin is saying about harnessing death anxiety and putting it to good use.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Which is, I think, what the Epicureans are saying sort of.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
This is another...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Yeah, maybe. All right. We'll talk about that another time. But Martha Nussbaum, a philosopher has a look.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Yeah, but she criticized him.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yeah, so I agree. All right. But I'd like her to take on that.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Yeah, that's excellent.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So, I mean, I appreciate the Kamu perspective. But I also think occasionally the philosopher can forget they're an animal, you know.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
There's a part where the ego and the brain just take over. And we are animals, you know.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Just get a little more visceral back to biology, the nature of life to persist, to endure from, you know,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000
quorum-sensing bacteria to the higher creatures of the planet. So, that's the...

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
There's a grounding somewhere there.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Although, then the question would be, if you're depressed, then you're a sick animal, right?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
And why should you not end your sickness?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Why do we have such an investment in other people not killing themselves?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
But I thought you were also saying that it doesn't have to connote depression.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
That perspective.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And I think, I mean, I would say that that is the metaphysical face of what is experientially depression.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
It's the same thing viewed in two different points of view.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That if the world no longer has any value or meaning and your commitments to the world fall away,

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
you're no longer invested in your own projects.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Because what it comes down to, again, is that there's no third party, there's no God guaranteeing your projects.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
The projects have meaning for you if they have meaning for you.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000
And if they don't have meaning for you, then they have nothing, no meaning at all to anyone.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So, then there's no objective reason why you can't kill yourself or why you want them to kill yourself.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
There's only other people's subjective desire that you not do it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So, I just want to introduce one other perspective.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.000
I've wondered whether this was just too esoteric, but...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:25.000
So, from a Buddhist perspective, and especially from the Vajrayana, the later Vajrayana developments of Tibetan Buddhism,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000
and the kinds of things that people recognize the Dalai Lama and the Karma Pahpa those folks do,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:39.000
there's a tremendous opportunity in the moment of death, and that is the opportunity for enlightenment.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:49.000
And there are a lot of practices, and I've done some of them, for conscious dying in the Tibetan practices among those

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
that have to do with the state of mind at the moment of death.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And there's a lot of preparation for that moment and a lot of support that would...

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I've just recently gone through a very personal death with someone who was supported all the way through, who was...

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:19.000
And the late stages of Alzheimer's with no cortex left at all had been unconscious, was very conscious in dying with the eyes open

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and light actually coming out of the eyes.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And so, the Tibetan practices are specifically focused, and there are some practices in Zen as well,

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000
on the opportunity of dying, and not just the opportunity from the point of view of any kind of immortality,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:49.000
but rather for the development of what would be considered the mind stream that has been in the form of this particular lifetime that goes forward.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And so, in these cases, death is really looked upon with a lot of interest and excitement,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and of course, there are many accounts of these kinds of experiences that are more or less well known,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:19.000
but these days they're out there, and it's just a very different involvement with death,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000
and it's a very different kind of development than what the Western perspective would typically take,

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and I just put it out there.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So, does that perspective as a death as an opportunity, does that depend on the scaffolding of reincarnation and other parts of the belief system?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Yes, it depends on...

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000
It's really hard, again, this gets into particularities about Buddhist philosophy,

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:55.000
but it isn't reincarnation per se, it's really called rebirth, and so, in Buddhist philosophy, the continuity from lifetime to lifetime

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:03.000
is the same as the continuity within a lifetime, like you're not the same person that you were when you were three, when you were 14,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:12.000
as you move along, your identity, your physical makeup, and your concerns and perspectives all change,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:21.000
and so, as you move over that transition from dying to the next stage, which is a sort of dreamlike stage,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:29.000
you carry some identity, but as you move through that process and then move into existence again,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
there may be very little trace of or memory of in the same way that you don't remember everything that happened to you yesterday,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000
you can remember some of it, you certainly wouldn't be remembering much from an earlier lifetime,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and of course, the Tibetans especially have ways of testing for that and so on when they're identifying a karmapa or a dalaylama or whatever.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
So, but it's just a very, very different framework on death, and it doesn't...

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
So, I have a framework that there is...

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Before you talked about accepting death, which presumably means that if there is death, that is determination of...

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
If there is death, that is determination of a life.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's a determination of a particular subject to...

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So, if you then introduce the metaphysics where that's not really the end of what matters, you're no longer talking about death,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
all you're saying is that you're denying that there is death in the relevant sense, that is to say...

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:34.000
That's really kind of a mistake to say it that way, because it makes it seem too distinct, like there is no death.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:46.000
There is actually a profound change when somebody moves out of a physical existence, and it's no small movement.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But it's not the end of that development of that consciousness, that's the thought anyway.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
So, then you have a strict separation between the consciousness and the body.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
You have a classical consciousness body dualism.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And in that framework, what really matters doesn't die.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So, to present that as a way of facing mortality seems to me very misleading, because if I'm going to face mortality,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I'm facing the fact that I am such a being that I can be completely annihilated.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I'm such a being that I depend on a body that I don't own, and that if it ceases to be, I will also cease to be.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
If there's any meaningful thought, if that's not the thought I'm facing, I'm not facing the thought of death.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I've just come up with the metaphysics where there is no one.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I would completely agree with you.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
But you just say that something continues.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
What continues about me...

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:46.000
But you're posing the whole argument on a point of view that's not valid to the system.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
And so, you can't say that it undoes, that it undoes, does itself.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
It does not.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It does not.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It does not.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Just to find death, ask, compete annihilation.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
But is there a material substrate for what survives, or is it purely spiritual?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It's purely spiritual.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And see, that's what we don't believe anymore.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That's what we can't believe anymore, is that there's no such thing as the spiritual.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
So, it is meant to be consciousness.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
That's what it is.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I think we'd be remiss if we didn't also consider the vicissitudes of the development of death fears,

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:32.000
and specifically the enduring influence from childhood when the first appearance of these kinds of concerns

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.000
that are often rooted in object relations, and the role of aggression in that,

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:55.000
that going back to the bodily substrate of experience, that when children begin to become aware of the possible consequences

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:02.000
of their aggression towards loved ones, and the fears of having murderous wishes towards others,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I think that it's useful to think about that in connection to fears of death and wishes for immortality

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000
as kind of reparations and undoing of some of these feelings.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I wonder if anyone wishes to comment on that.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I agree.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I think that there's a great deal that arises from that early sort of instinctual experience of being destructive.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And then that fears arise from that also in relation to the continuity of oneself and others,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
and that those are carried over then into one's view of death.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Most people, when I work with them in analysis or therapy, and I ask them,

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
what do you think happens when you die?

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Most people say you go into the dark, or you go into the dark alone, or it's over,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
but when I say, so what's that like? That it's over?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
It's usually something like the end of a movie, or things are just dark.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
It's an interesting thing. That's sort of the imagination of it.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
End of a movie. That is depressing. Popcorn stick into your shoes.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It's just like where it goes the end, and then there's nothing.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Okay, I think we can go to the audience for questions, but I just wanted to comment something.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:29.000
The last time you were here, you told us that we could get on some kind of rocket or ship

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:39.000
and go into another universe and start life there and have the whole new way of experiencing time and space and life.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So, the physics, it's not the escape clause. It's immortalizing, if not immortality.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It is completely plausible. The trick is you have to find a thousand solar mass or larger black hole,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.000
which is bigger than just a dead star, so we'd have to go a ways to find it.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And the point being that that's a big enough black hole that tidal forces don't destroy the body on your way into the event horizon.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And then you gather your friends and your loved ones in another spaceship,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and your time asymptotically slows down, and you're, you know, obviously comb your hair and do a very casual,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
royal family type wave, you know, on your way in, because that's the frame you're going to be left with.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
They'll be left with, they go off, die, etc. So that's the end.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
That's the perspective of everyone else. You have truly been immortalized.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:36.000
You, in your time frame, do travel through the event horizon to an unknown fate, but Kip Thorne, who is the consultant on that movie,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000
you know, he, in the top tier of Gravity Theoris, points out that spinning black holes of that size

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
do have time-like curves, where in principle you can, you know, cheat time by moving backwards and forwards,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000
meeting previous and future versions of yourself in theory, in the best theory we have of black holes.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000
So that's the, the nearest black hole of that size is going to be something like 500 light years away.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
So we have some technology. We have some technology to work on there.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:17.000
So questions line up and state your name and please keep it in the form of a brief question.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah, for people, for myself and people I know, there isn't so much a fear of dying.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
It's the process of dying, the pain and suffering of dying.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And I never understood the fear of dying because if you're religious, you're looking for something better for afterwards.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And if you're not religious, it's all over. So where does the fear and anxiety come in?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Well, I mean, I try to answer my question by saying that what you fear and fear in death is not the state of being dead,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
which is nothing, but to fear, to lose what you want to keep.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000
That is to say, you have fear insofar as you conceive of death as the extinction of the possibility of experience,

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
and you have an investment in going on, in continuing to have the possibility of experience.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
That's regret, not fear, isn't it?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
No, I think, I mean, whatever you want to...

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
It was a big difference in regret and fear.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I don't think it's not regret because it's not past-oriented. It's the prospect of a future in which you will not be.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And so, I think regret is past-oriented and fear is future-oriented.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
So I think that's adequately called a fear.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000
That I apprehend the possibility of my not being, and precisely because I have an investment in continuing to be,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
that scares me.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And it doesn't seem like that's a category mistake or irrational.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I think there's a very coherent logic to that.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.000
It seems to me that it's like what Rob said, that a lot of the fears are based on experiences from childhood that we've already had,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
and that we reorganize them around dying.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And so we're afraid that we're going into the dark alone, or we're afraid we're going to fall forever,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:05.000
or that some things going to be destroyed, that we've already had those deep fears, and they become reorganized in dying.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Even if you're religious, you have those fears?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Oh, yeah.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Because you don't believe your religion.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Well, dying is a physical, a very physical activity.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And as people go into dying, there are a lot of physical things that happen.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Yeah, I can understand what I said.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And so they anticipate those things, and they see their loved ones going through.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And I think a lot of the imagination does connect to childhood experiences and fantasies.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Thank you.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Hi.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Joan Oronian, a very happily retired surgeon.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:53.000
I told Edward that I thought he should begin this program with a couple of minutes of Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:59.000
with a 2,000 year old man, because that might be as close to immortality as we could come.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I like Martin's comments about temporary permanence, and very briefly two examples for me of temporary permanence.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:19.000
One, being a surgeon, and any physician in a teaching institution would have this experience, that your life doesn't change.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
The youth comes, is with you, and goes year after year after year.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:32.000
There's a permanence to our existence until we get home and look in the mirror.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Secondly, my wife has just written a book for her children and grandchildren.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
About her father.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Trying to establish some permanence in the minds of the future generations of Mehti Dormagani.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:04.000
And I think that this is one way that already one generation has seen and knows this man when they had never seen him or known him.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And she is establishing some temporary permanence, hopefully for another generation or two.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Thank you.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Go ahead.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
So since we're talking about film and comedy.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Wait, wait, yes, it belongs to comment.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Sorry.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I just wanted to follow up on your thoughts on temporary permanence, that I think that another way of fleshing up that thought,

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:33.000
and what you said was very evocative, is the fact that what makes it both

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:41.000
difficult but also meaningful to be alive is that you have both permanence and impermanence.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:48.000
If you only had absolute impermanence, there wouldn't be any problem because you wouldn't experience the loss of anything.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Everything would immediately disappear.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And if you had absolute permanence, likewise, nothing would be an issue because everything would just be what it is.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.000
So the key to thinking about mortality in the general sense, I think, is to think about the co-impicational permanence in permanence.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
That like, things last while also disappearing.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Things last while also being possible to cease to be.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And that's where both the passion and the agony of being alive arises from that intersection of permanence and impermanence.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And I mean, I'm sure as a surgeon you've had particularly vivid experiences of this, but I think that that is the structure.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And that's also why attempts to escape mortality can either be done like,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
oh, that's just an absolute impermanence. Everything disappears and I don't care.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
That's fine.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Then of course, nothing hurts me.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Or I imagine that there's something absolutely permanent that I don't have to worry about.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
But I think both of those paths are flights from what we are and how things matter to us.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
And we should not indulge those flights.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So I'd like also comic, because I also was provoked by the notion.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And so the perspective from physics or astronomy, if you like, is that of pattern.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
We're just patterns, really. That's all there is.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I mean, all of these atoms in this room and elsewhere in the whole universe were one smaller than an atom in the Big Bang.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:18.000
The space time paths went through these bizarre roots through stars to become heavier elements without which we wouldn't be here.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And they congeal or cohere.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And not even your skin is last a week. Your internal organ cells may be last much of your life.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
So we're just a consciousness ourselves the entire thing. It's just an evanescent pattern.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
And the patterns continue. They have, you know, the atoms may decay and tend to the 35 years we don't know.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
But that's pretty good. That's as close to eternity as I'd care to conceive of.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000
So the impermanence of patterns when we eventually get to understand the brain and consciousness better,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
maybe that opens the door also to some of these Eastern ways of thinking, just from the realm of straight up physics.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Well, Roger Penrose thought so.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Okay. I was just going to mention that this topic and discussion might well be summed up in a light vein by Woody Allen's response to the question on this topic of immortality,

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.000
which when asked, don't you want to carry on forever? He said, no, I just want to carry on in my apartment.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Okay. So the questions that arose for me during the panel, which was very, very good, in my opinion, were answered within the panel.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
So I'm just going to make a few quick observations, any comments that the panel would care to make are welcome,

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
but otherwise I'll just offer them as observations.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:49.000
On the point of our biological heritage, it wasn't mentioned that our prefrontal cortex and particularly structures within that prefrontal cortex,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:32:02.000
those structures are unique to human beings. And the way I can best describe it is a Ralo Mais comment in Love and Will that depression is the inability to construct a future.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So the need for us to look forward to the future also generates, because we are aware of our own mortality, that anxiety.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And I just thought that was something that wasn't addressed directly and I thought it would be relevant.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:24.000
In terms of the Far East, I think the perspective you were describing might be summed up in a Hindi saying,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:31.000
which translates as in the world, but not of it. In other words, there's being merged with the sensorium and our reactions to it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
And then there's another perspective where we step back and look inward.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And I think that that perspective makes all the difference between one's experience, not just oneself,

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
but one's impending demise. So that's another comment.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000
In terms of mathematics being invented, there is a raging debate whether it's invented or discovered.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And I think one piece of support for the latter is the robustness, let's say, of unstining relativity,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000
where because he was so convinced that his predictions would be correct and they have been to a remarkable degree,

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and he said, if when we're able to actually measure the perturbation of Mercury's orbit around the sun,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
if it doesn't agree with my theory, the measurement will be wrong.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:25.000
So mathematics does seem to, yes, it is language and therefore is inherently metaphorical.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:34.000
At the same time, if you speak with Professor Nima at Princeton, he's of the opinion that right now we're just getting into

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
approaching an error where we have an actual one-to-one relationship between mathematical theory and structure.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So it may not be the case that it's completely metaphorical and just our own invention.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I think that might be it.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Yeah.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Oh, yes. The other thing about the Far East, and again, this nature of permanence and non permanence,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:07.000
it is the case that while that perspective was encouraged within Buddhism,

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:15.000
at the same time, we cannot deny that the shogunates and the dynasties in Japan and China were definitely into permanence.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
So again, it's a matter of perspective versus the social-political context. Any comments or welcome?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I wanted just to make a comment about the business, about mathematics discovered or invented.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:35.000
And I think again, that may not be a really fruitful way to draw a distinction because, you know,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:45.000
it's kind of the, if you think from point of view of Winnicott or Piaget, does the child invent the world or discover the world?

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:52.000
You know, on one hand, it seems to be inventing the world and its perceptions, and on the other hand, it's discovering the world.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And so there's something about drawing the distinction between the discovering and the inventing that might be misleading.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And there's a lot that's written about that in psychoanalysis.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Just a short response to that, and I'll relinquish my time, which is that saying like a watched kettle, and that for boils, right?

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:24.000
In natural language, that describes the fact that people are not necessarily aware of, that when we pay attention to a phenomenon,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:32.000
our perception of the passage of time changes, which also speaks to the issue of boredom and a largely extended life,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:42.000
where it's, for me, completely feasible to imagine a point in science and technology where we're able to control that sense of the perception of time at will.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So the difference is that with that statement does not hold up to what we know and what we can accomplish using mathematics to actually measure the passage of time while that kettled boils.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:10.000
So there is a fundamental difference between the intuitive humanistic discovery of the world, and a language that is precise and independent of the individual

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000
that reflects the structure in the world.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I'll make one comment on the math issue. I mean, I think it's not a dichotomy. You can have your cake and eat it.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I mean, we're in the culture at the moment Turing is being celebrated, and his, to me, singular achievement was the Turing machine,

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.000
and that, which I think is what they should have been sending out with a SETI message rather than these little stick men and silly pictograms.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.000
They should have just sent a Turing machine because it's the algorithm of all algorithms, the algorithm that can do anything.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.000
So it's the purity of a computational framing that can calculate anything that you can imagine,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and you tell that to the aliens that were smart, or at least that were in the first run anyway.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Calculate this. Okay.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Thank you so much, Mayor.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I encourage the speaker about this very challenging subject, but just getting back to a second to, you know, play of a dude by, actually it was an Olympic champion

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
resolute head with his nickname, which means broad shoulder man, in a sense, anyway.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
One of the main ideas simply was the eight-quarter theory.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:29.000
They didn't even cut into an eight-quarter, so everything that he's growing to a tall majestic oak tree doesn't get lost on the way,

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:40.000
it's nothing but a dude. The wind would bloom to this world. We have a presence of soul, spirit, but it's exterior womb space for consciousness to develop over 21 years at the land, in versus the cob.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I'm just curious if I just toss this out. Do you think genetically encoded in that e-con theory for a human being,

01:37:46.000 --> 01:38:01.000
or things that we are just beginning to know that might actually still be in there? I'm just tossing that out. Whatever you think.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I'm not sure I understand the question, but how could there be something concealed that we wouldn't understand, but would that be?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:18.000
If you put consciousness in the human being, does not biologically develop your 21 or 22? So you couldn't access your full potentiality until you were 21 or 22.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000
By that time, most education is finished and done. We're in the world of reality. Our brains are just waking up.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.000
So if there was anything genetically encoded, we would just be able to access it at that moment and practically nothing to ever think about it.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:43.000
This is very early that audience, when I'm just forcing them out. I think they can answer that question. Thanks for your comment.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
One more thing.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Well, these days, they think it's 25. Not 21. Yeah, for that would be mature.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
85, you mean?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000
25, 25 are the very into matureness, potentiality for.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
What do you think?

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I'm not going to let it go. I'm not going to let it go. You just said that, but it's like, this is like a brand new thing about this.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.000
But it's saying, you know, just getting to that point, when science is going to understand it into a biology, or what that is.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
So you have to be gone to access.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Right.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
It might be a simple point of nature.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Right.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:28.000
The guy, you know, Gregory Bateson, Andrew Orton, he calls you a nature in four words, people think nature works.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Those are the words of four.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
If we're just getting to this essence, we don't even know what's there.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:45.000
If nature is likely intelligent enough to know that it might be like treating the sort of vision that something might come up like a collective unconsciousness.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I'm curious if you think of the mind and possibilities beyond thinking.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I think I'd say yes, if I understand the question.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
I think it would be impossible not to be.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
What do you guys think about the connection of immortality and singularity?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I mean, here, we're here in the first while, only 35, you know, we've got to reach that.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And it talks about patterns, right?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So body parts are replaceable, and computers can record every occurrence or record everything that we do, and therefore create continuity, and therefore reaching a mortality.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Any thoughts on that?

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Well, Ray's timescale is dictated by his own projected demise, and he's grossly optimistic, obviously, because strong AI has failed in its main agenda.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:53.000
There's more is a lot of the thing that makes our cyber lives easier is not being replicated in the cohesion of creating a sort of self-organizing framework that replicates in any part the subtlety.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And forget about reflective thought.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I mean, we're talking about, so someone like an inventor like guy at Carnegie Mellon, I'm just zoning out on his name, and he considers the full amalgam of robotic sensors and a neural net operating in an environment, sort of roboticized neural creature, is something of like a guppy, you know, in its capabilities, not, and not sending.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And that's probably about fair.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:33.000
So, and that is so many orders of magnitude away from where you need to be, even in just a mechanistic way of thinking about it, that, so that projection is wrong.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Is it off the table entirely and impossible?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Some people think that you have to hold judgment on.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:50.000
But if you want to take a different view of that, you could say that in the 100 simple, 100 years of computation and computer science, we have traveled to the world.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.000
We have traveled a road in mimicking biological capability that took evolution 3 billion years.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
That's pretty good acceleration, you know.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So the futurists, the post-humanists, the singularity people are sort of hanging their hats on that a little bit.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I just want to say one thing about that.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So, for the sake of argument, even if I were to bracket all the theoretical and practical difficulties of carrying these things out, and, you know, I could speak at length about the theoretical and practical.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
But say, just for the sake of argument, that it was possible.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000
It would still not be, in my view, immortality.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:47.000
As long as there is dependence on the material support, as long as it's not entirely spiritual to know what that was asking you, there is still the possibility of malfunction that things can, and that possibility of malfunction and that destructibility is not just, that's part of why that existence would still matter to me,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
even if it was possible.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:57.000
So I don't think that those are various, there might be other problems with those types of projects and file experiments, but I don't think it's a problem of immortality.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:13.000
As long as more recognizes that there is material support that enables that sort of existence, because as long as there's that, it's still, it's not corporeal in the sense of an organic body, but it is material in the sense of something that can be destroyed.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And so as long as those things don't spin off into a fantasy that we could be entirely spiritual beings, again, I don't think whatever problems it would be, it wouldn't be those sort of those things.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And the moral of this is should not have used GE parts.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
What quick follow-up?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Would that help us with our accepting our debts?

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I mean, if we came close to it, if we knew that we would continue on, if it's not just a movie, it's something very close to us.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Would we then accept death in a better way?

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.000
It depends on what, I find this idea of accepting death very obscure, and I find that people mean very different things with it.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000
In my view, it would usually mean denying death at the end of the day when they're talking about accepting death.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.000
So it would all depend on what you mean by the acceptance of death.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000
It doesn't matter if I exist or if I don't exist.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
That seems like a horrible thing.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I think our next person is going to ask questions, can clarify some of these points.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I'm going to talk from a clinical perspective.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:34.000
I have the privilege of working with some people who are dying, and what's interesting is our discussion is all about how we feel about death from the point of view of being healthy and somewhat young.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
When you're in a position where you're dying, you have a very different perspective.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.000
As Sheldon could probably tell you, people who are dying are not as afraid of death as you would imagine.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
In fact, some people, as they get sicker, look forward to dying.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
There's a wish for death.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:08.000
In fact, we have a group of patients that we call, they have a wish for hasten death, and some of those, as you know, sign up for programs to die by their own hand in their own way.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I think that as your life begins to diminish, and the burdens of living become greater, and you have less to look forward to.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000
You look forward to death as a kind of release or a freedom.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Again, if you talk to patients, they don't so much think about the fact that they're not going to exist, but they have all kinds of defense mechanisms.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
In which there is some sense that they will go on in some form or other.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Some of them feel that their body will die, but their spirit will continue.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:59.000
As some have said, as we get closer to death, or those of us who are in the foxholes all become quite religious.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.000
People do become more religious as they get closer to death.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Many people believe that they are, as Ed said, going to reunite with their family.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:20.000
There are all kinds of fantasies that play into making the process of dying much less frightening to somebody who's facing death.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Perhaps the discussion should be about learning something more from people who have actually got close to death or dying.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
For those of us who are still living are afraid of dying.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.000
They're less, they can teach us a great deal to make us less afraid.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
It seems to me that you're describing two very different things.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:50.000
I mean, one is an example of someone because of the physical or psychological suffering at late stage in life.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
You actually want to, you can say like comparatively in this situation.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I look forward to not existing.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
That's very different than looking forward to living on as a spirit or reuniting with your family.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
In your second example, there's no acceptance of death at all.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
It's a denial of death, saying.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
It's the same time.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Yes, but I'm saying they're very different psychological responses.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
They're extremely different.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
In fact, if what I'm looking forward, if what I want is for my consciousness to end because I'm suffering,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:26.000
then the second perspective that I will actually not cease to be, that I will have honest spirit, you know, is those are totally different reactions.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
So there's also some contradictory.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
But that's how really the mind works.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.000
The mind is not a linear function at very different levels.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.000
People will talk about just what you're saying on the one hand and the other hand.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:49.000
So they'll say they'll look forward to dying and to ending their life, and the same person will then say,

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and then I can be together with my parents and my sister who's dead.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
And the way they might talk about it, they'll be there perfectly healthy.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So we're capable of those kinds of inconsistencies.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Of course, but that's because they're actually still afraid of death, and I sympathize with that.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
But I wouldn't say that those are testimonies to how you are not afraid of death or have come to terms with death.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.000
That seems to me that whole testimony you're giving is a testimony to how incredibly difficult it is to face the prospect of dying

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
and how many contradictory fantasies you come up with to shield off that prospect.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And I have a lot of empathy with that, but I don't think it is an example of how someone who has accepted death.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:37.000
And again, I think that people do accept that many of them.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:47.000
In your clinical experience, have there been patients who convinced that there is nothing to live death, and no fantasies for those consequences

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
that you did with chapter life, who are also interested in pacing their death?

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Yes.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I think we'll...

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Absolutely.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I mean, you learn a tremendous amount about how adaptable the mind is when you talk to people who are dying.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
There are great teachers of how to deal with life.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
In fact.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Okay, thanks.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.000
He works with Memorial Day.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:27.000
I would say first of all, I really appreciate that you came here for a conversation and you didn't come and read your statements.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I think we'd all be much better off if we went with Polly and lived in the present, but aren't we pretty much stuck with Adam

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and in that there's a evolutionary advantage to living in the future.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And those people are the ones who survived.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Well, it is arguable as a 12th century Zen writer named Dogen said that the future occurs in the present, the past occurs in the present.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000
And because of that, there really isn't a present either.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:21.000
But things arise in the present and we pay attention in terms of the way we direct our actions.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:34.000
And so there we can direct our thoughts and actions towards the imagined future and also our prefrontal cortex tends to head us in that way

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
towards prediction and reliability, that sort of thing.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:46.000
At the same time, we can become aware that we're doing that and that there are choices within the present.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
As it arises, it's about three to ten seconds.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
It's not an absolute present.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000
But we can become aware of what is going on and where we want to direct our awareness.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000
And that's really what's meant by living in the present.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:18.000
So it's not avoiding prediction or the future, nor is it avoiding thoughts and feelings about the past, but the recognition that those are taking place in the present.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So that's maybe not so different from pattern recognition.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Yeah.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Please join me in thanking Laura.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
And please, short of my barring the door, please fill out the post round table surveys.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
We really depend on your feedback.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Thanks again for coming.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Thank you.
