WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:56.960
Hi, everyone.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.360
If I could have your attention for a brief moment.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.720
So we're about to begin.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.160
Thank you all very much for coming.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.920
So this is a roundtable on the sublime experience.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.920
And it is funded in part by a very generous grant from the Templeton Foundation.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.080
But one of the stipulations of that is that we have surveys that we need to be filled

01:16.080 --> 01:20.120
out by a certain number of people for every single roundtable.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.120
That otherwise, I don't know what would happen.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.760
Maybe they'd ask for their money back.

01:24.760 --> 01:30.720
But either way, I was not present for the first 15 minutes of when everybody was arriving.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.920
So I didn't get a chance to harass you individually.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.080
So now I have to do it en masse.

01:35.080 --> 01:40.440
So if you'd be very, very generous and gracious and be willing to fill out a survey, the first

01:40.440 --> 01:44.720
half is for before, the roundtable is so filling out right now or during, and then the second

01:44.720 --> 01:47.280
half is for afterwards.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.880
I guess just raise your hand slightly or eyebrows or something, and I can come around

01:51.880 --> 01:52.880
with surveys.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.880
I have a couple pens, but if you have your own pen, you should use that one.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.880
Okay.

01:59.880 --> 02:08.440
While Julie is doing that, I'll introduce our program.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.480
I'm Ed Nurse-Sesien, Director of the Center.

02:12.480 --> 02:20.240
Next, not next week, the week after the February 21st, we are going to show in the morning

02:20.240 --> 02:26.760
the documentary Particle Fever, and then in the afternoon we are going to have a roundtable

02:26.760 --> 02:29.920
with the title, The Quest.

02:29.920 --> 02:41.120
The participants of that are Sarah D'Amiro, Alberto Manguel, Gene Strauss, and Mark Levinson.

02:41.120 --> 02:52.680
Then on March 7th, we have a roundtable on consciousness, and David Chalmers from NYU

02:52.680 --> 02:59.720
called Friston from the University College London, Gabriel Jackson from Stony Brook, Pete

02:59.720 --> 03:07.320
Hott from Princeton, Ken Paller from Northwestern, and Nicholas Schiff from Cornell will be the

03:07.320 --> 03:10.920
participants of that.

03:10.920 --> 03:21.640
So today's roundtable is on the sublime experience, and I will read you briefly the bios of the

03:21.640 --> 03:23.200
participants.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.360
They are available on the website if you want to dig deeper into it.

03:28.360 --> 03:36.920
Paul Fry, sitting there, is the William Lamson, Professor of English at Yale.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.600
He was educated at UC Berkeley and Harvard.

03:40.600 --> 03:46.240
He's seven books and numerous articles cover many fields, the history of lyric, British

03:46.240 --> 03:52.720
romanticism, the history of criticism, the history of aesthetics, philosophy and literature,

03:52.720 --> 03:58.920
recent literary theory, and literature and the visual arts.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.400
I will stop there.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.040
That's about a quarter of what I have.

04:04.040 --> 04:10.280
James Judd, who is sitting here, is music director of the Israel Symphony and the Little

04:10.280 --> 04:15.160
Orchestra Society in New York.

04:15.160 --> 04:21.920
His previous directorship include the New Zealand Symphony, the Ochast National de Lille, Adelaide

04:21.920 --> 04:25.720
Symphony, and the Philharmonic Symphony.

04:25.720 --> 04:31.760
He's been a regular guest, conducted many orchestras around the globe, and he leads

04:31.760 --> 04:36.120
annual tour of Asia and the Asian Youth Society.

04:36.120 --> 04:42.600
And as an opera conductor, he's led the English National Opera, Glendenborn, and Florida Grand

04:42.600 --> 04:43.600
Opera.

04:43.600 --> 04:49.840
And again, I'll stop all the other major achievements.

04:49.840 --> 04:54.040
Alan Richardson, who is sitting there, is Professor of English at Boston College.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.280
He holds degrees in English from Princeton University and Harvard University.

04:58.280 --> 05:03.600
A romanticist by training, he has published extensively on the literature and culture

05:03.600 --> 05:11.480
of the British Romantic era, especially in relation to issues of education, race and colonialism

05:11.480 --> 05:14.440
and scientific psychology.

05:14.440 --> 05:20.040
He's devoted his research more recently on the intersections between literary studies

05:20.040 --> 05:23.960
and the sciences of mind and brain.

05:23.960 --> 05:33.320
And finally, Sandra Shabshay has a BA in intellectual history from Penn, from University of Penn's

05:33.320 --> 05:38.480
Pennsylvania and her PhD in philosophy from Columbia University.

05:38.480 --> 05:45.080
She's an associate professor of philosophy at Indiana University and her interest center

05:45.080 --> 05:51.360
on the 19th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary

05:51.360 --> 05:54.120
aesthetics and ethics.

05:54.120 --> 06:00.480
We had a fifth participant, Amir Exel, but unfortunately he fell yesterday on ice in

06:00.480 --> 06:04.520
Boston and broke his forearm so he won't be with us.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.520
Thank you.

06:05.520 --> 06:20.560
Well, I thought that perhaps I could get us started in a good philosophical fashion.

06:20.560 --> 06:26.080
I thought I would ask a definitional question of everyone.

06:26.080 --> 06:32.000
What is sublime experience or what is a sublime experience?

06:32.000 --> 06:41.840
Well, I'm glad you asked it that way because when I did my work on the sublime, it became

06:41.840 --> 06:46.600
clear to me that not everyone agrees that there is a sublime experience, but I do feel

06:46.600 --> 06:47.840
that there is one.

06:47.840 --> 06:54.080
So I like the way that your question is biased towards my physician if we have physicians.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.600
Some people think that the sublime is just a language game, what Wittgenstein would call

06:57.600 --> 07:02.160
a language game, a way of talking about certain class of experiences that we decide to label

07:02.160 --> 07:06.560
that way a rhetorical trope.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.720
But most sublime theories up to the 20th century clearly thought there was an experience of

07:11.720 --> 07:18.120
the sublime and something that you could feel before there was ever a word for it.

07:18.120 --> 07:24.000
I guess that that's what I feel just to start with, that it is an experience and it's an

07:24.000 --> 07:32.000
experience of, for me in brief, when you realize palpably, when you realize viscerally in

07:32.000 --> 07:39.320
your body as well as with all of your acting mind, that the world is greater than you have

07:39.320 --> 07:47.160
ever supposed than you can take in with your senses and with your cognition.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.960
It's an experience that's both cognitive, and emotional, and very powerful.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.240
And my guess is that many of these rooms feel that they have had such an experience.

07:56.240 --> 08:00.920
I know that I have.

08:00.920 --> 08:05.440
I do think that there is certainly a sublime experience.

08:05.440 --> 08:16.080
I think that the terms for it have varied in history and that the sublime experience

08:16.080 --> 08:25.120
as the response initially in a state of fear, then in a state of recovery, and in a certain

08:25.120 --> 08:31.560
sense after that, a state of possession, that is to say possession of the experience, but

08:31.560 --> 08:39.880
at the same time possibly being possessed by the experience, I think flourishes particularly

08:39.880 --> 08:43.800
in the 18th century.

08:43.800 --> 08:52.920
The terms sublime applies most recognizably to that experience then, and that as one moves

08:52.920 --> 09:03.640
into the 19th century, partly owing to Kant's third critique, but perhaps not as much of

09:03.640 --> 09:08.480
influence as the zeitgeist or whatever.

09:08.480 --> 09:17.160
In my own view, the experience or becoming aware of the imagination, that is to say,

09:17.160 --> 09:25.040
an internal faculty, that one is alerted to by the experience of something almost incommensurable

09:25.040 --> 09:33.040
in the external world, replaces the sublime, and that the word sublime as it's used in

09:33.040 --> 09:40.320
the rheumatic period becomes a little more casual, sometimes it even means chemical sublimation

09:40.320 --> 09:49.000
as when Byron calls a rascal, rapscallion of a lawyer, the sublime of rascals.

09:49.000 --> 09:57.360
That's a chemical term, the pure distillation of rascals.

09:57.360 --> 10:02.080
And then I think that since then, and this is something I'm going to stop and need to

10:02.080 --> 10:08.880
talk about, well I think that since then, the experience itself has become more unstable.

10:08.880 --> 10:16.440
In Freud, I think that a comparable sort of experience is the uncanny, and that's something

10:16.440 --> 10:20.120
we might want to come back to as well.

10:20.120 --> 10:27.360
And there are other aesthetic categories as described in the 20th and 21st century that

10:27.360 --> 10:32.800
in various ways may be encroached on what we mean by the sublime without taking away

10:32.800 --> 10:38.640
the fact that there is such an experience, so I've gone on too much.

10:38.640 --> 10:45.680
Well I think from my experience as a musician, I would veg as a suggestion, is that me?

10:45.680 --> 10:53.280
It seems to me that I'm growling and I don't mean to, that perhaps the sublime is easiest

10:53.280 --> 11:00.960
to be accessed through music, that I remember my experiences as a very small child, not

11:00.960 --> 11:06.280
being aware of particularly what I was listening to, some great works of music, great choral

11:06.280 --> 11:08.360
works, great bah.

11:08.360 --> 11:15.640
Then later, realizing that that music had transported me in a special way, that's right

11:15.640 --> 11:24.280
up to now I'm trying to analyze and understand, but I think that through great music, and

11:24.280 --> 11:32.080
I think we could all agree on certain pieces of great music, we can find the sublime, access

11:32.080 --> 11:34.080
the sublime.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.680
Well, now you have to.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.840
Oh, I know I understand some of my own questions.

11:40.840 --> 11:48.400
I think I also agree that there is such a thing as sublime experience and that it has

11:48.400 --> 11:54.680
a certain character to it that makes it distinctive.

11:54.680 --> 12:04.120
I also think that the term sublime as you, Lutupal, has become stretched in various ways

12:04.120 --> 12:12.920
to sort of take on perhaps an experience of horror on canny and actually one of the art

12:12.920 --> 12:17.120
critics for the New Yorker whose last name I can't pronounce very well.

12:17.120 --> 12:27.160
That's it, Peter Shallow said in response to an exhibit of works by Casper David Friedrich

12:27.160 --> 12:34.440
that the sublime doesn't mean anything today, that it's been stretched too far.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.480
And so one of the things that I've actually been working on in contemporary aesthetics

12:37.480 --> 12:47.080
is to come up with some sense of the concept of the sublime response that has a certain

12:47.080 --> 12:54.880
shape to it and doesn't fall victim to Chaldal's charge that I think he said something like

12:54.880 --> 13:00.840
it's the sublime has had 200 years to start meaning something coherent and it has failed.

13:00.840 --> 13:08.400
But I would say that there really is a category, a set of category that makes sense, that is

13:08.400 --> 13:18.440
kind of a mixed pleasureful experience in the 18th century when the category came to

13:18.440 --> 13:25.000
be significantly theorized it was seen as kind of the whole of beauty.

13:25.000 --> 13:34.440
So beauty was seen as largely very pleasurable, tranquil experience often of smooth or polished

13:34.440 --> 13:40.760
formed, beautiful formed objects and the sublime was seen as kind of a more painful

13:40.760 --> 13:51.960
tumultuous experience of often formless or vast overwhelming kinds of a paradigmatically

13:51.960 --> 13:55.560
natural objects or scenes.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.640
But it seems to me that there still is a kind of experience of being overwhelmed that is

14:00.640 --> 14:10.360
both it's painful and it's also pleasurable that we still feel today that answers to the

14:10.360 --> 14:14.120
concept of sublime.

14:14.120 --> 14:20.160
If I could respond to where you started Sandra, I don't think it's such a concern that terms

14:20.160 --> 14:25.200
and concepts get stretched out because that's what we do as language users.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.840
We try them out in new contexts and we stretch them out as long as it's not really a problem

14:29.840 --> 14:33.560
as long as we have central examples.

14:33.560 --> 14:40.280
So we can talk about an examining table and we can talk about a massage table but we

14:40.280 --> 14:46.440
still know that what a table is and this is our central example is something like this.

14:46.440 --> 14:52.880
So if everybody had a paradigmatic example of the sublime experience that might help

14:52.880 --> 14:53.880
us.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.800
Obviously James has already given us his.

14:56.800 --> 15:01.080
It's listening to what Mollers ninth or Beethoven's ninth.

15:01.080 --> 15:08.480
Yes and the moment when the audience comes to tears for me it would be being really high

15:08.480 --> 15:14.080
up in the mountains and being able to see range after range after range of mountains

15:14.080 --> 15:21.680
all around me and be completely unable to take it all in and yet sort of in awe of this.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.160
I still really like the natural supply.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.160
Do you have a central example?

15:28.160 --> 15:32.320
Paul, I would be perfectly happy with yours and it's interesting of course that in the

15:32.320 --> 15:38.680
development of landscape painting the Dutch in particular specialized in extended prospects

15:38.680 --> 15:46.160
that were just like that painted from a high angle so that you saw against the across the

15:46.160 --> 15:52.640
flat country of Holland through innumerable villages and spires becoming smaller and smaller

15:52.640 --> 15:59.360
in the distance and finally arriving at what might be the sea but is so far away that it's

15:59.360 --> 16:01.800
difficult to tell.

16:01.800 --> 16:09.840
I certainly agree that that's a central experience of the natural sublime on this opposition

16:09.840 --> 16:13.760
that the sublime is in the world and not in our head.

16:13.760 --> 16:21.760
I think that already we're coming to the point where the question of whether the sublime

16:21.760 --> 16:34.240
is bound to be very large or bound less, it already becomes a matter of interest because

16:34.240 --> 16:39.840
to speak of the shape of the sublime experience I think is right the experience itself does

16:39.840 --> 16:50.980
have a shape but the sublime the catalyst that which gives rise to the experience is

16:50.980 --> 16:59.240
arguably and it depends who you listen to either almost infinite but still finite that

16:59.240 --> 17:07.240
is to say an object in the external world or something that we think or constitute in

17:07.240 --> 17:12.440
our minds as the infinite because of course we don't know the infinite in the external

17:12.440 --> 17:19.920
world and this is one of the controversies about the sublime and it's very interesting

17:19.920 --> 17:28.040
that even people who modern critics and thinkers who theorize about the sublime seem not altered

17:28.040 --> 17:30.080
to get altogether to agree on it.

17:30.080 --> 17:37.280
There's a book by Stephen Knapp of Professor Berkeley called Personification and the Sublime

17:37.280 --> 17:47.560
that supposes sublime objects including supernatural beings, even human beings to have a finite

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
outline.

17:48.560 --> 17:56.760
We recognize them in the form of their personification, a device or technique that we associate with

17:56.760 --> 18:02.280
allegory so in some sense we can see them clearly.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.840
In that case if you take built as your sublime literary text, Barak Solance who'd say well

18:07.840 --> 18:15.840
Satan is the sublime figure because Satan is a being that you can see but you're mistaken

18:15.840 --> 18:22.560
if you think you know what the real extent of his magnitude is and we can come back to

18:22.560 --> 18:24.640
that I don't want to dwell over it for the moment.

18:24.640 --> 18:31.040
What I wanted to say for the moment was if on the other hand you think of the figures

18:31.040 --> 18:38.480
of sin and death in Milton, not so much Satan but the figures of sin and death you see that

18:38.480 --> 18:43.440
Milton's whole point about them is that they're shapeless.

18:43.440 --> 18:50.320
Their magnitude is communicated as that which is boundless and has no form.

18:50.320 --> 18:54.960
An underlying question for me in thinking about this and it may have to do with the relation

18:54.960 --> 19:01.880
between the sublime and the science is the question of whether the sublime as it were

19:01.880 --> 19:03.120
has a form.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.760
Well can I follow through on that?

19:06.760 --> 19:07.760
You mentioned Beethoven.

19:07.760 --> 19:14.320
Let's think of a piece we all know probably Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and I mentioned

19:14.320 --> 19:16.240
this for a few reasons.

19:16.240 --> 19:21.320
You look at the score, I've had the manuscript or the notebook in my hands from a library

19:21.320 --> 19:25.080
and cracker, but the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony you see something incredibly

19:25.080 --> 19:32.320
structured and perfectly formed in the hands of a great interpreter and I think the sublime

19:32.320 --> 19:36.160
in Beethoven's Ninth needs a great interpreter.

19:36.160 --> 19:41.760
For example, Foutvegler, if you listen to the recordings of Foutvegler live of Beethoven's

19:41.760 --> 19:47.520
Ninth Symphony, he transports this formal structure into something that at the end of

19:47.520 --> 19:52.520
his performance, his particular performance, he goes beyond the pain barrier in terms

19:52.520 --> 19:59.280
of tempo and in terms of spiritual ecstasy and takes us into something that's completely

19:59.280 --> 20:01.240
eternal I think.

20:01.240 --> 20:08.160
And yet interestingly, I mean, Vagner talked a lot about Beethoven.

20:08.160 --> 20:16.160
Foutvegler, the great Wagner interpreter, Beethoven interpreter read much or thought

20:16.160 --> 20:21.680
about his interpretations through the writings of Schopenhauer for example, both Wagner and

20:21.680 --> 20:22.680
Foutvegler.

20:22.680 --> 20:31.200
And so what I think music needs is music is not on the piece of paper sublime.

20:31.200 --> 20:36.920
It needs great interpretation because Beethoven's Ninth can sound perfectly pedantic.

20:36.920 --> 20:42.800
Well, one thing that also might be...

20:42.800 --> 20:49.920
Is the distinction that made in the Third Critique between the mathematical and the dynamical

20:49.920 --> 20:51.420
sublime.

20:51.420 --> 20:58.920
So the mathematical sublime deals with vast formless objects or expenses, possibly expenses

20:58.920 --> 21:10.000
of time and the dynamical sublime is about great power and sort of overwhelming power

21:10.000 --> 21:13.360
dominance.

21:13.360 --> 21:22.000
And so in some ways, one might think that an experience of a particularly sublime interpretation

21:22.000 --> 21:30.320
of Beethoven's Ninth would trigger more of the dynamical sort of sublime so that one is

21:30.320 --> 21:40.280
experiencing kind of being overwhelmed by some kind of power or emotional expression.

21:40.280 --> 21:45.760
And perhaps it's not, in that case, it's not a kind of sublime that answers to the more

21:45.760 --> 21:46.760
mathematical vastness.

21:46.760 --> 21:52.680
That's interesting because there is a work by Schokhausen for three orchestras written

21:52.680 --> 21:58.680
in 1954 which is incredibly complex because it's written on the 12-tone scale.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.120
But every dynamic is controlled by mathematics.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.400
Every note is controlled by mathematics.

22:04.400 --> 22:09.960
The instrumentation, three different orchestras placed around the hall, very complicated for

22:09.960 --> 22:13.360
the conductor because you have three conductors.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.360
Each orchestra is playing at different tempers.

22:15.360 --> 22:21.720
But it's perfect mathematically and it's so, so satisfying.

22:21.720 --> 22:28.480
So that's probably an example of music that you can just look at as a trained musician

22:28.480 --> 22:33.560
and find the sublime mathematical purity.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.840
Go and listen to it if you don't know.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.720
It's a challenging piece but it's wonderful.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.600
Yeah, really wonderful.

22:40.600 --> 22:50.960
A pioneering thinker concerning the sublime was a Greek teacher of Roman youth preparing

22:50.960 --> 22:57.480
to enter into civic life somewhere between the third century named Lunginus.

22:57.480 --> 23:02.600
And he wrote a treatise called On the Sublime.

23:02.600 --> 23:08.160
And he distinguishes there in ways that aren't, I think, fully analogous with Kant's mathematical

23:08.160 --> 23:11.920
and dynamic but at the same time rather interesting.

23:11.920 --> 23:19.520
On the one hand, there's the sort of power expressed by the tearing apart of the fabric

23:19.520 --> 23:28.360
of language through rhetorical devices, an opening of a gap or wound in ordinary discourse

23:28.360 --> 23:37.040
where somehow what he calls visualization or the experience of something arresting or

23:37.040 --> 23:41.640
terrifying from the outside emerges.

23:41.640 --> 23:49.120
And on the other hand, he speaks also of a sublime experience that one has if one's an

23:49.120 --> 23:56.840
auditor of Demosthenes being as he puts it, hit over the head again and again and again

23:56.840 --> 23:58.040
and again.

23:58.040 --> 24:05.520
In other words, with Demosthenes, it's a matter of sustaining the experience of being overwhelmed.

24:05.520 --> 24:11.080
In other sorts of rhetorical experience, it's a matter of a sudden tearing apart of the

24:11.080 --> 24:19.280
fabric of the experience which he calls persuasion or the coherence of an argument that can be

24:19.280 --> 24:22.640
very exciting and compel us because it is coherent.

24:22.640 --> 24:28.800
But at the same time, this sort of experience tears that apart leaving a sudden rift or

24:28.800 --> 24:42.320
gap through which as he puts it, the experience of the sublime floods.

24:42.320 --> 24:47.960
I just taught Lon Jaines to my undergraduates and one of the things that always interests

24:47.960 --> 24:54.480
me when I teach that piece is at the end of it, he starts this discussion or picks up

24:54.480 --> 25:00.120
discussion that he's had already with someone else about what kind of society fosters the

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
sublime.

25:01.120 --> 25:06.280
So apparently, there are certain societies that foster more sublimity than others and

25:06.280 --> 25:13.160
he wonders at first, is it that democratic societies and he's thinking of Athenian democracy.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.720
That's what fosters the sublime.

25:14.720 --> 25:21.240
But he says, no, what I really think is that affluent societies like ours, where people

25:21.240 --> 25:27.000
get very interested in consumer goods, what we would call consumer goods, money, those

25:27.000 --> 25:34.400
people are so preoccupied with mean thoughts of things.

25:34.400 --> 25:38.960
Lon Jaines says at the beginning, if it's treated as anything that it's cool to despise

25:38.960 --> 25:40.120
can't be sublime.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.160
So it's cool to despise money.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.680
We all know that it's a bit so that it can't be sublime.

25:45.680 --> 25:54.920
So a money society has much less sublimity than a society that prizes genius and characters.

25:54.920 --> 25:58.640
So I don't know what people think of that.

25:58.640 --> 26:04.800
Maybe that's the problem, not that we've defined a sublime too thinly, but that we're

26:04.800 --> 26:11.800
addicted to consumer goods and we've seen too many ads that say a cigar is sublime.

26:11.800 --> 26:17.080
Do you remember that one?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.040
You have to be a certain age.

26:19.040 --> 26:23.520
Back when they could advertise cigars that way.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.360
Is there anything to that?

26:25.360 --> 26:27.360
I think so.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.760
Actually, I go back to Kant a lot.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.320
I think Kant had a very nice way of understanding the sublime.

26:34.320 --> 26:42.520
And one of the key analyses that he gave was that in contrast to the beautiful, which

26:42.520 --> 26:48.560
is a kind of experience of proposiveness, of a sort of being at home in the world where

26:48.560 --> 26:50.960
things accommodate themselves to you.

26:50.960 --> 26:57.760
Their forms are comprehensible and one can sort of slip easily into a kind of tranquil

26:57.760 --> 27:02.840
free play of the intellectual faculties in the beautiful.

27:02.840 --> 27:10.920
The sublime is an experience of contra-proposiveness where you do not feel at home in the world,

27:10.920 --> 27:18.920
where things are difficult, they challenge you, where the paradigmatic for Kant, the

27:18.920 --> 27:26.720
environment is hostile in a way either to our intellectual faculties, hostile to comprehension

27:26.720 --> 27:29.360
or hostile to us existentially.

27:29.360 --> 27:38.440
So I do think the sublime does seem to be a kind of experience where one is being challenged

27:38.440 --> 27:39.520
in some way.

27:39.520 --> 27:45.680
So if things are too comfortable, if your environment has been made so comfortable through consumer

27:45.680 --> 27:54.520
goods, you're feeling pretty at home in the world where the sublime is a kind of, at least

27:54.520 --> 28:00.640
according to Kant, kind of feeling not quite at home, which leads one to, so that's the

28:00.640 --> 28:06.160
painful aspect of it, the experience of a person's or human limits, limits to our cognitive

28:06.160 --> 28:12.560
abilities and limits to our, but to our very own existence or our own power.

28:12.560 --> 28:17.600
So you're rooting for more snow right now, as well?

28:17.600 --> 28:19.080
Now you know who to blame.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
That's right.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.080
Yeah, it's true though.

28:21.080 --> 28:26.160
I think here in New York, if we had three feet of snow, we might have a greater chance

28:26.160 --> 28:29.120
of an actual experience of the sublime rather than.

28:29.120 --> 28:34.440
Some don't allow that the music of Marla, you mentioned earlier, it can be sublime because

28:34.440 --> 28:41.360
Marla is so earthbound with tragedy and with the personal battle and so on.

28:41.360 --> 28:48.480
But I've always found that repetition that you get in Marla sometimes of banality and

28:48.480 --> 28:53.640
of struggle releases something just so moving and profound.

28:53.640 --> 28:59.880
And I was thinking, as you all speaking, about a book I was just reading by a fantastic historian

28:59.880 --> 29:06.760
Brian Moynihan about the Leningrad Symphony of Schostakovich and about the circumstances

29:06.760 --> 29:09.160
historically surrounding the siege of Leningrad.

29:09.160 --> 29:14.000
I mean, it's too horrific, but I do recommend the book, Siege and Symphony.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.640
And thinking about the seventh symphony of Schostakovich, I don't know whether any of you know,

29:18.640 --> 29:24.360
in the first movement, that is a prolonged, I say prolonged, ten minutes of side drum,

29:24.360 --> 29:30.840
snare drum, just repeating this banal kind of threatening march.

29:30.840 --> 29:35.400
And through repetition, but this is another area, I suppose, of hypnotism repetition.

29:35.400 --> 29:40.720
I'm not sure that does that lead to the sublime, but through this grotesque music that some

29:40.720 --> 29:42.640
people can't stand, frankly.

29:42.640 --> 29:50.720
They dismiss, many people dismiss the symphonies of Marla, they can't take it, and dismiss Schostakovich.

29:50.720 --> 29:58.280
But for me, that music, just through the pain and so on, really, really takes it somewhere.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.040
The beauty of Mozart doesn't always do.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
Yeah.

30:02.040 --> 30:08.320
Well, that's Demosthenes, I think, in the Londginian register.

30:08.320 --> 30:15.600
And the element of repetition is an aspect, just as sheer accretion or accumulation of

30:15.600 --> 30:20.120
Kant's mathematical sublime as well.

30:20.120 --> 30:27.520
And I do see, somehow, a distinction between experiences, both sublime, one of which arises

30:27.520 --> 30:34.120
from repetition or accretion, and the other of which arises from, as I say, a kind of

30:34.120 --> 30:41.880
a blasting apart, which is momentary, is not sustained or repeated, but is momentary.

30:41.880 --> 30:53.880
I thought, by the way, that if only for truth and advertising that we should acknowledge

30:53.880 --> 31:01.400
rather strong adversary current in the 20th and 21st centuries concerning the sublime, because

31:01.400 --> 31:08.000
it has been accused, if that's the right word, of being both patriarchal and tyrannical.

31:08.000 --> 31:17.040
In other words, if one were to parse an ideology of the sublime, there are many who would say

31:17.040 --> 31:25.720
that it's gendered, not just masculine, but hypermasculine, and that politically, and

31:25.720 --> 31:31.360
this in some ways comes out already of the discussion at the end of Londginis, that

31:31.360 --> 31:42.040
politically it's anti-democratic, that is to say, it imposes on the recipient kind of

31:42.040 --> 31:44.720
tyrannical authority.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.800
And this is very widespread.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.280
I won't name names.

31:50.280 --> 31:55.680
But a number of people who have made arguments of this kind, and it's interesting to think

31:55.680 --> 32:02.440
about something I think those of us sitting here care about a great deal, under this sort

32:02.440 --> 32:12.720
of threat and maybe thinking about how to counteract it, or at least put it in perspective.

32:12.720 --> 32:17.640
I know that line of argument well, as you can imagine, and I don't buy it, and it's

32:17.640 --> 32:25.600
partly because even in Londginis, one of his great examples of the sublime is a poem

32:25.600 --> 32:27.880
lyric poem by Sappho.

32:27.880 --> 32:32.440
And it's the first time in classical literary criticism I know of that a woman writer's

32:32.440 --> 32:34.800
work is taken that seriously.

32:34.800 --> 32:38.440
And I'm not a classicist, so I don't know this for sure, but is that the only reason

32:38.440 --> 32:40.920
we have this poem by Sappho?

32:40.920 --> 32:42.440
Because Londginis preserved it that way?

32:42.440 --> 32:44.240
I think maybe I heard that one.

32:44.240 --> 32:50.960
I think that it is the most preserved form of poem, though.

32:50.960 --> 32:55.440
It was on, its praises were on everyone's lips.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.440
And had been.

32:56.440 --> 33:02.680
I mean, the extraordinary thing about the poem, as Londginis says, is that it expresses

33:02.680 --> 33:13.520
uncontrollably emotion in perfectly controlled verse, the verse which we now call, sapphix.

33:13.520 --> 33:19.480
It's an absolutely perfectly controlled meter, and yet constantly straining against it is

33:19.480 --> 33:27.440
the volcanic emotion that she's feeling about her lost, beloved, anectoria.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.200
And it's very emotional, and it's very physical.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.600
It's very bodily.

33:31.600 --> 33:38.000
And she's looking at this beloved woman, and she's sweating, she's trembling, she's gasping

33:38.000 --> 33:41.520
for breath, she's cold and she's hot.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.920
And it's the combination of all these things, Londginis says, that makes it sublime, the

33:45.920 --> 33:51.400
fact that she can weave together all these chaotic and even contradictory physiological

33:51.400 --> 33:53.800
symptoms as well as an.

33:53.800 --> 33:59.480
So in Burke too, the great 18th century sublime theorist in the English tradition, in Burke

33:59.480 --> 34:02.480
the sublime is very physical and very bodily.

34:02.480 --> 34:11.400
And part of the slam against the sublime was that it's disembodied, and it's transcendental,

34:11.400 --> 34:17.800
that there's such a rich sublime tradition, including Londginis and that citation of Sappho,

34:17.800 --> 34:23.440
you know, that says, no, we feel the sublime in our bodies and with our bodies.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.920
It's not up there someplace.

34:25.920 --> 34:32.880
That's the, as I'm listening, I keep wondering, it's not anything I know much about.

34:32.880 --> 34:43.960
But as I listen, I am not clear what's the, what is the experience and what is the product

34:43.960 --> 34:47.000
that causes that experience.

34:47.000 --> 34:58.840
So when you go up on the mountain and you are looking, is that perspective, that scenario

34:58.840 --> 35:05.920
what you are seeing or is it what you are feeling the sublime.

35:05.920 --> 35:10.520
And as a second question is, what is it you are feeling?

35:10.520 --> 35:16.760
If you were to, because it seems there's always a lack of sharpness to me when we say

35:16.760 --> 35:18.200
it's sublime.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.600
What is it?

35:19.600 --> 35:21.920
And what is it we feel?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.920
Is it joy?

35:22.920 --> 35:24.920
Is it all?

35:24.920 --> 35:32.160
Is it the uncanny feeling which contains elements of some anxiety or discomfort?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
So my...

35:33.160 --> 35:41.040
Yeah, you know, the mountains by themselves are, if nobody's there, the mountains aren't

35:41.040 --> 35:42.960
sublime, right?

35:42.960 --> 35:45.560
The sublime is a human experience.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.320
You need a human observer to have the sublime experience.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.640
So that one's easy.

35:49.640 --> 35:55.680
You know, the ocean isn't sublime when no one's out at sea in it, but you know, when

35:55.680 --> 36:00.520
you have a huge wave and you're seeing it, it's sublime.

36:00.520 --> 36:05.000
You know, that lack of definition is, this will sound like a cop out, but I don't think

36:05.000 --> 36:06.400
it is.

36:06.400 --> 36:11.160
The lack of definition is built into the sublime because it's what eludes our categories.

36:11.160 --> 36:16.920
It's what Teats has this lovely phrase, you know, when he talks about how the Elgin

36:16.920 --> 36:23.040
Marvel's Teases Out of Thought, the sublime is what Teases us Out of Thought.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.800
We can't...

36:24.800 --> 36:31.760
Our well-honed, you know, cognitive abilities are well-used, stable categories.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.320
They just fall by the wayside.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.560
It's a moment for me, the sublime is a moment of breakdown.

36:38.560 --> 36:45.880
And in that moment, we get this sense that the world was greater than we ever suppose.

36:45.880 --> 36:49.600
And Kant would add that, you know, the human mind is greater than we ever suppose, because

36:49.600 --> 36:55.040
somehow, even though we can't imagine it, we can't take it in, we're still cognizing

36:55.040 --> 36:59.800
it in some odd, intuitive feeling way.

36:59.800 --> 37:04.520
So it's hard for me to know exactly what Kant means at that moment, but it's almost

37:04.520 --> 37:07.320
like we feel our way into it.

37:07.320 --> 37:12.160
We can't grasp it, but we know it's there.

37:12.160 --> 37:19.760
I understand that, but then when I listen to James, and I'm very happy that he's here,

37:19.760 --> 37:26.640
because he brings a perspective which I think is so important in this, he feels the sublime

37:26.640 --> 37:29.360
a lot of the time.

37:29.360 --> 37:33.320
You have to go up those mountains.

37:33.320 --> 37:41.080
And James, he's almost constantly in the sublime.

37:41.080 --> 37:44.960
That's why I started off by saying, I think music is the easiest.

37:44.960 --> 37:50.200
But I was thinking about the mountains as well, because I had that same feeling when

37:50.200 --> 37:51.800
I'd go up into the mountains.

37:51.800 --> 37:57.120
And now I was thinking, I'm trying to figure this out for myself, the great symphonies

37:57.120 --> 37:58.760
of Brookner.

37:58.760 --> 38:03.240
I always think are sort of written for the mountain tops.

38:03.240 --> 38:08.240
And he was writing his music to the glory of God, but somehow when you hear those giant

38:08.240 --> 38:14.440
symphonies with their perfect mathematical structure, that's sort of where it takes me.

38:14.440 --> 38:23.920
But music is not about trying to replicate the mountains.

38:23.920 --> 38:30.840
And Beethoven in the pastoral symphony, as Wagner said, is not trying to depict the

38:30.840 --> 38:31.840
countryside.

38:31.840 --> 38:35.320
It's going beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond.

38:35.320 --> 38:41.800
So for me, when I listen to a Brookner symphony, I get an extra dimension, frankly, than I

38:41.800 --> 38:46.560
do from just being on the mountain top and being overwhelmed by that.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.240
And great music for me.

38:49.240 --> 38:52.080
That's because I'm a very simple soul, I think.

38:52.080 --> 39:01.440
Great music just puts me in touch, I think, with everything that has existed for all of

39:01.440 --> 39:04.600
my lack of knowledge about pretty much everything.

39:04.600 --> 39:10.240
That somehow there is a truth and a unity.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.600
It's not a religion.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.840
And I think I'm not going to say that, to what extent is all of this eventually just

39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
chemicals?

39:17.840 --> 39:20.920
I mean, this worries me a lot.

39:20.920 --> 39:25.560
I'm thinking about, I try to analyze why do I have these feelings about music.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.160
And I want to know more about what it is, and these days.

39:29.160 --> 39:36.600
And is there not a path that is leading us to believe that all of this is simply actions?

39:36.600 --> 39:43.120
Well, going back to the distinction between the sublime and the experience of the sublime

39:43.120 --> 39:45.720
in the mountains.

39:45.720 --> 39:54.120
Kant actually mentions the peasants of the Savoy, the Savoy, who are so acclimatized

39:54.120 --> 39:59.000
to the mountains because they live there, that they have no experience of them at all.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.320
And it's just their daily environment.

40:03.320 --> 40:11.120
So that what Kant is suggesting is that a certain distance from the quotidian experience

40:11.120 --> 40:15.320
of whatever it is that surrounds you is required.

40:15.320 --> 40:18.800
And in a certain sense, that's not chemical.

40:18.800 --> 40:24.120
Because if it were a chemical, you're in a mountain, you're going to have the experience.

40:24.120 --> 40:30.600
And that's that, whereas Kant is suggesting that it must, to some extent, be a question

40:30.600 --> 40:34.120
of environmental distance and not intimacy.

40:34.120 --> 40:39.400
And that's where the element of fear, for one thing, comes in, which is so frequently

40:39.400 --> 40:43.960
associated with the first phase of the experience of the sublime.

40:43.960 --> 40:50.720
The idea is that initially, in response to something that seems overwhelming, we feel

40:50.720 --> 40:52.000
fear.

40:52.000 --> 41:00.760
But then we realize that we're not actually in danger, that it is a kind of a proxy danger,

41:00.760 --> 41:03.320
that we are in effect safe.

41:03.320 --> 41:06.960
We're standing at the top of the mountain, but there's the railing that the tourist

41:06.960 --> 41:09.400
industry has put in for us.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
And okay, fine.

41:11.400 --> 41:23.360
And then, through a kind of recoil or retrieval of self-respect, we internalize the experience.

41:23.360 --> 41:34.440
And we feel that in some sense, it is the result of our own emotional or negative power.

41:34.440 --> 41:37.400
So that, and Lonzainus says this too.

41:37.400 --> 41:43.320
He says, the amazing thing about a great utterance is that it transports us.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.880
It puts us into an ecstasy, extosus.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.880
It transports us.

41:47.880 --> 41:55.600
So that we imagine that we ourselves have produced the thing that we have heard.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.600
So he takes you through the whole experience as well.

41:58.600 --> 42:03.400
It's like a kid watching a baseball game and swinging his little toy bat.

42:03.400 --> 42:08.080
He hits a home run and he's just so enthusiastic, swinging his bat.

42:08.080 --> 42:11.080
He thinks he hits the home run himself.

42:11.080 --> 42:15.320
He had through the intensity of identification.

42:15.320 --> 42:20.400
He has this moment of thinking he did it, which is part of the excitement.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.640
Right, in music, the great interpreters are recreators.

42:24.640 --> 42:28.120
I think the moment of performance, you are the creator.

42:28.120 --> 42:32.400
I mean, you have to be to make it convincing, I think.

42:32.400 --> 42:41.520
Well, one thing that fosters a puzzled over with this sublime experience that is this

42:41.520 --> 42:50.080
kind of mixed, painful, pleasurable experience, which I think will get to some of your worries

42:50.080 --> 42:58.520
is that it's not clear where exactly the pleasure should come from this experience.

42:58.520 --> 43:07.160
So if the experience starts off with a feeling of being kind of terrified or overwhelmed,

43:07.160 --> 43:11.120
potentially insignificant in some ways, where does the pleasure come from?

43:11.120 --> 43:16.040
And that's been kind of a puzzle for philosophers from the 18th century on.

43:16.040 --> 43:19.480
I've just been thinking about that.

43:19.480 --> 43:23.800
And in relation to the experience on the mountain and the experience of great music, it's a

43:23.800 --> 43:26.560
profound and wonderful loneliness.

43:26.560 --> 43:39.160
You know, pleasurable, but terrifying, but worrying about wonderful loneliness.

43:39.160 --> 43:44.960
That's interesting because part of the political critique is that the sublime is demagoguery

43:44.960 --> 43:54.400
and that the power of an orator is capable of transforming masses into a single entity

43:54.400 --> 43:57.640
or sinister community.

43:57.640 --> 43:58.640
Yeah.

43:58.640 --> 44:07.600
Well, I think the various philosophers have tried to come up with the answer to, you know,

44:07.600 --> 44:09.680
where's the pleasure coming from?

44:09.680 --> 44:18.440
And in some ways, I guess you get a more democratic kind of an answer from the transcendental

44:18.440 --> 44:26.560
philosophers that in some ways that this experience highlights a kind of power within the individual,

44:26.560 --> 44:35.720
within all human beings, in some ways to withstand this terrifying or overwhelming environment

44:35.720 --> 44:37.440
or force.

44:37.440 --> 44:45.880
So that there's a kind of a dialectic between feeling existentially very small and frail,

44:45.880 --> 44:53.960
feeling powerful and in some ways transcending natural limits that one is confronted with

44:53.960 --> 44:56.680
in these kinds of experiences.

44:56.680 --> 44:57.680
So yeah.

44:57.680 --> 45:03.880
And by the way, in New Zealand, you seldom find those safety rails when you go.

45:03.880 --> 45:11.400
You know, so I wondered to what extent are a search for this sublime in nature in this

45:11.400 --> 45:17.520
country where there are too many safety things there for it to remind you, whereas in New

45:17.520 --> 45:22.280
Zealand, there's this fantastic kind of risk and people get killed and eaten by sharks

45:22.280 --> 45:28.120
in Australia because there's no notice saying that sharks could eat you, you know.

45:28.120 --> 45:29.120
So yeah.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.880
Hands the privilege of music.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.880
The what?

45:32.880 --> 45:34.880
Hands the privilege of music.

45:34.880 --> 45:35.880
Yes.

45:35.880 --> 45:43.680
But is that the whole sublime experience?

45:43.680 --> 45:48.120
In other words, you feel the fear.

45:48.120 --> 45:57.880
But does the absence of the safety net, let's say, prevent you from the recoil and recovery

45:57.880 --> 46:03.480
that is allegedly or traditionally part of the experience?

46:03.480 --> 46:09.160
In musical terms, I realize that the only times that I think I can produce music of any

46:09.160 --> 46:15.160
worth, which is probably seldom to be honest or any obvious, is when there's...

46:15.160 --> 46:18.520
Don't say that, you will not have a job.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.720
There's absolutely no sleep.

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
No, no, no, no.

46:21.720 --> 46:25.800
You have to really throw all of that away.

46:25.800 --> 46:31.320
And the great performers that I think, or we talked about Fuddfenga earlier, an age where

46:31.320 --> 46:37.480
they were doing less repertoire, but doing it with such a whole-heartedness, it's very

46:37.480 --> 46:43.080
seldom that I hear this is a terrible thing to say, right?

46:43.080 --> 46:49.080
Modern performances where I don't feel safety net and there's something too structured as

46:49.080 --> 46:53.320
there's something around the performance that doesn't release the sublime.

46:53.320 --> 46:57.400
I mean, listen, sorry, but I'm thinking of no safety net.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.720
Listen to Glenn Gould playing Goldberg variations.

47:00.720 --> 47:03.440
If you want the sublime.

47:03.440 --> 47:09.200
And that's also interesting because when I think about that, you can watch him play

47:09.200 --> 47:11.880
and you can listen to him play.

47:11.880 --> 47:14.240
And is the experience the same?

47:14.240 --> 47:21.040
Is it even more sublime when you see this soul so wrapped up in his loneliness with this

47:21.040 --> 47:25.360
music that you're drawn in profoundly?

47:25.360 --> 47:30.960
Yeah, there's a category.

47:30.960 --> 47:37.040
As you were talking about the lack of the safety net, I was thinking, if you read people

47:37.040 --> 47:44.800
that nature writers like John Muir or that class, there's a class of experience called

47:44.800 --> 47:52.080
edge experiences that often get represented where, again, you're pushed beyond what you

47:52.080 --> 47:53.920
think is possible for you.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.040
And yet you still survive.

47:57.040 --> 48:03.920
And that is often a moment that that unleashes the sublime description.

48:03.920 --> 48:10.240
And so I agree, if you play with a net, if you've got the guardrail, it's not going to

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
happen.

48:11.240 --> 48:16.200
On the other hand, if you don't survive, then you can't ever tell about it.

48:16.200 --> 48:22.840
I guess that's what I meant about the shark.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.600
What about Chopinhauer?

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
Chopinhauer.

48:26.600 --> 48:32.360
His theory of the sublime is, I think, very Kantian.

48:32.360 --> 48:37.520
He kind of takes over a lot of the Kantian theory, the distinction between the dynamical

48:37.520 --> 48:40.200
and the mathematical sublime.

48:40.200 --> 48:44.760
But the key difference, I think, between their theories and actually this might lead into

48:44.760 --> 48:52.600
the music as well, is that for Kant, the source of the pleasure and the experience of the

48:52.600 --> 49:01.480
sublime comes from the recognition of a super sensible part of us, which is for Kant our

49:01.480 --> 49:10.560
rational location, our vocation to sort of understand, fathom nature as fully as possible

49:10.560 --> 49:18.520
and our moral rational vocation to be able to obey the moral law no matter what kinds

49:18.520 --> 49:21.840
of obstacles are put in our way.

49:21.840 --> 49:29.360
And Chopinhauer had a very different view about morality and different take on the powers

49:29.360 --> 49:30.560
of reason.

49:30.560 --> 49:38.200
And so he replaces the role of reason in Kant with a certain kind of attitudinal freedom

49:38.200 --> 49:46.000
so that when one is faced with very terrifying landscape, let's say you're facing a volcano

49:46.000 --> 49:55.360
or a tornado or something or a raging storm at sea, that the pleasure that one would feel

49:55.360 --> 50:03.120
according to Chopinhauer's theory would be a sense that one has a power to sort of respond

50:03.120 --> 50:05.120
to it in a different way.

50:05.120 --> 50:14.760
So one can not care, one can kind of disengage from the will.

50:14.760 --> 50:19.200
But actually, Chopinhauer's theory is really interesting for music and I think why he was

50:19.200 --> 50:28.200
such a darling of composers in that music for him was extraordinarily special in that

50:28.200 --> 50:37.640
for his metaphysics, the ultimate nature of the world is will, sort of a blind striving.

50:37.640 --> 50:46.760
And Chopinhauer thought that music actually was a copy of the metaphysical will and so

50:46.760 --> 50:51.800
actually one's experience with music would be, with the right sort of music would be

50:51.800 --> 50:55.840
more powerful than any other experience with art.

50:55.840 --> 51:00.400
And one thing that's puzzled me though actually about Chopinhauer's aesthetic theory with respect

51:00.400 --> 51:07.880
to music is that he himself does not apply his categories of the beautiful and the sublime

51:07.880 --> 51:09.680
to music.

51:09.680 --> 51:14.280
He talks about music as being the most powerful art form where we really sort of tap into

51:14.280 --> 51:22.360
the ultimate nature of the world and we resonate with universal emotions and that gets us closest

51:22.360 --> 51:30.680
to the way things really are but he does not talk about music as either a beautiful or

51:30.680 --> 51:39.960
sublime but it seems that those categories would naturally fit quite well with music.

51:39.960 --> 51:48.200
And I know Hanslek wrote on the musically beautiful but I was wondering actually if you

51:48.200 --> 51:57.160
thought that is there a specific sort of music or there are specific kinds of forms in music

51:57.160 --> 52:03.360
that you think would be the musically sublime that would be.

52:03.360 --> 52:08.440
Of particular forms it's difficult to say.

52:08.440 --> 52:13.880
I mean the Chopinhauer was such an influence on great music.

52:13.880 --> 52:19.880
You can't imagine certain pieces I guess existing the same way without Chopinhauer in my limited

52:19.880 --> 52:25.600
knowledge you know what I've read about the influence with Wagner and so on.

52:25.600 --> 52:33.760
But when we think back in music I think the first sort of music I would call sublime might

52:33.760 --> 52:41.960
be the music that had relatively little formal structure in a sense like music of Palestrina,

52:41.960 --> 52:45.780
these great core pieces of Talis.

52:45.780 --> 52:56.200
Music that just seems to hypnotize to flow, to be in touch with something that just goes

52:56.200 --> 53:00.680
directly to our souls without us having to have any knowledge.

53:00.680 --> 53:04.480
I think that's a great thing about music.

53:04.480 --> 53:09.280
Maybe what he was capturing, talking about the will that music is closest is because

53:09.280 --> 53:15.920
it's something so natural and to be very simplistic about it that wherever we go in the world

53:15.920 --> 53:21.240
and we play a minor triad and we play a major triad everybody is going to understand what

53:21.240 --> 53:25.440
is sad and what is happy, what is the fast rhythm, the slow rhythm.

53:25.440 --> 53:33.720
So it's just I think was he saying that there's something so simply natural about music?

53:33.720 --> 53:41.400
Yeah, I definitely thought that there was a kind of universal language of feeling to

53:41.400 --> 53:43.520
music, at least the right sort of music.

53:43.520 --> 53:53.000
He had tremendous criticisms of program music and music that wasn't truly expressive.

53:53.000 --> 53:59.280
I think Wagner was very careful to talk about Beethoven, it's not a picture, the pastoral

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
symphony.

54:00.280 --> 54:06.400
So many composers subsequently have been very, very cautious about attributing any kind

54:06.400 --> 54:07.640
of description to that.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.840
I put something and then withdrawn it later for this very, very reason because when you're

54:11.840 --> 54:19.040
listening to the scene by the brook of Beethoven, you're not picturing a brook with fish and

54:19.040 --> 54:20.600
glints of water.

54:20.600 --> 54:23.760
Sometimes when we interpret that music and you're working with an orchestra and you're

54:23.760 --> 54:29.160
not getting the sound you want, you do describe and you try to get the music by painting a

54:29.160 --> 54:30.160
picture from home.

54:30.160 --> 54:35.960
But that's not what it's about, it's about the overwhelming feeling of emotion.

54:35.960 --> 54:39.680
How do you separate emotion from the sublime?

54:39.680 --> 54:48.480
I mean, what is the difference between overwhelming emotion, overwhelming happiness and sublimity?

54:48.480 --> 54:50.480
What is that?

54:50.480 --> 54:57.560
Well, I think the sublime needs to be in some ways turbulent.

54:57.560 --> 55:03.280
So there needs to be some kind of dialectic, maybe this is controversial, but some sort

55:03.280 --> 55:12.360
of dialectic between a kind of feeling overwhelmed and then in some ways which would seem quite

55:12.360 --> 55:23.040
negative, feeling overwhelmed by emotion or overwhelmingly sad and then some sort of positive,

55:23.040 --> 55:27.000
effective experience that counters that.

55:27.000 --> 55:36.280
So I'm not sure if an overwhelming sense of happiness would be a candidate for a sublime

55:36.280 --> 55:40.600
experience unless there was in some ways some turbulence there.

55:40.600 --> 55:45.800
It's interesting because most people when they talk about their love of Mozart and a

55:45.800 --> 55:51.080
phrase of Mozart that really moves you, you talk about the happiness of Mozart but always

55:51.080 --> 55:55.360
with a tinge of sadness, there's always something more than just happiness.

55:55.360 --> 56:00.440
It's always, this genius always somehow reflects a contrast.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.680
Oh, in the holy halls.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.480
Yes.

56:05.480 --> 56:08.120
What about program music?

56:08.120 --> 56:14.080
Is there the possibility of sublimity in barely oats when we know the head is falling

56:14.080 --> 56:22.520
from the guillotine into the basket or in Peter and the Wolf or whatever program music one

56:22.520 --> 56:28.600
chooses to name, is there a possibility of sublimity or does the, I don't know, literary

56:28.600 --> 56:33.240
ness or narrative ambition of the music somehow preclude the sublime?

56:33.240 --> 56:37.160
No, I'm thinking actually the barely of somebody fantastic.

56:37.160 --> 56:42.880
You think of the first movement of his inspiration from his unrequited loves and so on.

56:42.880 --> 56:48.360
But when you think of the nature of that music in the first movement, I think that reaches

56:48.360 --> 56:55.640
a kind of sublime because it just transcends any kind of poem or any kind of feeling.

56:55.640 --> 57:02.320
I'm not sure about the march to the scaffold with the head falling into the basket but

57:02.320 --> 57:03.480
maybe we need that contrast.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.120
I think programmatic music can be sublime.

57:06.120 --> 57:13.720
Think of, you know, you might like the Strauss Alpine Symphony where he does sort of describe

57:13.720 --> 57:17.200
in chapters the journey of the mountain.

57:17.200 --> 57:23.920
I think that that can reach in our minds in great performance, a tremendous sublimity.

57:23.920 --> 57:27.360
I think it can be.

57:27.360 --> 57:28.360
Why not?

57:28.360 --> 57:32.440
But it somehow also, I also feel that those great pieces don't need the programmatic

57:32.440 --> 57:33.440
content.

57:33.440 --> 57:37.520
As we've been talking about the sublime in music, I've been thinking about are there

57:37.520 --> 57:43.000
art forms that can't convey the sublime very well and I was thinking about film because

57:43.000 --> 57:46.600
clearly there are films that try to convey the sublime.

57:46.600 --> 57:51.200
But if you see them 20 years later, they just seem sort of pathetic in those attempts,

57:51.200 --> 57:53.400
like the Ten Commandments.

57:53.400 --> 57:57.480
I think for early audiences that was like, wow, that's onswire.

57:57.480 --> 57:58.480
We see it.

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
They're not a spore option.

57:59.480 --> 58:00.480
Yeah, right.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.320
The first time you saw no spore option.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.680
But they have to have music as well.

58:06.680 --> 58:07.680
Right.

58:07.680 --> 58:12.280
Well, and they do use music but like James Cameron's Titanic, that was an attempt to mass market

58:12.280 --> 58:19.760
the sublime or the perfect storm at that moment when Mark Wahlberg for all his muscles is

58:19.760 --> 58:22.960
about that big and the wave is that big.

58:22.960 --> 58:27.440
That's a sublime moment but does it work or is it sort of cheesy?

58:27.440 --> 58:30.680
Can film is film unable to sustain?

58:30.680 --> 58:33.400
Can I make?

58:33.400 --> 58:34.400
As opposed to...

58:34.400 --> 58:35.400
I'm not trying to be a snob.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.400
I'm just...

58:36.400 --> 58:37.400
No, I'm just...

58:37.400 --> 58:40.400
I'm just inviting you guys to be snobs.

58:40.400 --> 58:43.840
I'm trying so hard.

58:43.840 --> 58:51.960
Well, I mean, the question of whether artworks at all could be sublime has been a somewhat

58:51.960 --> 58:53.760
controversial issue.

58:53.760 --> 58:57.360
I mean, so in some ways that, you know, every...

58:57.360 --> 59:02.840
Well, should I say, pretty much every work of art has some form or it has beginning,

59:02.840 --> 59:11.400
in case of musical compositions, beginning and an end or a painting has a frame, you

59:11.400 --> 59:15.680
know, there's a form to a film.

59:15.680 --> 59:20.640
So would that in some ways discount it from being sublime just there?

59:20.640 --> 59:24.960
And actually on some readings of Con, Con does sort of say, no, artworks can't be sublime

59:24.960 --> 59:29.920
even though he has certain examples that he uses of sublime artworks but it seems like

59:29.920 --> 59:33.640
it's a position that he made, it really held.

59:33.640 --> 59:41.480
But it seems that it's as long as one can kind of...

59:41.480 --> 59:47.720
If one has the sort of emotional response to say the Titanic, especially when it first

59:47.720 --> 59:56.280
came out and there had been a lot of imitators, if one can have the experience of feeling

59:56.280 --> 01:00:04.440
somehow overwhelmed or by the power of the sea and get into that dialectic of thought

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.360
and emotion, then why not?

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.120
Why couldn't that absolutely be sublime?

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:11.520
I don't see any reason in principle why it couldn't be.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.600
It creates the New Zealand experience.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:23.440
But it really does come back to the question though of the place of form and thinking about

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.600
the sublime again, as you say.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:31.400
And you began by, or at one point reminded us that especially in the 18th century the

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:39.920
sublime is the gendered beautiful, Addison and Burke describe the beautiful as smooth

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.440
and round and soft.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.480
Get it?

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:52.560
And associates the beautiful with reproduction.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:59.040
The sort of the whole 18th century, Addison says of the beautiful, he distinguishes three

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:07.600
categories, the beautiful, the uncommon as he calls it, which came to be called the picturesque

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.000
and the great, which came to be called the sublime.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.440
Well, the purpose of each of those is spelled out by Addison.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:22.480
He says that the beautiful exists to procreate the species.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:30.160
He says that the uncommon exists to inspire curiosity and to increase knowledge and that

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.560
the great exists to make us experience reverence for God.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:45.280
In other words, it is something finite, but in the contemplation of which we realize that

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.600
there's something infinite.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.880
In other words, in a certain sense, it already anticipates the argument of God except it's

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.880
not a subjective idea but a spiritual or transcendent idea.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:07.360
But the beautiful is plainly the usurper of any idea of form because even the picturesque

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.280
to some extent, and certainly the great or the sublime, tend to take us out of form,

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.640
not necessarily not by way of form, I mean, obviously the intermediation is formal, but

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.080
it takes us out of form.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:31.880
Whereas the beautiful is as it were form and for itself and for its own sake.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:38.280
So the place of form in this conversation, I continue to think is an important one.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:43.880
This round table, you have a picture, a Turner picture, right?

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.800
On the website, I think.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:52.320
And just as you were speaking, I was reminded that Fingal's Cave of Mendelssohn, this wonderful

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:57.400
piece from the 1830s, came out the same, I think was performed the same year as the

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400
Turner picture.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.400
Is that right?

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.920
Of Fingal's Cave.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.560
And that is framed.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.040
Mendelssohn's music is not.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.920
Which is closest to the sublime, I wonder.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:14.320
Well, the Turner does its best not to be formal.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.640
You have this huge cliff.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:22.720
The actual cave is almost impossible to discern in the painting.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:30.600
You then have the sea and you have the one thing that is formally and conspicuously there

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:39.560
is the, looks like a freight boat with a big cloud of black steam coming out of it.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:46.200
On which we understand Turner was seated when he was thinking about how to compose his painting.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.320
And that's what you can see.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:54.000
As if to say, well, I am doing this from a perspective and I can show you the perspective

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.080
clearly.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:02.520
But I don't actually want to show you the cave itself, maybe for just the reason that

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.440
if I do, music will have the advantage of me.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:13.520
But as you describe the Turner painting, there's that loss of outline again and that confusion

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.840
of categories, what sky and what sea.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:23.480
Or you know the burning ship paintings, what's fire and what's lightning coming down and

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.680
what's a shaft of light.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.400
And it goes back to the Sappho poem where you're trembling and you're cold and you're hot

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.400
and you're sweating all at the same time.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.800
And you can't organize your experience.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.520
Your experience becomes radically disorganized and yet it's more powerful than it's ever

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520
been.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:51.200
So, for me, Turner totally works as a sublime but it's probably because he really captures

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:55.280
that suspension of our ordinary categories.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.680
That seems to me to be one of his big programs in his art.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:03.440
He was way ahead of music at that time after all.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:09.480
I mean Mendelssohn's music is absolutely beautiful but very formally structured and is more obviously

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.080
picturesque, although I would argue that it isn't really.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.080
It goes much deeper than that.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:20.400
But when you think of what Turner was doing in the 30s, was 1832 I think.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:36.560
I mean, music came several decades later, music that was so unfocused in the way.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:43.040
You're going to the impressionists and it's amazing how I have to give it to Turner over

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.520
Mendelssohn.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:51.600
It's interesting too that when you think about Turner, when you think about some of

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:59.320
the composers, there's a lot of hostility initially when they're doing their great works.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.840
A lot of people don't understand them.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:10.520
And is that somehow tied in with the sublime, the art that goes ahead of its audience, which

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:15.600
would again make it very different from a mass marketed film that wants to manipulate

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.680
its audience, that wants to hit its audience right where it already is.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:26.240
Stravinsky famously said, I was the vessel through which Lesaka passed.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:34.360
And you think of Schoenberg's music, which I would argue is absolutely sublime when he

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:43.560
became more expressionistic with the 12 tone system, so to speak, which music sounds more

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.640
modern today than most music being written today, actually, in the century on is still

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.000
totally misunderstood.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:59.760
It seems that music takes a long time to catch up and we're in a world where we are so visual.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:07.400
I would love to see a sublime cuddly toy made and my sublime cuddly toy would be a sort

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:16.840
of 12 tone wind up thing for babies to see what influence that would have on their perception

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.960
of music in later life.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:26.320
I was just going to remark, in fact, in response to Alan's question how it is that art we consider

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:32.240
to be sublime or at least to have a legitimate aspiration to sublimity is so often greeted

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.720
with hostility.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.320
And once spontaneous first response is, well, obviously, we fear what we don't know.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:46.360
So it's a sublime emotion that we're having and it just kind of gets stuck on the dislike

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.080
that comes of fear and what we don't know.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:56.200
But at the same time, you know, there again the question of is there a sublime experience?

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:59.960
The initial feeling of which is not fear.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:05.680
I think that in the time being music and the way in which we respond to music, you've been

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:12.640
very strongly suggesting that that probably we need to not that some sublime experiences

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:20.840
don't begin in fear but that we need to dissociate, let's say our definition of the sublime experience

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.640
from the notion that it begins in fear.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:30.200
There's a sublime moment in music which you either consider sublime or cheesy.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200
I consider sublime.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:37.160
There's a wonderful oratorio by Edward Elgar whose music I love being English, the dream

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.520
of Gerontius or Gerontius.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:45.400
And there's a moment in that enormous work where there's a terrifying sort of march in

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:55.960
the music and everything just goes crash and still where Gerontius is allowed or perhaps

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.920
allowed to see God for a moment but can't face.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.200
And I'm thinking it allowed to see the sublime in a way.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.080
So I don't think it's anything to do with God that's too restricting.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:16.680
But it is the most amazing moment in music where it's so f***ing music, it's so fearful,

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.520
it's so overwhelming.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:28.640
And the moment of reaching something, it's unattainable and everything collapses.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.080
So the sublime is unattainable, Elgar's case.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.880
Ready for questions?

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:36.880
Yes.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
Okay.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:46.680
Please line up.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:55.960
It seems to me that there are a few ghosts who have been haunting this discussion and

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:09.560
I would like to hear your remarks on that and that those would be society, culture and

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.280
class.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:18.840
And neither of those have been mentioned in an explicit way and it seems to me to be

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:26.560
very much the foundation of the sublime the way it's been discussed here.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:38.080
Yeah, well we talked a little bit about society in relation to Longinus, right?

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:43.600
And his concern that this debate that was going on, whether you need a democratic society

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.240
for this, which is interesting because that would distance it from these fears that the

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.520
sublime is related to authoritarianism that Paul mentioned.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:00.480
Or whether what you need is a society that's less commercialistic and materialistic.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:07.320
When you mention class, I don't know if there's an implicit question there about whether the

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:14.760
sublime is an inherently upper class phenomenon that you don't have a sublime until you have

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760
a...

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.840
Yeah, please.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:27.400
What I mean is when we're talking about sublime in music, it seems to me that there's most

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:34.800
of music that most people listen to really has a great class difference from the classical

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:40.600
music, especially 12 tone music.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.840
What about the pretenders?

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:53.000
I mean, I think right, there's as much ecstasy and sublimity there as in any music.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.720
But somehow that hasn't been a part of this discussion and it seems to me we're talking

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:08.360
about a particular notion of the sublime, which really has a class foundation or at least

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.880
a part of the foundation does.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.720
Right, my vote would be for Jimi Hendrix.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:21.240
But seriously, and you know, you're right, I mean, here we're all academically trained

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:30.120
and so we're going to our stock academic examples, Turner, Moller, Milton, you've heard them

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:34.680
all and you're right, there's a bigger world of sublime out there.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.360
It's interesting in terms of the limits of the discussion, it is interesting that we

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.600
don't want to talk very much about religion because there's clearly an overlap between

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:48.600
the awe of the sublime and the awe of a lot of religious discourse and experience.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.880
So yeah, you've definitely located one of our blind spots so far.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.240
All along the watch tower in particular, if we vote for Jimi Hendrix.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.320
And the musicians pointed you, I mean, one of the things I truly believe is music is

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:11.320
music, you know, so within the day of music, I hate the barriers that we put up that are

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.440
both restrictive and suggestive of class and elitism.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:30.680
But what I'm just thinking about mostly is culture, which licenses ecstasy and that's

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:43.720
the kind of sublime that I find the most aggressive, you know, has the most aggressive

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:51.240
call on my particular way of responding.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:59.640
And it's distinctly a social form and that really hasn't been mentioned.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:09.560
Yes, we understand about, you know, whether it's democracy or you shouldn't be so, you

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.360
know, much interested in money.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.640
So the wealthy who don't have to worry about money, it's not the poor people, right?

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.280
So do they somehow lack for the sublime, right?

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:29.000
Could I jump in actually just quick because I do think we've been largely talking about

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.600
an aesthetic tradition that considers aesthetic experience to be disinterested.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:40.120
And so there is a certain kind of presumption that, well, one needs to have some leisure

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:46.440
time, one needs to be able to take, you know, time away from one's concerns in order to

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.040
appreciate something in a disinterested fashion.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:57.480
That you could say, well, that's a privilege of people who have some significant leisure

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.240
time.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:06.760
But at least with the 18th century tradition of the sublime, I would say it focused more

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.040
on nature, though, than art.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:18.120
And one of the environments that was seen to be the most sublime were the starry heavens

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:25.200
above us, which is anybody, you know, with eyes to look up at the night sky.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:32.520
So I think it's, I mean, I agree that kind of class bias, one needs the leisure time

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:38.920
in order to have a kind of disinterested appreciation, but the objects, the sublime, I would think,

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.440
in some ways, are more democratically open.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440
Okay.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.040
I'd be more of a discussion.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.880
Or is these days flexible?

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.880
Yeah.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.680
I would allow people with questions for it.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:55.680
Okay, go ahead.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.120
Thanks, everybody, for a memorable discussion.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:07.400
My question is for Professor Frye specifically in a concerns ecology and the sublime.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.480
Characterizations of the sublime historically have been inflected with terms of terror

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:15.720
and fear, which precipitate from the central concern of death and the subjectivity that

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.640
gives rise to.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.600
It's universally acknowledged, or ought to be universally acknowledged, is tracked towards

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:28.880
what C.S.L.A. would call the death of earth in four quartets.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:35.400
Fossil fuels accumulating in our atmosphere just rang for me when you talked about the

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.280
sublime as repetition and accretion.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:44.440
And that production is ingrained in our quotidian lives, our daily lives.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:50.880
So if the experience of the sublime requires a kind of distance from quotidian experience,

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.480
then that be achieved in this particular context.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:00.080
If it requires this kind of internalization of a proxy danger, what happens when the danger

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.160
is very real?

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.600
How does that complicate the internalization process?

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:13.280
Guess what I'm getting at in the context of our ecological moment, the impending catastrophe

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280
probably.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.240
We don't have a time scale, but it's looking that way.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.320
The reality of sublimity available to us.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.480
If it's not, is that a problem?

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.800
And if that's a problem, is it a political problem?

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800
Thank you.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800
Thank you.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.360
It's a very interesting question.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:38.720
I think the very concept of the Anthropocene itself is sublime, primarily because it has

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:46.160
to do with the traditional, very traditional way in which the sublime is a questioning

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.760
of the limits of human power.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.920
There's an odd paradox about the Anthropocene.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:59.200
On the one hand, we are holding our feet to the fire as a civilization in a way that

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.120
we never did before.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.240
And on the other hand, we are supposing ourselves to have greater power than we supposed ourselves

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.320
ever to have before.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.480
And in either case, you could say, that it's something like a sublime experience.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:23.360
I suppose the question is, depending on the degree that one might feel that the Anthropocene

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:32.200
is, how can I say it, a strong argument as opposed to a concern of global warming?

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:41.040
One might wonder about whether or not the relationship between the human and the impending

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.840
disaster remains sublime in the same way.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:53.600
You could argue, given the agreement most of us probably share that the debate is impending,

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:59.000
you could argue that this is very much like the traditional sublime moment in which one

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.920
is having a Birkian experience of being overwhelmed by something external.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:12.480
And you could argue that if we accept the strong argument about human responsibility,

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:20.920
that that's more like the content experience of recognizing something in yourself in response

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.040
to what you see in the external world.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.560
So I guess I would put the ecological question in relation to the sublime in those terms.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:35.360
Sorry to have gone on, but you did ask me.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.360
I too would like to thank the panel for a fascinating and broad-ranging discussion.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:47.800
The question I have, I guess, relates to the difference between the object that's nominally

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:53.480
sublime and the experience, the chemicals in our brain.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:59.560
I'm told that the liveness in the newtons have a sublime experience thinking about numbers.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.520
That would not be my experience, but I accept that they do.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:12.760
The question I have is, is there a relationship between the peak experience that may not have

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:21.800
any objective cause, particularly the zen and the art of archery type experience that

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.720
we experience not necessarily for archery?

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.760
It may come from Le Maud Joust.

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:30.200
It may come from hitting a perfect forehand.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.600
It may come from various other types of events.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:38.120
Is that similar in some sense?

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.560
It feels to me as if it's similar, but maybe a minor league form of the sublime, not in

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:47.800
the level of appreciating Bach or feeling transported, but I'd be interested in your

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.800
thoughts.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:58.080
I think it's close, but I think that it absolutely borders on it, but that the difference for

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.760
me would be, well, it depends on how you experience.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:08.480
If you experience it as the ultimate moment of mastery, like you really got it, then to

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.480
me it's not sublime, but it's close because you've transcended your usual capabilities

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:21.080
and done something like being in the zone.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:27.640
If you had this moment where you had no idea what you did, and then you looked and the

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:32.240
arrow was quivering right in the heart of the bull's eye, that's more like the sublime.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.320
When you weren't there, you didn't get to be there, and yet it happened.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.040
Again, you get a sense that, wow, there's something going on that I don't have a handle

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:47.120
on, control over that's bigger than me, and yet it just did this thing.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:53.920
That to me would be closer to the sublime, if not the sublime itself.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:01.520
The marvelous discussion, and it's all present for me because I haven't been thinking about

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.240
the sublime.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:11.400
My experience with what's happened here is all within the context of the now.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:20.160
It was going to say it wasn't a sublime experience, and I don't mean that as a subtle comment

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.640
on the discussion, which I think was terrific.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:29.560
Instead, it became a graphic experience for me after a progression because when I came

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.520
in, I began to hear a discussion of binaries.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.040
You had fear, and then you have this experience.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.800
You have something else.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.000
You have go to the mountains.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.640
You hear music.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:48.480
I was hearing a binary, and largely a binary of flow, an experience and a consequence.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:57.480
And it became graphic, and eventually, out of the past because it was spots, it became

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.680
sublime.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:08.720
I was hearing a discussion of sublime, and philosophers may have disagreed, which suggests

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:15.160
to me, therefore, they were landing on different landscapes or having different experiences.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.120
And within this context, there is no set definition, at least, that I heard of the sublime.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.640
So we have a plurality of sublimbs.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.200
Mostly as I say, the binary was something leading to something.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.960
But there was not a word used that I'd like to see if you have any comments on it.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:45.760
It suggested, constantly, discontinuity, that in this plurality of experiences, I would

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:53.840
say with music, it's a flow, not a discontinuity from what's happening to the sense of the

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.080
sublime.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:05.920
But in the disruption of life, severe loss, suddenly, all expectations, and impasse.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.400
There's a discontinuity.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:14.440
On other levels, there are discontinuities, expectations, totally.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.000
No, wow.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.800
And you could have that.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:25.680
So I'm seeing this graph of physical.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.400
You mentioned various physical things happening, and then the sublime.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.760
Sensual, many senses, visual, and sensual, leading to this.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.280
Emotional, strong emotional experiences.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.520
So I just wanted to share that, and then get a sense of, particularly, the sense of how

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:53.400
discontinuity, as well as the flow, are related to this experience, and then the product,

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.160
which we call the sublime, but should be sublime.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.160
Thank you.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:02.200
I feel very strongly that discontinuity is at the heart of the sublime.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.240
And that's why I talked about the rift in the fabric of communication, or rhetoric,

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:16.400
or discourse, something that unexpectedly bursts through.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.200
And I think in the 20th century, one of the more interesting instances of thinking of

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:28.960
it this way is in the work of the Frankfurt School philosopher Walter Benjamin, who speaks

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:39.560
of distraction or cerstroyonk as a necessary component of the experience of genuinely modern

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.320
art.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.160
And the way I always try to explain it is that it's basically it's saw on the road to

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160
Damascus.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.120
He's writing his horse along.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.520
He's paying no attention.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.720
And all of a sudden he falls off his horse.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:00.120
And he picks himself up, dust himself off, and he realizes that now he's Paul, somebody

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:08.520
with whom I can identify, and that he has had a transformational experience.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.800
He could not have had this experience except as a form of disruption or distraction.

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.440
He couldn't have had the experience if he just kept galloping Damascus.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:29.080
There had to be this moment of complete disruptive surprise which opened up for him the possibility

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.840
of a transformative experience.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.640
And I think that's the way Benjamin thinks of distraction and, for example, the work

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640
of art essay.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.480
I want to say about discontinuity in terms of music.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:48.360
Well in music, I'm just thinking as you were speaking that you think of the sublime continuity

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:55.120
of the music of Mozart, and he wrote from one moment to the next that you can see just

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.400
a complete flow.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.120
And then you think of the disruptions that Beethoven went through in order to achieve

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.280
the fifth symphony, and how he almost didn't get to the point that we know now is the sublime

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280
work.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.920
Because his work was constantly, he was disrupted by his own thoughts.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:19.880
He was such a lack of continuity in his thought, and yet he chiseled away and managed from

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:24.000
all of this to produce these cohesive, wonderful pieces.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.480
That's probably nothing to do with your question really, but just as simple musicians.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:35.480
Yeah, I'm wondering how much does one state of mind determine whether you have a sublime

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:37.920
experience as opposed to the actual event?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:41.960
Can anything cause someone to have a sublime experience?

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.960
If they're in the right frame of mind, particularly if they're on the right drugs.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:56.000
I actually think sort of depending on your view of the sublime, I think if you go with

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.520
a more physiological view of the sublime, like in Burke, where it's in some ways a kind

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:13.200
of relief from a terror or a kind of relaxation of mental and bodily exertion, then it seems

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:19.400
like it would be kind of a fairly easy experience for anyone to have.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:26.080
But I think those who take a more transcendental approach to the sublime see that there's much

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:32.520
more of a cognitive element to a sublime experience that involves a kind of train of thought

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.600
about one's place in the universe and a human's in nature.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:43.760
And in that case, I think you might need a little more education of a certain sort or

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:50.240
you might have to have a certain ideas in order to have that sort of sublime experience.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:56.240
Wouldn't that imply that the same event would cause the same people to be sublime?

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:57.240
Why?

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.280
It seems like people have very different experiences with the same event.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.680
So there's not absolutely about it.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.920
It just depends on the person.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:11.920
Yeah, although I think even though different people might have different experiences, you

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.520
might think that well, certain experiences are more appropriate for the environment than

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.440
others or certain experiences may be more serious.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.000
So I think in some ways it doesn't mean just because people might have different experiences

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.480
doesn't mean that there's no normativity available to us about these experiences.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.600
I think he goes back to the first intervention that I mean there is cultural conditioning

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.360
in the experience of the sublime.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.520
And probably there isn't anyone who doesn't fall under one form or another of that cultural

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:56.920
conditioning and therefore responds to a certain set of external events as the sublime.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:04.920
I think that's possible, very, very probable and that that means all kinds of music, all

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.600
kinds of art, all kinds of experience in the natural world.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600
Thank you.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600
Hi.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.160
Thank you so much for this awesome roundtable.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.160
I have a question that's similar but looking at it from a different perspective from the

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:29.040
individual feeling connected to the universe and whether or not the sublime or that moment

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:36.280
of feeling beauty or feeling sublime be a way to connect to society, to feel like a member

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.280
of a community.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:42.280
For example, I know that feeling standing on top of a mountain and you know that feeling

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:48.640
and you know that feeling and that I could know that feeling when you mention it implies

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.840
that there's some kind of shared or communal experience.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:58.600
And if you could talk about how I'm also coming through this from the perspective of Emerson

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.440
and his idea of like the common heart and human sentiment and if you could talk about

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:15.200
how that could maybe be the foundation for society or community.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.160
You went on the mountain.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:25.320
So that's a really thoughtful question and I appreciate it.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:29.920
And I'm understanding it various ways and one is at first I thought you were asking is

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.680
there a kind of a social sublime and then I started to get worried about there's the

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:44.320
fascist sublime where you're part of the crowd and that to me is not the sublime maybe just

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.320
because I find it distasteful.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:52.680
I'm not sure I have a good intellectual reason to rule that out but then I understood you

01:31:52.680 --> 01:32:01.440
saying do you tap into something that then connects to everyone else?

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.040
We were just talking about the sublime disruption.

01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:08.240
Can the sublime also lead to connection?

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:17.160
I guess there it would be insofar as the sublime shakes you out of your habitual sense of self,

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:24.440
makes you out of your sense of you as a stable individual with this name and this history.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.520
Then does it enable new kinds of connections?

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.320
And yeah I would say yes.

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:37.320
Hi, thank you for your discussion.

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:43.800
I have a question about the permanence of sublime and a couple of examples about this

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:49.600
is I always take pictures of everything so I'm very observant of my surroundings and

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:54.520
a pigeon on a rail on the way to work one morning will cause me to take pause and it's

01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.080
almost sublime something so simple.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:01.120
And the next morning I'll see the same thing and it's not there but the memory of the first

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.760
one remains.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:09.320
So memory and sublime I think is something that I wonder about but also going back to

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:15.160
the mountains for example let's say you make that trip with someone you love and you lose

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:22.120
that loved one and suddenly that experience is shifted into a very different painful type

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.120
of sublime.

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:28.200
I was just wondering if you could comment on that.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:35.480
Actually the mountains is a really interesting example and there's a book called Mountain

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:43.920
Gloom and Mountain Glory, thank you, Marjorie Hope Nicholson and if I recall correctly her

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:51.560
thesis is that actually it wasn't until about mid-17th century that is that right that people

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:59.680
started actually thinking of mountains as sublime and not blights on the earth's surface and

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:07.960
that's largely because of theological views that held that the earth was originally made

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:14.560
by God to be perfectly smooth and that it was because of the fall and sin that then the

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:22.200
world became you know a pocked with mountains and so in some ways it seemed that at a certain

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:31.520
point it had to be people's ideas about the earth and theology that enabled mountains to

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:37.160
become sublime and I think to be experienced as sublime I think one of the issues that

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:44.640
you raised about you know sort of what's the subjective component to the sublime experience

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:53.040
how much has it to do really with the ideas we have of the world and the metaphysical ideas

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:59.360
or even personal subjective associations you know I climbed that mountain with the love

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:08.040
of my life or something like that so I think I mean that's gets at some of the subjective

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:15.120
aspect of this experience and which would make it I think very difficult to give any convincing

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.680
account of sublime experience that is perfectly objective you know that well these kinds of

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:29.160
things are sublime and these are not it seems to have a lot to do with personal and also

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:40.200
cultural and intellectual associations what interests me about this lecture is it starts

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:45.760
out with a particular point and then radiates all over and the complexity of the subject

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:51.960
becomes vaster and vaster now I'm a pain story and so I'm going to speak a little bit

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.880
on a biased point of view from my particular stance but this kind of discussion has happened

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:05.000
more in the last 10 15 years and prior to that there wasn't as much interest in the sublime

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:12.040
and when you go back in history and you see religion took a very strong point and then

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.240
we move into the 19th century with nature and then art took on the role of the sublime

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:23.880
it became the mediator of the transcendental and then the art world changed and it went

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:29.920
into a gear of high and low and there was a questioning about should we be involved in

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.760
the cloud should we be thinking more about what's happening on the sidewalk around us

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:41.800
to look at all the all the de-trius of the world and the the emphasis on this peak experience

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.400
on this this experience of transition or the friction within the pearl that brings about

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:54.280
this this thunder was not essential and I'm finding now in these years which is interesting

01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:00.920
with the pendulum is swinging and there's more discussion about this nature of of things

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:08.440
of this sort and so again it is such a brought up so I didn't because there were so many

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.720
subjects that came under but perhaps the most important thing discussed was the concept

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:22.680
of discontinuity which does bring out the the awe and the sense somehow that we are the

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:29.640
human condition is a very fragile and and limited condition and I think it's that awareness

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.880
how fragile we are as as humans and as the earth is.

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:42.760
The 20th century saw a widespread distrust of aesthetics in general one might want to say

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:52.600
not just of the sublime the beautiful for its part came under a comparable cloud the literary

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.680
critic A.A. Richards early in the 20th century spoke of the phantom aesthetic state and what

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:08.760
he meant was the state of disinterestedness in Kant in which we have an aesthetic experience

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:16.520
as opposed to a pettitive experience or a cognitive slash moral experience the only one of those

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:24.200
experiences which being which is disinterested being the aesthetic experience the 20th century

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:32.760
skeptical of most things has been skeptical of disinterestedness in general and has insisted

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:40.680
through the great triumvirate that recur called the hermatives of suspicion marks Nietzsche Freud

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:49.640
has insisted that experience is interested and that there is no bracketing of a certain kind of

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:57.000
experience as though it were disinterested so therefore in in in this sense it was the aesthetic

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.680
in general that went into a kind of eclipse people were afraid to talk about their appreciation

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:13.000
of art or of their environment on aesthetic grounds now this it seems to me for a variety of reasons

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.560
that I'm not sure I fully understand because perhaps I'm a little skeptical myself despite being

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:29.800
very interested in aesthetics this it seems to me has somewhat subsided this as it were hostility

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.640
toward the aesthetic and we're hearing in addition to hearing more about the sublime again we're also

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:44.040
hearing more about the beautiful there are people main scary just to name one who are dedicated to

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:51.240
what I think in the early 20th century would have been called cult of beauty and insisting on the

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:58.360
return of this as a category which is intrinsically an ethical one and I think the return of the sublime

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:06.600
also has an interest and implicitly ethical dimension of the kind that we've been obliquely

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:12.200
talking about during this whole discussion so that that's how I would maybe explain if that's the

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.440
right word how it's returning you know

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:20.040
there's been a great emphasis on deconstruction of everything a whole concept so it's curious now

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:26.920
that the parts are being looked at that is unbroken but I think it seems to me also there were a

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:32.760
couple of moments in the middle of the 20th century though where the sublime kind of in painting came

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.560
back yeah right

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:52.440
I thought that was sublime but I was afraid to say something okay okay hi this discussion seems to be

01:40:52.440 --> 01:41:01.480
dancing around the fringe and not tackling the issue that would seem to be essential to most

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:09.320
people who think about this subject namely what is the meaning of these experiences yes on one

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:15.960
level a mountainous mountain is just a rock and then somebody comes along and has a different

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:23.640
experience of it is that experience merely an illusion based on the chemicals that are dancing

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:31.320
around inside our body or is it just that those chemicals are associated with an experience

01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:38.280
that has some real meaning that tells us something that is beyond the immediate reality of our

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:44.360
perspective and is carrying and giving us some clue to another dimension some would call it mystery

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:51.880
of course some people with that because then that takes you into the realm of spirituality and

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:59.000
some people then get suspicious are you talking about God perhaps and many feel much more comfortable

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:09.720
in reducing it to the materialistic level and talking about these chemicals dancing inside so I

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:17.960
wish you would address that these experiences meaningful in giving us a clue to something that is beyond our

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:25.320
understanding beyond our immediate perception but that represent that represents something that is

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:33.560
a reality but something that may be beyond our grasp of our immediate reality I would like someone

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:38.840
else to answer that question because I feel like I've already come closest to that of anyone but I

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.000
did want to say this is like the third or fourth time that the chemicals in the brain have come up

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:48.760
and I just wanted to make a point about the chemicals every thought we have is because of

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:56.840
chemical reactions every perception every movement we make none of that happens without chemical

01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:02.200
reactions in the brain so to say something's just chemical everything everything in our

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:08.040
mental lives is chemicals in the brain so it doesn't reduce it or you know that that's cut for me that's

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:14.120
that's sort of a category mistake so so I just want to get the chemicals that's not entirely true

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:18.760
what you're saying because there are many people who do believe that it's just the chemicals I mean

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:27.000
one big school of neuroscience for example would say that that brain is just it's another name for

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:34.840
consciousness and that consciousness is brain okay and that's another way of saying that it's all

01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:40.040
physical it's all chemicals of course I mean we couldn't be here we couldn't be having this

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:45.720
discussion unless we were encased in a body with all of the physiology associated with that but is

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:53.160
there something beyond that these experiences merely illusions is your experience of music merely an

01:43:53.160 --> 01:44:00.760
illusion because it evokes those chemicals in your body and do the chemicals produce the

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:06.440
experience does the experience produce the chemicals or are the chemicals just associated with an

01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.320
experience that has some meaning yet beyond the immediate reality I mean I can't answer that music

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:21.320
that question in music I I believe that my reaction to music when I first heard it and I hear it now

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:28.440
is something beyond something I don't understand can't comprehend but I'm always trying to challenge

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:38.920
that I find the fascinating and challenging that with with questions all the time and why I don't

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:45.080
believe that that it's God I don't I'm not sure what it is but I do believe that that sense sense

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:53.800
of sense central loneliness that we discussed earlier brings me together with something that I

01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:05.800
think that that in great music that it does serve a purpose I believe the great music can simply

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.360
bring us together whether we want to call it God whether we want to call it spirituality whatever

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:16.920
we want to call it I really believe not only great music great art that is its its role its

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:23.560
purpose its design its glory well there's a legend about Verdi that as a child

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:34.520
the first time he heard a symphony or some music that overwhelmed but he fainted and then his parents

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:41.480
decided that maybe we should get him that piano he's been asking for I think your question is a good

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:48.280
one but I don't think we have an answer for it well there may not be an answer but I think it's a very

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.320
important thing but I think it's your answer but if I understand you correctly you are trying to

01:45:53.320 --> 01:46:00.440
say at which point does the chemistry stop and something else is added to it I don't know if anybody

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:08.120
can tell you at which point chemistry stops and something is added to it unless you bring in belief

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:17.800
could I actually well I do think there's a there's a non-theological answer that I'm kind of sympathetic

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:24.520
with that comes out of the shop and how are kind of tradition which sees the the the meaning of

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:32.520
sublime experience as a kind of revelation of freedom so that which is a pretty mysterious thing

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:38.840
you know that we are beings who are natural beings but we also seem to have free will and

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.120
operate on a what some philosophers call a space of reasons that is not

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:53.400
just reducible to kind of a causal story and for for a common shelf and how are the the experience

01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:02.760
of the sublime was the way we could have a felt recognition of our freedom when I look thank you

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:08.360
come to realize a little more question okay go ahead well when I come to realize that everything

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:18.520
in the external world however large or distant is nonetheless finite the discovery of the very

01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:28.200
concept of infinitude that I find in myself is the signal in this in the sublime experience in this

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:37.800
tradition of freedom because freedom is nothing other than the escape from limits and if the

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:46.040
experience of the external discloses in me the escape from those very limits the power to escape

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:52.120
from those very limits that in that tradition that's another way to put it is the meaning of the sublime

01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:01.720
okay two more questions and then we'll stop first like I saw on this day I'm going to

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.480
first oxhole couldn't make it because this question was originally meant for him but

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:15.800
it's about a distinction so I study mathematics and it's not clear to me that I've ever experienced

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:22.200
the sublime in what I do but it's all it's been clear to me that I've certainly experienced wonder

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:29.080
and our discussion of wonder at least my impression of it is it's something that's it's got wonder

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:35.720
arouses a kind of productive curiosity about the world and it sort of fosters curiosity in science

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:42.760
and my question I guess is there a distinction between wonder and the sublime

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:55.080
and is if there is is the sensation of the sublime is that well certainly it seems to be only

01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:02.360
encountered in the arts and literature and music and what would that look like in a sort of a

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.040
more scientific mode

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:17.480
what you know for me wonder is obviously they're close because the experience of awe can be applied

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:23.960
to wonder or the sublime right so that so there's our our stretching of language again but if I

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:29.800
were going to try to distinguish wonder from the sublime I would say wonder makes us it it

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.920
there is a certain amount of awe involved with it but it makes us want to it makes us want to

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.520
know more and more about something right this is wonderful I want more intimacy with it I want

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:49.000
you know to really plunge into it now that wonder peaks us and and gets us engaged the sublime

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:55.720
knocks us off our feet right and and makes us feel that any amount of knowledge would be inadequate

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.080
to what we've just experienced

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:08.840
to what extent do you think context is important especially in light of your comment that or

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:15.720
I believe it was your comment that art you know the analysis in the 20th century shifted away from

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:22.200
a formal you know aesthetics or understanding because many people who appreciate modern art

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:29.880
appreciate it with an understanding of the need for context such that the Matisse exhibition

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:35.480
you don't necessarily have to know his place in history or his place in or what it represents

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:41.160
but the actual apprehension of it many people speak about it being joyful and and creating

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:47.720
possibly a sublimity or a sense of of great happiness with music on the other hand to what

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:56.680
extent can do you need a formal knowledge of it for example I I can't really access Schoenberg

01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:03.880
I don't have enough knowledge to to appreciate him and and would you call it aesthetic level

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:08.360
it's not satisfying to me and I know it's from a lack of knowledge whereas

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:15.160
Socrates is it's accessible to me for whatever reason it's not in that tone I don't think it's

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:22.840
the same extent of of what would you call it complexity if you will if you could just address

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.760
that well that's a different language the difference between Schoenberg and Stravinsky some people

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:33.720
will still find the Stravinsky very difficult and in principle I don't I think great art you can't

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:39.960
like everything and that what is great will hit you without you needing to know anything about

01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:46.680
the ingredients of the meal exactly the first part of what you were talking about interests me if you

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:53.960
you talked at very early in the day about Marla's Ninth Symphony the shared experience the context

01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:01.400
of the shared experience is a very interesting one to me if you go back home and look on YouTube

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:07.640
you will find a performance of the Ninth Marla's Symphony by the Lucerne Festival Orchestra with

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:16.440
Claudio Abado conducting and the performance is so extraordinary I would suggest leads the whole

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:26.280
hall of 2000 people to about 15 minutes of total silence at the end where that shared experience

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:33.400
and context has led to a sublime experience for all those people that you can also get

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:42.440
from just watching and participating and for me that's one of the great sort of truths of what

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:53.080
can do and the in context. I can just a quick point about something you said and and this lady will

01:52:53.080 --> 01:53:00.200
correct us because she probably has her own views of it I would say that there is actually a fairly

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:07.240
important difference between aesthetic appreciation and formal analysis I would not say that formal

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:14.920
analysis went into Eclipse in thinking about the art of the 20th century whereas what did tend to

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:23.720
go into Eclipse or underground as one might say was the willingness to say oh that's beautiful or

01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:29.320
that's sublime or it's ugly or it's grotesque or any of the other aesthetic categories that one

01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:35.400
might point to formal analysis on the other side on the other hand is something that I think has

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:41.320
flourished in the in the 20th century so maybe a distinction is needed there but that's a little

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:45.480
that's pathetic because we all understood what you were saying and it was very interesting.

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:50.440
It was the last question why let you ask your question but make it briefly.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:58.600
I'm a little sorry that you conflated sublime with aesthetics and beauty because I think they're

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:06.440
very very different issues and you can often appreciate aesthetics and beauty in in just about

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:13.400
any field that you want to talk about and not have sublime experiences with any of them and I think

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:18.920
this sublimity is something that you could it's almost like a pointillistic response

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:28.040
and you can you mentioned Glenn Gould and you can conjure up probably from anyone here who

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:34.760
knows him how to get a sublime experience out of looking into his eyes on film

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:45.880
little variations or one one chord in Tristan or one chord in the second string quartet of Schoenberg

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:52.600
or a sound of UC Bierling you know what what these things do and you could pick anything you could

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:59.080
talk about birds or flowers or mountains and have these kind of experiences without

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:08.600
they have anything to do with aesthetics you can you can have associative experiences even from

01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:21.000
ideas if you want to talk about someone's idea let's say of Schoenberg or Walter Benjamin and

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:28.120
then you can conjure up a whole class of ideas associated with what they're talking about and

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:38.840
have a sublime experience it's an abstraction it's it's a way of going into the universe of having an

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:46.760
infinite opening you know looking at one color out of a Roscoe painting or one one

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:56.840
gestural element in an abstract painting or Palestrina I mean or early blues or early jazz or anything

01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:05.960
you know it this sounds you know naying it it has there's something obviously physiological there's a

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:13.880
strong chemical component a physiological component but there's an associative component that as you

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:19.560
say can go from culture to culture to culture you could share it with almost anyone who knows

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:24.840
nothing about what we're talking about and they will know the meaning of sublime or the meaning of

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:31.080
numinous you know which is a word that wasn't used there are so many other things that the flowing

01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:36.200
into eternity it's not a question but I just felt listening to so many of these things that

01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:43.800
that there is a broad category and someone said which I thought was fascinating that no that

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:51.240
can you share the sublime if someone says something to someone else it's like like the old joke well

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:56.440
it's not the joke that's funny it's the way you tell it you know it's the number the way you say

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:03.480
the number of that joke and it's the same thing if you talk about the the pointillism of an event

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:11.640
that conjures a sublime experience so that opens it can you then share that with other people thank

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:18.840
you thank you and we have one more we have one more question last question and briefly of course

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:24.920
and this and this is a question and by its nature it will be brief but I'd appreciate to ask it

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:30.200
around the panel because it's striking for me that's something that's central to the discourse of

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:38.280
18th century Jewish mystics about the sublime as an opening into unumistica into the experience of

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:47.480
of of oneness and the move across the divide between human self and and divinity is is is the

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:53.080
emotional tone that goes along with that and that and that actually can be seen as the engine's way

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:59.000
into that is humility and while you've touched on we've touched on sort of the other side which is

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:08.440
almost a secularization of the of the of the of the of the translation into divinity in terms of freedom

01:58:08.440 --> 01:58:14.680
but while on this side of the divide the feeling that of sublimity that it goes along with with

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:19.320
the feeling of the of the encounter with the experience of the sublime of humility has been

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:25.800
missing entirely from this discourse and I'm I'm curious about that so I appreciate going around

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:32.040
the panel and addressing that in some way oh hey really confines the expression of the sublime

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:40.280
in history to he to the iconoclasm of Hebrew scriptures and the reason he does that is he feels that

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:47.000
the sense of the infinite is directly connected to a mistrust of images in other words that images

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:58.040
always take bring with them an investment in finitude and the humility of our of our deference to the

01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:05.880
infinite is something that can only enter into the picture sorry wrong expression can only enter

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:20.440
into consideration for Hegel in the form of iconoclasm thank you okay we will stop
