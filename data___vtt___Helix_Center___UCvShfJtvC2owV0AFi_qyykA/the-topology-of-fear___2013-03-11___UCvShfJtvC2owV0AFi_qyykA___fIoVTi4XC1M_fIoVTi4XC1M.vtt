00:00.000 --> 00:08.720
I'm Edward Narcissian, Director of the

00:08.720 --> 00:11.400
Helix Center and I welcome you to

00:11.400 --> 00:13.600
today's program on the topology of

00:13.600 --> 00:17.120
fear. I should tell you that next

00:17.120 --> 00:22.000
Saturday the program is on Elizabeth

00:22.000 --> 00:24.960
Bishop and the participants are Bonnie

00:24.960 --> 00:31.920
Costello, Lloyd Schwartz, Alice Quinn, and

00:31.920 --> 00:37.440
Jean Valentine. Programs for April will

00:37.440 --> 00:40.880
be on our website. On the website we

00:40.880 --> 00:44.080
also now have a section for conversation

00:44.080 --> 00:46.080
so if there are any thoughts and

00:46.080 --> 00:48.840
questions that you have after today's

00:48.840 --> 00:51.200
meeting or opinions that you have you

00:51.200 --> 00:53.960
can go on that side on that

00:53.960 --> 00:57.200
under conversation and write whatever

00:57.200 --> 01:01.040
you are thinking. Today's round table

01:01.040 --> 01:04.360
was proposed by Professor Gratiella

04:39.000 --> 04:44.640
right? And at the Cardozo, Cardozo Law

04:44.640 --> 04:48.720
Review. So, Gratilla is going to get

04:48.720 --> 04:53.920
things going. The topology of fear, which

04:53.920 --> 04:58.240
is the title of this meeting today, this

04:58.240 --> 05:03.480
roundtable, puts together two different

05:03.480 --> 05:07.200
concepts. One from mathematics, pure

05:07.200 --> 05:10.120
mathematics and that's topology and the

05:10.120 --> 05:14.560
other one is fear and generally emotion.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.280
And we have here specialists from both.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.480
So, I wanted to introduce very briefly

05:22.480 --> 05:28.320
the topic before we have the usual format

05:28.320 --> 05:34.960
that these roundtables use. We're all

05:34.960 --> 05:37.120
very curious about emotions and the

05:37.120 --> 05:41.200
emotion of fear is very well understood

05:41.200 --> 05:44.240
by anybody who looks at what happens on

05:44.240 --> 05:46.160
an everyday basis and the press, what the

05:46.160 --> 05:53.400
press chooses etc. And the article that

05:53.400 --> 05:58.760
the topology of fear, which is here, is an

05:58.760 --> 06:01.160
article I published a few years ago.

06:01.160 --> 06:09.440
Essentially, looks for a mathematical

06:09.440 --> 06:14.000
explanation of how fear fits and helps

06:14.000 --> 06:18.040
define our decisions in a way that is

06:18.040 --> 06:22.320
not the same as we are used to. And we are

06:22.320 --> 06:25.840
talking, we are talking, we have here very

06:25.840 --> 06:28.560
impressive specialists. In fact, the best

06:28.560 --> 06:30.480
thing about this roundtable are the

06:30.480 --> 06:34.920
people here. And so, I'm not going to be

06:34.920 --> 06:36.720
talking too much about that because that's

06:36.720 --> 06:38.840
their field, although I have done some

06:38.840 --> 06:40.480
experimental work on this. But the

06:40.480 --> 06:43.400
critical thing about topology is that it

06:43.400 --> 06:46.600
helps you explain a form of rationality

06:46.600 --> 06:50.120
that puts fear in a rational context in a

06:50.120 --> 06:52.720
way that is different than what we are

06:52.720 --> 06:56.000
used to in decisions, analysis, and in

06:56.000 --> 06:59.240
psychology, and in economics, etc. etc.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.960
in the social sciences. So how does that

07:01.960 --> 07:05.080
work? The branch of mathematics, topology,

07:05.080 --> 07:07.680
we were discussing just before with

07:07.680 --> 07:09.480
Linda, who is a mathematician, as you can

07:09.480 --> 07:12.520
tell you about that, is really about what

07:12.520 --> 07:15.640
does it mean to be nearby? What does it

07:15.640 --> 07:20.200
mean to be similar nearby? And they are

07:20.200 --> 07:22.280
very different versions about what that

07:22.280 --> 07:26.080
means. For example, you can say that the

07:26.080 --> 07:28.480
weather in New York is similar to the

07:28.480 --> 07:34.160
weather in Siberia. If, on average, we

07:34.160 --> 07:36.720
have the same temperature. But if in

07:36.720 --> 07:40.280
Siberia, or in a desert, the temperature

07:40.280 --> 07:43.280
is extremely cold over parts of the year,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.560
and then very hot over others, you would

07:45.560 --> 07:49.000
say, no, it's not quite the same. So what

07:49.000 --> 07:51.160
do you mean the weather is similar in New

07:51.160 --> 07:53.320
York and in Siberia? What exactly do you

07:53.320 --> 07:56.320
mean by that? There are two versions at

07:56.320 --> 07:58.800
least two, but they are two actually. One

07:58.800 --> 08:00.960
is, let's look at things on the average.

08:00.960 --> 08:04.440
Let's look at the average of the weather

08:04.440 --> 08:07.640
over this century, over this millennium,

08:07.640 --> 08:10.360
that's one way, over the earth, that's

08:10.360 --> 08:12.600
another way. The other way is look at

08:12.600 --> 08:15.040
the extremals. What's the worst that can

08:15.040 --> 08:17.720
happen? What's the highest and the lowest?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.240
And we won't say that things are close

08:20.240 --> 08:25.240
by unless the extremals are nearby. And if

08:25.240 --> 08:28.400
we do that, we're looking at what nearby

08:28.400 --> 08:30.880
means in a completely different way. We

08:30.880 --> 08:32.520
define the completely different

08:32.520 --> 08:34.920
apology, and all of a sudden what appear

08:34.920 --> 08:37.600
to be rational behavior because of a

08:37.600 --> 08:39.880
emotional reasons appears to be

08:39.880 --> 08:43.480
mathematically very, very rational. So

08:43.480 --> 08:46.080
just wanted to be more precise in the

08:46.080 --> 08:50.200
paper, the topology of fear, Paul said

08:50.200 --> 08:52.520
brief outline and he has to be very

08:52.520 --> 08:57.800
brief. I looked at the disjoint that

08:57.800 --> 09:00.680
appears when you try to explain in

09:00.680 --> 09:02.800
experiments how people behave under

09:02.800 --> 09:04.840
conditions of fear and they appear to

09:04.840 --> 09:07.960
behave irrationally. An experiment upon

09:07.960 --> 09:10.280
experiment and upon experiment shows

09:10.280 --> 09:16.080
that. And where does it come from? So in

09:16.080 --> 09:18.960
the paper I show that if you look at the

09:18.960 --> 09:21.360
axioms which are the basic beliefs on

09:21.360 --> 09:23.120
which the theory of decision is based,

09:23.120 --> 09:27.400
and you assume that instead of making

09:27.400 --> 09:31.040
decisions on the average and valuing the

09:31.040 --> 09:32.960
average and caring about the average, you

09:32.960 --> 09:36.440
look at the extreme ones. Mathematically

09:36.440 --> 09:39.600
that difference is the topology of fear,

09:39.600 --> 09:43.960
and in terms of decisions it leads you to

09:43.960 --> 09:45.960
completely different decisions and

09:45.960 --> 09:49.840
rationality for example. You would say

09:49.840 --> 09:55.120
that if you wanted to invest in a fund

09:55.120 --> 09:59.640
you may look at the average returns that

09:59.640 --> 10:04.040
this fund brings to the investors. But

10:04.040 --> 10:06.840
you may say that's okay that's all very

10:06.840 --> 10:08.720
good but I'm afraid it will be a market

10:08.720 --> 10:13.400
crash. Fear and therefore I'm going to

10:13.400 --> 10:17.200
invest in the fund that assures me that

10:17.200 --> 10:19.960
even if there is a market crash I will

10:19.960 --> 10:22.400
have my money back or most of my money

10:22.400 --> 10:26.360
back. Those are two criteria, completely

10:26.360 --> 10:29.240
different criteria and depend on the

10:29.240 --> 10:31.160
topology and I'm saying when you have

10:31.160 --> 10:33.240
fear, when there is fear present, when

10:33.240 --> 10:35.960
there is catastrophes, real events with

10:35.960 --> 10:39.160
enormous consequences, you tend to use

10:39.160 --> 10:41.880
the topology of fear to determine what's

10:41.880 --> 10:44.000
close to each other and that leads you to

10:44.000 --> 10:46.840
make decisions which are considered to

10:46.840 --> 10:49.840
be irrational by the standard decision

10:49.840 --> 10:54.440
theory. Namely, no I'm not going to invest

10:54.440 --> 10:58.160
in the investment fund that gives me the

10:58.160 --> 11:02.040
higher expected returns. Why? What's wrong

11:02.040 --> 11:04.400
with you? Are you going to be rational? No,

11:04.400 --> 11:09.160
I'm not. I'm afraid. I will give a lot of

11:09.160 --> 11:11.800
weight to what happens in that fund in the

11:11.800 --> 11:14.720
case of a market crash and I will not

11:14.720 --> 11:18.480
optimize according to the what is the

11:18.480 --> 11:20.720
expected return alone. I will not do that.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.040
That's not irrational according to the

11:23.040 --> 11:25.480
standard theory it turns to be rational

11:25.480 --> 11:28.360
it cannot be explained. So by introducing

11:28.360 --> 11:31.560
the topology of fear you can explain a

11:31.560 --> 11:33.440
different form of rationality and then it

11:33.440 --> 11:37.400
leads to the following criteria that is

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
okay I'm going to invest in the fund that

11:39.400 --> 11:41.560
gives me the highest expected return

11:41.560 --> 11:44.600
provided that the worst that can happen

11:44.600 --> 11:47.320
in the case of a catastrophe I'm willing

11:47.320 --> 11:50.120
to accept it. It's like maybe I will lose

11:50.120 --> 11:53.120
5% of my portfolio but no more. Now this

11:53.120 --> 11:55.360
sounds like a reasonable thing to do, particularly

11:55.360 --> 11:57.360
these days with a gun being what it is.

11:57.360 --> 12:02.640
But it's contradictory to what we think

12:02.640 --> 12:05.960
is a rational decision making and it

12:05.960 --> 12:08.320
leads people in experiments to say

12:08.320 --> 12:12.080
humans are irrational. You just don't make

12:12.080 --> 12:14.280
decisions by what you expect that will

12:14.280 --> 12:17.360
happen. The expectation part is really

12:17.360 --> 12:20.680
averaging things. The consideration of the

12:20.680 --> 12:24.000
catastrophe and the extremal is looking

12:24.000 --> 12:25.800
at the worst that can happen and it is

12:25.800 --> 12:28.800
using the topology of fear. This turns out

12:28.800 --> 12:33.400
to be mathematically connected with the

12:33.400 --> 12:35.120
theory of the incompleteness of

12:35.120 --> 12:38.200
mathematics and with the resolution that

12:38.200 --> 12:41.480
Bertrand Russell gave to some of the biggest

12:41.480 --> 12:44.280
contradictions that appear system that has

12:44.280 --> 12:47.640
the richness of mathematics. But we are

12:47.640 --> 12:49.680
going into details I wanted to explain

12:49.680 --> 12:54.360
that going way beyond the issue of the

12:54.360 --> 12:58.800
fund, the dimension, that is nice because

12:58.800 --> 13:01.040
it's an everyday phenomenon that we're

13:01.040 --> 13:03.200
not afraid of. How do we make decisions

13:03.200 --> 13:06.800
about jumping into an accident and trying

13:06.800 --> 13:10.480
to pull a person out? We are governed by

13:10.480 --> 13:16.480
fear. Well under those conditions we need

13:16.480 --> 13:18.440
to expand our notion of what rational

13:18.440 --> 13:22.000
means and what the topology of fear does

13:22.000 --> 13:24.560
it gives you a mathematical tool, a

13:24.560 --> 13:27.720
measurement tool, an experimental tool to

13:27.720 --> 13:30.760
define rationality in a way that admits

13:30.760 --> 13:33.200
certain ambiguities and allows you to

13:33.200 --> 13:35.280
cope both with the extremals that you

13:35.280 --> 13:37.720
behave with when you are involved in a

13:37.720 --> 13:40.840
situation that has a catastrophe or can

13:40.840 --> 13:44.040
cause fear and at the same time the

13:44.040 --> 13:46.720
average behavior that you consider when

13:46.720 --> 13:50.800
you are being you know naturally weighing

13:50.800 --> 13:52.680
the probabilities of what can happen. They

13:52.680 --> 13:55.960
do things emerge. So the result of that

13:55.960 --> 14:02.320
paper is that when you consider fear and

14:02.320 --> 14:04.480
when extremals do matter and you use a

14:04.480 --> 14:06.360
topology of fear which is your value

14:06.360 --> 14:08.960
system, the topology of your value system

14:08.960 --> 14:11.560
is what matters, what's similar to what.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.040
Then you will end up behaving like that.

14:15.040 --> 14:20.160
You will choose the electric network for

14:20.160 --> 14:23.880
our city so that it maximizes a throughput

14:23.880 --> 14:27.720
of electricity but minimizing the worst

14:27.720 --> 14:30.080
that can happen in the case of a blackout.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.760
Does it sound reasonable? Yes. It is

14:33.760 --> 14:36.120
inconsistent with the way we view

14:36.120 --> 14:38.280
rationality until now through averages.

14:38.280 --> 14:41.960
So what I just said is reasonable but

14:41.960 --> 14:43.800
there were notions of rationality until

14:43.800 --> 14:46.760
now have eliminated it as if it was

14:46.760 --> 14:48.760
irrational. I can give more and more

14:48.760 --> 14:52.560
examples. So instead of doing that I

14:52.560 --> 14:55.800
wanted to say that that gives you a use

14:55.800 --> 15:00.160
for mathematics that really opens up a

15:00.160 --> 15:03.240
completely different sphere and we will

15:03.240 --> 15:05.680
hear maybe more about that from Linda but

15:05.680 --> 15:09.400
I was told before by David that the

15:09.400 --> 15:14.280
French are not adverse to using topology

15:14.280 --> 15:17.720
when they try to study the internal

15:17.720 --> 15:21.720
psychological behavior and she's going

15:21.720 --> 15:24.360
to explain that in their own in help

15:24.360 --> 15:27.560
people make decisions. So I think with

15:27.560 --> 15:29.400
your permission I will stop here because

15:29.400 --> 15:31.080
I am more interested in what these people

15:31.080 --> 15:33.080
have to say than what I have to say. I

15:33.080 --> 15:35.240
hope it's an introduction. It's the beginning

15:35.240 --> 15:38.320
and right maybe you can pay

15:38.320 --> 15:42.080
any sense of vision for it. Yeah I have a

15:42.080 --> 15:47.520
comment and so you try to take an

15:47.520 --> 15:50.320
everyday word like rationality and turn

15:50.320 --> 15:52.320
into more of a scientific mathematical

15:52.320 --> 15:59.320
concept. Is that correct? No. I mean no

15:59.320 --> 16:03.880
it is my... No I think it's a very good

16:03.880 --> 16:08.200
point. I have to say that Joe's work is fantastic

16:08.200 --> 16:11.560
so you know it's my pleasure to be

16:11.560 --> 16:15.720
answering your question. No what they do

16:15.720 --> 16:18.000
is something different. I look at the

16:18.000 --> 16:22.720
definition of rationality that we use in

16:22.720 --> 16:25.880
just about every scientific discipline I

16:25.880 --> 16:29.880
know and it has to do generally speaking

16:29.880 --> 16:33.840
with having some actions and the

16:33.840 --> 16:36.600
driving from those actions to logical

16:36.600 --> 16:40.840
statements that we are willing to accept

16:40.840 --> 16:43.280
because we accept the actions. That's the

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
way mathematics is constructed. I just

16:45.520 --> 16:48.720
described to you what mathematics is. I

16:48.720 --> 16:50.880
also described to you what is decision

16:50.880 --> 16:53.880
theory? What is probability theory? We

16:53.880 --> 16:56.680
start with axioms and then anything that

16:56.680 --> 16:58.560
we're willing to accept as rational is

16:58.560 --> 17:01.480
what derives from the actions in a

17:01.480 --> 17:04.720
logical system that we accept. That's the

17:04.720 --> 17:07.400
way science proceeds. I didn't say it should

17:07.400 --> 17:10.440
proceed. I said proceeds. So the

17:10.440 --> 17:12.920
rationality that I speak about is not a

17:12.920 --> 17:17.200
loose word that we use at breakfast. Maybe

17:17.200 --> 17:18.320
it should be but that's not what I'm

17:18.320 --> 17:19.800
talking about. I'm talking about scientific

17:19.800 --> 17:21.400
rationality. I'm talking about the fact

17:21.400 --> 17:24.680
that quantum probability, quantum theory

17:24.680 --> 17:27.160
has axioms that were defined by von Neumann

17:27.160 --> 17:30.080
in 1932. From those axioms

17:30.080 --> 17:33.160
logical speaking you derive the entire

17:33.160 --> 17:37.280
quantum theory and everything can be

17:37.280 --> 17:40.080
drawn back in the logical steps, mathematical

17:40.080 --> 17:42.480
steps to the axioms. That's rationality.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.160
So what have I done here? How am I

17:45.160 --> 17:48.160
redefining rationality? Am I changing the

17:48.160 --> 17:52.440
logic? No. What am I doing? I'm changing

17:52.440 --> 17:55.640
the axioms. Okay but it's a scientific

17:55.640 --> 17:58.600
view of rationality. But you started

17:58.600 --> 18:01.800
asking me if it was a loose way of

18:01.800 --> 18:03.080
understanding the language. I was more

18:03.080 --> 18:04.600
interested in the scientific part. So you

18:04.600 --> 18:08.440
have a scientific view. Yes. But you on

18:08.440 --> 18:11.200
the other side you took fear and used the

18:11.200 --> 18:13.720
everyday version of it. So you didn't

18:13.720 --> 18:15.400
have a scientific approach to fear. You

18:15.400 --> 18:18.840
had an everyday version of fear. Well yes

18:18.840 --> 18:22.600
and no in the sense that after I changed

18:22.600 --> 18:25.680
the axioms and I said golly when you

18:25.680 --> 18:28.200
have catastrophic events, real events at

18:28.200 --> 18:30.600
that terrible you need to use the topology

18:30.600 --> 18:33.000
of fear. Different axiom, different

18:33.000 --> 18:35.400
results, different rationality. And he

18:35.400 --> 18:38.720
says okay but with respect to fear you're

18:38.720 --> 18:40.960
still woosy woosy. You're not giving me

18:40.960 --> 18:42.920
the scientific version. Right. And he's

18:42.920 --> 18:45.440
right. I don't know what fear is. What I

18:45.440 --> 18:48.040
do know is that I have carried experiments

18:48.040 --> 18:50.280
in which people are subject to

18:50.280 --> 18:53.160
propositions that inspire extreme fear

18:53.160 --> 18:55.400
to see whether they behave according to

18:55.400 --> 18:57.240
the axioms and the logic from those

18:57.240 --> 19:00.320
axioms using the topology of fear will

19:00.320 --> 19:04.120
imply. And the answer is yes so far

19:04.120 --> 19:05.840
because you can never prove anything with

19:05.840 --> 19:07.960
experiments. You can only prove that you

19:07.960 --> 19:10.120
don't know that you have made a mistake.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.800
But if you don't define fear you can't

19:12.800 --> 19:16.240
scientifically use it. No what I do is I

19:16.240 --> 19:22.240
define the topology of fear as a topology

19:22.240 --> 19:24.960
that takes into consideration as a value

19:24.960 --> 19:27.440
focuses on extreme acts. The words that can

19:27.440 --> 19:31.360
happen. And that topology then gives

19:31.360 --> 19:34.360
rise through to a different axiom through

19:34.360 --> 19:36.720
logics to different behavioral patterns. I

19:36.720 --> 19:39.040
check them. I tested them experimentally

19:39.040 --> 19:41.840
with a team in France but this is baby

19:41.840 --> 19:45.160
stuff compared to yours. Well you know I

19:45.160 --> 19:47.280
think the I have a problem with fear

19:47.280 --> 19:52.720
myself. So. You're afraid? Of snakes yes

19:52.720 --> 19:54.840
but that's not the problem. The problem

19:54.840 --> 19:56.840
is I'm afraid of what we've been calling

19:56.840 --> 20:00.240
fear for hundreds or maybe thousands of

20:00.240 --> 20:03.840
years. And I've gotten really hung up on

20:03.840 --> 20:05.720
the question of how everyday language

20:05.720 --> 20:08.040
relates to the scientific language

20:08.040 --> 20:10.440
especially in emotion and fear. Because I

20:10.440 --> 20:12.200
think we've made a lot of mistakes. And

20:12.200 --> 20:15.680
in my own work I've made mistakes as

20:15.680 --> 20:20.000
well. So I've studied how rats detect and

20:20.000 --> 20:24.040
respond to threats for 30 years and have

20:24.040 --> 20:25.600
called the brain systems that we've

20:25.600 --> 20:28.320
identified the fear system. And I think

20:28.320 --> 20:30.600
that's a mistake. So I'm publicly

20:30.600 --> 20:34.240
announcing my my errors here. I think you

20:34.240 --> 20:36.840
should still buy his book. By the next

20:36.840 --> 20:39.600
one. Explain this. Which book you can give

20:39.600 --> 20:41.760
us a title? It's called anxious. Anxious.

20:41.760 --> 20:45.440
But it's a it'll be a while yet. Still

20:45.440 --> 20:50.480
working. So anyway so the by studying the

20:50.480 --> 20:51.960
way the brain detects and respond to

20:51.960 --> 20:54.400
danger. We've identified circuits that

20:54.400 --> 20:56.640
are very important and ultimately in

20:56.640 --> 21:00.240
fear. But they're not fear circuits. And

21:00.240 --> 21:02.960
for many years when I've been introduced

21:02.960 --> 21:04.520
to give lectures I've been introduced to

21:04.520 --> 21:07.280
someone who's discovered X, Y, and Z about

21:07.280 --> 21:09.800
how we feel fear. And nothing could be

21:09.800 --> 21:11.880
further than the truth. So I'm trying to

21:11.880 --> 21:15.000
backtrack a bit and look at what we mean

21:15.000 --> 21:18.600
by fear. And I'd like to just describe

21:18.600 --> 21:20.960
you know how you go about the science of

21:20.960 --> 21:22.520
doing something like this. Take a couple

21:22.520 --> 21:25.200
of minutes to do that. So in you know

21:25.200 --> 21:27.520
for studying the psychology and its

21:27.520 --> 21:29.440
relation to the brain psychology of fear

21:29.440 --> 21:31.360
into relation to the brain. We have to

21:31.360 --> 21:34.000
first define identified the everyday

21:34.000 --> 21:35.480
experience that we're interested in.

21:35.480 --> 21:37.320
That's basically what we do in psychology.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.440
Paul is interested in reward. So that's

21:39.440 --> 21:41.760
an everyday concept. And he turns that

21:41.760 --> 21:43.600
into some kind of scientific approach.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.280
So you first define what you're

21:46.280 --> 21:48.080
interested in fear. And you say well fear

21:48.080 --> 21:50.560
is an emotion. And it's different from

21:50.560 --> 21:53.120
other things that we call mental states

21:53.120 --> 21:56.080
like conditions or thoughts. And it's

21:56.080 --> 21:58.080
different from other emotions like

21:58.080 --> 22:02.480
sadness and anger and empathy and so

22:02.480 --> 22:06.200
forth. It's closer to anxiety. Maybe

22:06.200 --> 22:08.480
that's kind of a topological relationship

22:08.480 --> 22:10.280
in some sense. And in fact I think mostly

22:10.280 --> 22:11.720
what you were talking about is anxiety

22:11.720 --> 22:13.360
rather than fear. But we'll get to that in

22:13.360 --> 22:17.960
a minute. So you've identified the

22:17.960 --> 22:19.560
you've defined the thing that you're

22:19.560 --> 22:21.080
interested in. And then you figure out

22:21.080 --> 22:22.800
some experimental way to study some

22:22.800 --> 22:26.120
aspect of that. So I've done that by

22:26.120 --> 22:27.640
studying the way the brain detects and

22:27.640 --> 22:30.800
responds to danger. Now when you do the

22:30.800 --> 22:32.800
the experiment your goal is not only to

22:32.800 --> 22:36.240
study the little thing that you're

22:36.240 --> 22:39.000
modeling but also the bigger thing that

22:39.000 --> 22:40.400
you want to make you want to gain some

22:40.400 --> 22:42.000
clarity on the bigger picture that you

22:42.000 --> 22:44.680
started out with fear. And so these two

22:44.680 --> 22:47.400
processes of defining and researching

22:47.400 --> 22:51.000
often go hand-in-hand. So over the last

22:51.000 --> 22:54.040
hundred and fifty years or so when that

22:54.040 --> 22:56.840
fear has been studied in various ways

22:56.840 --> 22:59.200
it's gone through a lot of transformations.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.560
The first approach has been to start with

23:01.560 --> 23:03.320
the everyday experience. Darwin talked

23:03.320 --> 23:07.120
about fear as a state of mind that's

23:07.120 --> 23:11.320
evolved. Freud talked about fear and as

23:11.320 --> 23:13.200
a conscious experience it might be

23:13.200 --> 23:15.480
turned into an unconscious or repressed

23:15.480 --> 23:19.280
state. William James talked about it. And

23:19.280 --> 23:21.480
then the behaviorist came along and said

23:21.480 --> 23:23.880
well this all this talk about consciousness

23:23.880 --> 23:25.800
is getting in the way of doing research.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.760
So let's talk about fear as a

23:27.760 --> 23:31.080
disposition to act in a certain way. And

23:31.080 --> 23:34.640
then a little bit later that was

23:34.640 --> 23:37.320
turned into something called an

23:37.320 --> 23:39.120
intervening variable. So the behaviorist

23:39.120 --> 23:40.960
talked about observable events like

23:40.960 --> 23:46.360
stimuli and responses. A behaviorist

23:46.360 --> 23:48.240
Carl Toman introduced the intervening

23:48.240 --> 23:50.960
variable which is something that sits

23:50.960 --> 23:52.760
between the stimulus and the response but

23:52.760 --> 23:55.080
has no psychological or biological

23:55.080 --> 23:59.880
reality. So fear in that sense was a

23:59.880 --> 24:02.640
concept that relates an external event

24:02.640 --> 24:05.480
with an observable response. It wasn't a

24:05.480 --> 24:07.040
real thing. It wasn't a fear in the

24:07.040 --> 24:09.120
sense of a psychological experience. It

24:09.120 --> 24:11.480
was just in a variable that explains how

24:11.480 --> 24:13.520
certain stimuli give rise to responses.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.120
The next step was these got turned into

24:16.120 --> 24:18.920
hypothetical constructs. So the

24:18.920 --> 24:22.160
hypothetical construct of fear was a

24:22.160 --> 24:24.920
one of the main idea was as a drive. So

24:24.920 --> 24:27.120
it was a drive that when reduced

24:27.120 --> 24:30.160
eliminated the the aversive state that

24:30.160 --> 24:32.480
you're experiencing. And then this became

24:32.480 --> 24:35.000
turned into a biological entity certain

24:35.000 --> 24:37.200
kinds of states of the brain. Now the

24:37.200 --> 24:39.360
original ideas that were coming along

24:39.360 --> 24:41.040
when people talking about brain states

24:41.040 --> 24:44.320
of fear were in something called the

24:44.320 --> 24:47.160
conceptual nervous system because they

24:47.160 --> 24:48.960
didn't know enough about the details of

24:48.960 --> 24:50.520
the brain to talk about the real nervous

24:50.520 --> 24:52.440
system. So again it was all

24:52.440 --> 24:55.080
hypothetical. It wasn't a real thing. But

24:55.080 --> 24:58.520
then finally research on brain circuits

24:58.520 --> 25:00.440
came along and we were able to identify

25:00.440 --> 25:03.640
circuits of fear. And now that those

25:03.640 --> 25:06.120
circuits have come along to explain how

25:06.120 --> 25:08.720
the brain detects and responds to danger

25:08.720 --> 25:10.560
something else has happened. Those

25:10.560 --> 25:12.480
circuits you know all of this effort has

25:12.480 --> 25:15.240
been to not talk about the not talk

25:15.240 --> 25:17.640
about fear as a psychological state as

25:17.640 --> 25:19.160
we're studying animals and we wanted to

25:19.160 --> 25:20.960
be able to understand how the stimulus

25:20.960 --> 25:23.040
produces the response without having to

25:23.040 --> 25:25.240
assume anything about the psychology of

25:25.240 --> 25:27.600
what that animal might be experiencing.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.960
But then once you have the circuit the

25:29.960 --> 25:31.960
circuit starts to be psychologicalized

25:31.960 --> 25:34.400
into a fear circuit. So that circuit is

25:34.400 --> 25:37.320
also generating the feeling of fear which

25:37.320 --> 25:38.960
people who are studying those circuits

25:38.960 --> 25:41.920
never really say. So all of this is a

25:41.920 --> 25:43.640
long way of saying we have a lot of

25:43.640 --> 25:45.600
problems in starting with a psychological

25:45.600 --> 25:48.320
concept like fear and getting back to

25:48.320 --> 25:50.480
how the brain is working but then coming

25:50.480 --> 25:52.280
back to understanding the psychological

25:52.280 --> 25:54.120
concept. And I think there's a way to do

25:54.120 --> 25:55.520
that. What we have to do is first

25:55.520 --> 25:58.960
distinguish what is that psychological

25:58.960 --> 26:01.280
concept from one of the underlying things.

26:01.280 --> 26:04.160
And I'll just wrap up by saying that

26:04.160 --> 26:06.120
every organism whether it's a bacterial

26:06.120 --> 26:08.640
cell or a human has to be able to detect

26:08.640 --> 26:10.920
and respond to danger. It doesn't need to

26:10.920 --> 26:12.920
feel fear to do that. Even in a human

26:12.920 --> 26:15.560
brain the brain can detect and respond to

26:15.560 --> 26:17.160
danger without building the stimulus is

26:17.160 --> 26:19.480
there and without having any experience

26:19.480 --> 26:23.200
at all. So what the organism is doing

26:23.200 --> 26:25.240
whether it's a bacteria or a human is

26:25.240 --> 26:28.160
detecting and responding to a threat. And

26:28.160 --> 26:30.920
somewhere in the course of evolution when

26:30.920 --> 26:32.640
the brain acquires the capacity to be

26:32.640 --> 26:35.120
consciously aware of its own activities

26:35.120 --> 26:37.040
you have the feeling of fear that comes

26:37.040 --> 26:39.360
along or the feeling of anxiety or love

26:39.360 --> 26:42.240
or whatever else. So I think we have to

26:42.240 --> 26:44.400
distinguish the feelings. I think that

26:44.400 --> 26:46.800
the everyday language is the way we

26:46.800 --> 26:49.200
should think about states like fear and

26:49.200 --> 26:51.760
anxiety and love and so forth. And that

26:51.760 --> 26:53.280
the scientific way of thinking about

26:53.280 --> 26:55.600
these things has to explain where that

26:55.600 --> 26:57.720
comes from but without assuming that

26:57.720 --> 26:59.400
it's the same thing as the scientific

26:59.400 --> 27:01.120
stuff that we're studying. I don't know if

27:01.120 --> 27:03.120
that makes any sense at all but it's...

27:03.120 --> 27:11.840
This is fascinating. One thing I wanted to say is that as we start a new geological period on planet Earth

27:11.840 --> 27:16.240
the the anthroposphere in which humans are

27:16.240 --> 27:22.560
dominating the planet the notion of fear or rather as he points out

27:22.560 --> 27:28.480
the threats. He's saying just let's talk about threats okay we are not clear what

27:28.480 --> 27:31.360
we mean by fear or do we need to have an emotion

27:31.360 --> 27:33.840
but the response to threat is what we're talking about.

27:33.840 --> 27:36.880
Well we do have fear we experience it but

27:36.880 --> 27:39.920
that's not what the brain... the brain

27:39.920 --> 27:43.840
circuits that detect threats do not exist in the brain to make you feel

27:43.840 --> 27:46.880
afraid. They make you... they're in the brain to allow you to detect threats.

27:46.880 --> 27:51.600
So let's back off and say instead of fear let's talk about the response to

27:51.600 --> 27:55.120
threats and then I'm saying what he used a

27:55.120 --> 27:59.200
keyword evolution. It turns out that the brain

27:59.200 --> 28:04.400
is like an automobile that has pieces of all sorts of primitive material like

28:04.400 --> 28:09.440
bicycles and monosycles and until it gets to a modern automobile

28:09.440 --> 28:12.720
we have all these pieces and they're loosely connected with each other in

28:12.720 --> 28:16.960
some way or another that we somehow understand but the point that he's

28:16.960 --> 28:21.200
making is if we made it so far he's because somehow

28:21.200 --> 28:27.920
we relate we we reacted to threats and what I'm saying is and we are in a

28:27.920 --> 28:35.760
position now where emotions may be evolving as the threats are evolving

28:35.760 --> 28:42.000
because in the anthropocene this new geological period that started in 1945

28:42.000 --> 28:47.200
we are facing totally different threats so the response to threat which is what

28:47.200 --> 28:51.680
he says is the only thing I can be clear about which is what the brain

28:51.680 --> 28:56.320
is doing. It's now something that is evolving because the

28:56.320 --> 29:01.280
threats are completely different. We used to be afraid of our survival

29:01.280 --> 29:06.400
in nature as other animals where our predators

29:06.400 --> 29:09.680
were it is nature who has to be afraid of us now

29:09.680 --> 29:13.600
so we have other fears the fears of what we ourselves

29:13.600 --> 29:18.480
may be going to do so this evolution of emotions

29:18.480 --> 29:22.000
is you know I think leading a lot of people to think well

29:22.000 --> 29:26.640
are emotions reasonable good should they orient our actions

29:26.640 --> 29:31.920
or not and to the extent that the response to threat is an emotion and I

29:31.920 --> 29:36.080
don't even know if it is an emotion. It's not I would say no. There it is.

29:36.080 --> 29:40.240
Let's get the other people in the discussion. Paul what do you think?

29:40.240 --> 29:45.680
I'm trying to jump in right there. Gretel I'm struggling a little bit with

29:45.680 --> 29:49.200
understanding the relationship to topology

29:49.200 --> 29:53.360
and I mean I heard what Joe said very clearly which is

29:53.360 --> 29:56.800
maybe we aren't talking about fear maybe we're talking about the way

29:56.800 --> 30:03.680
organisms respond to threats and I understand when I put on my hat as an

30:03.680 --> 30:06.720
economist being both an economist and a neuroscientist

30:06.720 --> 30:11.520
I'm very sympathetic to the classical economist definition of rationality

30:11.520 --> 30:14.560
that people are consistent that they follow some set of rules

30:14.560 --> 30:19.680
or maybe even an economist would say a human behavior is maximizing something

30:19.680 --> 30:23.040
that we have goals that we perceive towards these are all alternative

30:23.040 --> 30:29.200
ways to say the word rationality. So it seems to me the classic story is

30:29.200 --> 30:34.000
if I'm afraid my behavior is discontinuous across this boundary where

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
I become afraid and my behavior stops being rational and

30:38.000 --> 30:43.440
goal-directed and progression and consistent and become something else

30:43.440 --> 30:46.560
disordered dysfunctional and it seems to me that the

30:46.560 --> 30:49.840
core of the argument here is that you found a way

30:49.840 --> 30:55.360
to say well maybe that's not true maybe this is one thing and I was wondering

30:55.360 --> 30:59.040
if you could elaborate for me a little bit more for all of us a little bit more

30:59.040 --> 31:02.960
about topology and how it does that how it takes a

31:02.960 --> 31:08.400
discontinuous disordered behavior and reveals it not to be discontinuous

31:08.400 --> 31:12.080
disordered or unproductive.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.600
I did not introduce Paul so I didn't know the introduction of anybody else so I

31:17.600 --> 31:22.000
didn't tell you how great these people are but you probably understand

31:22.000 --> 31:27.200
already how they are clarifying things and cutting things down to size.

31:27.200 --> 31:33.440
Okay Paul yes the rationality is defined through maximums with logical

31:33.440 --> 31:38.080
deductions. I'm saying if I change the actions

31:38.080 --> 31:42.560
and I keep the rationality scheme which is using

31:42.560 --> 31:46.880
a logical deduction I will get to explain actions

31:46.880 --> 31:52.240
that were considered to be discontinuous and irrational before and you are

31:52.240 --> 31:56.480
asking me explain how. Well I were given some intuition

31:56.480 --> 32:03.040
for topologies role in that. Maybe I can say something.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.880
What topology is all about is in some ways

32:08.880 --> 32:15.200
defining what continuity is about because when you say something is

32:15.200 --> 32:23.440
continuous you want to say that if I move if I don't move too far and I'm

32:23.440 --> 32:27.760
measuring something that's happening out there it's not moving too far or

32:27.760 --> 32:31.200
I'm looking at my results and if these results

32:31.200 --> 32:36.880
are close together what people do what whether it's an economic

32:36.880 --> 32:40.320
model whether it's biological model whether it's a physical model

32:40.320 --> 32:44.320
I move a little bit that came from stimuli that were

32:44.320 --> 32:49.840
close together and that is what continuity

32:49.840 --> 32:54.080
really means and to say that it's discontinuous

32:54.080 --> 32:58.720
says that well if I have nearby things here

32:58.720 --> 33:02.960
the events that they create can be very far apart.

33:02.960 --> 33:08.080
So you come down to the idea of what's nearby and so how do

33:08.080 --> 33:12.720
so if you want to if you change the topology

33:12.720 --> 33:17.440
about saying what are your nearby things you can turn

33:17.440 --> 33:21.520
what seems in this model to be discontinuous

33:21.520 --> 33:27.040
because those things that you start close they got far apart here when you're

33:27.040 --> 33:31.440
measuring them this way but when you change the topology you

33:31.440 --> 33:36.240
change what's nearby here they become closer together

33:36.240 --> 33:42.320
so that and Graciela's example about weather for example

33:42.320 --> 33:46.160
if you just say things are nearby if they have nearby

33:46.160 --> 33:50.160
averages then you're going to have this big discontinuities

33:50.160 --> 33:54.080
if you say okay when are things nearby they're nearby

33:54.080 --> 33:57.200
if the average temperature over the year is nearby

33:57.200 --> 34:01.120
and their extremes are also close together

34:01.120 --> 34:04.080
things are different if they have very different extremes

34:04.080 --> 34:10.560
well then you have a different model and what's continuous one one model can be

34:10.560 --> 34:16.480
discontinuous in another model and so I think that

34:16.480 --> 34:20.720
it's very this idea of saying topology and fear

34:20.720 --> 34:25.440
you're taking different kinds of words that we're all used to using in different

34:25.440 --> 34:29.040
contexts I mean this is part of what you were saying how do we use these

34:29.040 --> 34:34.080
words and I think that if you want if you're trying to set up

34:34.080 --> 34:39.840
some kind of model that you can work with you do have to

34:39.840 --> 34:44.880
make these words have definite meetings in the context of what you're talking

34:44.880 --> 34:48.720
about so fear when we talk about the topology of fear

34:48.720 --> 34:52.560
we're talking about certain ways of measuring things if we change the ways

34:52.560 --> 34:56.000
of measuring things then maybe different things are

34:56.000 --> 35:02.480
closer together or not but it's very hard to take a very

35:02.480 --> 35:05.920
amorphous concept of fear talking about it this way

35:05.920 --> 35:10.560
and then here's your model and so you know you want to make the model it

35:10.560 --> 35:13.600
kind of reflects the things that you really are interested in

35:13.600 --> 35:17.360
I mean that's what people do when they try to set up mathematical models you

35:17.360 --> 35:19.920
try to find the things that you're really interested in

35:19.920 --> 35:25.920
and use those as the building blocks for your model

35:25.920 --> 35:30.480
and build those into your axiom system so that

35:30.480 --> 35:35.520
you get out things that you can predict from otherwise why do you want a model

35:35.520 --> 35:37.520
so far does that be?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.440
Helps on them let me bounce it back and you tell me

35:39.440 --> 35:43.840
if I got enough to really grab on to that

35:43.840 --> 35:47.200
I mean when I hear you say continuity the three of us are probably all

35:47.200 --> 35:50.240
immediately thinking about the mathematical term continuity and it

35:50.240 --> 35:53.600
may have slightly different meanings to different people in the room

35:53.600 --> 35:58.720
but what I hear saying is if we look at a change in the environment and a

35:58.720 --> 36:01.920
change in behavior we say oh look you know the environment's getting a

36:01.920 --> 36:04.720
little bit riskier and people are getting changing

36:04.720 --> 36:07.840
their behavior a little bit change it a little more they change it a little more

36:07.840 --> 36:11.200
change it a little bit more suddenly you make a little change and

36:11.200 --> 36:16.160
the behavior looks completely different so I think to me as an

36:16.160 --> 36:19.760
economist and nurse scientist that's discontinuous right yeah oh sure and

36:19.760 --> 36:24.720
so I had this problem which was that the thing I was manipulating the risk

36:24.720 --> 36:28.240
looked continuous to me and the behavior looked discontinuous to me which left

36:28.240 --> 36:32.160
me kind of like oh well that's not good and I'm hearing you say that the

36:32.160 --> 36:36.880
critical idea here is well when you see discontinuous behavior

36:36.880 --> 36:40.240
that doesn't line up with what you think is a continuous state of the outside

36:40.240 --> 36:43.200
world maybe you're looking at the outside world wrong

36:43.200 --> 36:46.400
maybe there there's a lens that makes the outside world

36:46.400 --> 36:49.360
either look discontinuous or flip the other way makes the behavior look

36:49.360 --> 36:54.880
continuous right yeah in fact to be very specific

36:54.880 --> 37:01.360
you as I said by using different polo you are using different values

37:01.360 --> 37:07.360
so something that you in example I gave before

37:07.360 --> 37:11.200
your value is on average you want to be as well as you can when you invest

37:11.200 --> 37:16.000
your money that's the way you value an investment

37:16.000 --> 37:20.400
an investment approach but then all of a sudden

37:20.400 --> 37:26.400
there is a small probability that this here there will be a market crash

37:26.400 --> 37:31.760
under the average response which is what you were saying

37:31.760 --> 37:37.120
and you were saying you will just you know

37:37.120 --> 37:41.600
neglect the market crash you will deny a market crash

37:41.600 --> 37:47.600
and you will dive into the market crash which is what happens to us

37:47.600 --> 37:50.400
so you're not looking at the worst that can happen

37:50.400 --> 37:54.400
that would not be your behavior if you're using the normal

37:54.400 --> 37:59.920
the polishing under the polishing of fear it doesn't matter to you how small is

37:59.920 --> 38:03.840
the probability of the event if it is bad enough you're going to

38:03.840 --> 38:08.000
focus on it really hard and then through these results

38:08.000 --> 38:12.240
I give a complete characterization that tells you how

38:12.240 --> 38:17.760
the human behavior the russian human behavior in corporate instead two parts

38:17.760 --> 38:20.960
incorporates I want to be on average as well as I can

38:20.960 --> 38:24.560
so I like the temperature to be on average 70 degrees

38:24.560 --> 38:30.320
but I'm going to also mind if there is a jump of 100 degrees from one day to the

38:30.320 --> 38:33.440
next I can't deal with it so I'm going to look at those two

38:33.440 --> 38:36.240
things and that leaves you to totally different

38:36.240 --> 38:40.480
behavior and not to look at the average temperature

38:40.480 --> 38:44.320
if you don't look at the average temperature you look irrational

38:44.320 --> 38:47.760
according to that criteria and it goes you know

38:47.760 --> 38:56.560
this can be made very very very precise mathematically as precise as you want

38:56.560 --> 39:02.960
so in the case of a market crash we might have avoided the market crash

39:02.960 --> 39:08.960
if the people in Wall Street instead of using the economics of averages

39:08.960 --> 39:14.160
which is the standard of unemployment theory they would have used the economics

39:14.160 --> 39:19.280
of reacting to a threat which is what I call the topology of fear

39:19.280 --> 39:22.400
and that leads to a decision criterion or function

39:22.400 --> 39:26.640
in which the words that can happen all of a sudden may pop up

39:26.640 --> 39:33.680
whoa we can go into a crash whoa stop break change behavior is that

39:33.680 --> 39:36.480
discontinuous well it would be if you're just doing

39:36.480 --> 39:39.920
a damages but if you're looking at the words that can happen it

39:39.920 --> 39:44.880
wouldn't be this continuous so the notion of rationality which is tied up with

39:44.880 --> 39:48.960
continuity as Linda says depends on how you measure things what your

39:48.960 --> 39:52.400
values are what you what you observe what you care for

39:52.400 --> 39:56.480
does it make sense yeah David why don't you know

39:56.480 --> 40:01.200
and then there's a great deal that's been said already that in terms of

40:01.200 --> 40:05.920
psychoanalysis raises a number of interesting

40:05.920 --> 40:11.760
questions but just this last point about continuity and discontinuity and about

40:11.760 --> 40:21.440
flipping the topology of the response so as to find a continuity where it

40:21.440 --> 40:26.800
appears that there's a discontinuity is a position that one experiences as a

40:26.800 --> 40:32.880
psychoanalyst all the time that is one of the things that takes place

40:32.880 --> 40:37.440
in listening very closely to the discourse of a patient

40:37.440 --> 40:41.520
is linked is one hears or finds links

40:41.520 --> 40:47.600
proximities continuities where it appears there are discontinuities

40:47.600 --> 40:54.080
in the content that's being talked about there also for example things which

40:54.080 --> 40:59.440
may seem highly unrelated on the face of them on the surface

40:59.440 --> 41:02.960
through further discourse you begin to see how they are in fact linked

41:02.960 --> 41:09.680
so you you find unexpected continuities unexpected proximities

41:09.680 --> 41:15.040
right on the level of meaning for example

41:17.760 --> 41:23.280
a person is to associate a little bit he will show you exactly

41:24.080 --> 41:27.120
if you free associate he'll give you an example yeah

41:27.120 --> 41:34.960
we're already using a couch but people are speaking about one topic

41:34.960 --> 41:39.840
in what appears to be a clear rational

41:39.840 --> 41:44.000
depiction of some story and suddenly they have a thought

41:44.000 --> 41:46.320
and they say I don't know where this comes from it's got nothing to do with

41:46.320 --> 41:49.920
what i'm talking about right but under the

41:49.920 --> 41:53.440
structure of a psychoanalytic treatment which is that you say whatever comes

41:53.440 --> 41:57.520
into your mind they say this thought that's random

41:57.520 --> 42:02.560
that seems completely unconnected as they speak about it

42:02.560 --> 42:07.040
and it happens this is a daily event this is not an unusual event in psychoanalytic

42:07.040 --> 42:11.360
work at all as they speak about it of two or three

42:11.360 --> 42:15.280
minutes into things of course i see why i thought about this

42:15.280 --> 42:20.080
it happens to us all all the time we have an association which seems entirely

42:20.080 --> 42:23.440
discontinuous and we discover the continuity

42:23.440 --> 42:26.080
right i mean how do you know it's a real continuity

42:26.080 --> 42:31.200
as opposed to one that's interpreted without any interpretation

42:31.200 --> 42:33.920
now the question there of course is what do you mean by real

42:33.920 --> 42:37.680
content i mean that is a question it's more about how this gets back to the

42:37.680 --> 42:40.480
sides of the well the way it gets back and

42:40.480 --> 42:46.080
uh is that it has to do with the the level of analysis

42:46.080 --> 42:51.520
you know each of us work in a different framework of analysis

42:51.520 --> 42:57.280
but uh what's of interest to the psychoanalysts is subjective

42:57.280 --> 43:00.960
reality its subjective experience is not just

43:00.960 --> 43:05.600
the description but the articulation of subjective experience putting it into

43:05.600 --> 43:09.600
language conveying it to another person so

43:09.600 --> 43:15.040
the continuity is real by virtue of the subjective experience

43:15.040 --> 43:19.680
what its reality is in terms of other criteria is another question

43:19.680 --> 43:22.800
so in my field we have something called memory

43:22.800 --> 43:26.880
reconsolidation where you take a memory out as as you do in

43:26.880 --> 43:33.760
psychoanalysis examine it and what we and others have found is that when

43:33.760 --> 43:36.720
memories are are taken out in this way and made in

43:36.720 --> 43:41.200
in a made active they go to a period of vulnerability where they can be

43:41.200 --> 43:46.480
changed and then restored and the new reality becomes what's restored

43:46.480 --> 43:50.640
rather than what the original reality was

43:50.640 --> 43:55.440
and so a common example is someone witnesses a crime

43:55.440 --> 43:59.120
and gives a report to the police on the day of the crime

43:59.120 --> 44:05.120
and then they go to court to testify and rather than talk about the details

44:05.120 --> 44:08.240
they gave the police they come up with details that were in a newspaper

44:08.240 --> 44:12.880
article that they read in the meantime so reading that article reactivated the

44:12.880 --> 44:17.120
memory caused new information to be stored and then that becomes the

44:17.120 --> 44:20.080
reality that they carry forth as the next memory

44:20.080 --> 44:23.920
so the you know the extreme version of this is your memory is only as good as

44:23.920 --> 44:27.680
your last memory and that's that is an extreme version but

44:27.680 --> 44:31.440
there's some truth okay i have to say something directly

44:31.440 --> 44:37.920
related to that uh and to uh poll was saying mathematically

44:37.920 --> 44:44.320
when you have when you have

44:44.800 --> 44:49.920
the foundation of how we observe reality is probability and statistics

44:49.920 --> 44:53.040
that's how we observe things we measure things and we take

44:53.040 --> 44:56.560
statistics okay that's we look at statistics of what

44:56.560 --> 45:00.880
you don't see one option you you look at statistics of it

45:00.880 --> 45:05.440
now these same axioms of are using the extreme

45:05.440 --> 45:08.960
at events lead to a different probability and statistics

45:08.960 --> 45:14.320
which when you look at the stochastic processes that they generate

45:14.320 --> 45:18.320
when you have a probability function and you pull out

45:18.320 --> 45:24.400
uh you pull balls from an urn that has a different distribution

45:24.400 --> 45:31.360
then you plot how many were red how many were black etc that gives you

45:31.360 --> 45:36.880
a stochastic process that's what it's called and the prices of the stock in

45:36.880 --> 45:41.120
wall street also are a stochastic process

45:41.120 --> 45:46.160
the observations of particles in the universe are also a stochastic process

45:46.160 --> 45:52.960
etc well if you take these axioms and you put

45:52.960 --> 45:59.440
the topology of fear and derive the stochastic process that occur

45:59.440 --> 46:03.600
they are not random walks and they are not smooth diffusion processes

46:03.600 --> 46:10.640
they are diffusion processes with jumps that's a theorem

46:10.640 --> 46:16.080
now what you are saying and what you are saying is you observe a person

46:16.080 --> 46:19.600
talking about an event and all of a sudden they make a jump

46:19.600 --> 46:26.320
which is discontinuous which you say unrelated

46:26.320 --> 46:31.680
well there is a theorem coming from these axioms that says

46:31.680 --> 46:35.520
that's the way it is they will be market charges

46:35.520 --> 46:39.680
they will be discontinuities on the second analytic chair and they will

46:39.680 --> 46:42.800
the discontinuities are the rule not the exception

46:42.800 --> 46:47.600
but they are not really discontinuities when you take into account

46:47.600 --> 46:52.640
the value system or the topology of fear that is underlying this form of

46:52.640 --> 46:55.440
rationality they are what you expect to be

46:55.440 --> 46:59.840
in fact you prove they are going to be jump diffusion processes

46:59.840 --> 47:04.800
that's why the mass in the universe is not uniformly distributed that's why

47:04.800 --> 47:08.480
you have stars so you have nothing for a while and then you have

47:08.480 --> 47:12.000
you know jumps in mass that's why people in the couch

47:12.000 --> 47:15.520
all of a sudden come up with something strange but could you predict what

47:15.520 --> 47:18.560
the patient is going to come up with you can predict the

47:18.560 --> 47:22.960
frequency in which they will occur you can predict

47:22.960 --> 47:26.160
the form that this probability distribution takes

47:26.160 --> 47:29.840
and then you can carry experiments about it and

47:29.840 --> 47:32.880
that gives rise to a new form of probability and statistics

47:32.880 --> 47:36.640
and it reproduces what what happens for example with earth quakes

47:36.640 --> 47:41.520
I just want to add a dimension to that

47:41.760 --> 47:45.520
and in so doing bring it back to the question of emotion and to the question

47:45.520 --> 47:52.880
of fear and threat because that your argument I think is that fear

47:52.880 --> 47:56.560
introduces a particular form of discontinuity

47:56.560 --> 48:06.640
which can be accounted for by a topological structure which will

48:06.640 --> 48:11.120
match the values of that new form of discontinuity

48:11.120 --> 48:17.760
what I'd like to suggest that the discontinuities are only apparent

48:17.760 --> 48:28.160
yet so it seems to me though that there

48:28.160 --> 48:31.520
there is something about you know

48:32.000 --> 48:40.640
you it's not clear that fear it I mean it works maybe in this context but

48:40.640 --> 48:44.560
there are a lot of situations people are building now these huge

48:44.560 --> 48:48.320
supercomputers and they've got thousands of computers that they put

48:48.320 --> 48:52.560
together and they know as these things go they generate

48:52.560 --> 48:55.520
heat you know they're going to generate heat so you know that this one is going

48:55.520 --> 48:58.880
to fail and you have to program them in such a way

48:58.880 --> 49:02.320
that when this one fails this one is taking over

49:02.320 --> 49:06.240
and so that people when you're looking at the output it all looks very

49:06.240 --> 49:09.120
continuous because you don't see that this one

49:09.120 --> 49:13.280
stopped and that one started but in fact

49:13.280 --> 49:17.440
there was this jump now this is and all of this

49:17.440 --> 49:21.600
has nothing to do with the emotions this is because people have thought about

49:21.600 --> 49:27.360
well how are you going to deal with situations where you know

49:27.360 --> 49:30.160
something's going to get hot you don't know which one's going to get hot

49:30.160 --> 49:34.640
you don't know when you have some sense of mean time to failure but

49:34.640 --> 49:38.880
you try to build this in to the system and

49:38.880 --> 49:43.840
but this is not an emotionally charged situation where you're dealing with

49:43.840 --> 49:48.160
some kinds of discontinuities and so you try to create models where you think

49:48.160 --> 49:52.000
this is going to work and in that sense you create

49:52.000 --> 49:55.200
topologies which are measuring what's going on

49:55.200 --> 49:59.120
and there is something similar to that in terms of you're saying

49:59.120 --> 50:03.200
you have a topology you want to create a topology that takes

50:03.200 --> 50:08.800
these what seem to be rationalities when we put it in the context of the market

50:08.800 --> 50:16.000
as discontinuities and make them into a situation where you can

50:16.000 --> 50:20.640
know what to expect so that you know you know how to react to them you know

50:20.640 --> 50:25.760
that the market that you can make a situation where you're in good shape

50:25.760 --> 50:30.800
so the so is using the word fear throwing in

50:30.800 --> 50:34.800
an emotional charge into the discussion commensor

50:34.800 --> 50:38.880
and you agree with him because he said well i just you know i just he's saying

50:38.880 --> 50:42.720
it's not really fear it's like the there is a systematic way in which we

50:42.720 --> 50:45.760
respond to threat and we better know how to do that because otherwise we

50:45.760 --> 50:49.360
wouldn't be here and that's what it is and you may or

50:49.360 --> 50:55.120
not feel fear right and so there is no role for the

50:55.120 --> 51:00.160
emotion no the once once you've detected a threat

51:00.160 --> 51:04.480
and it invades your consciousness then it's a whole new game then that's when

51:04.480 --> 51:10.320
fear is there and begins to act back on the the whole system

51:10.320 --> 51:13.920
and everything changes i i work in the first 15 milliseconds

51:13.920 --> 51:17.680
of stimulus so that's what i'm trying to understand

51:17.680 --> 51:21.520
but you know by the time that you have the awareness of something

51:21.520 --> 51:26.080
obviously it's a whole new ball game so you will say the reaction to threat

51:26.080 --> 51:30.560
in the first few milliseconds is what it is no fear no emotion it's just a

51:30.560 --> 51:34.800
reaction to threat and then eventually the brain picks up

51:34.800 --> 51:39.440
oops it realizes what's happening it's observing itself

51:39.440 --> 51:43.920
and then it feels fear right there's another step though so

51:43.920 --> 51:49.120
the the brain first detects first we react to danger so you're walking

51:49.120 --> 51:52.560
along there's a snake on the ground you stop and then you realize there's a

51:52.560 --> 51:55.520
snake right because your brain is detected it or you're walking down the

51:55.520 --> 51:58.240
street you jump back and the bus goes flying by

51:58.240 --> 52:03.200
so you're able to the bus the bus so our car whatever taxi so

52:03.200 --> 52:07.440
your brain is able to identify these these stimuli that are potentially

52:07.440 --> 52:12.880
dangerous uh and and allow you to react in hardwired pre-programmed ways

52:12.880 --> 52:16.400
now once that's happened that changes the state of the brain so that you

52:16.400 --> 52:19.840
become more sensitive to threatening stimuli

52:19.840 --> 52:24.160
you you have goal-directed behaviors that begin to be called upon through

52:24.160 --> 52:29.200
past learning and and so forth that allow you to then

52:29.200 --> 52:33.760
perform instrumental or willful behaviors that help you cope with the situation

52:33.760 --> 52:37.680
not necessarily consciously but then at the same time you're beginning to

52:37.680 --> 52:41.840
become consciously aware of everything and then that will also impact as well

52:41.840 --> 52:44.400
so we can think of like three levels here and then once

52:44.400 --> 52:47.280
you're conscious of it then it's a whole nother ballgame where

52:47.280 --> 52:51.040
you know you're consciously planning things and you may say that that's

52:51.040 --> 52:56.720
a complete artifact as well there could be a topology going on that's making

52:56.720 --> 52:59.680
predictions about what the next step is going to be in

52:59.680 --> 53:02.640
consciousness is a total epiphenome i don't think that's true

53:02.640 --> 53:06.720
but we certainly don't understand what consciousness is and how it works

53:06.720 --> 53:13.600
one question are emotions good or bad they're both

53:13.600 --> 53:19.120
so how do we know whether we should yield to our emotions or not

53:19.120 --> 53:22.640
well first of all you can't i'm just asking a simple question

53:22.640 --> 53:26.080
i mean you wait in terms of your reaction you can't stop that i mean first you're

53:26.080 --> 53:30.240
gonna react and then you may you know you may short circuit it but it starts

53:30.240 --> 53:32.880
uh and then that's what will determine whether you

53:32.880 --> 53:36.960
continue to respond or not and you may not even be able to stop it

53:36.960 --> 53:41.760
but if we develop emotions as part of this process of coping and observing

53:41.760 --> 53:45.920
etc and rationalizing what happens when we react to threat

53:45.920 --> 53:49.040
and now in the Anthropocene threats have changed

53:49.040 --> 53:53.920
are there were emotions changing different threats different emotions

53:53.920 --> 53:57.520
depends on what you mean by emotions i mean it's you know it's it's all about

53:57.520 --> 54:02.080
defining what the terms are i think the you know i think David was in the middle

54:02.080 --> 54:05.040
of something when we got off track so maybe we should go back to that

54:05.040 --> 54:11.680
well it relates to your question and and it's to introduce another

54:11.680 --> 54:17.520
uh term in the question of decision-making and that is the notion of desire

54:17.520 --> 54:24.640
because it seems to me relevant that in making a decision the subject is not

54:24.640 --> 54:29.680
simply engaging in a rational calculation of

54:29.680 --> 54:34.160
advantage and disadvantage the subject also

54:34.160 --> 54:39.680
experiences something about a fantasy a wish

54:39.680 --> 54:43.040
an idea of what the consequence of success

54:43.040 --> 54:50.160
will be um as part of subjective life one

54:50.160 --> 54:54.000
continuity one proximity that is very striking

54:54.000 --> 55:00.960
is that very close to the experience of desire

55:00.960 --> 55:02.240
is the experience of threat

55:02.240 --> 55:08.000
yes i'm using the topological i'm using the topological idea that is

55:08.000 --> 55:16.480
that is whereas we might think that nothing could be more discontinuous or

55:16.480 --> 55:20.720
further apologize to the experience of

55:20.720 --> 55:26.160
the first thing that is that is

55:26.160 --> 55:33.200
think that nothing could be more discontinuous or further apart

55:33.200 --> 55:39.840
as for example someone speaks about a wish that they have

55:39.840 --> 55:44.320
and they begin to articulate the nature of that wish a wish for some

55:44.320 --> 55:48.320
outcome some behavior some activity to take place

55:48.320 --> 55:52.640
as they articulate more and more about that wish including unexpected

55:52.640 --> 55:57.200
elaborations about that wish what often takes place is an experience of some

55:57.200 --> 55:59.920
kind of inhibition something stopping them

55:59.920 --> 56:03.440
they stop i can't go on i can't really say more

56:03.440 --> 56:09.200
about this to talk about what you want to talk about your desire freely

56:09.200 --> 56:14.000
is a very difficult thing to do something takes place something

56:14.000 --> 56:17.760
related to what i think joe is talking about as as a threat

56:17.760 --> 56:23.360
responds to threat pre-conscious the desire is a response to threat

56:23.360 --> 56:28.320
no no in talking about desire in articulating desire

56:28.320 --> 56:35.200
we observe a response to threat in the form of of of some kind of an

56:35.200 --> 56:39.920
inhibition some kind of a stopping some kind of a difficulty

56:39.920 --> 56:43.680
right going at are you saying anything more than

56:43.680 --> 56:48.320
if you want to put ten thousand dollars in

56:48.320 --> 56:54.000
grass yellow spond and you think grass yellow is gonna give you

56:54.000 --> 56:58.560
three thousand dollars more by the end of the year so you'll have 13 000 so your

56:58.560 --> 57:02.320
desire is to change your ten thousand into 13 000

57:02.320 --> 57:06.240
then you have the idea what if grass yellow doesn't succeed and i lose my

57:06.240 --> 57:09.680
money is that what you mean by desire and threat

57:09.680 --> 57:13.680
no because that that i mean that that's a very rational you know what you're

57:13.680 --> 57:17.440
worried about there well now i'm talking about the more

57:17.440 --> 57:22.160
and it's a garden variety i think we all experience it you think

57:22.160 --> 57:28.720
i have a good chance of doubling my money in this investment

57:28.720 --> 57:32.960
but there's something about that that bothers me there's something i

57:32.960 --> 57:37.760
you know what i'm not i'm not sure i can actually

57:37.760 --> 57:43.600
bring myself to act on that knowledge it's an inhibition

57:43.600 --> 57:47.840
why do people get in their own way why do what i would suggest is this

57:47.840 --> 57:52.240
happens constantly this happens in daily life

57:52.240 --> 57:57.120
this isn't a rare event under extreme conditions so you're afraid of what you

57:57.120 --> 58:05.280
want i think people are generally afraid of what they want

58:05.280 --> 58:09.440
now in post-traumatic stress disorder

58:09.440 --> 58:13.920
isn't it doesn't it come up in some cases where you associate something that you

58:13.920 --> 58:16.960
want very much with something which is a tremendous

58:16.960 --> 58:22.480
threat to you like what i mean what do you mean

58:22.480 --> 58:28.560
well let's look at the case of domestic violence

58:28.560 --> 58:38.560
so you are in love with his man and one day he tried to kill you

58:38.560 --> 58:43.360
and then out of that you have this association you love this person that

58:43.360 --> 58:46.480
is all these warmth and these wonderful feelings

58:46.480 --> 58:51.040
but then all of a sudden you relay that with the worst possible experience

58:51.040 --> 58:55.920
which is that your life may be at stake in a horrible way

58:55.920 --> 58:59.680
so you're describing to describing the person's

58:59.680 --> 59:04.240
subjective conscious experience but underneath that are going to be

59:04.240 --> 59:07.600
approach and avoidance tendencies that have been conditioned by those

59:07.600 --> 59:12.320
experiences so there may be some uh you know some very good times that

59:12.320 --> 59:17.360
created positive relationships stimuli associated with that person that

59:17.360 --> 59:20.640
are attractive and appealing but also the very negative things

59:20.640 --> 59:23.200
they're going to be pulling you in the other direction

59:23.200 --> 59:26.720
so these are these are the kinds of things they're going to be triggering

59:26.720 --> 59:31.840
these implicit unconscious processes every time you encounter that person

59:31.840 --> 59:34.720
uh and you know which one wins probably the

59:34.720 --> 59:38.480
adversity is it is uh it's going to win in every situation

59:38.480 --> 59:45.440
because but Joe the what you were saying seems to me would make sense

59:45.440 --> 59:52.000
if uh the example wasn't grads yellow's example because grads yellow's example

59:52.000 --> 59:55.760
is that your actual life is being threatened it's not that

59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.080
you say you know he's a nice guy because he buys me nice presence

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.600
but whenever he comes home for dinner he starts yelling and screaming

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.240
that's uh when you were talking about an extreme example like

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.080
she's talking about how would you justify remaining with somebody who

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.080
actually is threatening your life and he's saying there would be natural

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.800
because what you most desire is also what you're most afraid of

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:27.520
not really saying that

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.160
i wouldn't put it that simply in in in the sense that it's in all cases

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.720
all i'm saying is that there is an unexpected proximity

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.640
in the sense that uh you were talking about it topologically there's an

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:48.640
unexpected proximity between threat and desire unexpected by what we might

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.960
think of as a an ordinary topology but the topology

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.920
that that a psychoanalyst comes to work with

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.040
is the expected proximity of threat and desire

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.000
i can give you a research example that i think helps to address this question

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.160
um one of my colleagues Regina Sullivan uh has studied

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.360
rat pups and at a very early age while the pups are still

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.400
nursing um pups what's pups maybe pups maybe rats

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.960
nursing with the mother um a stimulus that's associated with the mother

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.920
but uh is also connected to to a painful experience

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.240
in the pup uh the the the pup will treat that stimulus

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.600
as a positive stimulus so it's as if you know the mother may be abusive

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.520
but the pup is dependent on them on the mother so the connections formed are

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.200
still in the positive approach uh vein but as soon as the the pup stops

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.120
nursing um the those same stimuli now become

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.880
aversive and the pup will avoid those under any circumstance

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.440
now that okay that's fine but then in the adult you can bring back

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.960
this infant uh attraction by stress so raising cortisol levels in

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.640
the adult rat will bring back the infantile pattern

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.040
of approaching the dangerous harmful stimulus

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.040
so to the extent that PTSD is often something that

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.880
uh a person doesn't just develop PTSD after one stress in life often it's

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.480
something where one has been traumatized as a child

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.000
and then that sensitizes the brain to to later stress

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.320
you can imagine how the same kind of mechanism would kick in

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.640
wow

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.200
so essentially what he's saying is that masochism is cortisol

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.520
well the the topology actually is uh

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.440
it's actually doing a lot of work for us here because it's telling us

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.520
again values in some cases what you really care for but also

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:05.280
in reality what things are close to which i mean it's really

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:09.920
it's uh i mean i there is no question that

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.520
it really depends on the topology we use depends on the way we're wired

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.040
but also our culture certain things in our culture are considered to be

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.600
similar and that topology that proximity is

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.240
completely

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.920
hard wire i mean there's no particular reason for it

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.120
uh i was going to give examples but i want to create anything to

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.680
uh difficult to comprehend but what you're saying is very interesting for that

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.240
i mean i think was agreeing with what you said about desire

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.920
and uh well so what i was saying out of that was that

01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:01.280
we can put a topology on emotions that our

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.600
measure two two emotions are close together if they

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.600
both make you feel relatively good or if they both make you feel

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.120
relatively bad and we sort of tend to think of

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.400
um being happy is on the way to being ecstatic which is

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:25.040
sort of closer than being in great fear or

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.760
being terribly sad and i think what you're saying is that

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.920
off if you change your idea of what the topology is

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.880
and you say we put emotions together it would say that they're close if they

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.040
occur at the same time or in close

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.800
prux you know if you see within a given individual

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.800
these emotions occurring simultaneously then maybe that's

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.920
when you say these should be close so that's a different topology that you

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.520
can put on emotions saying that these are these are close together

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:04.400
because they occur often together as opposed to having

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.280
that they're far apart because they have

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.680
uh you know they seem far apart about what they make people feel

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:15.600
from it

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.760
Paul did you get the response to the question you have?

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:24.240
I think so i mean i i understand a little bit more this notion of

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.160
what you mean by topologically consistent and i mean i think

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.360
the discussion here has really focused on how emotions are topologically

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.280
consistent how they that might align with the topology of

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.480
fear and the topology of efficient decision-making

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:44.240
i'm not exactly sure how these two sets of ideas the one psychological

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.720
about topology and the other economic basically about topology

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.800
exactly align and i see joe chafing constantly at the border between those

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.960
two ideas but what about reward prediction error

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:02.240
which is something you study i mean that's a discontinuity

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.800
i'm sorry i didn't hear you yeah did you know did i want to go there?

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.680
i don't want to go there i don't know if that's true

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.360
but if you have a something that's being predicted and that

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:17.840
prediction is not coming true and that's triggering

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.480
you know i mean i i view that as a very continuous process because i'm thinking

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.800
well i'm expecting to find a full glass of water and i find only half

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.040
a glass of water so i'm surprised negatively by half

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.360
i mean these are you know little things that you learn from

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.320
don't expect whatever but i know what she's talking about

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.000
but i i don't i don't see those as discontinuous at all

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.760
i mean those map and normal topologies those are just straight linear spaces

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.800
i i mean i don't want to descend into mathematics here but

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.800
i think this is something really different

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:58.080
well i have a question about topology that maybe Linda can answer

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.520
the model that some psychoanalysts use to map the space

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.200
where these unexpected continuities occur is

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:12.320
uh it can be talked about in a variety of one of them is the cross cap

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.760
the project the real projective plane yeah

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.520
the self-intersecting plane yeah right

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:29.520
um just does that make sense to you as a topological model

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.120
related to the questions that we're talking about

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.440
here

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:46.320
I guess for my my sense thinking about that kind of model is

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:49.760
that

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.760
what is special about it is

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.640
that it's an example of something that is not orientable

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.800
so the simplest example of that is the Mobius strip

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.720
where you take a piece of paper like this and then you

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.560
want to glue the ends together and you glue it like this and the thing is that

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:21.360
you can keep going around it it has only one side right i think

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.960
what you're saying more about this question of

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.760
proximities that you don't expect to find is

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.680
that you have a situation where you're looking at

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.800
this global question of dealing with these emotions and trying to see how they

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.560
fit together and they're sitting it's more like a surface that comes around

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.560
and meets itself it's not the question of orientability

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.760
that is what characterizes cross cap but the idea that you have something

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.480
that what we call in mathematics is immersed

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.640
rather than embedded that you have you have a surface that comes around and

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.600
intersects itself it comes out and then it comes around it might

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.560
intersect itself again in some other kind of

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.960
special place so it's more this question of

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.920
the fact that you have self-intersections and

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:18.160
immersibility as opposed to embedibility in terms of the

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.760
mathematical technical terms for yeah that is a great

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:26.560
image of those modes of intersection called singularities yes

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.080
it's a very evocative term for a psychoanalyst

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.040
i mean you know if you the simplest kind of

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:39.760
thing is you know if you take a curve that you grow on the plane that comes

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.440
around and intersects itself in one point

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.320
well you can write down equations for surfaces where

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.600
the surface lives in a bigger space because there are more variables but

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.760
then they intersect in a whole line or in bigger and even bigger

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.480
pieces and sometimes it does it in a nice way and sometimes it does it in a

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.080
very not very nice way and there are lots of theories to think about these

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.040
various singularities and see how they come about

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.840
but you think also is that sometimes the opposite

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:18.000
speaks and that's what you were saying with this type of emotions i mean the

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.120
extreme desire and extreme fear or feeling of threat

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.000
meat but the only thing i would say that

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.080
somewhat differs from your position is that i find that this is

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.920
occurs all the time i don't think it's a rare

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.920
event i think in decision-making all the time

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.480
there are these singularities these conjunctions of opposites these

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.880
unexpected i agree all right what i'm saying is that

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.600
when you look at it from a conventional approach

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.600
you like this and you dislike a threat okay they're separate and what you're

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.800
saying is no don't expect them to be separate expect them to

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.960
converge and in mathematics expect them to come together all the time

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:07.120
and they do and i agree with that and that leads to a totally different types of

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.800
type of mathematics and you can predict different things

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.040
for example believe it or not you can predict some things that's happening

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.360
quantum probability using this type of mathematics

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.240
that you couldn't predict otherwise and and maybe that we should be using one of

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.840
those because the quantum probability scheme

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.640
that is also the biological connects with the issue of frameworks and i

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:38.160
don't understand why since i call ushists or understand that we think in

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.280
frameworks those two fields have not been

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.440
closer together

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:49.200
did i say something wrong i don't know

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:55.280
yeah i think i'd like to just go back to the the basic question of

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.920
a fear versus anxiety because i i think most of the stuff you talked about in

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.400
your example would fall into the category of what scientists call

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:07.600
anxiety more than fear

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.520
so the typical scientific definition is fear is

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.880
a state that occurs when there's an immediately present threat so like the

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:18.720
snake on the ground whereas anxiety is one where you're

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.360
anticipating a threat now by that definition though

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:27.040
really almost everything that we call fear is anxiety because

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.880
it's usually not you know the snake itself but the

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.480
what what you're what's you know there's nothing about the snake that's

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.200
inherently dangerous it's the you're worried that the snake is

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.280
going to bite you so all of that is becomes anxiety

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.600
um now one way to to look at these things is in terms of

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.320
what's called predatory imminence um this is a theory that michael

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.960
phanslow ucla is advanced and he has a scale of uh different degrees of

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.400
temporal and spatial proximity that determine uh how a rat is going to

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.840
respond to a particular threat or any other organism

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.840
so if the stimulus if the threat is like immediately

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.240
in front of you uh then you have you you will freeze

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.240
if it's a little bit further away um you will freeze but sort of be

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.240
engaging in uh what's called risk assessment kind of head bobbing and

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.960
moving back and forth but when you're frozen you're just

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.560
dead solid no movement at all but if the threat is further away you're kind of

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.080
checking it out if the threat is very far away you might

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.920
just run away because that's uh the best thing to do if if you have

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.760
the opportunity to escape and if it's really far away and

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.280
is not even visible then you know there's no response at all

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.480
even though it may be potentially present so

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.440
an animal that is um is hungry for example he's what hungry

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.320
we'll have to overcome certain concerns every time he goes out of the the

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:02.160
nest and into the world there's a chance there's a probability that he's

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.480
going to be eaten but uh he knows what's going on in his

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.640
local area so he's going to take that chance to go find something to eat

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.240
uh so there's no threat present but he has to be vigilant just in case but he's

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.840
going to still perform the behaviors he needs to unless the threat is actually

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.320
detected at some distance and depending on how close it is the uh

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.160
the way it will respond to be different so it seems that maybe that's just too

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.520
simple mud in terms of topology but it seems that there's a

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.960
topological relationship between what the animal is going to do

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.160
and uh what it expects and so forth that is a very good example

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.080
yeah okay i think we can go to questions yeah

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.920
i think there is a couple of questions here

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.360
they have to be questions they don't have to be statements and long comments

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.640
great questions please

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:01.200
let me refer i did have a comment that was going to turn into a question so

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.520
let me rephrase it uh i think uh joseph mentioned as

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.640
Paul did later on but you were very explicit that one of the issues here

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.400
is definition of terms so i went the question i have for

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.640
Linda i think at first um in topological space especially

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.240
mathematical top uh topology uh the notion of

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.200
continuity versus a continuous versus discrete transformation

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.520
is very very precise so i think the whole idea of discontinuity here

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.600
was used in a context that strays from a strip topological

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:39.840
uh interpretation so i wanted to ask you that uh and i'm quite

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:46.080
understanding well in that um if one if if if you're talking about for

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:50.880
example the uh transforming the topology uh based on certain axioms

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.400
into a second topology based on different axioms

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.280
if that's a continuous transformation that's one thing

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.320
if there's separate type of topologies it's something else

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.000
yeah so right so i think basically what she's defining is a separate

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.280
okay it's not it's not that it's not that you're making a continuous

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:16.800
transformation from one topology to another yeah yeah yeah no

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.800
and then the since that's cleared up the question i have for you specifically

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.680
would if you have looked into or think that looking into

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.760
um abelian lee groups would have any traction in this context

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.280
and i break i bring that up because of its relationship to quantum mechanics

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.040
and that lee groups have been shown to um be very useful in probabilistic

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.080
interpretations of quantum events yeah so i'm actually bresiella can probably

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.840
answer that better than i can because she has worked with

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.160
mathematics of those models so she would know better weather

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.760
you really how you how you use the abelian yeah but they would kick me out of

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.080
here if i started talking about that but yes i mean

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:12.320
if you everything they were saying is very very close to quantum

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.080
probability by that among other things you have different frameworks in which

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.280
you look at things now when you do have that and you

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.400
transform one framework into another that is a group of transformations

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.600
that gives rise to either abelian or non-abelian groups

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.160
oh very good okay so then i'll talk to you later about

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.760
the relationship of min max uh to that statement

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.120
wow that i i don't know it's like linda said

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:43.440
they are not connected i mean typically speaking what you do there is you

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.360
transform if a basis of coordinates into another

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:51.280
and you're not using min max no but in terms of the topological

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.320
representation of the two different uh state spaces that's what i put not now

01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:02.880
thanks hi i'd like to ask if you could define

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:10.400
embedded versus immersed and if there is a an analogy in both psychoanalysis and

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.600
in the work show that you do this question only in new york city

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:29.200
i was an amazing question okay so it's um if i have a surface that's embedded

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:34.160
it will intersect itself if i have if i have a curve

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.840
i mean it's easier to think about a curve that comes back

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:42.800
and crosses itself if it crosses but i can think of it as a curve because it

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:48.000
makes sense to follow it around right so when i follow it around like

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.440
shoelace and i go to tie it that's where it crosses itself

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.680
if it fuses together if it doesn't come together

01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:01.600
if it's if if when i follow it around it never touches itself it's embedded

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.080
very simple

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.120
okay so your necklace isn't bad if it doesn't come together

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.960
actually but yeah i can do it doesn't you're right

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:25.280
but is there an analogy in the sense that when you start thinking about

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.800
emotions that are close together in terms of say the way they make you feel

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.920
or and you start going through moving through

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.080
emotions that are close together and then these are

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:45.920
would somehow feel very far apart but in terms of their occurrence within the

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.280
space they come together again as in feeling good

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.720
and then feeling fearful and so you've made this transition through these

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.760
various different emotions and you come together and all of a sudden there you

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.280
are in the same place yeah i'll i'll give you one other

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.880
example uh it has to do with the notion of transference

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.080
in psychoanalysis transference yeah the notion of transference

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.720
it to put it very simply is that an event taking place

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.160
can be simultaneously meaningful in two

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:27.680
points of time two points of time i.e. a memory and an encounter in the present

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.880
can be at that moment experienced as a simultaneous event

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.640
so there is exactly the kind of so you've gone from when it happened before

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:43.200
through some period of time and now you experience it again

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:48.880
and so it is in the but it feels like so you're in the same point from the

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:53.280
point of event but a different point in time yeah and that is

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.280
transference in psychoanalysis you know defined topologically

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.640
so from the neurobiological point of view that what you just described is

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:08.720
the you know when we scientifically we think of

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.120
being able to attend or be conscious of a particular thing in our mind

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.440
means that that information is in what's called working memory

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:22.400
so maybe you first had one state one of these states in working memory

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.960
or the other but now they're both in working memory so they're simultaneous

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:30.560
but in terms of you know so-called emotions whether you can have two

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.240
emotions at one time in terms of the biological

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:40.800
underpinnings of emotion is i don't think we we know the answer but

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.200
you know if we think of for example

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.480
what what these states do let's say you're in a state that's been triggered by

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.280
the presence of a threat it begins to monopolize your brain because it

01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.640
takes over causes you know this is a survival situation

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.640
so your brain is now in a state where everything has to be dedicated

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.440
to survive the moment so that's why it's monopolizing so it would be hard for

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.600
another state to take over at that point unless it had some

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.000
greater priority so let's flip things around let's say you're really hungry

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.520
so the the nutrition energy balance system has taken over your brain

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:32.640
but um you know that there's a predator right out there where you've got to go

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.280
get your food so you're not going to go out you're

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.480
going to stay hungry for a while on the other hand

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.840
let's say you know the predator's there and you're still hungry and you're

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.440
really hungry you're on the point of starvation now so you have to risk

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.320
encountering the predator to get some food so these are uh

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.840
can be thought of as different points of monopolization that where the

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.680
states are almost uh discontinuous and switching back and forth

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.000
as needed on the momentary state

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.840
okay

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.720
frustrated by this idea of this this model this

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.680
topology which is is trying to be imposed on

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:23.200
something and it doesn't fit and well it seems to me that i've been

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:29.760
i was a computer programmer most of my life and i understand programs that

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:36.080
i understand programs that uh you know possibly predict to like which

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.440
where you're going to put your money you know if you're

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.800
a vase of uh you want to avoid too much risk and something like that you could

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.880
put it but it can't be just it isn't something simple

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.840
it's something very very complex you would have a case's well case

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:58.000
from from this age to this age or this you would have right a

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.040
very complicated program and and the complicated program

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:09.680
would have to follow the analysis and the input from the people who uh

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.640
were actually dealing with something real it's sort of like uh

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:22.480
uh science following observation and then uh people coming up with

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.320
uh this happens this time and this time and this time and then the theories

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.280
are evolve and uh when the after the theories evolve

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.840
something comes up that this that doesn't quite fit in so it's slightly

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:40.400
modified you modified the program slightly to fit it in and to me that's

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:44.800
what science is about it is i i find it very frustrating to think of

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.240
a topology uh that uh that's very vague and i don't know

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:54.400
what any practical use for it and and i don't see how it's going to

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:58.000
work you if you have a programmer programming

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.360
these decision tables interviewing every

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:07.920
uh analysis and you can i could set up a i believe i could set up

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.880
certain questions that therefore a individual patient and every person

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.640
would be different and they would have these different things that they would

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.680
be afraid of and when they wouldn't then you they would become very predictable

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:26.080
if you fit it into a program and then you could would test it to see if

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.000
if it would work and when it didn't work you would have to modify it

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.760
and but i don't understand i a an abstract philosophical

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:43.600
uh topology imposed somewhere or or where it isn't either

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:51.840
influenced by the underlying analysis and or experiments that would say

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:56.800
prove that this analysis of theory was wrong you have to start with the

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.520
observation observation of the rats or

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:07.760
observations of or much more complex observations of human beings by

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:14.320
analysts uh getting uh getting all this data and then you

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:19.600
come up with after the fact with a formula that would work i can't see

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.560
coming out starting with a formula and then

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.120
important from the outside first of all is a fascinating comment

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:33.200
fascinating from your experience to tell us that um but

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:39.120
let's look at the rat okay so the question is

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.040
you want to predict what's going to happen to the rat or he wants to predict

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:46.560
what's going to happen to the rat when he grows up

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.200
so he's not pursuing that i think what he's doing well you want to predict

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:54.160
no what your what what you can keep with the program

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.440
all the same rats when they were growing up

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.120
observe many of them see what happened to the ones who

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.520
be who had this experience and the ones that didn't have that experience

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.440
and then you then you do that after the fact what's your name

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.160
ready ready what the polish is doing is telling you

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.480
what to look at what to look at yeah what's important

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:22.640
okay and if you tell me that is a large philosophical theory that doesn't

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:28.240
matter that's not what the polish is telling you

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.760
what what matters is is the average behavior of the mother

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:36.640
or whether the mother at some point took a deep dive and did something

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.880
that have caused a big impact on the young brain

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.200
what matters more what you do on every day basis with a child

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.400
or what you do what you did once and that's extremely

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.040
so the same thing is through about a computer

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:59.680
programming yes you want to say you want to feed data

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:03.680
and then you want to see if the data is within this neighborhood i know this

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.840
is going to be the result but suppose that you say no what matters is

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.480
what's the minimum of all the numbers you feed and that's going to determine

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.120
whether it's going to go this way or it's going to flip

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.760
and your computer program so the question is what is important

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:23.360
are you testing for the correct thing is that yes

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.080
and therefore that is very crucial it's not

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.120
oh philosophical and that's what we're talking about

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.880
by topology by the way i take the opportunity to say that

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.600
i brought 15 copies of the article the topology of fear

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.840
if you want to read them they would be left i did not read it before so i'm sorry

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.920
no of course not but i mean they're sitting there

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:47.600
so in some sense it's really very fundamental because that's what science

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.520
is looking for patterns but i think like a psychology

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.680
it seems to me that psychologists are doing that they are coming up with

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.880
tests they're coming up with tests that it seems to me that

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.800
that's very anyway i don't i'm not going on

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.600
yeah thank you very thank you and i will read your

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.720
article thank you

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:16.240
why has anybody mentioned uncertainty which seems to me

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.160
uh the fundamental condition of human condition and

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.080
which to link what the psychoanalysts said

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:30.880
with what you were saying you've got your financial decision that

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:37.120
needs to be made and at the same time somebody has

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.440
a desire in both cases what's really an issue

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.880
is the uncertainty of the outcome that comes with our normal day in and day

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.480
out living and decision making we have to make

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:58.880
so that what what we're talking about and it really is the response to threat

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.200
as well because what is the threat we're responding to

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.560
we're responding to the threat of uncertainty because that's the way life

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.400
is we don't know what's happening from one

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.440
one second to the other psychoanalytically if somebody has a strong

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.000
desire it seems to me it's fairly natural to

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.480
also have fear associated with it because it's uncertain we don't know that

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.400
will come out it's not a matter of the

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:39.200
specific desire that we fear it's another aspect of it

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:45.680
that we know the uncertainty that we may encounter in reaching

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.760
in having that desire satisfied but again what

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:54.480
by basic point is what was missing in this whole discussion

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.040
was nobody talking about uncertainty and the fact that

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.160
in each and every case what you're really looking at

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:10.880
is we're here now and we're either perceiving threat perceiving concern

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:15.520
that's the future and that's where the uncertainty comes in

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.280
and let people answer it but we're going to have a round table on uncertainty

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.280
later in the year okay everything we said was about

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.440
uncertainty everything from the from the word go

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.000
when we started saying well you don't know what's going to happen with the

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.800
market conditions are you going to invest to get

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.160
the best possible expected return that's uncertainty

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.360
are you going to be afraid or and focus on the market crash

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:43.600
another form of uncertainty the question is how do you define uncertainty and

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.640
what do you focus on are you focused on on the average

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.480
uncertainty of the weather or are you focused on the maximum and the

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.440
minimum well you see but but this is where i get

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:57.600
my question regarding the the mathematical explanation

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.560
in the uh the topography and again a couple of times you alluded to

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.320
quantum mechanics okay and we know that quantum mechanics

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.560
the uncertainty principle and the idea of what you're trying to do

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.280
is predict probabilities mathematically but when we're talking about

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:20.000
i think the topic of human uncertainty we're talking again to go back to the

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.240
subjective the the individual trying to make their

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.240
own decision and all i can say at that point

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:32.320
i mean it is so much more complicated i think

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.160
than what we've said but you still got a look at it from the standpoint of the

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.760
individual and again each one of us has to face our future and we do it

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.880
every minute of our lives it's too bad Paul is not here

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.720
because that's exactly what he works on the way the brain is a Bayesian

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.960
statistical probability generator and how our decisions are based on these

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:57.760
probability estimates and incidentally what i wanted to talk with him but

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.840
is the Bayesian decisions or the Bayesian updating

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:07.360
which is that you have the belief and then you get a new piece of information

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.920
and you update your belief that's what Bayesian uh theory does

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.360
well how do you update your belief mathematically you updated so that they

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:21.600
know updated distribution that you adopt

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:25.760
uh minimize the errors given what you now know

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.840
and the minimization of error depends on

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.400
the topology do you want to minimize error on the average

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.360
or do you want to minimize the extremal errors it makes a completely

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.560
come a drastic difference to your Bayesian

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.960
optimization whether you want to minimize the worst possible error

01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.800
or the average error so therefore you even then the the issue of the

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.360
the polish that you use makes a big difference and

01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.240
your issues about the animals making decisions like that the frozen animal

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.640
making a decision are getting more information as you just said that's

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.280
making a Bayesian decision it starts sitting there

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.440
frozen and scoping up what is that Bayesian updating

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.640
right well is it scoping up for the average

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.400
of what the predator is going to be or for the worst possible thing that's

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.800
going to happen and is he going to react differently

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.440
and the answer is very differently and that's what the

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.000
topology of fear price of capture sorry so

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.320
let me give you a simple example take physics you drop a ball from a

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:37.760
tall building and you can predict by an equation how long it will take to

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.080
hit the ground however if at the same time you happen to have an earthquake

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.440
which is a rare event you get a different outcome the point of this is

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.040
trying to explain a bit more because i think people are not used to that

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:52.720
it's a very important example so so the point i'm trying to make it

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.080
really really are two complex systems involved here

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.640
there's the reality and then there's the brain and they both have this

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.040
phenomenon that they are capable of all the butterfly effect

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:11.200
of having a discontinuity that is a very small new piece of Bayesian input

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.600
will cause a drastic change in your updating of your information

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.640
so the question i have in the studies in the trying of

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.160
the notable effort and noble effort everybody's trying to do to try to put

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:26.880
this on a scientific basis there's some of the fundamental limitations

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:31.360
that come with it being a complex system and even more

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:34.160
fundamental when you have two interacting complex systems

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.880
that is the brain and the reality it's trying to deal with

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.960
so my question to the panel is how does one

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.400
simultaneously recognize that there's no fixed point here

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.680
that both the decision making apparatus that is perceiving the reality

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.240
has this capacity for a butterfly effect that is to have a discontinuity

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:59.440
and suddenly change its reaction instantaneously for very

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.160
incrementally small new piece of information

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.440
and the reality itself that it's trying to make a decision about

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.600
has that same basic property how does one

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.160
fix it how does one know how when this entangle where that extra little

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:18.320
input came from it was in your case because the person had an experience

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.640
in real life that was a butterfly effect it traumatized them

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:25.440
and it therefore made a fundamental change in how they're going to

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.760
subsequently react or was it something that the reality was

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.800
essentially continuous but something else that as you talk about in the

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.600
background suddenly made a fairly normal thing

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.000
cause a discontinuity in their brain how does one

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.160
disentangle those two things you go on there coupled

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:47.600
you know your question is related to the one before and i think it's about the

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.320
limits of knowledge and factoring the limits of knowledge

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.240
into your expectations and your schemas of analysis your theory of

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:03.520
rationality even to have built into it

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:09.600
that idea of you know an uncertainty factor an accidental factor

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.360
unpredictable factor it's a change in the position of

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:17.760
knowing right so there's one other comment in this it seems to me that

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.400
the thing that i always think about in this context

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.920
is that and i think that's what uh

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:28.480
residuals theory i think is useful in is that

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:32.960
if we walk around with an expectation of a continuous reality

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.760
with a machine that is inherently discontinuous in the way it functions

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:43.520
that will lead to some very incorrect analysis of what is going on how the

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:47.440
system is reacting and the way to compensate for that at

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:50.080
some level is what i call what is called commonly

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:56.080
metacognition that is to acknowledge in a feedback loop to yourself

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.880
that you are dealing with a series of discontinuities

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.240
and have some mechanism both scientifically and personally

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:07.120
in order to process and make your decisions that ask yourself that question

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.240
or is this new piece of information that is causing this discontinuity

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.440
something that i should be analyze and make a fundamental change or not

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:20.960
and therefore be able to somehow compensate for the fact that you know you

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.040
have two interacting circumstances that can expose you to these very rare

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.240
moments that could cause a very significant change in your reality

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:32.800
that's not particularly warranted but there are animals that have been

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:37.120
around since the uh you know earliest times of life on earth

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.160
that are so primitive they can't possibly have metacognition yet they've

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:43.440
adapted to these discontinuities pretty well

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.600
i don't think they have 99.9 percent of the species

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.200
bacteria for example

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.600
yeah because they do something and so they're the lifetime

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.760
so they've adapted to that okay that's not a that's not a mechanism

01:38:57.760 --> 01:39:03.360
available to us and you are 90 bacterial DNA so don't stand there

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:10.080
talk against them okay next question um so i'm a

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.960
trauma psychiatrist that's how i make my living and i did read this paper

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:15.520
years ago and have thought about it for many years because i know graciolan

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.400
have taught this paper and i i sort of the comment i sort of do want to make a

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:21.520
comment follow-up question the comment is i think that this is a ground

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:24.720
breaking paper and the reason i think this is a ground breaking paper

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.240
is because it's very in some ways it has a very similar place in the history of

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.120
this kind of science to the famous paper by

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.760
by backer about rational addiction and what the paper by backer with rational

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.720
addiction did was to move the boundary of what is rational to show that i could

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.520
use purely axiomatic rational modeling to explain addiction

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.880
which broadened the concept of what rationality was

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.880
and shrunk the concept of what irrationally and emotionally driven things

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.080
one that he showed that you could actually mathematically and rationally

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.560
predict even something as unusual as it as addiction and i think graciolas

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:05.040
paper takes that even a step further and expands our notion of what is

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.320
rationality and what we mean by rationality is something to do with

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.800
consistency something to do with compute to

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.160
computability something to do with predictability

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.520
and those notions of rationality so i think it expands the very concept of

01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.760
what we think is rational and what we have to think is and and therefore

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:25.440
there are it's actually less that we have to explain by this vague notion of

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.720
emotional and irrational and i think it really think it does

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.080
an amazing job of that but i think if you want to explain that paper you have to

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.040
sit down with a friend of yours who's a mathematician to read this paper trust

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.640
mail that way thank you

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.080
hi um i've got a quick question about how i raise this up

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.040
about the proximity of fear and desire so it's been suggested that because

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.400
these emotions oftentimes occur together that there might be some

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:54.480
tight-knit relationship between them so they should be close in our topological

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:58.080
map of these emotions but your that's what it is

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.720
your example um of the rat who's hungry for something that's in the same

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.880
area as a threat makes me think that the closeness

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.480
the the frequent reoccurrence of these emotions in tandem

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.640
might say more about the events than the actual proximity of those emotions

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:18.640
every event has multiple components some of which are good and some of which

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.640
are bad and it has multiple potential components some of which are good and

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.680
some of which are bad so you have different reward circuitry and

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.760
different fear circuitry and they might be activated at the same time

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.560
for the same event simply because there are different components to these

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:36.640
events if my fiance invites me to go to dinner with her parents i'm

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.640
afraid to act like an idiot and i'm also excited

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.400
so i just don't think that should inform our topology

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.360
of these emotions it might be the case that different events

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:50.480
can excite both of these emotions and i was wondering

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:56.640
you agree disagree well in order to answer that uh we would have to get into

01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.640
the notion of desire and what i mean by that or what is meant by that in psycho

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:05.200
analysis that there is a logical connection

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:11.440
between fear and desire not a contingent connection so what is it

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.720
uh it has to this will take a lot longer than

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.720
than we can get into but it has to do with

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:25.280
um the uh how can i do it quickly it has to do with

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:34.880
the experience of satisfaction of a wish and the complex symbolic

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.320
meanings of that satisfaction there are fantasies

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:46.720
that accompany the satisfaction of a wish and those fantasies involve

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:52.640
ideas that are forbidden why as i said it's going to take a

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.640
long time to answer this question what what it touches on is the

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.920
i just it is it's it's the notion of repression

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.440
in a psychoanalytic sense the psychoanalytic notion of repression

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.800
that something occurs that makes desire

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.880
linked in some way to the forbidden and it's the linking to the forbidden

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:20.880
that constitutes the threat i guess i i guess constitutes the source of the

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:24.480
threat so it's not contingent joe's example was about a contingent

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:28.400
connection which can also exist but also i mean

01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:33.360
anything that you desire is potentially threatening for its loss

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:36.480
so i mean threat comes with almost everything in life

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.840
you know and that's the the most fundamental thing of staying alive is

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:46.240
warding off the threats and the opportunity to acquire something useful

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.640
uh will usually cost you something there will be some threats involved

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:54.480
that you have to overcome to get it but also then you have to face the

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.320
uh the threats that come from maintaining hanging on to it

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.240
but it's love or anything else i i would agree that it's about the

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.560
the centrality of loss i'm wondering but what is there oh i'm sorry

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.800
just to just to comment on your example of the fiancé

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.240
there it's not a given that you should be afraid because you're going to meet

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:26.320
your fiancé's parents it is then you need to see him

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:30.720
i guess i'm wondering if you could consider even the psychoanalytic

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:35.680
desire for mastery just to simplify the discussion might you consider that

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:39.440
a component of that same stimulus the event that you fear

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.880
and the desire for mastery of that fear couldn't that be considered

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:48.480
a component and then you can avoid the difficulty of letting that influence

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:52.320
your topological map that way

01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:03.680
um so i guess what your question is is could there be

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:09.120
a more sort of Euclidean or linear explanation

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:16.080
of how it is that threat and desire link up i i guess ultimately i'm thinking

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.080
it would be a mistake to conflate the events that trigger certain desires

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.640
and those desires or emotions generally in themselves so ultimately we're just

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.240
dealing with different systems and i guess i i kind of agreed with your

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.080
point uh what what is the top topological map telling us i

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:35.120
understand its utility and driving research questions

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.600
but does it really tell us anything about

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.880
the act does it have any predictive value yes

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:46.080
and that's my point that's the point if you didn't forget it

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.960
who cares thank you okay thank you question thank you

01:45:50.960 --> 01:46:10.160
so we will end here
