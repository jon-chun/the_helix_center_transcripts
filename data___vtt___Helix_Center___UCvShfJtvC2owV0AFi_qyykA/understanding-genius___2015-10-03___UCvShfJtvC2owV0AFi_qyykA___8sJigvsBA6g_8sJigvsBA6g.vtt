02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
Davis.

02:38.040 --> 02:45.040
Unfortunately, Joanne Ruth Sats from Ohio State, who was scheduled to be here, was unable

02:45.040 --> 02:50.760
to join us because of the inclement weather which canceled her flight.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.040
So we'll begin now.

02:52.040 --> 03:00.040
How do we begin?

03:00.040 --> 03:06.480
Genius just emerged just like that.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.760
Well, that is a long-running theory that genius is spontaneous.

03:11.760 --> 03:17.440
And I think that researchers here would probably argue that's not the case, that genius often

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
takes a lot of work.

03:18.440 --> 03:23.220
That Edison, when he said that genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent imping

03:23.220 --> 03:27.120
inspiration was more on to truth.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.200
And yet it's interesting that we seem to like that idea, the idea of the apple falling

03:32.200 --> 03:36.800
and Newton just discovering the law of gravity like that even though we know he worked 18

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
hour a day.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.440
In fact, when Newton was asked, how do you come up with all these great ideas?

03:42.440 --> 03:45.760
He just says, I ponder a lot.

03:45.760 --> 03:51.040
And it's not just the amount of work they put in, thinking over and over and over again

03:51.040 --> 03:58.640
about whatever obsesses them, but they make a tremendous amount of mistakes along the

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
way.

03:59.640 --> 04:05.800
You know, there's all these fault starts because a lot of times you don't see it because either

04:05.800 --> 04:12.800
it's not published or if it's art, it ends up in the basement in storage or some of the

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
kind of things.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
So it's filtered.

04:14.800 --> 04:21.720
But even in Albert Einstein, who's like a prototype, all these horrendous errors, particularly

04:21.720 --> 04:24.560
in developing this unified, yeah, unified field theory.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.960
There was a good book that was out a couple of years ago called Einstein's Mistakes.

04:28.960 --> 04:36.880
And it's about just this, the creative errors that one makes on the way to truth.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
And you have to do it.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.080
And he even justified it.

04:40.080 --> 04:46.240
He says mistakes and signs are okay as long as they're big enough.

04:46.240 --> 04:52.840
I'll tell your students that.

04:52.840 --> 05:00.520
I think it's worth clarifying that humans like narrative and simple stories.

05:00.520 --> 05:05.280
And so often we attach achievement or results to an individual when in fact there are quite

05:05.280 --> 05:06.600
a few people who contributed.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.000
So it's, I think that is not to say that I don't believe that there are geniuses in

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
the world.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
There certainly are.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.800
But the true story is almost undoubtedly more complicated than the one that we're familiar

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
with.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.800
All right.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.240
And it's even true for someone like Albert Einstein.

05:20.240 --> 05:25.760
At the very beginning, when he was a nobody, he used his first wife as kind of a sounding

05:25.760 --> 05:27.920
board for a lot of his ideas.

05:27.920 --> 05:32.440
And some people even say that she probably contributed more in particular to special

05:32.440 --> 05:35.360
theory relativity than she got credit for.

05:35.360 --> 05:40.400
They made a deal when they got divorced that he would get the award and she would get the

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
money.

05:41.400 --> 05:50.200
And a lot of people realize that later on, he's like, oh, I'm sorry.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.880
He got in over his head mathematically.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.360
And so had to take on mathematical collaborators, he wouldn't have been able to develop his

05:56.360 --> 05:58.520
later theories.

05:58.520 --> 06:05.520
And later on when he was working on his general relativity, he got into a kind of a contest

06:05.520 --> 06:09.240
with an distinguished mathematician, Pong Karate.

06:09.240 --> 06:15.120
And it was really kind of close for a while because he didn't have the mathematical ability

06:15.120 --> 06:17.280
to do what he needed to do.

06:17.280 --> 06:26.020
And something we said about the differentiation between collaboration and inspiration and

06:26.020 --> 06:33.880
and the subsequent aspiration of I'm thinking of, you know, fifth century Athens or Elizabethan

06:33.880 --> 06:43.440
England, or Renaissance Florence where it didn't necessarily have, I mean, there were some

06:43.440 --> 06:47.240
collaborations but the emergence of these geniuses on multiple fronts.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.120
that there's something also about the inspiration?

06:50.120 --> 06:53.040
I think there are special moments in history

06:53.040 --> 06:58.120
where either the cultural background is particularly conducive

06:58.120 --> 07:01.160
to some kind of breakthrough, or in the case of science,

07:01.160 --> 07:03.280
what is often the case is you have theoreticians

07:03.280 --> 07:06.560
who have ideas, but the experimental technology is not there

07:06.560 --> 07:08.200
to test those ideas.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.720
So for example, today we have a lot of people working

07:10.720 --> 07:12.840
on things like string theory, which are,

07:12.840 --> 07:16.040
to this moment, actually completely untested by experiment.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.520
And it may turn out when we look back 1,000 years from now,

07:19.520 --> 07:21.280
we may say, hey, these guys were geniuses,

07:21.280 --> 07:23.680
and they developed a full theory of quantum gravity

07:23.680 --> 07:25.600
with no experimental input.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.520
Or it might be 1,000 years from now, people look back

07:27.520 --> 07:30.880
and have completely forgotten about string theory.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.160
Einstein was lucky because his theories were tested very soon

07:34.160 --> 07:35.440
after he made them.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.600
And they were both conceptually deep and broad breakthroughs,

07:39.600 --> 07:43.000
but they were also verified as true very soon afterward.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.440
And that's why he has become such a singular history,

07:45.440 --> 07:48.120
a singular figure in the history of genius.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.320
They were verified and publicized too,

07:50.320 --> 07:51.720
and I think that's critical.

07:51.720 --> 07:59.480
It's in 1917, 12 years after the Anis Morabulous of 1905.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.480
Right, Stissen.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.000
Why are there five of us?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.400
It seems to me as we go down.

08:07.840 --> 08:08.840
All right.

08:08.840 --> 08:09.840
Man.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.840
Thank you.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.440
And the voice.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.920
OK.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.360
It's 12 years after he's done his major work,

08:16.360 --> 08:20.560
and yet it's publicly announced and verified.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.440
And it's then in 1917 when he becomes this kind of world

08:24.440 --> 08:27.960
saint, really, all over the world.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.480
And he's the only genius that we really have access

08:30.480 --> 08:31.160
to his brain.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.280
So that's not true.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.480
Well, we start harvesting brains in the 19th century,

08:37.480 --> 08:40.440
and there are all kinds of bits and pieces of geniuses.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.680
It's been bones and even a penises.

08:42.680 --> 08:47.280
It's been studied very deliberately, I guess.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.240
So we've had bits and pieces of Einstein's brain,

08:49.240 --> 08:51.360
and people are very fascinated with it.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.440
We have Lenin's brain, and other brains as well.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.760
But it's been studied and made slowly accessible.

08:56.760 --> 09:00.320
And people are fascinated by this brain.

09:00.320 --> 09:06.360
What is in this head that makes this individual so remarkable?

09:06.360 --> 09:08.480
And I was talking with a friend earlier,

09:08.480 --> 09:10.880
when they looked into his brain, it

09:10.880 --> 09:13.840
was rather unremarkable when they first looked at it.

09:13.840 --> 09:18.280
It was somewhat smaller than the average human brain

09:18.280 --> 09:21.240
even for a person his age until people started

09:21.240 --> 09:25.800
remarking on it and finding these unusual bits and pieces

09:25.800 --> 09:28.200
that were a bit different than other brains.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.400
I would have had lateral, exceptional lateral connectivity

09:31.400 --> 09:35.120
between left and right, or is that just, is that apocryphal?

09:35.120 --> 09:36.160
It's a bit apocryphal.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.400
I mean, they have one of the first studies

09:38.400 --> 09:42.800
they looked at his angular gyrus.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.760
And they started looking at the number of glial cells

09:45.760 --> 09:48.440
versus neurons in his angular gyrus.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.200
And Widdlson, I believe, found that there

09:51.200 --> 09:54.320
hired glial ratio to neuron ratio.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.520
They had a bit of his frontal lobe, his brain,

09:56.520 --> 09:57.800
I don't know if people know this,

09:57.800 --> 10:00.880
but his brain was cut up into little cubes.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.640
Soon after his death, he died of aortyl aneurysm.

10:04.640 --> 10:10.040
So his brain was relatively preserved from his untimely death

10:10.040 --> 10:13.280
and cut up his brain in little cubes and sent them around.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.920
He had a piece of his frontal cortex

10:14.920 --> 10:16.840
and a piece of his parietal cortex.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.960
And they took a look at it and they

10:17.960 --> 10:20.240
found that his frontal cortex wasn't particularly

10:20.240 --> 10:22.520
unusual in terms of neural-to-wheel ratio,

10:22.520 --> 10:26.920
but part of his angular gyrus was unusual.

10:26.920 --> 10:31.360
Parts of his corpus callosum are unusual in terms

10:31.360 --> 10:32.200
of its connectivity.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.520
People have looked at that.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.440
His motor cortex has a knob on it,

10:36.440 --> 10:41.320
which they have hypothesized is involved with his violin

10:41.320 --> 10:42.440
playing.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.160
But does this have anything to do with genius at all?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.000
You know, it's worth, I always like to point out

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
that Einstein left explicit instructions in his will

10:52.000 --> 10:55.880
that in no part of his body would be left behind.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.640
And so it was taken without knowledge of that will,

10:57.640 --> 11:01.400
but against his will, by this a very amusing man who

11:01.400 --> 11:03.640
kept the brain in a beer cooler for a while and drove it

11:03.640 --> 11:07.120
in the back of his Pontiac around the country.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.200
But that kind of fascination with the body parts of genius

11:10.200 --> 11:11.840
actually has a long history, as I say.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.400
Or other saints for that matter, as you indicate.

11:14.400 --> 11:14.920
Exactly.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
And that in itself says something interesting

11:16.920 --> 11:20.880
that we want to put our fingers on the genius part.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.200
And frankly, I think it's a little silly.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.000
I mean, I don't know about the brain science here,

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
but my understanding is that the effort

11:30.000 --> 11:34.480
to locate Einstein's genius in his brain is kind of just silly.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.000
Sometimes you end up with this thing

11:37.000 --> 11:38.920
like happened with the phrenologists.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.960
Because they were the, some people even say

11:40.960 --> 11:44.800
that modern cognitive science is the neo-phrenology.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.840
You're trying to find where and the brain genius is located

11:47.840 --> 11:49.560
or inside of the book or whatever.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.320
And way back in the early day of the phrenology,

11:52.320 --> 11:53.360
they analyzed it.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.840
Did Saint kind of postmortem.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.280
OK.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.000
Only it was easier.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
He didn't have to have the brain tissue.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
He just had to have the skull and the uro.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.280
And this guy, I forget who it was,

12:03.280 --> 12:05.120
the early phrenologists pointed out,

12:05.120 --> 12:06.080
it might actually think all.

12:06.080 --> 12:06.840
I don't know.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.080
Pointed out that the area of the cranium

12:11.080 --> 12:15.240
that is responsible for mathematical ability

12:15.240 --> 12:20.000
in Descartes was actually depressed instead of bumped out.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.520
And so they argued on the base of that negative evidence

12:23.520 --> 12:26.040
that his mathematical ability must be tremendously

12:26.040 --> 12:26.800
overestimated.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.880
It's not clear that what purports to be Descartes skull

12:30.880 --> 12:32.880
is even his skull that's returned to France

12:32.880 --> 12:34.600
and different privileges.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.720
So there is this fascination of trying to understand.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.520
I mean, so your intelligence, your creativity,

12:41.520 --> 12:44.800
all of these things arise in your brain, at least in part.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.240
So trying to understand the complexity

12:47.240 --> 12:49.280
of that relationship between brain and behavior

12:49.280 --> 12:51.040
is certainly a worthy endeavor.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.680
But looking at the corpus callosum or the motor strip

12:54.680 --> 12:57.720
or the angular gyrus is going to be fraught

12:57.720 --> 13:02.360
with a phrenological types of underpinnings.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.720
You're not talking at all about IQ.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.640
So you are separating genius from IQ?

13:10.640 --> 13:12.000
We could talk about IQ.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Yeah.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.720
Well, no, I just, I mean, one more

13:15.720 --> 13:17.720
that thought you would say, well, somebody

13:17.720 --> 13:21.240
who has an IQ of 100 and something or other

13:21.240 --> 13:22.600
is considered the genius.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.160
But you're not going there at all.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.160
I'll talk about that.

13:25.160 --> 13:25.660
Yeah.

13:25.660 --> 13:26.360
We can all do it.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.360
We can all do it.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.360
What?

13:28.360 --> 13:29.360
You might go, you might.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.360
I suspect we're using the term to mean someone who

13:32.360 --> 13:34.080
has achieved something great.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.640
And so there are many people who have high IQs who do not

13:36.640 --> 13:37.960
achieve great things.

13:37.960 --> 13:40.240
However, the probability that someone

13:40.240 --> 13:41.560
will achieve something great, I think,

13:41.560 --> 13:43.760
is monotonically increasing with IQ.

13:43.760 --> 13:49.080
And if you test eminent scientists, randomly selected

13:49.080 --> 13:50.640
eminent scientists, you will find that they

13:50.640 --> 13:52.240
tend to have very high IQs.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.760
But of course, nothing in human life is deterministic.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.040
So there are plenty of people who are seven feet tall

13:57.040 --> 13:58.640
and are not going to play in the NBA.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.880
But the fraction of seven footers in the US

14:01.880 --> 14:05.160
who play in the NBA is exceptionally high.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.520
I just say one thing.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.600
I teach the history of psychology,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.280
and I have a little section on this.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.720
It's really kind of upsetting to me

14:12.720 --> 14:15.280
what happened to the term genius.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.440
I mean, it was originally designed

14:17.440 --> 14:20.440
to refer to outstanding achievement.

14:20.440 --> 14:22.920
And then there was this guy at Stanford University

14:22.920 --> 14:26.960
named Lewis M. Turner, who decided

14:26.960 --> 14:31.320
he was going to do this massive longitudinal study of high IQ

14:31.320 --> 14:31.800
kids.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.120
That's obviously these kids were little kids, boys and girls.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.680
So you can't talk about outstanding achievement.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.200
And follow him all the way through adulthood.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.760
And he called this genetic studies of genius.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.920
Genic by weight can also mean developmental, not a study.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.440
You know, heredity.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.560
And termites.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.480
What?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.480
It's termites.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.000
It's termite.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.160
Yeah, it's termite.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.280
And the thing is, is that he had

14:53.280 --> 14:57.200
to pick an arbitrary selection criteria.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.640
So he picked 140.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.920
And if you look at a lot of dictionaries,

15:01.920 --> 15:03.960
like the Barrican Heritage Dictionary,

15:03.960 --> 15:06.880
they say a genius of someone who has an IQ of 140 or above.

15:06.880 --> 15:10.000
That was a totally arbitrary decision.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.960
It could have been 136 or 152 at 0.1.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.600
And in fact, none of the kids who

15:16.600 --> 15:19.800
passed the threshold of 141, the Nobel Prize,

15:19.800 --> 15:22.360
there were two physicists who just missed qualifying

15:22.360 --> 15:26.200
Shockley and Lewis Alvarez, who did win the Nobel Prize.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.760
Now, there's some claim that the test that was used

15:28.760 --> 15:30.240
was primarily verbally loaded.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.160
And these two were much stronger mathematically.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.400
And probably would have qualified had

15:33.400 --> 15:35.920
to use a slightly different kind of IQ test.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.720
But so a lot of people will use the fact

15:37.720 --> 15:39.960
that none of the termites won the Nobel Prize

15:39.960 --> 15:42.840
as evidence that IQ has nothing to do with achievement.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.320
But that is completely wrong, actually.

15:46.320 --> 15:52.000
It's also interesting that two of the termites grew up

15:52.000 --> 15:55.680
and ended up being professors at Stanford University.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.920
And they took over this longitudinal study

15:57.920 --> 16:00.040
that was still continuing.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.280
So they became subjects in their own.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.480
It reflects full interpretation.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.680
And Terman's study, I mean, it was incredibly flawed.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.600
He got involved with the two.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.200
He wrote letters for them.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.320
Yeah, he wrote letters of recommendation for them.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.640
So I mean, it was a horribly flawed study

16:18.640 --> 16:20.880
from that perspective as well.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.120
There's incredibly biased, experimental bias.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.960
There's a more modern variance of the Terman's study,

16:25.960 --> 16:27.920
which is still ongoing, called, there's

16:27.920 --> 16:31.360
two variants of it, SMPY and SVPY,

16:31.360 --> 16:35.000
study of mathematically or verbally precocious youth.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.520
And probably some of the children of people

16:37.520 --> 16:38.600
in this room are in the study.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.960
But if you score above a certain level by the age of 13,

16:41.960 --> 16:43.560
you're admitted to this study.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.160
And the oldest people in the study now,

16:45.160 --> 16:46.960
I think, are in their 50s.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.440
And so you can ask, well, as the IQ gets higher and higher,

16:50.440 --> 16:53.200
does the probability of some level of achievement increase?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.800
And so you can, for example, show

16:54.800 --> 16:58.880
that someone who's at the 1 in 10,000 level of ability

16:58.880 --> 17:03.440
is many times more likely to have a patent at age of 45

17:03.440 --> 17:05.920
than someone who was only in the top 1%.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.440
So there's no diminishing returns to intelligence,

17:09.440 --> 17:13.280
even as you get to the 1 in 10,000 level of ability.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.000
Probability being tenured at a major research university,

17:16.000 --> 17:17.440
also monotonically increasing.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.120
So even within what we would consider already very high

17:20.120 --> 17:24.720
scores, top 1%, as you go from top 1% to top 1 in 10,000,

17:24.720 --> 17:27.120
there are significant differences in those populations.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.800
And the major thing about that study,

17:28.800 --> 17:31.520
unlike what happened in the terming one,

17:31.520 --> 17:36.400
is they actually got people who we would consider geniuses.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.040
For example, they have field's medalists.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.560
I don't think they have medalists.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.640
Terence Tau is in it.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.040
Yeah, good example of that.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.800
Absolutely outstanding.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.160
And also interesting, because one of the issues

17:47.160 --> 17:49.120
that sometimes arises when you talk about geniuses,

17:49.120 --> 17:53.440
mad geniuses, and Terence Tau is just totally normal guy.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.400
Well, if you met Terence, you would say he clearly is not

17:56.400 --> 18:00.000
a, he's a little bit on the aspect of his side.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.040
But for someone that smart, he is very normal.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.120
Yeah, I would put it that way.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
I should have called about it.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
Yeah.

18:05.120 --> 18:12.560
You know, you said we're talking about Q,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.600
but just to link up what we were talking about earlier,

18:14.600 --> 18:17.600
brain studies, cranial studies, IQ.

18:17.600 --> 18:23.760
When the IQ exam is developed in the 1890s in France by a man

18:23.760 --> 18:25.480
by the name of Paul B. A.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.560
And it's Lewis Turman, who takes that research

18:29.560 --> 18:31.640
and sort of instrumentalizes it.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.080
B. A was actually a very interested in cranial studies

18:34.080 --> 18:35.280
as well.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.480
And I see that IQ exam is kind of growing out

18:37.480 --> 18:42.560
of this long 90th century attempt to locate genius.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.920
And some of that research, I think, should give us real pause.

18:45.920 --> 18:50.040
It's not coincidental that Turman was an anti-Semite

18:50.040 --> 18:55.800
that he had unsaved reviews about race.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.000
He was an acolyte of Francis Galton,

18:59.000 --> 19:04.160
who was an important scientist, the nephew of Charles Darwin.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.400
His first book is entitled, Hereditary Genius,

19:06.400 --> 19:08.320
and who's very interested in how to identify genius

19:08.320 --> 19:11.680
in population pools, but who's also the father of eugenics

19:11.680 --> 19:13.120
as people in the room will know.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.880
So it's sort of just worth pointing out

19:15.880 --> 19:17.840
those connections, those long-fhelial connections.

19:17.840 --> 19:22.360
That's not to cast IQ out of the discussion by any means,

19:22.360 --> 19:24.880
but there's a dark history there, too.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.880
Yeah.

19:25.880 --> 19:26.200
Yeah.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.840
And even manifest in the Turman's study,

19:29.840 --> 19:32.240
because you mentioned Shockley.

19:32.240 --> 19:36.280
He really resented that he didn't have an IQ higher now.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.640
He spent the rest of his life resenting it.

19:39.640 --> 19:44.760
And basically stealing the transistor idea for some colleagues.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.920
I mean, I'm not sure he stole it, but he took more credit

19:48.920 --> 19:50.120
than with his teacher.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.480
But he got one up in the end, because he contributed

19:52.480 --> 19:54.640
to sperm to the Nobel Prize sperm bank.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.840
Right, right.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.360
Right.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.680
He'll have more more to say later.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.160
And he ended up doing in line with the tradition,

20:02.160 --> 20:05.720
going back to Galton, started arguing about superior

20:05.720 --> 20:07.720
and inferior races as well.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.240
Yeah.

20:08.240 --> 20:12.240
But I would say to some extent, we live in Galton and Turman's

20:12.240 --> 20:14.400
world today, even though we don't think about it anymore.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.000
So long ago, we would not have thought

20:17.000 --> 20:19.640
that we could use standardized tests to filter talent

20:19.640 --> 20:23.600
or to allow access to valuable educational resources.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.680
But this is exactly what we do in our society.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.040
So if you want to get into MIT, you

20:28.040 --> 20:30.280
have to do quite well in the standardized test,

20:30.280 --> 20:31.880
which are essentially IQ tests.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.200
And so American society is quite ordered, in some sense,

20:36.200 --> 20:38.440
along achievement lines on these exams.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.560
And if you go to places like Japan or China

20:40.560 --> 20:44.520
where admission to college is based on a single exam,

20:44.520 --> 20:46.720
again, you have a society that's actually filtering based

20:46.720 --> 20:49.360
on brain power and then allowing those people who

20:49.360 --> 20:53.000
have, above average, ability more access

20:53.000 --> 20:54.080
to educational resources.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.680
It's going to lead us meritocracy.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.680
Well, yeah.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.200
And it is interesting that the United States adopted

21:04.200 --> 21:08.280
use of these kind of standardized exams very quickly

21:08.280 --> 21:12.520
and took to it much more aggressively than other countries.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.960
In the front of Europe, say, that's

21:13.960 --> 21:15.440
something that American society has to say,

21:15.440 --> 21:16.680
a kind of elitist meritocracy.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.680
I don't disagree with you.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.600
But if you look at how admission to a cold normal superior

21:20.600 --> 21:23.440
or a cold polytechnic in France, it's even more elitist

21:23.440 --> 21:24.040
than what we have here.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.360
It's much more elitist.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.640
It's much more elitist.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.520
So in fact, it's not fair to tar Americans only

21:29.520 --> 21:30.240
with this brush.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.280
In Japan and China and Korea, same thing.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.880
There is a Gao Kao or high exam that you take when you leave

21:35.880 --> 21:36.400
high school.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.560
And if you do well in it, you go to Beijing University.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.560
And if you don't, then.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.520
Well, China has had the civil service.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.560
1,000 years, 1,000 years.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.640
I'm talking about the type of exam.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.200
I mean, to get into the cold normal superior,

21:48.200 --> 21:51.400
you do the cany and you do a whole set of exams.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.240
It's not an exam that like IQ at all.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.600
It's based on content.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.120
All right.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.080
And that's a different method.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.040
And there's another interesting thing that happened to IQ

22:01.040 --> 22:03.560
is that the original conception of intelligence

22:03.560 --> 22:07.200
when Benet was working on it was actually much broader.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.640
He was looking at mental retardation.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.560
Yeah, exactly.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.200
He actually started looking at the lower end for special education.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.200
He was interested in artificial education.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.080
And also, the items were much broader.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.760
He was just looking at what are the kind of things

22:19.760 --> 22:22.920
that kids are able to do as they mature intellectually.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.720
And so I'm hoping who might need additional help

22:25.720 --> 22:27.560
to succeed in an educational environment.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.360
And then it got kind of inverted.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.720
It was actually term inverted because he went from studying

22:31.720 --> 22:36.000
people who were on a lower end to people on the upper end.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.720
And part of that also was narrowed

22:38.720 --> 22:42.920
because of the emphasis on increased reliability of the test.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.440
So what you do is to increase the reliability,

22:45.440 --> 22:48.120
you have to throw out the items to have lower correlations

22:48.120 --> 22:49.360
with the overall score.

22:49.360 --> 22:49.880
And guess what?

22:49.880 --> 22:51.440
When you throw out those items, they

22:51.440 --> 22:53.400
have to do with things like creativity

22:53.400 --> 22:55.800
and moral decision making or things that

22:55.800 --> 22:57.440
aren't part of intelligence, obviously.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.160
I think that's a very important point.

22:59.160 --> 23:01.800
So when you're measuring analytic ability

23:01.800 --> 23:05.600
or some kind of very well-defined intelligence,

23:05.600 --> 23:08.960
then it can roughly, crudely, be measured by these IQ tests.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.480
Things like creativity, ability to work well with other people,

23:12.480 --> 23:14.320
ability to inspire other people.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.600
Those have never been things that we've

23:15.600 --> 23:18.680
been able to measure to operationalize in a reliable way

23:18.680 --> 23:19.200
in tests.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.960
And therefore, they get de-emphasized in ours.

23:20.960 --> 23:21.480
I always disagree.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.160
So they're getting better with measures of creativity,

23:25.160 --> 23:28.840
creative achievement questionnaires, reliable and validated

23:28.840 --> 23:31.680
measure, and personality is getting much, much better

23:31.680 --> 23:33.920
at measuring particular personality variables.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.960
So IQ is the gold standard that they can measure better

23:37.960 --> 23:40.720
than height in the doctor's office, believe it or not.

23:40.720 --> 23:46.400
But it is an incredibly reliable and validated standard

23:46.400 --> 23:49.040
to shoot for, but creativity measures and personality

23:49.040 --> 23:49.800
measures are getting better.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.040
The problem with personality, so it

23:52.040 --> 23:54.160
is very difficult to cheat on an IQ test.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.280
Because to cheat, you'd have to be smart.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.280
But you can cheat on a personality test.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.320
Because I can imagine my sociopathic friend

24:01.320 --> 24:03.400
and say, I'll answer the way he would answer.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.160
I'll answer it right.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.360
I'll answer it pro-social ways so that I can get this job.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.000
So that's the problem with personality tests.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.240
Although I agree, they do have validity and reliability

24:13.240 --> 24:13.520
as well.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.520
If I can tell you how to cheat right now,

24:15.520 --> 24:19.560
the personality variable that correlates most strongly

24:19.560 --> 24:22.320
with creativity in a wide range of areas

24:22.320 --> 24:24.040
is the openness to experience.

24:24.040 --> 24:27.480
OK, so you already know how to answer all the questions.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.080
That's the time to ask you.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.720
Are you interested in trying to see

24:31.720 --> 24:34.440
all these people in this room are open to new experience,

24:34.440 --> 24:37.680
because they're here by definition.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.480
Guaranteed.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.440
Yeah, I want to go to poetry readings.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.920
Do I want to go see art?

24:42.920 --> 24:45.040
Do I want to try new food?

24:45.040 --> 24:46.360
That's the openness to experience.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.200
And yeah, it's easy to cheat on.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.760
But dig this, reinforce on it.

24:51.760 --> 24:55.040
IQ is a goal standard that I think will never be met,

24:55.040 --> 24:58.200
because it has been homogenized into what is measured.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.640
And it's interesting how a gardener came up with it.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.000
Well, initially, seven intelligence,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.080
but he's added some additional ones.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.640
And he's sometimes been criticized,

25:06.640 --> 25:09.680
because he says some of those intelligences

25:09.680 --> 25:12.800
don't really have measures for them.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.920
It's because they're creativity and personality.

25:14.920 --> 25:18.120
Yeah, like interpersonal intelligence.

25:18.120 --> 25:22.200
Intrapersonal intelligence.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.800
What's it, the somatic?

25:23.800 --> 25:24.320
Kneesthetic.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.200
Kneesthetic intelligence.

25:26.200 --> 25:26.760
Right.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.800
And they can't do it.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.200
Have something to do a layup and then give them a score.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.800
I mean, there's no.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.400
So is that really a criticism?

25:34.400 --> 25:37.880
But I think the criticism of gardener

25:37.880 --> 25:40.400
is usually not that his constructs exist.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.480
People agree that his constructs exist.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.120
The question is, can you operationalize it?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.640
Can you actually measure it in a reliable way?

25:45.640 --> 25:47.840
And on that question, the answer is no.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.840
You can't.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.320
And that's why you ended up going from kind of looking

25:51.320 --> 25:55.320
at it in the general population to focusing on genius.

25:55.320 --> 25:55.800
Yes.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.880
I create a achievement in creating minds.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.520
And then there's no question.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.240
So you started out with the question about intelligence

26:03.240 --> 26:03.720
and genius.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.600
But do you think creativity and personality

26:05.600 --> 26:09.320
variables are critical to the manifestation of genius?

26:09.320 --> 26:10.600
Well, yeah, that's the whole point.

26:10.600 --> 26:14.160
It's to me, it's not a single dimension.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.640
We can talk about g, you know, intelligence.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.520
It's been well demonstrated.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.960
It's very hard to get rid of it.

26:20.960 --> 26:24.320
So intelligence is likely necessary, but not

26:24.320 --> 26:26.760
sufficient to achieve genius.

26:26.760 --> 26:27.240
Yes.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.920
And that's why you talk about, yes.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.040
You have a monotonic line.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.800
But it's huge scatter right now.

26:32.800 --> 26:33.360
Exactly.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.960
These are all noisy predictors.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.880
And the reasoning why they're scattered

26:36.880 --> 26:38.960
is this person has a high openness experience.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.720
And this person has low openness experience.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.600
The person who has a highest recorded IQ,

26:44.600 --> 26:48.920
she took the Stanford Bine, when she was a little girl,

26:48.920 --> 26:50.480
and got her perfect score.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.400
She writes Marilyn Vosseva.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.800
Yeah, Marilyn Vosseva.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.920
Sure, it's an advice call.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.360
I mean, 226 is a really good IQ.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.000
No, no, no.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.360
She has book of records.

27:02.360 --> 27:03.920
But what is she doing?

27:03.920 --> 27:05.480
I hope she's not here.

27:05.480 --> 27:10.240
But it's a really good achievement

27:10.240 --> 27:11.360
that she's doing very well.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.440
She's drawing a column for a Sunday supplement.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.400
In which people ask dumb questions,

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
that she answers.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.600
That she answers.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.160
I mean, a lot of them are really dumb.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.200
Like, why in winter should you wear dark clothing?

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
Yeah.

27:25.200 --> 27:25.720
Yeah.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.680
Yeah.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.160
And she gives a very interesting number.

27:29.160 --> 27:30.000
That's not a dumb question.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
You look up by googling.

27:34.440 --> 27:39.600
So to me, she's sort of the prime example of having

27:39.600 --> 27:40.880
supreme IQ.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.160
She's basically a specialist in taking IQ tests.

27:43.160 --> 27:43.640
Sure.

27:43.640 --> 27:46.720
She's taking every IQ test you can possibly imagine,

27:46.720 --> 27:47.680
including one further.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.400
There's one for the four Sigma society.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.080
That's four standard deviations above of me.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.960
And I've seen some of the questions.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.440
And I'll admit it.

27:56.440 --> 28:00.280
I couldn't understand what they were asking.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.160
Dean, don't feel bad.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.600
I don't even look at those questions.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.960
I know.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.720
You know, it's like, maybe that's the test.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.720
Are you smart enough to realize these questions don't

28:09.720 --> 28:13.120
actually ask any way?

28:13.120 --> 28:16.880
These questions are nonsense.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.120
So genius requires intelligence, but then there's

28:19.120 --> 28:19.960
something else.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.480
Yes.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.440
And there's a secret sauce.

28:21.440 --> 28:21.440
Right.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.960
They be sort of X factor.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.200
And that's Cicero called it the quidum de winum, the kind

28:26.200 --> 28:29.240
of divine something that somebody like Socrates had.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.480
Socrates thought he had a dimonion, a little sort of

28:32.480 --> 28:34.920
spirit that followed him around and whispered in his ears.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.920
In fact, that's the Greek term dimonion, the dominion of

28:37.920 --> 28:40.360
diamond, gives us our word demon.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.040
But in Latin, that's called agenius, which is just

28:43.040 --> 28:43.920
like the word genius.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.680
And originally the idea was that that

28:46.680 --> 28:51.640
extra something was breathed into you by a god or a muse, or

28:51.640 --> 28:53.040
implanted in you by the gods.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.120
But it was a divine special something that ordinary

28:56.120 --> 28:57.080
human beings didn't have.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.640
Are you saying that's a genetically induced?

28:59.640 --> 29:01.120
What?

29:01.120 --> 29:03.640
I'm not saying anything about genetics.

29:03.640 --> 29:07.080
So we mentioned fascination with measuring the brains of

29:07.080 --> 29:08.120
these deceased geniuses.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.840
Well, I think the next step, which will be realized as

29:10.840 --> 29:13.000
technology improves, is of course measuring the genome.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.000
It's happening as we speak.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.800
So I just hosted a meeting of the International Society for

29:19.800 --> 29:21.360
Intelligence Research in Robert Ploeman.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.480
Yes, that's Robert Ploeman.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.600
Yes.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.960
Did you go to James Lee's talk?

29:24.960 --> 29:25.520
I did.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.320
Yeah, very, very impressive talk.

29:27.320 --> 29:32.560
And so they're searching for the genes of genius, or high

29:32.560 --> 29:36.160
intelligence anyway, and having a hell of a time finding

29:36.160 --> 29:36.680
them.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.080
A lot of them, right?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.520
Well, yeah.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.560
A lot of them in multiplying dramatically.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.560
So Robert Ploeman has made his life mission finding this

29:46.560 --> 29:48.320
gene for genius.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.560
And it turns out that there's not a gene, and there's not a

29:51.560 --> 29:54.000
hundred gene, and genes, and there's not a thousand

29:54.000 --> 29:54.320
genes.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.760
But there's probably thousands and thousands.

29:56.760 --> 29:57.920
And they're kind of interchangeable.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.360
So it's like the same genes get a peer and every single.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.800
And it's not for every single person.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.200
It's really a complex story.

30:05.200 --> 30:10.080
And the takeaway for me was twofold.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.160
So you have this bell shaped curve.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.600
Now we're all very interested at this high end of the curve,

30:14.600 --> 30:16.560
because we're all smart people.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.800
And we're here at this talk, and we're talking about genius.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.080
But evolution is selecting for the middle of the curve.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.800
That is where the sweet spot is for replication, natural

30:26.800 --> 30:28.360
selection to occur.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.080
And that's where the action is at the gene.

30:30.080 --> 30:34.840
So Robert Ploeman is looking for booster genes when actually

30:34.840 --> 30:36.480
there's suppressor genes.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.680
And the lack of suppressor genes that decrease your

30:39.680 --> 30:42.320
intelligence is actually the big story.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.080
And Dr. Lee and Dr. Ploeman are finding these stories that

30:45.080 --> 30:47.440
the lack of these suppressor genes are really more

30:47.440 --> 30:51.000
interesting than these booster genes for high IQ.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.640
There is one area where there's been, I think, more

30:53.640 --> 30:55.960
success to look at the genetic basis of genius.

30:55.960 --> 30:59.200
And that is not the focus on IQ, but the focus on

30:59.200 --> 31:00.560
personality.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.760
Because we know that most major personality traits have

31:03.760 --> 31:06.840
very strong genetic component, usually about 50% on the

31:06.840 --> 31:09.640
average credibility.

31:09.640 --> 31:14.680
And what's also interesting about this research is that it's

31:14.680 --> 31:17.480
helped us understand a little bit more a very important

31:17.480 --> 31:20.680
issue that has gone, well, it goes all the way back to Plato

31:20.680 --> 31:23.160
and Aristotle, the mad genius issue.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.440
What's the relationship between genius and mad stuff?

31:26.440 --> 31:30.760
I mean, Aristotle says that all geniuses are, even in

31:30.760 --> 31:33.880
politics, he said, you know, suffer from melancholic, which

31:33.880 --> 31:36.840
is just his word for depression and depression.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.640
And he was probably a depressed guy.

31:38.640 --> 31:42.440
Because he listed philosophy as one of characteristic.

31:42.440 --> 31:47.640
And what's interesting to me is that there is evidence that

31:47.640 --> 31:52.960
there are shared genetic basis between certain kinds of

31:52.960 --> 31:57.320
mental illness and certain kinds of creative achievement.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.600
It's not that highly creative people are mentally ill.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.520
It's just that there's certain things that allow them to be

32:05.520 --> 32:09.520
creative that are shared with people for mentally ill.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.480
Because they don't have whatever the moderating

32:11.480 --> 32:12.680
variables are.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.000
For example, reduced-laden ambition.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.680
I was going to say, what do you think those cognitive

32:16.680 --> 32:18.200
variables, the cognitive variables?

32:18.200 --> 32:19.200
They just can't.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.240
They have less ability to filter out irrelevant

32:22.240 --> 32:22.960
information.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.600
Well, guess what?

32:23.600 --> 32:26.000
That actually is useful sometimes.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.960
Because when you filter out something that's irrelevant,

32:27.960 --> 32:31.040
it actually may be something that, well, like serendipity,

32:31.040 --> 32:34.240
all serendipity by definition is irrelevant.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.520
And so you have spotted.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.720
Then that's domain specific though, right?

32:37.720 --> 32:42.200
In other words, one can imagine a correlation between

32:42.200 --> 32:45.440
poetic genius and a form of mental instability.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.640
Because making metaphor is drawing connections between

32:48.640 --> 32:49.520
dissimilar things.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.880
And you move that a little bit over and you got schizophrenia.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.720
And you can see how that might be.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.040
But presumably, in other domains, maybe not that.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.400
He's going to tell you something different.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.360
No, OK.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.080
Well, I mean, this is obviously very complicated.

33:02.080 --> 33:07.560
But if you look at scientific genius, their leanings are

33:07.560 --> 33:10.080
towards the autism spectrum.

33:10.080 --> 33:10.580
OK.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.080
And mathematics, for example, yes.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.000
And so in a sense, it's the opposite.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.080
Because they're so incredibly focused.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.920
I mean, when you figure out Albert Einstein, when he

33:20.920 --> 33:23.400
worked out his theories, well, if you don't realize, they're

33:23.400 --> 33:25.880
like, oh, you just come up with equals m c square, and you're

33:25.880 --> 33:27.200
done.

33:27.200 --> 33:32.000
I'm afraid he had to do calculation after calculation.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.080
He would often get those calculations wrong and would

33:35.080 --> 33:37.320
have to redo them.

33:37.320 --> 33:42.720
He worked, he published three papers on the size of a

33:42.720 --> 33:44.040
molecule, kind of a dumb thing.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.960
That's what he did his doctoral dissertation on.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.440
He got Avogadro's number wrong.

33:48.440 --> 33:49.840
He got wrong again.

33:49.840 --> 33:52.800
And he finally, on only a third calculation, he finally got

33:52.800 --> 33:55.480
it right, predicting it on the basis of his observation

33:55.480 --> 33:56.720
of the theory.

33:56.720 --> 34:01.240
So you have to be very, very focused in science.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.480
You're obsessed with Avogadro's domain.

34:04.480 --> 34:06.160
I think you're absolutely right.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.520
But I would make one observation, which is that the

34:08.520 --> 34:11.600
enormous powers of concentration that are required if you

34:11.600 --> 34:13.920
want to do high level mathematics or theoretical

34:13.920 --> 34:15.840
physics, those are developed.

34:15.840 --> 34:18.600
So when I was a kid growing up, my father, who was an

34:18.600 --> 34:21.040
engineering professor, I always thought of him as absent

34:21.040 --> 34:23.360
mind, and I used to joke with him.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.200
And I used to say, and I was kind of a normal kid, I thought,

34:26.200 --> 34:26.880
at least I think.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.600
And I used to say to my dad, hey, I'm never going to be as

34:29.600 --> 34:30.640
absent mind as you, dad.

34:30.640 --> 34:31.920
I think I'm different than you.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.080
And he said, well, just wait, because if you want to do

34:35.080 --> 34:37.360
the work that I do, you have to think.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.040
And when you're thinking, people will think you're

34:39.040 --> 34:40.280
absent-minded.

34:40.280 --> 34:43.600
And so what's actually happened is that as a kid, I could not

34:43.600 --> 34:46.280
hold some really complicated mathematical thing in my head

34:46.280 --> 34:46.920
and manipulate it.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.000
But now I can.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
It's developed.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.640
And so now my kids look at me, and I'm doing something, but

34:51.640 --> 34:53.200
they don't realize I'm doing something.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.960
They think I'm ignoring them or absent-minded.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.080
So it's a little bit more complicated than you think.

34:57.080 --> 35:00.320
They may actually be doing their work when they appear to be

35:00.320 --> 35:01.320
a kid.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.240
Sometimes I mean, Einstein would be talking with some gas.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.600
And all of a sudden, his mind would be elsewhere.

35:07.600 --> 35:08.960
He'd get up and go out of the room.

35:11.600 --> 35:14.280
And what if there's two main things that our brain does

35:14.280 --> 35:16.840
that's analogous to evolutionary processes, blind

35:16.840 --> 35:18.920
variation and selective retention?

35:18.920 --> 35:22.800
And so this is the mechanism of evolutionary processes.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.120
And this is kind of what you're describing.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.080
This variation process where you're thinking up lots of

35:27.080 --> 35:29.600
different ideas, and you can do mental simulations.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.680
But then you have to selectively retain, and you have to

35:31.680 --> 35:32.640
drill down.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.000
And at one extreme, and I wrote a paper on this that I

35:35.000 --> 35:37.280
think you reviewed as well, wrote a paper on this that at

35:37.280 --> 35:40.520
one extreme, blind variation can devolve into psychosis where

35:40.520 --> 35:42.680
everything is related to everything else.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.800
At the other end of the continuum, with selective

35:45.800 --> 35:48.400
retention, things get so narrow that there's only one

35:48.400 --> 35:50.160
solution become very rigid in your thinking.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.360
And autism is at the end of the psychopathological

35:53.360 --> 35:54.280
perspective.

35:54.280 --> 35:57.600
And the brain is designed to be, again, in the middle of

35:57.600 --> 36:01.320
the golden mean where blind variation and selective

36:01.320 --> 36:04.480
retention work hand in hand so that you can be most

36:04.480 --> 36:07.000
adaptive for problems that are well known, that you have to

36:07.000 --> 36:08.840
solve problems rapidly and accurately.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.640
That's kind of an intelligence thing.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.520
And problems are unknown where you have to come up with a

36:13.520 --> 36:14.800
new solution to a problem.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.280
That seems like the sweet spot.

36:16.280 --> 36:19.960
A good example of this is John Nash who recently died.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.400
He was the subject of this book, a movie, a beautiful

36:22.400 --> 36:23.160
mind.

36:23.160 --> 36:26.920
And he had a schizophrenic phase where he was really

36:26.920 --> 36:27.440
lost.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.960
And there were periods of time when he would wander around

36:29.960 --> 36:32.840
Princeton and just fill blackboards with just nonsense

36:32.840 --> 36:33.760
and crazy things.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.200
But then when he regained his sanity a little bit, people

36:36.200 --> 36:37.960
asked him, what were you doing all those years, John?

36:37.960 --> 36:41.560
And he said, well, these arguments that God is acting

36:41.560 --> 36:45.480
with Joseph Stalin to do something with Martians, those

36:45.480 --> 36:47.640
ideas came to me from the same places that the

36:47.640 --> 36:48.960
mathematical ideas came from.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.480
And so I didn't just treat them the same way.

36:51.480 --> 36:56.120
So it's very, I think it supports what your model.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.800
And from a neurological perspective, that's how we're

36:57.800 --> 36:58.600
starting to appreciate it.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.880
With networks in the brain that are involved with this

37:00.880 --> 37:04.360
variation process, the default mode network, and networks

37:04.360 --> 37:06.640
that are involved with the selection process, cognitive

37:06.640 --> 37:09.320
control networks, and how they have to work in tandem

37:09.320 --> 37:10.320
with each other.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.120
It's not just a place in the brain, but it's these networks

37:13.120 --> 37:16.320
working hand in hand that allows us to be uniquely human

37:16.320 --> 37:17.520
and successful as humans.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.320
This is relevant to another issue.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.760
If you look over at the program, they have all these

37:21.760 --> 37:23.520
really interesting issues.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.920
And some of my, I think we didn't touch upon because we're

37:27.920 --> 37:30.920
missing a person who's an expert in that area.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.760
But one of them is why not all child apologies grow up to

37:35.760 --> 37:37.840
become adult geniuses.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.960
And it's a very complex issue.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.720
It has to do with social development, a lot of other

37:41.720 --> 37:42.120
things.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.720
But one of them is, I guess this kind of blind version

37:45.720 --> 37:49.320
selective retention thing.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.440
When you see a lot of child apologies, they're usually in

37:51.440 --> 37:55.000
areas where you have to acquire incredible expertise,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.160
incredible expertise in chess, incredible expertise in

37:57.160 --> 38:01.520
mathematics, incredible expertise in music, performance,

38:01.520 --> 38:03.880
playing the violin, piano, whatever.

38:03.880 --> 38:08.560
And at the beginning, it's really helpful to just focus

38:08.560 --> 38:09.520
and focus and focus.

38:09.520 --> 38:13.920
It's very narrow, and we everything out beat towards

38:13.920 --> 38:16.520
the artistic end of the spectrum.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.120
But as you mature, that only works for certain kinds of

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
things.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.760
You can keep on doing that for chess.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.200
You can keep on doing that for some kind of mathematics.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.480
But there's other areas where all of a sudden you have the

38:30.480 --> 38:32.600
openness to experience.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.640
You're still composing music.

38:35.640 --> 38:36.640
Most of those are a good example.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.840
He was a phenomenal child prodigy.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.000
The greatest child prodigy in music the world has ever seen.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.960
He was actually studied.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.000
A lot of people don't know this.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.200
There was actually an article where they studied him.

38:47.200 --> 38:47.960
The Royal Academy.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.040
At the Royal Academy.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.000
Yeah.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
And published in the transactions.

38:52.000 --> 38:52.560
I just read that.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.560
We read that recently.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.400
It's fascinating.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.880
I mean, it's obviously not that he would go chase around a

38:56.880 --> 38:57.760
cat.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.840
Yeah, he was still.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.440
That was used as a proof that he really was his

39:01.440 --> 39:02.240
angel.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.880
Yeah, it really was a child.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.000
But what was interesting is that a lot of people

39:06.000 --> 39:09.760
realized that he was actually slow to mature as a

39:09.760 --> 39:11.800
composer.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.120
Some of you may have heard this 10-year rule.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.600
It takes about 10-year.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.720
It took him longer than 10-years.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.560
He was composing at six.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.840
And it wasn't until roughly he was 29 that he started

39:22.840 --> 39:25.840
composing his first masterpieces.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.880
And what happened is all of his stuff beginning, the

39:28.880 --> 39:31.640
really great music.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.000
But it's just kind of music that everybody else was

39:35.000 --> 39:36.560
composing.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.120
And there's no there there.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.640
He had to go through his death of his mother.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.720
He had to go through an unfortunate love affair and

39:44.720 --> 39:46.000
a marrying the sister.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.800
And all these other kinds of things.

39:47.800 --> 39:50.240
He had experience in life.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.320
And it broadened him so that all of a sudden he could put

39:53.320 --> 39:56.120
meaning into his music that he didn't have before.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.080
He just had the technique.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.120
And then when he puts it there, the Viennese Society

39:59.120 --> 39:59.960
can understand it.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.120
And he starts losing his contrast.

40:02.120 --> 40:02.640
Right, right.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.400
And dies, you know, proper.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.480
Yeah, he paid the consequence for it.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.200
He became less popular.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.920
No, no, please.

40:10.920 --> 40:14.120
I was just going to say, Dean mentioned that this

40:14.120 --> 40:17.360
nexus between madness and genius goes all the way

40:17.360 --> 40:19.160
back to Aristotle and Plato.

40:19.160 --> 40:21.120
But in the 19th century, there's quite a developed

40:21.120 --> 40:24.240
medical theory that genius is a sort of positive side

40:24.240 --> 40:26.840
effect of mental degeneration.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.400
And you know, there's a lot of literature on this.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.640
But the story I love to tell is that the great French

40:31.640 --> 40:36.200
novelist, Emil Zola, suspects that he's a genius.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.160
But he's also an acolyte of this theory.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.160
So he knows he has to be somewhat mad.

40:41.160 --> 40:45.000
So he hasn't sort of analyzed by a group of 12 French

40:45.000 --> 40:49.040
psychologists who come to the conclusion that he's mildly

40:49.040 --> 40:51.680
neurotic, just neurotic enough to be a genius.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.120
But I function it.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.040
You're in a sweet spot.

40:54.040 --> 40:54.640
There you go.

40:54.640 --> 41:02.200
But when you talk about Mozart, or you could talk about

41:02.200 --> 41:08.920
Matisse or Botticelli, is IQ relevant there?

41:08.920 --> 41:12.640
I suspect that if you took the greatest,

41:12.640 --> 41:16.200
we in this room made a list of who we thought were the

41:16.200 --> 41:18.040
greatest novelists.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.600
And you gave them all IQ tests.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.160
They would all score above average.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.280
But I think very few of them would score really off the

41:23.280 --> 41:26.640
charts the way that astrophysicists would score or

41:26.640 --> 41:27.240
something like that.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.840
The average, the bill-shaped curve, would center around

41:29.840 --> 41:32.480
120, around the Wexler scales.

41:32.480 --> 41:35.440
I think the issue here is you have to, and the same thing

41:35.440 --> 41:38.240
is true for the madness thing, that's like a pathology

41:38.240 --> 41:41.240
thing, you have to break it down by domain.

41:41.240 --> 41:46.040
And you can't do these big cuts even of artists versus

41:46.040 --> 41:48.160
scientists, because you've got to break it down much more

41:48.160 --> 41:48.800
fine.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.680
For example, you look at arts, and there's actually some

41:50.680 --> 41:53.400
research done on this, for example, where this guy

41:53.400 --> 41:58.720
compared highly formal abstract arts that are very

41:58.720 --> 42:02.560
logical, like a Mondrian, for example, with highly

42:02.560 --> 42:07.800
expressive emotive arts, like Jackson Pollock, for

42:07.800 --> 42:11.840
example, or abstract expressionism in general.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.600
And guess where all the psychopathology is?

42:14.600 --> 42:19.440
It's on the highly emotional expressive, and the highly

42:19.440 --> 42:22.800
abstract form, it's like mathematics.

42:22.800 --> 42:26.360
It doesn't require that kind of openness and craziness.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.880
But it's seen for physics, as you've shown too.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.800
Revolutionaries are more likely to show psychopathology

42:31.800 --> 42:36.280
than our theoretical physicists versus garden varieties.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.680
So you really have to cut it fine.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.760
And then again, just like it is for intelligence, or

42:40.760 --> 42:42.720
scatter around.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.720
So you don't have to be crazy.

42:45.720 --> 42:48.280
Einstein, maybe he was a little bit autistic, but he

42:48.280 --> 42:49.640
himself wasn't crazy.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.000
But he may have been carrying a gene for it because his

42:52.000 --> 42:56.640
science, and it's schizophrenic.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.160
Wonderful.

42:57.160 --> 42:58.240
I'm still not clear.

42:58.240 --> 43:02.920
Are you saying that the correlation between

43:02.920 --> 43:08.280
intelligence and genius applies primarily to fields like

43:08.280 --> 43:11.680
science, mathematics?

43:11.680 --> 43:17.320
Or is that applicable across the board to everything, whether

43:17.320 --> 43:20.000
it's painting, music?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.920
I think if you use the word intelligence, you have to be

43:21.920 --> 43:23.280
very careful of what you mean by that.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.440
So because there is an operationalizable version of

43:26.440 --> 43:30.800
it called G or IQ, that's the one we tend to focus on.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.000
That one tends to show a higher correlation with certain

43:34.000 --> 43:36.960
types of works, symbolic manipulation, mathematics,

43:36.960 --> 43:38.840
things like that, computer programming.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.960
But writing a novel I think has so many other

43:41.960 --> 43:45.320
ingredients in it that the loading on that particular

43:45.320 --> 43:47.760
kind of intelligence has decreased.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.240
But not absent.

43:49.240 --> 43:50.240
But not absent.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.880
It's like you said, 120 or something like that.

43:52.880 --> 43:53.840
Certainly not absent.

43:53.840 --> 43:55.200
These aren't dumb people.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.680
No.

43:55.680 --> 43:58.000
But they're spending more of their time thinking more

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
concretely about things that happen in life.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.880
I think feeling 120 is not the genius.

44:03.880 --> 44:04.400
No.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.600
It's gifted level.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
It can't be.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.400
120.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.440
It's all relative.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.200
It depends on who the 120 person is with.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.520
So yeah.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.480
I think if you ask, well, what is it that makes

44:15.480 --> 44:18.560
somebody a great novelist, they have to be able to read

44:18.560 --> 44:19.040
and write.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.960
But they have to think about humans and have insight into

44:21.960 --> 44:24.120
human psychology and life.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.240
And those are things which are not measured by these tests.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.200
So someone may be very, very off scale in their insight

44:29.200 --> 44:32.640
into human psychology.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.800
They may be off scale in their ability to write beautiful

44:34.800 --> 44:35.560
prose.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.640
But that's not measured by these little tests.

44:37.640 --> 44:40.440
And so they may come out as 120 on the little test, but

44:40.440 --> 44:43.160
they're one in a million in these other areas which we just

44:43.160 --> 44:44.280
are not very good at measuring.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.000
Right.

44:46.000 --> 44:57.200
So why isn't then the measurement made in terms of

44:57.200 --> 45:02.920
what knew did the person bring that didn't exist before?

45:02.920 --> 45:07.800
So let's say Manet in terms of painting bring something

45:07.800 --> 45:08.920
at a point.

45:08.920 --> 45:09.920
Yeah.

45:09.920 --> 45:13.000
That's the measurement that society gives in calling them

45:13.000 --> 45:15.280
the genius, the one in the million.

45:15.280 --> 45:21.520
Society then gives the acclimation or the collective

45:21.520 --> 45:25.160
approval that this person is, has produced something so

45:25.160 --> 45:27.920
unusual that that is the measure.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.480
I would say that's a much deeper way of classifying genius

45:30.480 --> 45:31.880
than just giving somebody a little test.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.560
This is saying, well, in the test, you're a genius as

45:34.560 --> 45:37.200
opposed to you contributed something really original.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.360
By definition, you can't standardize it.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.360
No.

45:40.360 --> 45:43.120
If you're going to score them on how original they are, then

45:43.120 --> 45:45.960
how do you standardize something like that?

45:45.960 --> 45:48.960
But I would say there is one problem here to capture.

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
The societal level.

45:49.960 --> 45:52.440
I thought they're doing a whole set of genetic studies on it.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.040
So they are trying to standardize it, but are they

45:55.040 --> 45:58.120
standardizing it just for scientists or are they standard?

45:58.120 --> 45:58.960
No.

45:58.960 --> 46:02.560
All the genetic studies would use as the phenotype variable, a

46:02.560 --> 46:05.240
score on a test, like an intelligence test.

46:05.240 --> 46:06.680
Or a personality test.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.160
Any trait, that quantitative trait that you want to measure,

46:09.160 --> 46:12.040
you can calculate, for example, the correlation between a

46:12.040 --> 46:14.720
particular gene variant and that phenotype.

46:14.720 --> 46:15.920
And that's what's being done.

46:15.920 --> 46:19.120
But there is not a good phenotype as in made original

46:19.120 --> 46:20.280
contribution to society.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.080
That's quite difficult to standardize and measure.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.800
I just want to say one thing, though, back to the very first

46:25.800 --> 46:29.200
comment I made this evening, I think a lot of times we give

46:29.200 --> 46:32.520
someone credit for some huge original contribution to society.

46:32.520 --> 46:35.200
But that's a manufactured story.

46:35.200 --> 46:38.240
That person may actually not deserve the credit that we

46:38.240 --> 46:38.640
give them.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.600
And so I think you have to be quite careful about that.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.240
Or the person didn't get it in their lifetime.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.280
And much later they get it.

46:45.280 --> 46:45.880
Bend off.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.240
Most genes are dead.

46:47.240 --> 46:48.240
Yeah.

46:48.240 --> 46:51.040
Most people are dead too.

46:51.040 --> 46:51.640
Yeah.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.240
And there's a huge number.

46:53.240 --> 46:58.040
We could all name examples of Emily Dickinson.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.000
And Sprito Kahlo sometimes mentioned.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.920
But she was actually pretty famous during her lifetime.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.200
She had went her pain.

47:05.200 --> 47:08.320
Was Melville not, I guess, Moby Dick was not.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.640
Yeah, I think he was underappreciative.

47:09.640 --> 47:11.640
I don't know if he was neglected.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.000
You got published.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.520
And then there's the other example of somebody we think

47:15.520 --> 47:17.120
of Edison and the light bulb.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.400
I mean, the light bulb would have been invented many times

47:19.400 --> 47:20.200
prior to that.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.760
And he seizes the moment at the right time.

47:21.760 --> 47:22.800
There's myth making.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.200
Any of our big, whether it's Steve Jobs or people

47:26.200 --> 47:27.440
who are big figures today, there's

47:27.440 --> 47:31.800
a tremendous amount of determined, intentional myth

47:31.800 --> 47:33.200
making around all these people.

47:33.200 --> 47:33.520
Yeah.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.120
You have to be quite careful about that.

47:35.120 --> 47:39.200
By the way, I also have to say a lot of neglected geniuses

47:39.200 --> 47:42.640
are really honest to good, neglected geniuses that

47:42.640 --> 47:43.720
deserve to be neglected.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.440
I had this weird experience.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.160
I published a little tiny commentary in Nature.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.200
Oh, yeah.

47:51.200 --> 47:54.280
And I just raised this issue of whether or not

47:54.280 --> 47:58.080
geniuses extinct now in the natural sciences.

47:58.080 --> 47:59.920
I'm talking about physics and chemistry.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.160
You still want to be trouble for that.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.680
That's become such, you know, so expertise driven

48:03.680 --> 48:07.160
and group oriented and, you know, big research teams

48:07.160 --> 48:09.080
and big grants.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.960
And all of a sudden, I found out.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.400
By the way, they changed the title on me.

48:13.400 --> 48:17.000
So they said, is Einstein extinct, which

48:17.000 --> 48:19.280
is much more dramatic and sells lots of copy,

48:19.280 --> 48:21.320
but it wasn't what I intended.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.280
And there's all these people came out of the woodwork,

48:24.280 --> 48:26.880
you know, and they started saying, wait a second.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.720
I'm alive.

48:27.720 --> 48:32.120
And I said, well, what do you do?

48:32.120 --> 48:34.720
And he says, I've revolutionized theoretical physicists.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.200
You should appreciate that.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.480
They've actually proved that Einstein was wrong.

48:39.480 --> 48:42.440
So I said, can you send me a PDF of anything?

48:42.440 --> 48:46.240
Well, I haven't got accepted yet, but I have a YouTube.

48:46.240 --> 48:50.240
LAUGHTER

48:50.240 --> 48:51.840
Can I comment on your article?

48:51.840 --> 48:53.240
Because you read it.

48:53.240 --> 48:53.720
OK.

48:53.720 --> 48:55.560
Well, I think it raises an very important point.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.720
So in the era of Einstein.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.040
You didn't send them a YouTube, did you?

48:59.040 --> 49:00.040
I didn't.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.040
LAUGHTER

49:01.040 --> 49:03.040
We have to clarify that first.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
LAUGHTER

49:05.040 --> 49:07.880
In the era of Einstein, the top minds

49:07.880 --> 49:10.080
were drawn from a relatively small population.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.720
So if you think of the number of people today

49:11.720 --> 49:14.960
who have access to first-rate university education,

49:14.960 --> 49:17.600
it might be in India, it might be in China,

49:17.600 --> 49:21.600
and then access to first-rate graduate school,

49:21.600 --> 49:23.520
our talent pool is enormously larger

49:23.520 --> 49:24.800
than in the time of Einstein.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.040
So there is no doubt that in some sense of,

49:27.040 --> 49:28.720
if you just measure IQ scores, there

49:28.720 --> 49:32.200
are plenty of people around who are as smart as Einstein

49:32.200 --> 49:33.880
on that particular metric.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.880
But it is much more difficult to stand out today.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.240
Because every area of science, in particular,

49:40.240 --> 49:43.320
say physics, which I know well, is being worked on

49:43.320 --> 49:45.800
by very, very smart people competing against each other

49:45.800 --> 49:48.080
and pushing things forward a little bit at a time,

49:48.080 --> 49:49.160
working in big teams.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.720
So you just don't stand out.

49:50.720 --> 49:54.760
If you took an NBA guard today, and you had him play against NBA

49:54.760 --> 49:57.160
guards in 1950, he would embarrass those people.

49:57.160 --> 49:59.400
Maybe not Oscar Robinson, whatever he's in his favor.

49:59.400 --> 50:04.320
But he would embarrass almost all the other players in 1950.

50:04.320 --> 50:06.560
Because he would just be off scale for that era.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.760
But today, every game he goes to, he's evenly matched

50:09.760 --> 50:10.600
against some other players.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.840
So you don't think of that guy as a basketball genius.

50:12.840 --> 50:14.120
But he is a basketball genius.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.240
The talent pool has come from the pool.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.240
Yeah, the talent pool is just so tremendous now.

50:17.240 --> 50:20.480
And the set of frontiers that are being pushed forward

50:20.480 --> 50:23.040
in science, whether it's in biology or physics or chemistry,

50:23.040 --> 50:25.360
is so vast that we have a lot of geniuses.

50:25.360 --> 50:27.720
But they're totally unrecognized geniuses.

50:27.720 --> 50:28.840
Like a super-string theory.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.560
I mean, you have to be a genius to contribute to that.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.960
For example, for example, really impressive people

50:33.960 --> 50:35.680
are doing that work in that area.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.840
But no one's really stood out.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.320
And part of it is the problem that you said earlier.

50:40.320 --> 50:43.160
You can't verify which of these.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.880
And this one assumes 15 dimensions.

50:44.880 --> 50:45.880
And this one's 18.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.080
So which one do you pick?

50:47.080 --> 50:49.360
Well, they both give the same prediction.

50:49.360 --> 50:52.400
So this was more parsimonious, I guess.

50:52.400 --> 50:57.640
But to your point, does that mean that there's still

50:57.640 --> 50:59.400
geniuses out there?

50:59.400 --> 51:01.000
Or how do you define it?

51:01.000 --> 51:02.560
Because they're not achieving.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.040
They're not able to achieve.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.160
I mean, are there geniuses?

51:05.160 --> 51:06.280
But they can't achieve.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.800
There's not the opportunity to make those achievements.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.480
Because they're just the talent pools to offer.

51:10.480 --> 51:13.000
There's an issue of something we call low-hanging fruit.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.800
So how long have humans been doing science per se?

51:16.800 --> 51:18.160
A couple hundred years.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.560
So there are a lot of pretty easy things that got done early.

51:21.560 --> 51:22.840
And now there are a lot of things

51:22.840 --> 51:26.600
which are going to require teams of very, very, very

51:26.600 --> 51:28.480
smart people to filling in the details.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.600
So yeah.

51:29.600 --> 51:31.720
Well, it's not just filling in the details.

51:31.720 --> 51:35.040
So we don't know how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.360
And maybe each string theory does.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.560
That's not filling in the details.

51:37.560 --> 51:38.800
That's a very fundamental thing.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.040
But it's going to take 1,000 Einstein-level people working

51:42.040 --> 51:42.960
on it to make it.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.440
Thank goodness the brain is completely unknown.

51:45.440 --> 51:48.680
And the brain, we still know almost nothing about the brain.

51:48.680 --> 51:50.280
So yeah, fantastic.

51:50.280 --> 51:50.760
Oh, God.

51:50.760 --> 51:55.000
I think this was mentioned in your little flyer as well.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.520
Has my favorite definition of genius.

51:57.520 --> 51:59.360
And it kind of fits in here.

51:59.360 --> 52:03.760
Because he puts the originality as the first requirement.

52:03.760 --> 52:09.000
But the second requirement is that the idea be exemplary.

52:09.000 --> 52:12.680
And what he means by that is that it

52:12.680 --> 52:16.680
forms a model for other people to follow and imitate

52:16.680 --> 52:18.480
or emulate or whatever.

52:18.480 --> 52:20.960
And I think that in the case of like Albert Einstein,

52:20.960 --> 52:22.880
like we were saying in that period,

52:22.880 --> 52:26.040
or in case of Niels Bohr or whatever,

52:26.040 --> 52:29.360
these people would come up with these ideas that people

52:29.360 --> 52:30.880
would immediately have to pick up on.

52:30.880 --> 52:32.840
I mean, you couldn't do quantum physics

52:32.840 --> 52:36.320
that ignore Niels Bohr and Heisenberg and the rest.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.880
So they reset the mark.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.400
But it's hard to know who's doing that now.

52:41.400 --> 52:43.800
Where everybody has to follow this guy or that guy.

52:43.800 --> 52:48.680
It's impossible for even a really great scientist in area A

52:48.680 --> 52:52.360
to actually follow what's going on in area C or D or E.

52:52.360 --> 52:55.400
So you could think of each one as a little microcosm

52:55.400 --> 52:57.240
where some genius work is being done.

52:57.240 --> 53:00.440
But it's so specialized now that it's very difficult for anybody

53:00.440 --> 53:02.320
to know what other people are doing.

53:02.320 --> 53:06.160
I want to ask you about what the thing you said

53:06.160 --> 53:08.920
about the basketball player.

53:08.920 --> 53:13.160
So you are saying a basketball player today

53:13.160 --> 53:16.280
is significantly superior in his abilities

53:16.280 --> 53:18.560
to a basketball player from the 50s.

53:18.560 --> 53:19.080
Yes.

53:19.080 --> 53:21.000
What does that say exactly?

53:21.000 --> 53:23.680
It's just that the pool from which the talent is drawn

53:23.680 --> 53:25.000
is much larger.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
So presenting.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.640
And the training and the techniques.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.280
But let me just say the pool.

53:30.280 --> 53:33.440
So that then wouldn't apply to genius because in genius,

53:33.440 --> 53:35.760
the idea is that there is something

53:35.760 --> 53:39.840
the person has given that makes them so.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.160
If you were a very, very smart kid

53:42.160 --> 53:45.280
and you grew up in Calcutta in the 1900s.

53:45.280 --> 53:48.280
Yeah, or even 1920, your chances of getting

53:48.280 --> 53:50.760
a decent education would be quite low.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.440
Whereas today with the Indian Institute of Technology,

53:53.440 --> 53:56.960
they're quite good at filtering the top young kids in India

53:56.960 --> 53:57.640
and bringing them.

53:57.640 --> 53:58.960
I mean, they're not fully efficient.

53:58.960 --> 54:01.720
But finding an early cultivating and then making sure

54:01.720 --> 54:04.360
that one could argue that in the time of Einstein,

54:04.360 --> 54:07.320
the actual population base from which the geniuses are

54:07.320 --> 54:09.520
drawn is more than 100 million people.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.960
Whereas now we're probably drawing

54:10.960 --> 54:14.080
from a pool of three or four billion people now.

54:14.080 --> 54:15.920
So.

54:15.920 --> 54:21.240
But the idea is that if you were basing it on an IQ test

54:21.240 --> 54:25.480
and if IQ tests existed in 16th century,

54:25.480 --> 54:28.760
that the numbers would be the same as the numbers

54:28.760 --> 54:29.760
that are now.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.600
So you are popping.

54:31.600 --> 54:37.000
So you are saying that the IQ, let's say,

54:37.000 --> 54:41.720
for the genius level is now higher than it was

54:41.720 --> 54:42.800
in the 16th century.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.200
And in the IQ has risen.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.840
Yeah, in the Flint Effect.

54:46.840 --> 54:50.160
Yeah, 100 or 150 years ago in the richest countries

54:50.160 --> 54:52.160
in the world, like the United States,

54:52.160 --> 54:55.400
the average years of education for an adult male

54:55.400 --> 54:57.920
would be something like six years or seven years.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.080
Well, IQ should be running into the education.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.080
Well, you did.

55:01.080 --> 55:01.520
No, no.

55:01.520 --> 55:06.560
I mean, unless you have some good environmental basis

55:06.560 --> 55:09.040
to build on, you're not going to achieve your full IQ.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.200
So actual raw scores on IQ tests.

55:12.200 --> 55:15.720
So, for example, the Swiss Army, sorry, the Swedish Army,

55:15.720 --> 55:18.240
there are various entities that have been testing IQ

55:18.240 --> 55:20.000
for over 100 years.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.160
And so they have scores on the same problems

55:24.160 --> 55:26.360
that have been given over a long period of time.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.920
And so there's been a gradual increase in scores.

55:29.920 --> 55:32.400
More people are getting them right over time.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.520
Because they have to make the tests harder, right?

55:34.520 --> 55:37.720
So they came off the farm and Sweden

55:37.720 --> 55:40.240
and they had four years of formal education.

55:40.240 --> 55:42.080
They weren't going to do very well in these tests.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.120
The average kid does much better.

55:44.120 --> 55:45.960
So in some sense, the environment

55:45.960 --> 55:48.480
has gotten much better for development of intelligence

55:48.480 --> 55:49.640
for the average person.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.120
And we're not quite sure if it's a combination

55:52.120 --> 55:53.720
or dietary factors.

55:53.720 --> 55:54.400
Nutrition.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.440
And people are reading and using their brain

55:57.440 --> 55:58.920
in a very complex way.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.200
So literacy has increased over the last century.

56:02.200 --> 56:04.200
Visual spatial development.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.080
People are using their brains in very complex ways.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.720
Visual spatially, this could be related.

56:09.720 --> 56:12.760
But the secular increase in IQ is a real thing.

56:12.760 --> 56:17.320
So when you go, I think it's when you go to first grade

56:17.320 --> 56:19.120
or kindergarten, I think to kindergarten,

56:19.120 --> 56:21.720
there is a test they give kids.

56:21.720 --> 56:27.360
And then some of these kids also have IQ tests.

56:27.360 --> 56:28.440
So you would.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.760
We just took naps in first grade when I'm.

56:30.760 --> 56:34.760
But look, in this sandbox, if I understand this.

56:34.760 --> 56:39.680
It's really changed over here in New York, it's different.

56:39.680 --> 56:42.960
If I understand you, when I went to nursery school,

56:42.960 --> 56:45.400
it was obligatory to take one hour nap.

56:45.400 --> 56:46.240
Yes, yes.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.720
It was.

56:47.720 --> 56:53.800
But so are you saying that the IQ of a five-year-old

56:53.800 --> 56:57.760
or a six-year-old when those tests applicable to that age

56:57.760 --> 57:02.640
are taken has the potential of developing and becoming

57:02.640 --> 57:04.760
a higher number?

57:04.760 --> 57:05.280
It has.

57:05.280 --> 57:06.760
Yeah, it already has.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.600
And that's why they have to rescale it.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.320
Yes.

57:09.320 --> 57:12.160
It's like what happened with the math portion of the SAT.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.360
People gain 800s and 800s and they try to rescale it.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.040
And they still start getting 800s and 800s.

57:16.040 --> 57:19.120
But you think of your genes as kind of a variance

57:19.120 --> 57:20.840
that you can be within.

57:20.840 --> 57:23.520
And you can either, if you eat a lot of lead paint

57:23.520 --> 57:25.160
and have a very restricted environment,

57:25.160 --> 57:28.160
you'll end up at the low end of that genetic variance.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.080
But if you have a very enriched environment

57:30.080 --> 57:32.160
and have parents that read to you and you

57:32.160 --> 57:34.240
have early education programs, you'll end up

57:34.240 --> 57:36.240
at the high end of that variance.

57:36.240 --> 57:40.760
And so the farmer in Sweden that never had an education

57:40.760 --> 57:42.760
will end up at the lower end of that variance

57:42.760 --> 57:45.920
and have a lower IQ versus the farmer that has

57:45.920 --> 57:47.320
educational opportunities.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.400
And as you mentioned, it's not just the education.

57:49.400 --> 57:49.920
It's the nutrition.

57:49.920 --> 57:54.280
How many of those farmers kids had had an orange at the turn

57:54.280 --> 57:55.880
of this century or had an orange during the winter?

57:55.880 --> 57:56.760
I understand.

57:56.760 --> 57:59.320
So what you are saying, if you said to me,

57:59.320 --> 58:05.040
it's in terms of that good parenting and reaching

58:05.040 --> 58:09.560
environment, good education, et cetera,

58:09.560 --> 58:13.440
will contribute to a smarter kid.

58:13.440 --> 58:15.040
And we've got a secular increase at all.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.960
If we are talking about genius, we

58:16.960 --> 58:19.160
are adding something on top of that.

58:19.160 --> 58:19.840
Yes.

58:19.840 --> 58:22.880
And are you saying that something on top of it

58:22.880 --> 58:24.120
is moving higher and higher?

58:24.120 --> 58:25.960
Not necessarily, but I want to say the following.

58:25.960 --> 58:28.400
So suppose you have many components that contribute

58:28.400 --> 58:28.920
to genius.

58:28.920 --> 58:31.000
So one is your raw IQ.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.520
One is your originality, creativity.

58:33.520 --> 58:36.160
Those are all things that are distributed within populations.

58:36.160 --> 58:40.000
And if I just give you a bigger pool of people to pick from,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.360
the person who's maximal on all of those qualities,

58:42.360 --> 58:44.520
or any particular sum of those qualities,

58:44.520 --> 58:45.720
will just be better because you were

58:45.720 --> 58:47.080
able to choose from a bigger pool.

58:47.080 --> 58:47.580
OK.

58:47.580 --> 58:48.760
And that's what's happening today.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.360
Good example is the chess genius,

58:50.360 --> 58:53.160
or interesting study of why are so many chess geniuses

58:53.160 --> 58:55.400
Russians or Hungarians or whatever?

58:55.400 --> 58:56.600
I mean, yes.

58:56.600 --> 58:56.940
What?

58:56.940 --> 58:57.440
Or a comedian?

58:57.440 --> 58:58.440
Or a comedian.

58:58.440 --> 58:58.960
Yeah.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.280
And it's a very simple answer, because there's

59:00.280 --> 59:03.080
so many of them playing.

59:03.080 --> 59:03.960
You know.

59:03.960 --> 59:05.000
It's an enriched environment.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.600
It's very competitive.

59:07.600 --> 59:09.200
They have very beginning.

59:09.200 --> 59:12.360
They have the chess clubs that are at very, very high level.

59:12.360 --> 59:14.360
Like at their ELO rating, at a very young age.

59:14.360 --> 59:17.560
I mean, you'd have this per capita kind of.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.440
There is a base population that you're

59:19.440 --> 59:21.320
drawing the champion from.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.280
And the bigger that base population,

59:23.280 --> 59:24.800
whatever the thing you're selecting for,

59:24.800 --> 59:26.360
you're going to get better champions.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.720
But one of the things you said is there's

59:27.720 --> 59:29.200
fewer problems to solve, too.

59:29.200 --> 59:33.000
So you have this incredible secular increase in intelligence,

59:33.000 --> 59:35.080
but you don't have an increase in genius,

59:35.080 --> 59:37.240
because there might be fewer problems.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.440
Or the problem, if you put us off a few problems,

59:39.440 --> 59:40.360
there are some of them.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.360
Maybe you didn't say that.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.120
No, I would say there are few problems

59:43.120 --> 59:46.280
that people readily identify as genius problems.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.880
But let me just mention that one in a million problems.

59:48.880 --> 59:50.320
Let me just mention that this thing

59:50.320 --> 59:53.000
is a million times more powerful than the computers

59:53.000 --> 59:54.320
that we had 20 years ago.

59:54.320 --> 59:55.640
Now, how did that happen?

59:55.640 --> 59:56.880
So this thing called Moore's Law

59:56.880 --> 59:59.120
is a doubling of our computer power

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.240
every couple of years or so.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.160
How does that happen?

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.360
The way it happens is there are thousands and thousands

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.160
of electrical engineers and applied physicists

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.600
who are not chopped liver, who are working on this problem.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.680
Consulate.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.960
They're working on this problem constantly

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.360
with billion dollar budgets.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:14.480
And you're not aware of anything that they do, are you?

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.240
But are they geniuses?

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.680
Because I don't know why they're not geniuses,

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.400
but you're not aware of them.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.960
And of course, another component of this,

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.280
as you mentioned already, is that genius

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.200
is a cultural label that we apply.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.000
And that is historically specific.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.720
People don't refer to individuals as geniuses prior

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.080
to the latter part of the 17th century.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.520
The cult of genius emerges in the 18th century.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.880
And I'm always the token historian at these gatherings.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.960
So I will spare you a lecture, but there

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.440
are culturally specific reasons why the cult of genius

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.400
emerges in the 18th century.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.760
And one of them has to do with the new emphasis

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.080
is placed on originality.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.640
I like to point out that if you look up the word

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:59.760
to invent or to discover, if you look at those roots,

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.240
the German for invent is effinden.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.200
And it literally means to find, to come upon.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.880
And that's reflective of a cultural mindset,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.760
same with the discovery.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.560
You're uncovering something of a cultural mindset that says,

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.200
every truth in the world has already been discovered.

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.640
God knows everything.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.400
What we do as artists, as thinkers,

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.320
is recreate God's perfection.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.840
So in that world, you don't produce anything original.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.320
And there's a cultural impetus, rather, to imitate.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.840
Imitate is not to do anything bad.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.800
It's just to recreate, to perform the maces, which

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.480
is the dominant kind of mode of aesthetics

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.760
prior to the 18th century.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.640
Well, in the 18th century, you start

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.240
to get a new emphasis placed on originality,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.200
both in the market.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.720
And I think it's not actually on coincidental

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:50.320
that the cult of genius emerges at the same time

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.920
as commercial society, when there's

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.480
a kind of emphasis on bringing a new product to the market,

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.520
tweaking a little bit on the neighbor's product

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.960
so that you can get something new.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.760
Copyright law merges at the same time.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.680
An emphasis on the individual.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.360
Exactly.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:05.920
Exactly.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.960
And so that's all by way of saying that I think

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.000
our need for geniuses has changed over the years.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.680
And we don't need the kind of geniuses that we once needed.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.120
Because the flip side of this is we

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.760
have geniuses all over the place now.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.040
You can learn how to be a genius.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.360
You just go to Amazon.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.120
You get a self-fulfilled congenius.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:25.760
I'm not kidding.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.040
There are hundreds of titles.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.800
You two can think like Leonardo.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.400
Well, do you think that secular change is happening

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.200
to bring us back to more of a democratization of genius?

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.720
And that so we don't need this.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.320
Why do you think this is happening?

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.120
That we don't need this individual genius

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.360
and this kind of democratization is happening again?

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.920
The cult of genius plays a religious role.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.720
The geniuses become secular saints.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.160
And that's a long story.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.680
And so about atheists.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.920
Well, there's that.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.200
But there's also, at the heart of democracy,

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.240
there's a kind of discomfort with genius.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:59.360
Because geniuses are people who are naturally different

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:00.440
and better than others.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.760
And we don't really like that.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.800
We're not really comfortable with that.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:04.400
Exactly.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.400
And so I think that there's always been a discomfort.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.000
And that sort of dialectic has worked its way out

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.880
over the centuries.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.640
And we're at a place now where we live in Lake Wobagon.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.440
We're all above average.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.080
I mean, that's why there's such a hostility towards life.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.520
You have to do an education program.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.840
Because there seem to be elitists.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.920
Why spend money on these elite people who don't need any help?

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.240
They've already got a lego.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.600
They already got it made.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.760
They already got the brain.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.120
So that's focused on the money in where it can be used.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.760
It used to hold.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.520
Like egalitarianism.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.760
That's make everybody equal.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.840
I think that's exactly how Americans feel.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.760
But I would say that the true secret of the world

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.360
is technological and economic advancement

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.920
are basically driven by some small percentage.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:54.320
A very small percentage in terms of cognitive ability

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.800
of our population.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.440
And so to give you an example, quantum mechanics, which

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.320
was invented in the early part of the 20th century,

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.600
is now in roughly 10% of our GDP.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.360
So if you ask about telecommunications equipment

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.240
or fancy chemicals, applied materials,

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.160
all these things require some understanding of quantum

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.360
mechanics to build and develop.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.040
But maybe 0.1% of our population actually

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.200
understands quantum mechanics.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.760
And this is the other thing about the IQ thing,

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.600
because I don't like to turn on IQ.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.560
General intelligence.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.040
And it relates to different areas of achievement.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.480
There are some areas where the knowledge base

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.160
has become so complex that you need a very high IQ just

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:42.440
to master it.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:48.720
I mean, physicists have an average IQ of about 140,

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.360
which is the genius level according to the dictionary

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.440
of the heart of the term.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.960
So that means the average physicist is genius.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.600
Psychologist?

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.520
I hate to tell you.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.680
120.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.920
It's much lower than that.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.280
But they're still creative.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.720
But they're still creative.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.920
And it's probably quite high for psychometricians, though.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.480
Yeah, but psychometricians.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:22.400
And so it takes a certain amount of, gee, general intelligence

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:26.680
to master complex abstract knowledge bases.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.800
And physics, if any of you have taken physics courses,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.360
that is definitely a complex, act-back knowledge base.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.840
Oh, it took one physics course.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.480
I mean, just learning the math to be able to do physics.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.240
So I guess my day job is as an administrator

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.400
at a big university with 50,000 students, and one

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:52.960
can't really even speak those words in today's environment.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.120
So we cannot say, the provost will look at me and say,

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.560
how come our students are having so much trouble

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.040
with freshman chemistry or organic chemistry?

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.520
Surely there is a way that everybody on our campus

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.120
can pass organic chemistry or second-year calculus

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:11.120
or multivariable calculus.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.440
Can't say they're not smart enough.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.640
Yeah, so it's kind of amazing that we've

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.400
been talking a little bit about this IQ construct

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.240
and all those others.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.200
But in higher ed, you're not supposed to say those things.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.240
It's the fault of the chemists that they don't know

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.380
how to teach their stuff, because surely everybody

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.520
can understand if they really want to.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.240
And so I think there's still this tension

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.120
in American society between understanding

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.560
that certain truths are true and living

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:43.680
in some world of magical thinking.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.000
I can show the spell.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Right?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.520
I want to say something to what you said,

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.960
because it's one thing to say that the word genius,

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.920
as it's currently used now, we're discussing it

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.160
as a relatively new thing.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.080
But a lot of times, different cultures

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.520
and different times and places will

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:08.840
have sort of semantic equivalence to genius.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.920
Like, for example, in Chinese civilization,

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.880
there's a certain poet, Libo, for example,

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.440
who has had a term for it.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.080
It's like a fallen angel.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.320
Oh, Tiananzai.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:20.720
What?

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:21.240
Tiananzai.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.680
Well, it means somebody who comes from heaven.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.960
Oh, yeah, someone comes from heaven.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.480
Yeah.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.000
And we also see that in, it means genius, basically.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.320
Yeah, I mean, basically it's a translation

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.960
of each or defined Michelangelo's, what Vasari called Michelangelo.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.280
Because it was just like, where does it come from?

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.000
Yeah.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.880
You know, it's just out of the blue, literally out of the blue.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.760
And so that's like genius.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.240
In the case of, I mean, it is like genius.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:47.040
And of course, every culture has heroes of the mind.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.000
But the Michelangelo case is interesting.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.600
I mean, Vasari uses, in the first edition,

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.080
the lives of the painters, he calls Michelangelo divine,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.720
like 35 times, and it's like 50 something times

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.680
in the second edition.

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.000
The word do we know, right, the Latin.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.760
And prior to that point, been almost used exclusively

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.680
for religious figures.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.360
And you get Brunelleschi's, you get described

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.080
as a divine architect and so forth.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.760
And that in itself is a kind of shift

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.160
from thinking about religious figures, especially

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.720
touched to secular artists, right?

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.040
I mean, Michael, he's still of the angels, right?

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.840
He's angelic.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.000
I mean, he says the same thing.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.240
He said, and of course, that is an old way

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.840
of thinking about genius that goes all the way back to Plato

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.760
with his idea of divine fury of genius.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.640
But it carries on.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.040
I mean, there's a whole sociology that develops

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.280
in Austrian Germany in the early part of the 20th century

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:38.720
that refers to the Geni-Grelydion, sort of religion

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.720
of genius, the modern kind of cult of genius.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.280
And this idea that geniuses are specially touched, yeah,

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.160
that they have a kind of religious aura.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.640
You see this in the cult of Einstein.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.120
I mean, Einstein can see into the heavens, right?

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.680
He can read the mind of God.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.120
He's called a Jewish saint.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.880
And even the interest in his brain,

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.760
it's like he's different from everyone else, you know?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.080
It is like relics almost.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.920
People are getting little bits of his fingers or something.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.400
Yeah.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.520
You had that quote from Schopenhauer.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.000
It illustrates that talent hits a target

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.040
that no one else can hit.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.240
Genius hits a target that no one else can see.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.720
Yeah.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.320
So just out of the blue, again.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.320
Yeah.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:17.760
Yeah.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.520
And of course, that has always existed, right?

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.920
But it's the question becomes for a historian.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.400
Well, why at certain moments does this cult emerge?

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.520
And what does that say about the culture, right?

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.680
And how is it shifting back?

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.960
Because it appears to be shifting back

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.320
to a more secular conception of genius.

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.120
Yeah.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.440
Yeah.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:37.280
By the way, this idea we talked on earlier about, you know,

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.360
the relationship in native ability, you know,

01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:42.480
native intelligence, you know, the genetic component.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.720
And, you know, we didn't actually call it Flynn's law,

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.400
but we were talking about for a while,

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.680
I think they increased intelligence over time.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.080
One of my favorite examples, there are examples

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.800
of cultures that came out of a nation that was relatively

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.880
nondescript, and then in a very short time period,

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.160
became the center of creativity for the world.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:07.840
OK.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.920
And one of my favorite examples is Islamic civilization.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.840
Except for poetry, the Arabs in Arabia

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.360
had very little that was very distinctive in their culture

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.440
in terms of contributing to world civilization.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.600
They are converted to a new world faith.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.720
They launch a campaign, a conquest.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.520
And they are all of a sudden forced to assimilate

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.880
all these great ideas from India and Persia and Greece.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.480
And they not only assimilated it,

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.080
but they integrated it to a new culture, a new civilization.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.680
And all of a sudden, they're making phenomenal contributions,

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.760
leaving in the dust all the rest of human civilization,

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.400
like in particular, certain areas like mathematics,

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:57.480
for example, and medicine.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.920
Just out there to the hospital.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.680
Because of that openness.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.120
Because they were phenomenally open.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.880
Because they were so naive.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.440
You know, they come out and they have the Quran and their armies.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.760
And all of a sudden, there's all these books and experts

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:12.640
on things.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.240
And there was a great caliph who set up

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.440
what's called the House of Wisdom, where he deliberately

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.040
said, there's a lot of things we don't know.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.720
And it's not an Arabic.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.120
So we brought all these people in.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.320
And they were not necessarily Muslims.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.120
They were Christians.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.600
They were medicans.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.320
They were Zoroastrians.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.280
And it says, translate everything into Arabic.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.640
So we don't miss out on anything.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:40.400
And the Ashkenazi Jews are a good example of this too.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.480
And the fact that you're getting out of your and being

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.120
driven out of your home is another example.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.840
You are forced to invent new ways of solving problems.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.920
You're living in different through your exposure

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.360
to new cultures and new ideas.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.080
Well, there's a lot of actually empirical research

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:01.080
on multicultural experiences as conducive to creativity.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.040
And the Ashkenazi Jews definitely

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.600
had that as part of a way of life.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.600
You're not advocating warfare, though.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.080
No, no, no, no.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.920
And the same thing happened with the old and old age

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.600
of Islamic civilization.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.200
It was horrendously multicultural.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.240
And by the way, a lot they don't realize this.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.160
But even in the periods of conquest,

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.880
most of the people in Islamic countries under the caliphate,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.600
in particular, were not Muslim.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.760
They belonged to some other faith,

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.960
usually Christian or in the case of Persia,

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.200
the Zoroastrians, and so forth.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.280
So it was a very, very multicultural society.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.720
So I've been confused about something

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.600
I was talking with a friend earlier.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:43.600
We have this explosion of human creativity

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.640
around 30 or 40,000 years ago.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.000
And why did this happen?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.080
And one of the things you start looking at,

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.200
the Shulian hand-acts was the pinnacle

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:58.200
of modern, hominid experience for 1.5 million years.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.240
And it was so stable for so long.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.720
And then 30 or 40,000 years ago, boom,

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.040
you have agriculture, you have written language,

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.720
you have culture, you have buildings,

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:09.320
you have things that led to this.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.280
And in evolutionary time, this 30, 40,000 years

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.040
is minuscule for this to happen.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.880
So one of the things that you read about

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.440
is that people were coming out of Africa,

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.840
and people were going into glaciers

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.560
were retreating and encroaching on Northern Europe,

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.960
and environments were changing in South Africa.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.560
I mean, was this of a theme that we're starting to see

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.920
that this massive expansion of territory

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.960
through warfare or through distribution of populations

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.960
is the secret sauce of human creativity and innovation.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.280
It's also possible that on relatively short time scales,

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.000
if selection pressures change just a little bit,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.640
you can have a secular increase in the average intelligence

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.360
of early hominids.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.880
Dines off of the successful ones.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.560
Well, so for example, we've replaced

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.480
the Neanderthals very quickly, actually.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.120
They were around for about a million years

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.880
and didn't really accomplish very much.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.920
And so it's quite possible.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.200
We incorporated some of their DNA.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.360
And incorporated some also.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.920
They've also been an interesting addition to it.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.320
But I think as we get closer to the genetic basis

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.080
for variations in human intelligence,

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.440
we'll be able to look back, because we're getting quite good

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.840
now at extracting DNA from dead creatures.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.200
We'll be able to look back at humans who lived 10,000 years

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.600
ago, 20,000, 40, 50, and actually see how smart they were.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.080
Mm-hmm.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.600
It's interesting that I'm trying to remember who it was.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.080
I'm having problems, because I know this guy primarily

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.280
by reviewing manuscripts that he submitted for publication.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.000
Not a week, really.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.480
No, no.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.080
And of course, it's anonymous.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.640
So by both ends, you know, double blind.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.240
So I can't draw into blank.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:00.200
But anyway, who's argued that general intelligence

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.280
was actually a lot of people in cognitive psychology

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280
talk about modules.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.200
There's a module for this and a module for that,

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.000
that evolution involved developing

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.040
as various kind of module for language.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.200
And the magic of mathematics, or really arithmetic.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.680
And this person argued, I think he's

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.640
at the Lenin School of Economics,

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.640
he argued that general intelligence

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.400
is a specialized module.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.800
Very interesting concept.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.360
It's a specialized module that appeared when human beings

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.280
started exploiting new niches in the environment.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.600
Because it was the.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.680
Khonazawa?

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:38.720
Yeah, that's it.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.240
That's it.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:43.240
You know, thank you very much.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:43.960
Eureka.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.640
Eureka.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.880
And that's an interesting concept,

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.440
because how do you adapt to totally new environments that

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.000
have never been seen before?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.760
Well, you have this module that's very plastic,

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.960
and it can absorb a lot of information,

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.560
a lot of new information, and form new adaptations,

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.360
and so forth.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.480
And so it's kind of something ironic twist to it,

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.400
that generalized intelligence may be a specialized module

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.200
for adapting to new environments.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.720
And he's done that interesting research,

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:17.000
where he shows that general intelligence correlates

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.680
with people's preference for novel behaviors.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.720
Like, for example, one of the things I find really interesting

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.320
is that highly intelligent people

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.280
are more likely to like instrumental music,

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.200
whereas less intelligent people are more likely to like

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.280
vocal music.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.280
I think you better be careful.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.040
Tread it into a dangerous.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.760
Because, instrumental music is a little bit

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.560
of a real trouble.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.720
It's for the dumb.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.040
I actually like both, you know?

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.520
So I don't know how I feel about it.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.480
So Khonazawa is very controversial.

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.800
And Khonazawa, these in Tubi, talk about two different modules

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.760
in the brain, one that's a specialized problem solving,

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.760
and one's more general improvisation module.

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.440
And this is more analogous to my thinking

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.440
that we have these two competing neural networks,

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:09.480
not competing, but cooperating neural networks.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:13.880
One designed to do this intelligent hypothesis testing,

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.600
which is rapid, accurate problem solving in the environment.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.800
And one, to do hypothesis generation

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.800
when we don't know what to do next.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.880
And I think Cosmades and Tubi were probably

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:29.000
a little more accurate in their conceptualization of these,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.560
maybe not modules in the brain, but networks in the brain

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.240
that we're now coming to appreciate.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:38.240
And Khonazawa is misappropriating creative problem solving

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.120
for intelligent problem solving.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.920
But we can argue about this for.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.440
One development that I think is really absolutely mind-boggling

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:47.880
for me.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.400
And you kind of hinted at it when you talked about the Swedish

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.360
things.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.120
In a lot of Scandinavian countries,

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.080
they're doing these studies that are the whole population.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.080
They don't have samples.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.280
They have the whole population.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.280
I just reviewed a book that was on the relationship

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.400
between psychopathology and male illness about Kyaga.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.840
And he's in Sweden.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:17.800
And his original study for his doctoral dissertation,

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.040
he had something like 700,000.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.360
But now he's expanded a sample to over a million.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.840
Yeah, he's right.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840
It's not uncommon to have sample sizes of order millions

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.280
now for a lot of these studies.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.080
And so he can do these fine distinctions that you just

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.920
can't do with small samples.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.560
Because he's breaking down creativity, for example,

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:46.560
in all these sub areas and different kinds of achievement.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.120
Are you in a creative profession or not

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.720
in the arts versus the sciences and that kind of thing?

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.280
And then also breaking down the gene side of it.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.760
So what specific kinds of genetic disorders

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.080
are associated with which kinds?

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.400
And these are studies with typical ends

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.520
that most psychologists work with.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.080
You couldn't do because you'd have one case in each cell.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.880
At the ISIR conference, they started

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:15.000
to brag about this by saying, we're

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.920
using scientific notations for our end, 10 to the fifth.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.560
I was that new.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.640
I didn't realize that.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.040
Because psychologists, it's like we had a neuroimaging.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.080
It's like we had a sample of 50 or 60 or maybe 100

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:30.920
is a big sample.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.560
But they kept going back and forth at this conference.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.720
Proaching 10 to the sixth.

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:41.200
Yeah, 10 to the fifth, 7 to the log guys.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.520
The talk gets bigger than yours, my sample size.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.520
The talk that you mentioned at ISIR, which just happened,

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.360
I guess it was a couple of weeks ago.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.880
This guy James Lee is a plumb in an eye,

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.400
and James Lee are all collaborators.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.280
Yeah, Lee gave a very impressive talk.

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.120
So the talk that James Lee gave was

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.720
the result of a big collaboration

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.680
called Social Science Genetic Association Consortium,

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.120
which is an international consortium.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.400
They're probably something like 50 or maybe even 100

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.800
universities involved.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:11.120
And they have a pool of about 300,000 people

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.320
for whom they have some kind of cognitive measure,

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.640
and then they have the genotype.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.320
32 of them.

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.960
And they've reported at something

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.600
called genome-wide significance, which

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.120
is a statistical criterion.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.560
About 80 hits on specific gene variants

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.320
that are associated with either slightly higher

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.360
or slightly lower IQ.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.000
And so probably the way this field is going to evolve

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.080
is that as we get bigger and bigger sample sizes,

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.360
we will eventually get to the point

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.160
where we've identified the probably of order

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.200
10,000 places in the genome, which

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.680
are directly associated with either slightly enhanced

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.960
or slightly decreased cognitive ability.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.400
And at that point, we'll be able to make predictions.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.000
So if you give me the genotype of a person, site unseen,

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.120
run it through the algorithm, it will predict

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.880
this person's IQ is 120 plus or minus 10.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.600
We can already almost do that for height.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.280
So we already almost understand the genetic architecture

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.320
of height such that if you give me from, say, a crime scene,

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.560
the DNA from a person, I can say something

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.080
about the height of that person.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.200
I can say something very definitive about eye color,

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.760
skin color, things like that.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.920
But these complex traits, which are influenced

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.880
by thousands of genetic variations,

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.600
are going to be the last ones to be cracked.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.920
But they're going to be cracked probably

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.120
in the next five years, I would say.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.640
Which is scary to me because we might have, well,

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.600
we already see this, this neo-ugenics movement

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.600
where you find out the genetics of your infant

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.280
before it's even born and decide this person can't

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.720
be an NBA basketball player or this person can't be a scientist.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.560
It's quite what I want.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.240
Not quite what I want.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.240
And I think this is really worth thinking hard about

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.840
because it's right around the corner.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.720
And we may.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.120
Also modification.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:55.800
Well, exactly.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.960
That's what I mean.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.520
And so we will say, we're not going

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.960
to do that in this country for more reason, but somebody will.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.480
And then people from New York with money

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.240
will start flying to the places of the world they will.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:10.320
So their children can have an IQ of 15, 20 points higher

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.040
than the rest.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.360
And so again, I would say this is a time

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:17.080
to study the history of this kind of stuff too because,

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:23.200
get dark for the million or so couples in the world each year

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.600
that go through in vitro fertilization or IVF.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:29.680
In almost every case, they are producing multiple embryos.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.640
And there is already a decision process

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.600
that is made of which embryo should

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.840
be implanted to become the child and which one

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.560
should be frozen or disposed of.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.760
Now that decision process right now is quite primitive.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.280
So the doctor may eyeball the growing blastocyst

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.520
and say, this one has good symmetry.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.560
I bet it's healthy.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.360
The next step is to actually take a cell

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.320
from one of the blastocysts and sequence the DNA.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.440
So you know the genotype.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:23:00.560
And then you can exclude certain severe diseases.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.560
You may be able to say certain things about phenotypes

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.480
like height or IQ.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.720
So that's where we're heading.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.440
And it's really all existing technology.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.640
The only last step is just the ability

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.680
actually with the algorithm to predict the phenotype

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.880
from the genotype.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:16.560
Well, cost and Moore's laws we're bringing down the cost.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:17.360
It's inexpensive.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.440
I mean, if you're not in the US, it's quite expensive

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:19.940
in the US.

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.960
But if you go to Asia where the success rates are actually

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.160
quite high, a cycle of IVF is a few thousand dollars.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.080
It's not very expensive.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.560
Oh, I was talking about genotyping.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.720
Oh, the genotyping is, yeah, we still need to accumulate

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:30.360
all that data.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.800
It's getting closer to $1,000.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.300
Correct.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:32.640
Correct.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.360
Closer to $100, which will be in the next.

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:38.760
So my prediction actually is that if you define genius

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.080
as having a particular IQ score, not having

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080
some outstanding unique contribution,

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.160
but just the IQ part of it, humans

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:45.960
are going to be much.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:48.240
There are going to be many more geniuses of that type

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.520
on this planet 50 years from now than there are today.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.400
Because I think there's going to be an incredible increase

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.080
in human intelligence.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:58.120
Because it's a bit of a place to live.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:58.640
Yeah.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.320
We'll need them to fight the rise of the machines.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.280
Well, that'll be the big fight.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.760
I hope Schwarzenegger is still alive.

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.760
General intelligence.

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm sure this is on that note.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:11.500
Yeah.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:15.440
And that is what I'm sure this has stimulated a lot

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.440
of interesting questions from the audience.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.760
So we'd like to open it up to people

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.000
if you would line up at the microphone.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.640
And please speak in the form of a brief question.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.960
My takeaway from what you said is in terms

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.200
of the title of the roundtable, Understanding Genius,

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.840
is that we don't.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:50.640
That there is no objective reality of genius.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:57.040
The very many variants that high IQ alone is not good.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:59.040
If you have a high IQ and sit in a room

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.800
and don't achieve something, not necessarily a genius.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:12.080
So I'm unclear about what understanding genius does

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.240
unless it's to ultimately, scientifically,

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.280
manipulate wherever the criteria you want

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.000
to use to call genius.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.860
Because a great warfare, we've had

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:27.120
authors that are genius, but they're

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.880
not capable of being reproduced or tested.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.520
So that's what my takeaway is.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.160
Am I being too narrow in my understanding of what you said?

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.880
I think your characterization is fair.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.320
I mean, you're talking about a very complex aspect

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.520
of human achievement.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.880
And it's not going to be something we can just bottle

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.680
and or define very precisely in a few sentences.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.800
So yeah, we're studying.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.480
We have a historian and a psychologist.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.480
I brought a thermos hoping that you could bottle it.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.080
I'm going to take it back.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.840
But I'm very much a joyous.

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:02.680
I hope he didn't pay to get in here.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.240
Pardon me?

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.120
I hope he didn't pay to get in.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:12.320
I'm hearing a genius scholarship.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.280
But I can't say that we're making progress in two areas,

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.680
identifying talents that can become future geniuses,

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.400
and then developing environments that encourage

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.600
the development of those talents.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.040
But have you ever find it?

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.040
Is there some objective?

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:32.160
We're identifying genius.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:33.200
How do you define it?

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:33.800
Well, talents.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.240
I mean, individual talents, mathability,

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.440
the study of automatically precocious youth

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.920
is a very good example with Benbo and Lubinsky.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.360
But it is a label that you put on after you think this

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.560
is something that's a genius.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.720
Well, it's even worthy of labeling genius.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.600
But don't be a little labeling.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.920
Because a lot of the people be conscientious once they've

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.240
been identified as a genius.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.000
Yeah, and it's a particularly important label,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.920
mathematically, mathematically, precocity.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.360
And now they're looking at visual spatial precocity.

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.120
Some of these particular talents, I think,

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.480
are very important for life outcomes.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.480
And whether they become geniuses or not,

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:15.000
we need this human capital, which is another term

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.240
that they use in future generations.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:20.960
This human capital, whether it becomes genius or not,

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.720
is incredibly important and cultivate.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:27.000
The variables, the components of achievement, are worthy.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.560
But the label genius.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.600
Two people could look at these variables

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.280
and one say that's a genius and the other say that's a fun thing.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.120
You know what they say about pornography, right?

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.120
Yeah.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.040
You know what we see it?

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.920
You know what the Supreme Court says about it.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.720
So I think we could make a list of 100 candidates

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:46.320
for genius category.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.160
And probably we'd agree on 90% of it.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.200
There might be 10% that we wouldn't.

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.240
So if that's enough to stop you from wanting to proceed further,

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.520
then fine, we can work further on the definition.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.520
But I think we have a kind of definition

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.640
that I think is largely agreed upon here.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.640
I think you can talk about, well, is there an IQ threshold?

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.280
How do we identify these people early?

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.960
Is there a way to measure their creativity when they're 14?

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.400
Those are all things that people work on quite a bit.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.920
And so I think there is progress, but it's certainly not

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.920
an answered.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.320
There are no concrete answers to all these things.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320
Isn't that okay?

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320
Yeah.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.280
Yeah, I think you were accurate.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:18.840
Thank you.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840
Yeah.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:21.840
Yes.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.800
I'm wondering how much of what we attribute to geniuses

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:28.320
is due to the time and the environment they live in,

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.160
as opposed to what they've actually done.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.720
If Einstein wasn't around 100 years ago,

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.160
would somebody else have come up with the theory?

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.600
And also if Einstein lived now, would he come up with a theory

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:43.520
that explains what we can't do now?

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.920
There's a very interesting phenomenon

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.920
which we haven't talked about in science

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.440
called multiple discovery in a dimension, where two of my people

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.720
come up with the same idea totally independently

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720
of one another.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.840
And that's often taken.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.640
And I've actually done some research on that,

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.440
and empirical research on that, and fit

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.920
some mathematical models to explain it.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.640
One of the things that's interesting about it,

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.160
if you look at it very carefully, though,

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:09.000
is that you can go ahead and say, well, yeah,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.240
both Newton and Leidenitz came up with the calculus,

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.200
for example, or both Wallace and Darwin

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:18.440
came up with a theory of evolution by natural selection.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:21.360
But if you look at the theories very carefully,

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.760
or the inventions very carefully, they're not the same.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:28.760
Newton's calculus and Leidenitz's calculus

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.960
is very, very different, not just notationally,

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.920
but in the general philosophical orientation.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.160
And in fact, a number of historians of mathematics

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.920
argued that the commitment of British mathematics

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:43.760
to Newton's version of calculus set back mathematics

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:46.160
in Britain relative to the continent,

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.120
where they were using Leidenitzian form of it.

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.640
And you can see the same thing with Darwin and Wallace.

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.360
They actually had a different version of evolutionary theory.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.440
Darwin thought that human beings could be included

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:04.040
in natural and sexual selection, and Wallace did not.

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.800
So what that means is that you would have gotten

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.600
a different history of mathematics,

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.160
or different history of evolutionary theory,

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.560
if one of those had died in the crib.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:19.920
So because each one has something unique

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.840
that they're contributing.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:25.560
Do you think we'd be in a different place now?

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.040
I think we would be in it.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.560
I mean, this is all hypothetical, right?

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.280
But you're talking about multiple universes.

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.960
There may have been another universe out there.

01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.560
There was a Wallace universe.

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.080
What?

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.120
We're in the Darwin universe.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:35.620
Right.

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.720
There's another one with the Wallace.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.680
Wallace published first.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.680
Yeah, right.

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.200
Right.

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.320
Exactly.

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.480
My answer to your question is that these things

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.520
are very contingent.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.640
Any great achievement is very contingent.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.000
So if Einstein had been born at a different time,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
a different place, he would probably

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.240
be recognized as a very insightful smart guy.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:52.840
But he certainly wouldn't, almost certainly,

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.200
wouldn't have this reputation that he has in our world.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.400
Right.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.280
Another point I'd like to make is that,

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.600
what was the other point I was going to make?

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.560
Oh, Einstein actually, technically,

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.760
in terms of his mathematical ability, was not that strong.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.800
And so if he were today trying to do string theory,

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.200
I think he would have quite a difficult time.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:13.040
So the great Harvard biologist Stephen J. Gould

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.480
had a line where he said, I'm less

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.600
interested in the shape of Einstein's brain

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.880
and more interested in the people of his skills who

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.640
died working in rice fields or what have you.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.400
And that does point to the role that context plays.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.840
And we can all do this.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.640
You can cluster genius.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:35.400
4th century BC Athens, 15th century Florence, New York

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.560
in the 1950s, when you've got these really highly creative

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:42.200
minds all working around common problems,

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.000
that does something, Silicon Valley in the 1980s.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:45.480
No, yeah.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.200
But there's a really interesting example.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.200
If you've mentioned the Einstein example,

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:53.120
when the Nazis took over Germany,

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:56.080
they started rewriting the history of physics,

01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:57.880
because they didn't like the fact that there

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.920
were too many high quality Jewish physics.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.920
Jewish physics.

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:02.280
Yeah, that was right.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.920
And so it was actually one guy named Stark, notorious,

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.800
not see theoretical physicists.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.800
And so he wrote a book on famous physicists.

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.840
And it's very interesting, because most of the names

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.200
look very, very familiar until you get to the 1930s.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.720
And all of a sudden, where you would expect a biography

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:26.240
of Einstein to be, there's a biography of Hasenro.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.800
How many of you have heard of Hasenro?

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.280
I've heard of Hasenro.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:37.280
Hasenro actually came up with all the things in Einstein's theory

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.880
that was important, which means non-Jewish.

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.280
The non-Jewish portion of it.

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:46.080
And then everything else, of course, could be dismissed.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.360
And there were some things.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.320
Hasenro did work on the early stages of relativity theory

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:52.480
and what have you.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.600
But he wasn't on Einstein.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:58.560
But it's an illustration of how the cultural context,

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.400
of course, unfortunately, that was a temporary one.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.920
But what if the Nazis had won?

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.840
There you go.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.320
Then we wouldn't be talking about Einstein.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.240
We'd be talking about Hasenro.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.080
Well, I think even the history that we have is not reliable.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.720
So I think if you looked carefully,

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.760
you would find grotesque distortions

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760
in some of our histories.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.280
Exactly.

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280
Yeah.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.440
Is there any evidence that Jesus are happy?

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.320
Oh.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.760
Well, I think life satisfaction is actually,

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.880
correct me if I'm wrong, somewhat positively correlated

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.240
with IQ, right?

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.160
So that vague sense.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.960
I don't know that geniuses are necessarily tortured people.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.560
I knew Richard Feynman.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.640
He was quite happy.

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.320
Terry Tao seems quite happy.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.160
So that's anecdotal.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.360
It's anecdotal.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.960
Well, I gave you the statistical result, which is pretty dry.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.360
This is just positive correlation.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.680
But there is a problem that, again,

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.280
we have to talk about different domains.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.200
Because one of the nice things about working in the sciences

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:00.480
of mathematics is you know when you're doing good stuff.

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:03.240
You can go ahead and work out the equations, double check.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.520
You're math to make sure.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.200
But if you get the answer, you've got the answer.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:10.200
But what?

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.520
And I've done research, too, and showing that the consensus,

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.960
like, for example, in the hard sciences,

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.760
they recognize up and coming stars very, very quickly.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.120
Because they know what's good and what's not.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.800
But if you're in the arts, you know,

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:28.320
that struggling artist in the attic, it often happens.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.120
You're not immediately recognized.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.080
So is it the recognition that makes them happy?

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.320
Or is it the higher?

01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.160
Well, sometimes it's a two-inch sword.

01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.960
You know, you have someone like Truman Capote.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.800
Yeah, it's really great, you know, to get recognized very early.

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.240
But then all of a sudden, there's more pressure on you

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.480
if you're a next novel.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:46.840
You're the one hit wonder, yeah.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:49.200
Yeah, and you're just going to parties and getting drunk.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.320
And people were asking about your next novel.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.520
So I wrote a history of happiness before I worked on genius.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.440
So I've thought about this a little bit.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.920
And the thing that I would say is

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.680
that there's clearly a myth associated

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.000
with genius that correlates with unhappiness,

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.760
with mental instability, and so forth.

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.560
So we talked about Aristotle's theory

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:14.120
of that people of eminent achievement

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.200
have a superabundance of black bile, of melan, ochre,

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.160
and the Greek, they're melan

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.560
and that idea gets kind of reinvented in the Renaissance

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.800
and then again in romanticism.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.640
And you get this idea, which I think is still part of our culture,

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:30.960
that sadness is profound and happiness is sort of superficial,

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.440
that to think and think deeply, you know,

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.760
is like Walter Benjamin says, you know,

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.920
every document of Western civilization is a document of barbarism, right?

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.360
That truth is somehow dark.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.280
Now there may be something to that.

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.600
But I think it's also a kind of stylization in a myth.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.960
And that, as you say, you know, Richard Feimand,

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.640
Einstein was comparatively happy.

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:53.960
You know, in Silicon Valley, they're all really happy.

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:54.960
Yeah.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:55.960
Yeah.

01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:56.960
Rich, serious.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.760
Money does buy.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.560
So this isn't exactly a question, but sort of an observation.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:07.200
So I think what the public typically recognizes as genius,

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.640
finding, hitting the target that no one even saw before.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:13.520
So it's highly specialized in a particular niche.

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:16.320
So if you think about Mozart, was Mozart also

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.760
a great mathematician?

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760
Probably not.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.520
So that in itself is some kind of a clue

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.680
that it isn't a general brain mechanism.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:27.680
Just maybe you can comment on that.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.080
Well, why wouldn't it be a general brain?

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.680
So you can have domain specificity.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.840
And you can have, but I think, you know,

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840
to, again, to have these modules of the brain,

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.480
there's a module for art and there's a module for math

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.600
and there's a module for basketball

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.240
and there's a module for this.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.400
I mean, it doesn't make it.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.080
It doesn't make sense, right?

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.840
So there has to be some general characteristics

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.640
of brain functioning that come to play.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.880
It's up in math and not in art or the philosophy.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.160
Well, I don't know.

01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.040
I mean, you know, historically, actually,

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.040
the idea has been that genius is a, you're born with it.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:04.920
It has to be original.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920
It can't be learned.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:08.280
Talent can be learned and acquired, but not genius.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.120
And it's applicable to multiple domains, right?

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.080
So that Mozart made a choice early on,

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:15.840
but he could have gone another way.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.160
And then you get examples of people

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:20.200
who have genius level capacity in multiple domains,

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.480
like Goethe, right, who is a kind of genius in poetry

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:25.320
and playwriting, good scientist to boot and so forth.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.360
But I suspect that there's this general module

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.320
wherever you went.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.880
There's this general brain module or general network

01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:34.120
that comes to play, regardless of the individual domain

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.000
that you practice.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
What it might be that genius is more recognized

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.800
in the sciences and in literature

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:44.320
and that there are genius capabilities that go less

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:48.320
recognized, but this human capacity

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.840
is quite general capability.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.800
I'd like to just tell us how it's an approach to,

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.000
like, intelligence that's kind of emerging now

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.080
because until 50 years ago, very few educators

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.400
even knew what a brain was.

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.080
Like, they thought your brain was actually

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.240
a storage place in your body for sperm.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.360
I mean, that's just true.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.320
But I have a little video just to put what I'm going to say

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320
in context.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.040
It's called, where I have five-year-olds

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.240
who talk about life with more than most adults

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.480
and the five-year-olds from New York,

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:25.320
and they say, no adults left behind.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.320
But I've asked over 30 professors

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.800
just to put this in context.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.720
If they knew the etymology, the word intelligence,

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.080
which has been brought up today, none of them have known.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:36.480
I'm just curious if any of you know

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.600
the etymology of intelligence, which you might have known

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.040
in the second grade.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.640
Do any of you know?

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.560
OK, if you just cut the word in half,

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:45.640
intelli means between the other half of the word is

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.880
legary, which means to choose.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.640
Intelligence literally means to choose between,

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.440
that you're not using your brain supposedly

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.760
until you're making a choice.

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.560
OK.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.640
But the point where I'm coming from

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.400
is that basically the way the brain

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.880
works with the new research and brain research now,

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.920
basically the way your eyes work is the way your brain works.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:10.000
That's why you say, I see what you mean.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.480
I use my imagination.

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.840
But ironically, you cannot see, as you know,

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.040
without moving your eyes.

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:18.280
You have a fovea, narrow point.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.720
So you have to be moving your eyes very.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:23.320
So they say in a state of nature,

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.080
when a human being, like I said, we all live in the Amazon

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.960
rainforest, we've been moving our eyes

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.280
left, right, up, down all the time,

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.280
and our brains evolved that way.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.920
So in the state of nature, a human brain

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:38.000
evolved to be aware of seven streams of awareness simultaneously.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.760
That's why seven is the sacred number.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.000
When we lock up our eyes on static letters we read and write,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.680
we actually atrophy the way our brain operates,

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.960
and we go from seven, like, to one.

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.000
So when you hear that a human brain is naturally,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.400
and maybe these people in these genius states,

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.000
are more open that they're not locked in to just doing

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.760
what they've been told.

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.320
So they're moving their eyes.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.400
Their brain is open, and they have access

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.800
to that seven, the natural sacred number.

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:08.160
And because they do, they maybe have taken a stroll

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.640
at a Plato's cave with the shadows or letters on the...

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.040
But what about, you know, when you hear about the seven point

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.120
natural awareness and the craziness that we're going down,

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.960
we're dumbing ourselves down, atrophying the way our brain

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.520
works from seven to one, because we're locking up our eyes

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.560
on letters, and a letter in a name is actually just a name

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.640
for an object or an image.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.560
It's a sound that doesn't mean anything.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.040
Can you do me a favor and ask the question?

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:39.080
Because you keep going around, and we're the best ones.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.520
It's the seven point awareness that is a natural part of us

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:44.600
that's been covered up.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:46.280
And now that it could be opened up,

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.720
and people could have access to it,

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:51.080
and you say maybe genius comes from having access to that.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:53.160
What do you think about that is the new research

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.520
that's taking us in that direction?

01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.520
I can address that.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600
That's bunk.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.600
So...

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.600
That's what?

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600
Bunk.

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600
According to who?

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.600
Me.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:06.600
So...

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.600
So you said so many things that I could disagree with,

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600
but I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.600
So we know very little about how the brain actually functions

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.600
as neuroscientists.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.600
So a lot of the assertions that you make are fundamentally flawed.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:27.600
I think that the basis of your question is that you're getting

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.600
to a point where you think that people are using their brain

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:33.600
in a different way that you think is flawed, correct?

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.600
No, it's not me.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:36.600
It's like...

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600
And just...

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.600
All this stuff is coming out of behavioral obtitration training.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.600
Here's what I'd like to say about that.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:44.600
People are using their brain in a different way,

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.600
and it's being optimized to their environment.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:51.600
So that optimization to the environment just reflects a new environment.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.600
It's a different environment, but it's a new environment

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.600
that that brain's being optimized for.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:58.600
I think we should get to the next question.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600
Okay.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.600
Thank you.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600
Thank you.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:02.600
Thank you.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.600
Hello.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:04.600
Hi.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.600
Good afternoon.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:10.600
I came in towards the latter part, but I have a question regarding

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.600
inheritance of genetic genius, so to speak.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:17.600
I don't know how you would put that in factor.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.600
I'm one of a multiple birth of triplets, two boys and a girl.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:27.600
And basically, a lot of the factors that I noticed in the geniuses

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.600
in the family is that literally we can master things at a early age,

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.600
since like seven, eight, nine, ten years old, and we're everyone.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.600
This is from the 60s and 70s.

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600
I'm last at a baby boomers.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600
So, yes.

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.600
You and me both.

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:40.600
Yeah.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:41.600
I'm 51.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.600
It feels great.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.600
But it doesn't feel so great to me, but...

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600
I'm doing yum.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.600
I'm doing yum.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.600
The factor is that my brothers, I'm the only girl.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:57.600
So, the two identical boys, I'm wondering if this is a factor.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.600
The first boy was born.

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:03.600
I had my own embryonic sac, which I call my condo.

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:05.600
I came between the second.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.600
I came as the second.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.600
And then the third one, the two identical boys were separated.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:15.600
I came between, and I didn't understand if that was a factor of what happened

01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:20.600
to the oldest boy, because things started happening.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.600
Ten, psychologically.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:28.600
And I wanted me coming between the two births of the two boys.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600
It became...

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:33.600
You know, only God knows, but the family always said, it was you.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.600
You came between the two identical boys.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.600
He separated them.

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.600
And, you know, I know what he says.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:39.600
He said, talk.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600
I think you answered your own question.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600
Only God knows that.

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.600
Yeah.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.600
And trust me, that's been my sanity.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.600
But the fact of my question is, again, is...

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:55.600
They were geniuses way before I considered myself a genius,

01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:59.600
because where they mastered technology in old school days,

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.600
there was always a motherboard hanging around the technology,

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.600
the big zen of TV tubes.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.600
I'm seven years old.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:08.600
Everyone's sitting in the living room.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.600
I know how to go on the back and fix the zen of tubes.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:16.600
Take the ones that's in the kitchen cabinet and fix the TV in the back

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.600
and just sit back down and look again at the TV.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.600
And everybody's like, what did you just do?

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:23.600
How did you just do that?

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.600
There's a lot of things I've done in my life.

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.600
I could never explain on 51.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.600
I still can't explain.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.600
But it can come to me with numbers, even visions.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:35.600
And I can master it, where it takes someone to go to school for eight years,

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600
even to get a master's degree.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:43.600
So on that factor, it's kind of coming to me later now than earlier.

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.600
And I was trying to figure out the geniality of it, you know,

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.600
the inheritance.

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.600
But, yeah, techs, doctors, lawyers, easy age.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:54.600
Like, we can master it.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.600
I studied neurosurgery since it's great.

01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.600
Can I actually say something?

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.600
Okay.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.600
So you raised an issue that we actually didn't talk about.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600
Actually, a couple issues that we didn't talk about.

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:04.600
Oh, okay.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600
I thought I missed it.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600
Yeah.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.600
There's so many things that you could talk about in this topic.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600
Okay.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.600
And one thing that is really interesting to me is there is some work

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:22.600
on the intrauterine environment as a factor in the emergence of at least certain kinds

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.600
of genius.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.600
And like, there's something called a, I mean, it's not completely established.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.600
Here's another good notion, right?

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:36.600
That the interuterine environment can influence brain growth at a very early age

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.600
that has lifelong consequences, particularly for developing certain kinds of

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:48.600
exceptional abilities like in mathematics or music, for example.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:51.600
But we still don't understand it.

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:55.600
But we do know, I mean, obviously brain chemists is being influenced by that which

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.600
ambiotic society you happen to be in, right?

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600
If it's a different one than others.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.600
Yeah, we just...

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:05.600
Another issue thanks to your prompt is birth order.

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.600
It was actually Francis Galton who did the first study of birth order.

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:13.600
And of course, you have two brothers.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:19.600
Birth order interacts with gender as well.

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.600
I mean, I did a study, really interesting study.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.600
Well, we researchers always think we do really interesting studies.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600
You may disagree.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.600
You actually do interesting studies.

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.600
But I did a study of eminent women in psychology, eminent scientists in psychology.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:42.600
And women, and comparing them to comparably eminent men, looking at birth order.

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.600
And I found that there's a tendency for...

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600
And this is just a scenario.

01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:56.600
A tendency for not only for women to be firstborns, firstborns are overrepresented

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600
among scientists, okay?

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.600
But they're even more likely to be firstborns than melisar.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:05.600
And they're even more likely to come from smaller families.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:10.600
And they're extremely unlikely to have older brothers, which is spoil things.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.600
Development of talented female scientists.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.600
So there's all these other factors.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.600
You know, it's a whimsical thing like birth order.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.600
Yeah.

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.600
Or, you know, the chemistry of your intrauterine environment can have...

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:28.600
Let me just get you another arbitrary thing.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.600
It's sort of like birth order, but even more arbitrary than birth order.

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:35.600
There was a study done of music competitions.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600
You know, these big things like the...

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600
You know, clivering kind of competition.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.600
People come in.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.600
They play a piece of music.

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:49.600
And they deliberately have a piece of music that nobody knows, including the judges,

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.600
to equalize things.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.600
So they're all doing the rock, mononoth, third or something.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:48:00.600
And what's interesting is that they find that the people are more likely to win the prize

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.600
or the people will perform later in the competition,

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.600
because by then everybody's more familiar with this new piece of music.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.600
They've heard all the little glitches.

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.600
And it's, by the way, it's random assignment.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.600
It's random assignment.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.600
What order you perform?

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.600
Okay.

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.600
Just to...

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.600
Okay.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:24.600
I mostly among creative people, spent among creative people.

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:30.600
Artists, poets, and writers.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:40.600
And I could say that among artists, it's very few really intelligent people.

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:44.600
And...

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.600
Better you said that than him.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:55.600
So much more among poets and more among writers.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:03.600
And they try to suppress their intelligence with the legal drugs very often.

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:16.600
So my first question about how you can comment that people deliberately try to suppress

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:21.600
their intelligence with the legal drugs to be more creative.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:33.600
And second question is, it's several years ago I read about several women who took sperm

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:41.600
from noble lawyers and give blood to kids.

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:52.600
And then when these kids start to grow, they encounter very big problems how to raise them.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:50:03.600
And now they fighting for ability to learn who really drew their parents and how they can connect with these kids.

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:10.600
Because it was like manipulation of genetics.

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:20.600
And it seems like you have at least two loved person who give blood to your child that understands what is going on.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:24.600
Because they just don't understand.

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:32.600
And they are autistic with problems and they don't get also suffering.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:33.600
They don't know what to do.

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:41.600
So if we manipulate genetics of our kids we won't know how to deal with it.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:53.600
So that's two questions, the legal drugs and if we manipulate genetics would be recognizing and going to raise our kids.

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:57.600
Can I address the first question if I understood it correctly?

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.600
About suppressing intelligence in the...

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.600
Because it won't go for artists in musicians.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:08.600
Since we're at the Sacramento-Liddick Institute I should bring in Freud at least somewhere.

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:14.600
Freud actually addressed this issue and one of his essays he was dealing with the question,

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:20.600
why is it that critics aren't very creative?

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:27.600
They know everything about films, they know everything about novels, everything about poetry.

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.600
They can't create one themselves.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.600
And he specifically said...

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:33.600
And they know that, right?

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:37.600
And it's because they're 100% secondary process.

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:41.600
They never allow the primary process any latitude.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:47.600
The second the primary process is coming with some kind of crazy idea, it's merely squelch.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.600
By the super eager...

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.600
That would make a lousy movie.

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:56.600
I mean Dean's theory seems very plausible to me because I think if you want to be open to the creative process

01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.600
you maybe want to suspend judgment.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:04.600
And the kind of thing we call intelligence is a kind of analytical judgment that maybe you're trying to suppress

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:06.600
when you try to get new influences.

01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:13.600
As far as your second question, so I think there's been at least one book written about the Nobel Prize sperm bank.

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:20.600
And oftentimes when people review that book, because they don't think statistically they just think anecdotally,

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.600
they try to portray it as a huge failure or something.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.600
But if you just made a prediction based on genetics of what would happen if you took sperm from a bunch of Nobel laureates

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.600
and you gave it to a bunch of recipients, you'd probably say that the kids will be somewhat higher in IQ

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.600
on average because they're getting genes from a high IQ, at least one of their parents is high IQ

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:40.600
and probably the other one maybe as well.

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:45.600
Secondly, maybe some eccentricities like things like autism might be more prevalent in that population.

01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.600
And I think that's roughly what was found.

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:54.600
So I don't think it's more or less conforms with what just on the basis of genetic theory you would predict would have happened

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.600
with this sperm bank.

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:01.600
Now some people who wrote the books on this would say, oh well it's awful that it didn't produce another Nobel Prize winner.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.600
It should have definitely produced a Nobel Prize winner otherwise it's a failure.

01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:06.600
But I think that's going way too far.

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:12.600
No, I'm thinking about how today as a child that you don't have any connection.

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.600
That's the point of what is the beginning?

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.600
Is it just little kids?

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.600
These women don't know how to raise them.

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:28.600
They have very big difficulties with these kids because they cannot connect with them at all.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:29.600
I see.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:35.600
Is it different than the problem they say a parent of an autistic child would have?

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.600
Similar?

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.600
No, maybe similar.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600
I don't know.

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:40.600
I'm not a human.

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:45.600
I don't know.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:49.600
I don't know.

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:53.600
But there must be also, I would predict some similarities between the child and the mother.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:58.600
And you would think the maternal love is still there and everything.

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:03.600
I wouldn't expect it to be as quite as bad as you described it.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.600
Okay.

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.600
Okay.

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:13.600
Well, I have some problems with the language you've been using and I have a problem with

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.600
the concept of IQ test.

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:21.600
First of all, genius, maybe the word is been overused.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:28.600
Maybe we should say creativity because genius has so many problems connected to it.

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:34.600
The other aspect of things, the IQ test.

01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:38.600
Well, I find it a very problematic thing.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:47.600
And I always see the creative individual as having a mode of thinking maybe with different

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.600
synapses, different ways of approaching something.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.600
And an IQ test is too standardized.

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:59.600
And I remember taking when I was so bored that I decided I couldn't bother with it.

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:02.600
And I looked at my neighbor and I said, I'll just copy that.

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:06.600
And they told me, oh, you're a wonderful, you're an average person.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.600
I said, oh, thank you.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:14.600
But I think we have to find a different way to define intelligence.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:20.600
And I think it's a very complex, the way creative people think.

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.600
There is some form of deviancy even.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.600
Maybe they can't even deal with the normal situations of things.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.600
Sometimes I think of it as the pearl that has an irritant and they have to find a way around

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.600
a problem.

01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.600
So I think the problem in the brain is not going to be very standardized.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.600
It's going to be a very common, I'm an artist.

01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:48.600
But it's a very complex aspect of how different synapses connect different things.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:54.600
And creativity lies in this strange way of organizing and assimilating the world.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.600
And we have so much knowledge now that it's true.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:03.600
One of the problems you brought up is for true creativity, it's very difficult because there's

01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.600
so much more of a branch of knowledge than even Leonardo da Vinci had to have.

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.600
And I know they're not questions, but I can try.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:13.600
And what question?

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600
You want questions?

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.600
All right.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.600
Well, the question is the structure of the brain.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.600
Can it be measured by an IQ test?

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.600
Are we really speaking about the true measurement?

01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:30.600
And the other thing is the conflict between individual intelligence and collective intelligence

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.600
where a group of individuals are working out a problem together.

01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.600
Then we're into another problem.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.600
But I'll just keep the structural problem of the brain.

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.600
Do we really know what intelligence is or how it operates?

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.600
That's your question, Guy.

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.600
So we've correlated intelligence tests with the structure of the brain.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:57.600
Many researchers have done this and found the correlations to be low, but significant

01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:58.600
across studies.

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:05.600
So I wrote a paper in 2007 in behavioral and brain sciences where I reviewed all the

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:09.600
studies looking at the correlations between the structure of the brain and these various

01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.600
measures of intelligence.

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.600
And that's called the parietal frontal integration theory of intelligence.

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:21.600
So it summarizes kind of a network in the brain that underlies the ability of humans

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:28.600
anyway to express intelligent behavior as manifested on these particular kinds of tests.

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:35.600
So there is a significant correlate between the structure of the brain and performance

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.600
on these tests.

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.600
As you would expect, whether it's creativity, personality, intelligence, just about anything

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:49.600
our brain does, motor behavior, there's going to be some correlates that are found in the

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:52.600
brain and certainly we found that with intelligence.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.600
I would have addressed the collective intelligence idea because this gets back to what we talked

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:02.600
about earlier about collaboration being very important in certain fields, picking the

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.600
sciences.

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:11.600
And one thing I think is fascinating is that there's a kind of isomorphism between how

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:18.600
creativity operates in a group and how creativity operates within a single individual who's

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:19.600
highly creative.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.600
What I mean by that is we mentioned earlier that highly creative people tend to score

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:28.600
very high on openness to experience and they have multicultural experiences.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.600
They have lots of very wide interests.

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:35.600
They're just very, very open to a lot of different possibilities.

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.600
They have a lot of different hobbies.

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.600
There's one interesting study for example that stratified scientists from the elite of

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:48.600
Nobel laureates to only members of the National Academy of Sciences.

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:55.600
And then people who didn't even get that high and looked at their their educational interests.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.600
And it was beautiful.

01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.600
More artistic interests as you go higher up.

01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:05.600
So diversity is really interesting.

01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:06.600
They're complexity.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:11.600
They're heterogeneity of their minds, their interests, and their even their expertise.

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.600
I think I could play the piano.

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:14.600
I can also sell a book.

01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:17.600
I don't know how much expertise is involved in that.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:24.600
If you look at groups, when the main predictors are creativity in a group is how heterogeneous

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.600
the group membership is.

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.600
Do they differ in their training?

01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.600
Do they differ in gender?

01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.600
Do they differ in ethnicity?

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.600
It's an amazing phenomenon that really diverse groups.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.600
So in a sense what you do, you're having is instead of having all that diversity in a

01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:48.600
single brain, you're having a division of labor, of diversity is distributed within the group

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.600
membership working on a problem.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.600
It becomes a neural net that solves problems.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:52.600
Yeah, neural net work.

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:57.600
You have to have lots of different abilities to be able to solve that problem well.

01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:58.600
Okay.

01:59:58.600 --> 01:59:59.600
Hi.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:00.600
Dr.

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.600
I have like two five second questions.

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:07.600
Yeah, it's okay.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.600
In the forms of question.

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.600
Yeah.

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:11.600
Wow.

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:17.600
The first one is working hand in hand was mentioned in lateral conductivity.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:21.600
I was wondering if there's anything left and right brain balancing.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:24.600
There are brain balancing centers.

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:26.600
Yeah, I can answer that very quickly.

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.600
So this left brain right thing is considered to be neuro mythology at this point.

02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:37.600
And certainly you need all of your brain to do creative tasks as you do intelligent tasks.

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:44.600
So this comes from work by Spery and Gazanica in the 1970s who did corpus callosodemies on

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.600
patients with epilepsy is a long story.

02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:49.600
But they found that the hemisphere's function rather differently.

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.600
Language tends to be in the left hemisphere and nonverbal stuff tends to be in the right hemisphere.

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:57.600
It's got taken up by the popular press like wildfire.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:01.600
The one is intensely active, the other one is not nearly as active.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.600
No.

02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:05.600
This is working on activating the other one with certain activities.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:11.600
So during creative activity the activation pattern is moving around during in these different

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:15.600
networks and there's probably suppression of different parts of the brain, activation of

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.600
the other different parts of the brain, but that moves around from place to place.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:20.600
It's not isolated.

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:21.600
It's not isolated.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:29.600
The other question is, any research on proactively cultivating EQ and the correlation with a rise

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.600
in IQ as a result?

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.600
This is an easy question because I don't know hardly anything about EQ.

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.600
I would expect, I think, you might know something a little bit about EQ that is probably a little,

02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:53.600
it is emotional intelligence or emotional intelligence is going to be somewhat positively related to

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.600
intelligence because of the general factor of intelligence.

02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:59.600
I would guess, but I don't know anything beyond that.

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:04.600
The problem is that the psychometric properties have emotional intelligence.

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:07.600
It's not at the same level.

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.600
It turns out to be a very heterogeneous construct.

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.600
It's just sort of like creativity in comparison to general intelligence.

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:17.600
So it's a real mess.

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.600
You know what's going on?

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:24.600
There's no correlation study as far as, oh, you work hard on raising your kids EQ that would

02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:25.600
really be a good question.

02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:26.600
I don't know if any of these.

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.600
I mean, there may be, I wouldn't know.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.600
But I would like to answer that.

02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.600
I don't know if this is valid or not, but I've never seen some study where, at the point of this,

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.600
you know, this mythology of, you know, writers of left hemisphere, it was very interesting

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.600
that my dad was, maybe his hope or something like the HOPPE.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:44.600
Yeah.

02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:45.600
Yeah.

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:46.600
Yeah.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:52.600
And it was something about that they can't understand metaphor because they have to put

02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:57.600
things together from both sides of the brain.

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.600
Like, you might like a neurological study of patients.

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:07.600
And, yeah, and one of the experiments I thought was really brilliant is that you show people

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:15.600
a film clip where there's a kid playing on a swing and then a ball goes out in the street

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:21.600
and the kid definitely runs out in the street and then all of a sudden you just see this

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:22.600
empty swing.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.600
Yeah, what happens next?

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:25.600
Yeah.

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.600
Or what happened?

02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:27.600
Right.

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.600
What happened?

02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:33.600
And people who have normal intact corpus callosis figure that out and people who have split

02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:35.600
brains can't figure out what happened.

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:37.600
No, it gets weirder than that.

02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:41.600
You have patients that will be, you know, buttoning their shirt with one hand and unbuttoning

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.600
it with the other.

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.600
The two hemispheres function independently right after the surgery.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:50.600
So, yeah, friends like that.

02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:57.600
And if the hemispheres can't communicate from a neuropsychologist by training, from a neuropsychological

02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.600
perspective, it gets really interesting if you can show someone a key only in their right

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:09.600
hemisphere, for example, and you can do this with tekistoscopic presentation on the retina

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.600
and they can't access it, they can feel it, they can touch it, but they can't name it.

02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.600
They don't have access to the language module, they can't name the key.

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:25.100
It's really fascinating to see the modularity then of the brain functioning when you can

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.100
split the corpus callosis.

02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.600
So, if you want to increase your creativity, do not get a split brain.

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.600
No, no.

02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:34.600
You need both halves of your brain to be creative or intelligent.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.600
Or have personal...

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.600
Last three questions.

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:42.600
First of all, thank you for having the discussion and thank you for steaming it live.

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:47.600
My friend is watching it right now and he has the question, can you comment on the current

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:50.600
state of research on enhancing fluid intelligence?

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:54.600
Do we know of any methods just enhancing that part?

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:55.600
Enhancing, oh, yes.

02:04:55.600 --> 02:05:06.600
Yes, so Dr. Yege from California, UC Irvine, I believe she is at now, did some working

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.600
memory training to increase intelligence and the theory is that you can do this dual

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:17.600
and back type of, which is a very difficult task to do where you're keeping streams of

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:18.600
information going.

02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:20.600
Yeah, it's very unpleasant actually.

02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:26.600
You want to shoot yourself after you do this type of task, which is the best decision you

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:27.600
could make.

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:32.600
But the theory was that you did this working memory task and because the working memory

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:37.600
networks are parietal frontal distribution, overlap the intelligence networks, you could

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:39.600
increase your intelligence.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:47.600
So she published this in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and many

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:50.600
people have attempted to replicate this in different ways.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:57.600
She's replicated it and it's very equivocal about whether this actually does and the

02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.600
research.

02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:03.600
The best digestion of the research that I can give you is that there's near transfer and

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:04.600
far transfer.

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.600
And if you do a working memory task, you are likely to increase working memory, but the

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.600
likelihood of increasing intelligence, which is kind of far away, is rather low.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.600
If you do an attention task, you're likely to increase attention.

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:20.600
If you do a visual spatial task, you're likely to increase visual spatial ability.

02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:27.600
But to have that transfer to other tasks is not been well demonstrated through replication.

02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:33.600
We used to have that belief that brain exercise is good for you.

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:35.600
It's like exercising your muscles.

02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:40.600
It doesn't matter if you're lifting a dumbbell or whatever, you know, lifting up is lifting

02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:41.600
up.

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:46.600
It doesn't seem to be that case, you know, so...

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:47.600
Or that easy.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.600
Yeah, so that you say learn Latin and make sure it's smarter.

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:52.600
Well, no.

02:06:52.600 --> 02:06:54.600
I'd rather do the dual end back task.

02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.600
Yeah, you're right.

02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:57.600
No.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:58.600
Thank you.

02:06:58.600 --> 02:06:59.600
Next question.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:01.600
No, we had three.

02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.600
You're going to be the fourth.

02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:04.600
No.

02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:06.600
I have two there.

02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.600
Okay.

02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:08.600
All right.

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:09.600
Go ahead.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:14.600
But many years ago, I wrote a song called I Used to Think I Am a Genius.

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.600
My great fun singing that to roomfuls of genius.

02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:19.600
I just want to quote the last line.

02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:21.600
I used to think I'm a genius.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:22.600
Please don't ask me why.

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:24.600
But now I know I'm not a genius.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.600
I'm just a wonderful guy.

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:27.600
All right.

02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:28.600
Next.

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:29.600
Perfect.

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:39.600
I guess.

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:46.600
Is there a corollary for genius being attached to ineptitude in other areas such that people

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:51.600
like Einstein might not have been able to wash his clothes or set the table while he was,

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:56.600
you know, fastnesses of physics and so forth.

02:07:56.600 --> 02:08:01.600
I have noticed very, very intelligent people often don't manage without something to do

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:05.600
their washing or clothing or set the table or something like that.

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:06.600
Thank you.

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:08.600
I think that's a very interesting question.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:14.100
So there's a stereotype that we all know about, right, that the great genius can't handle

02:08:14.100 --> 02:08:16.600
everyday things, can't tie their shoes, they're clumsy.

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:21.600
And I'm guessing that if you're really careful, carefully study this issue, it's not true.

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:26.600
But I think that if you were intensely interested in your work and you just wanted to achieve

02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:31.600
in that narrow sphere as much as possible, it would be great if you could outsource your

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.600
daily task to someone else to help you free up.

02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:39.600
I really, I would love to see a study actually.

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.600
I mean, if you just look at the sort of not focused on genius, but just focused on sort

02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:48.600
of the broader population and sort of IQ, you find that people who have IQs, they tend to

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.600
also be good at lots of things, so they're not necessarily incapable.

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:58.600
And Terman actually found this, I think, in his group that they were quite healthy, physically

02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:03.600
strong, healthy group of people and they didn't seem to have particular handicaps.

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.600
But you mentioned, I mean, I think what it is, you do have these obviously strong cases,

02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:13.600
conspicuous cases like Albert Einstein, but even Hannah, you have to be very careful,

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.600
because a lot of times he was very smart.

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:18.600
I mean, yeah, he's got his priorities and he wants to work.

02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:23.600
So like, yeah, he didn't wear socks, okay?

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:26.600
But he had a very good reason for not wearing the socks.

02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.600
It's because he always got holes in them and he says, it's ridiculous.

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:32.600
Always wear something that you wear out.

02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.600
So he stopped wearing a sock.

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.600
He was once asked for his phone number and he said, well, okay, let me just see if I can find it.

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:41.600
And he said, you don't know your phone number?

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:46.600
And he says, I can always look it up.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.600
So I think that's actually smart.

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:52.600
He's got his priorities kind of organized in the right way.

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:58.600
And Carler with that is an outsized appetite, I think, goes with high intelligence such

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:03.600
that I know Einstein was very sexual with many women.

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:04.600
Many men are, of course.

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.600
But I think...

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:09.600
Or would like to see many women are...

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.600
That's part of the openness to experience.

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.600
That's part of the human experience.

02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:26.600
But I make a connection between an outsized brain with an outside need for food, perhaps

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.600
sexual appetites as well as other inputs that feed the creativity.

02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:34.600
And I don't think it's ridiculous to hypothesize that.

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:39.600
I mean, Newton never had a lover, another Emmanuel Kant.

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.600
But that connection between sexuality and genius is a long history.

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:46.600
In fact, the word genius that I mentioned before, Latin, comes from the Latin verb,

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:48.600
genogeneré, which means to generate.

02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:50.600
It gives us genes and genitals.

02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:55.600
And there's an association drawn very early on that productivity is somehow sexual.

02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:03.600
If you've ever seen the famous statue by Rodin of Balzac that's in the sixth hour when he's more of Paris,

02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.600
you know, he's in...

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.600
He always rode at night and he would wear these great overcoats.

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:11.600
And there's a kind of conspicuous bulge there in one part.

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:15.600
Well, in his studio afterwards, they found there are all these studies of Rodin holding his phallus.

02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:21.600
And so this is this kind of myth of the pro-dian artist who is sexual, but I think that's largely a myth.

02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.600
But nonetheless.

02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:31.600
It also touches upon perhaps something that we've not quite talked about.

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.600
I mean, it's been a very cortical-centric discussion.

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:41.600
But if somebody like Pang stuff is correct in terms of the seven areas of the brain stem,

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:51.600
seeking rage, lust, play, et cetera, then what contribution does this have to what we consider to be

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:54.600
hiding at higher levels of creativity, genius?

02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:55.600
Certainly.

02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:56.600
Yeah.

02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.600
I mean, it must be there somewhere.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:03.600
These very basic type of instinctual types of responses either have to be kept at bay

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:09.600
while we're doing those higher meaningful things or incorporated somehow.

02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:14.600
So they're open area of research and we must understand how they play.

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:17.600
And they may play out in these sexual appetites.

02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:20.600
They may play out in addictive appetites and other,

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.600
a pettitive type of behavior in very important ways that we don't understand.

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:26.600
I think that's fascinating.

02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:28.600
The last question is the...

02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:30.600
The last question.

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:31.600
The last question.

02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:32.600
The last question.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.600
Yours will be the last.

02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:40.600
About intelligence testing at the idea of stage before pre-implantation?

02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.600
Whatever is possible right now, how much would that cost?

02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:51.600
And if there's an equivalent of a more law, what we can expect that to cost in five or ten years?

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:58.600
Yeah, so the main issue now is the availability of large amount of data so you can build the predictive model.

02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:02.600
So we just don't have good predictive models for cognitive ability based on genotype now.

02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.600
We do for things like height and other things, but not for IQ yet.

02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:10.600
The cost is actually not very high.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:17.600
So the cost to do the genotype being is on the order of a few hundred dollars actually for that embryo.

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:20.600
And so I don't think the cost is the real barrier.

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:25.600
The barrier is just getting enough data so that you can build the predictive models.

02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:28.600
Do you think the open source or the data will be able to...

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:35.600
I think that these predictive models, whether they are predictive of disease conditions,

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:38.600
disease susceptibility or physical proportion, whatever it is,

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:43.600
they will be among the most valuable pieces of intellectual property

02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:48.600
because they basically deal with the internal blueprints of the human species.

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:53.600
And so whether they'll be open sourced, I don't know.

02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.600
Okay, last question.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.600
Edison, Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Steve Jobs, Branson, Newton.

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:07.600
They say they would dyslexic, right, and a lot of others.

02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:13.600
Is dyslexia a really a learning disability or is it something to do with the genius?

02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:19.600
And also the visual and verbal, right?

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:22.600
A lot of these people had visual thoughts.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:24.600
They didn't think verbally, right?

02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:31.600
So again, is dyslexia really a learning disability or is just a different way of thinking?

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:37.600
And people with dyslexia are being dictated by the people in the bell curve in the middle?

02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:39.600
With the learning side.

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:44.600
Well, from a neuropsychological perspective, dyslexia, reading is a relatively new human behavior

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:48.600
that's rather unusual for the brain to do, but the brain can do it.

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:52.600
And the brain of most people can do it, but the brain of some people cannot.

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:56.600
So dyslexia is an interesting neuropsychological phenomenon,

02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.600
and people who are dyslexic use their brains in different ways,

02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:07.600
and so they develop other strengths to compensate for this lack of reading ability.

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:10.600
And that may have something to do with their creative ability.

02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:17.600
And you do see some studies support an over-flight, over-representation of dyslexia and creative endeavors,

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:24.600
but I think there's something interesting there, but like the mad genius,

02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:25.600
I think we could...

02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:26.600
We have a mad genius, too.

02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:27.600
We wouldn't want to put too much in it.

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.600
There's something interesting there worth exploring, but we wouldn't want to have an equivalence.

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:38.600
Because your dyslexic means that you're more likely to become a genius.

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:40.600
The fact that you have a really high...

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:41.600
I wouldn't say that.

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.600
Well, though...

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:46.600
The fact that you have a really high IQ means that you're inevitably going to become a genius.

02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:52.600
It makes things more interesting as these things coalesce and come together in the individual brain

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.600
that you have a high IQ, and that you might be dyslexic,

02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:59.600
and that the conditions were right that genius may emerge,

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:05.600
but we don't have the recipe that gives you that inevitable.

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:12.600
It may not even be a recipe, because it could be that we have several alternative ways of attaining the same end.

02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:20.600
In fact, I had worked with a graduate student, and we published earlier this year a study we did in African Americans,

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.600
and the testis hypothesis.

02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:27.600
And this hypothesis is something we call diversifying experiences,

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:35.600
and that somehow we got to break a person away from the path of conventional thinking, conventional learning,

02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:39.600
towing a line, conforming to what everybody else believes.

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:41.600
If you're going to become a major innovator.

02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:46.600
The thing is, though, there's no one way you need to do that.

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:48.600
There are multiple ways you can do that.

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.600
So there's a large inventory of childhood experiences,

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:59.600
and things like both physical and cognitive disabilities are in that list,

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.600
that seem to have higher frequencies, but they're not high enough to say,

02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:07.600
well, that's essential.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:10.600
It's just one of several different options.

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:12.600
A parent dying is another one.

02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:13.600
Yeah, a parent dying, orphanhood.

02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:15.600
Another thing.

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:22.600
Some kind of trauma in early childhood often is associated with later creative achievement,

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:23.600
but you can have too much.

02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.600
We talk about a sweet spot.

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:30.600
So all these things you can collect, it can be one of those things, you know?

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.600
And then you find a sweet spot, and that sweet spot will vary according to other things.

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.600
So the reason why we're focused on African Americans is they obviously have a lot of diversifying experiences

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.600
beyond what majority culture Americans have to deal with,

02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:50.600
and we actually looked at things like major episode discrimination and things like that in their lives.

02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:53.600
These are all very eminent people.

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:57.600
Like Maya Angelou was in the sample.

02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:01.600
In fact, we published a study just before she died.

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:08.600
But anyway, and what we found, of course, is that for African Americans, the sweet spot is lower.

02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:12.600
So you can have too much of these diversifying experiences.

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:16.600
Whereas if you're in the majority culture,

02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:22.600
you're the threat of just doing everything the way everybody else is doing it as much greater,

02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:25.600
then you need a bigger push of these things.

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.600
But the point, to get back to the original question, is that all these things are involved,

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:33.600
and if you have too many of them, then you're going to be over the sweet spot.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:38.600
So if that dyslexia plus your lost your mom, or whatever it happens to be,

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:40.600
that may be too much for you to handle.

02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:45.600
And of course, there's also a resiliency factor that may be in your own constitution.

02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:49.600
So people have more resiliency than others as well.

02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.600
Thank you.

02:18:51.600 --> 02:19:20.600
Thank you.

02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:34.600
Thank you.
