WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Okay, so I should just speak.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.320
I can, okay.

00:07.320 --> 00:11.480
All right, so we're gonna get started.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.720
My name is David Pollins.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.200
I'm head of the Poetry Committee here at Helix.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.520
And I wanna welcome you to the first poetry event in our tradition series, a series which

00:21.520 --> 00:25.840
will be devoted to the appreciation of literary traditions that are less familiar to a general

00:25.840 --> 00:28.200
audience.

00:28.200 --> 00:34.360
For future events in this series, we have begun preparations to organize programs on the Palestinian

00:34.360 --> 00:42.200
poet Mahoud Darwish, on Native American poetry, on modern Yiddish poetry, and the literary

00:42.200 --> 00:45.320
beauty of the Koran.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.280
I wanted to make a general announcement too that we wanted to apologize for the cancellation

00:50.280 --> 00:57.160
of the roundtable last week on Love, which has been rescheduled for next Saturday, and

00:57.160 --> 01:01.440
upcoming in the Helix series is the topology of fear.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.160
What's the date on that?

01:04.160 --> 01:06.400
March 9th.

01:06.400 --> 01:12.780
On March 16th, we'll have the first event in our Legacy series in poetry, a series that's

01:12.780 --> 01:16.200
dedicated to the work of English language poets.

01:16.200 --> 01:22.840
Our first event is a discussion of the poetry of Elizabeth Bishop and includes Bonnie Costello,

01:22.840 --> 01:28.160
Alice Quinn, Lloyd Schwartz, and Jean Valentine.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.800
We're currently planning an event for the fall on John Dunn and his influence on contemporary

01:32.800 --> 01:37.760
poetry, and that's being co-sponsored with Fordham University and the New York Public

01:37.760 --> 01:40.520
Library.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.560
I wanna thank the members of the Poetry Committee, the likes who are helping to prepare our events.

01:45.560 --> 01:52.640
They are Heather Dubrow, Rachel Haddis, Anne-Ree Levine, Patrick Rosal, and Polly Rosenweke.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.760
Today, we're very fortunate to have Francis Pritchett and Mustafa Menai with us to talk

01:57.760 --> 02:05.760
about the poetry of Gala, the great 19th century poet of the Urdu and Persian literary traditions.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.400
He was a preeminent master of the poetic form that I used to call gazelle, but now no better

02:10.400 --> 02:11.840
and pronounced guzzle.

02:11.840 --> 02:18.720
Mustafa Menai is lecturer of Urdu at the University of Pennsylvania, South Asia Studies.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.600
Francis Pritchett is professor of modern Indian languages in the Department of Middle Eastern,

02:23.600 --> 02:28.240
South Asian, and African Studies at Columbia University.

02:28.240 --> 02:34.560
She presides over a wonderful website devoted largely to the poetry of Mir and Gala, which

02:34.560 --> 02:39.760
we will have the opportunity to view today as our two presenters guide us into the world

02:39.760 --> 02:42.360
of Gala.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.840
Before turning the floor over to our presenters, I'd like to draw your attention to a charitable

02:46.840 --> 02:54.360
foundation that is special to them, the Hoshar Foundation, which is dedicated to providing

02:54.360 --> 02:58.680
opportunities for education and empowerment to the girls of Pakistan.

02:58.680 --> 03:02.800
I'll distribute some information about the foundation and the hope that you will find

03:02.800 --> 03:05.160
it worthy of your support.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.800
I now turn the presentation over to Mustafa and Francis.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.400
Well thank you very much, David.

03:11.400 --> 03:18.080
It's a really nice introduction and we appreciate your coming out on such a very pretty Saturday

03:18.080 --> 03:23.480
afternoon because I know for most of you this is an intellectual adventure and not something

03:23.480 --> 03:29.520
that you're already familiar with or interested in, so that deserves more credit and more

03:29.520 --> 03:33.840
admiration for your intellectual curiosity and outreach.

03:33.840 --> 03:40.520
So we'll try to make life interesting as best we can for the next hour and a half.

03:40.520 --> 03:46.560
I would like to begin by just reading a brief little historical and analytical presentation

03:46.560 --> 03:51.960
about the guzzle just to touch on a number of points that will help you sort of feel

03:51.960 --> 04:00.120
oriented about it and then we can move on and discuss any of the particulars in detail

04:00.120 --> 04:01.920
and look at one verse.

04:01.920 --> 04:08.520
I know the viewing angle isn't ideal but on our screen back there we have the one photograph

04:08.520 --> 04:14.200
ever taken of Mirza Akalib, the great poet that we're going to talk about today.

04:14.200 --> 04:22.480
This was done in 1868 and he died in 1869 and in 1868 photography was just coming to

04:22.480 --> 04:29.920
Delhi where he lived and in his letters you can see there are references that he makes

04:29.920 --> 04:35.400
to how oh his friends had urged him to go to have a photograph made but the photographer

04:35.400 --> 04:36.400
hadn't come.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.280
He didn't expect him to come to his house not to go to a studio and it was too much

04:40.280 --> 04:44.880
trouble and who who minded but then there was another occasion and so finally the photographer

04:44.880 --> 04:49.960
did come and it's very moving because we have all sorts of miniature paintings of this

04:49.960 --> 04:52.440
man.

04:52.440 --> 04:57.120
Let's just take a brief look.

04:57.120 --> 04:58.840
And you see it's a different world.

04:58.840 --> 05:08.200
When you move into the world of miniature paintings you are at one more remove from our world

05:08.200 --> 05:12.680
and you have to imagine the background and imagine the kind of poetic and painting and

05:12.680 --> 05:16.440
artistic conventions that are being used.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.240
These are all just interesting bits and pieces from my website.

05:19.240 --> 05:25.760
I'm just showing them for fun but these early photographs were pasted onto like visiting

05:25.760 --> 05:29.200
cards and you would give them as mementos to your friends.

05:29.200 --> 05:34.960
So this is a visiting card that had been preserved in the family of a friend of mine for a long

05:34.960 --> 05:41.080
time and it's very faded but this is the best access we'll ever have to what Khaleb

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
actually looked like.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.560
Then we have of course the later visions by modern Pakistani writers of what they think

05:47.560 --> 05:51.320
about Khaleb or the impressions that they have.

05:51.320 --> 05:59.280
And here is an art student whom I know has imagined that Khaleb would appear on a Pakistani

05:59.280 --> 06:06.120
rupee note although that actually hasn't happened but he's just experimenting with the view

06:06.120 --> 06:10.040
in a sort of free ranging way.

06:10.040 --> 06:17.360
But let me just give you a little background about the genre and the poet.

06:17.360 --> 06:22.640
The word guzzle means something like conversations with women.

06:22.640 --> 06:28.960
Like the genre itself it originated in 6th century Arabic verse.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.720
Early Arabic guzzle revolved around two broad themes.

06:32.720 --> 06:39.320
The rakish celebration of wine, women and song and the elegiac lament over lost love.

06:39.320 --> 06:45.280
By the time the guzzle passed into Persian from the early 11th century onward the second

06:45.280 --> 06:49.200
theme had come to have mystical overtones.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.440
Separation and suffering were at the heart of love and the faithful longing lover was

06:53.440 --> 06:55.960
even a kind of martyr.

06:55.960 --> 07:02.040
Through Persian the medieval guzzle also came to develop major traditions in Turkish and

07:02.040 --> 07:03.040
Urdu.

07:03.040 --> 07:08.760
Nowadays among these languages the guzzle remains alive only in Urdu.

07:08.760 --> 07:15.440
If we focus on the classical that is 18th and 19th century guzzle in Urdu the two greatest

07:15.440 --> 07:24.280
poets of this tradition were Mir Muhammad Thape Mir 1722 to 1810 and Mirza Asadul al-Achan

07:24.280 --> 07:29.720
Ralib 1797 to 1869.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.660
Formally speaking a guzzle is a set of two line verses.

07:33.660 --> 07:38.040
They aren't technically couplets since in most of them the two lines don't rhyme and

07:38.040 --> 07:41.480
in a couplet usually the two lines rhyme.

07:41.480 --> 07:46.760
Ideally there are to be an odd number of them and ideally the number is to be something

07:46.760 --> 07:49.680
like seven or nine.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.200
Could we make the sound louder would that help would that make it easier sir?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
Is it okay?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.200
Okay.

07:55.200 --> 08:03.360
They these verses share a strictly defined Arabic derived quantitative meter and at the

08:03.360 --> 08:09.920
end of each verse they also share a common rhyme syllable and after it usually a common

08:09.920 --> 08:14.280
repeated refrain word or words as well.

08:14.280 --> 08:20.320
Beyond this the verses of a guzzle share only the larger guzzle universe of stylized

08:20.320 --> 08:23.840
characters scenes actions and images.

08:23.840 --> 08:30.520
A guzzle in short is a series of semantically independent two line mini poems that have

08:30.520 --> 08:36.280
a strong formal unity but usually no particular unity beyond that.

08:36.280 --> 08:43.200
Thus in performance oral recidors and singers freely rearrange the verses of a guzzle and

08:43.200 --> 08:47.280
almost always omit a good number of them.

08:47.280 --> 08:53.080
The first verse of a guzzle commonly incorporates the rhyme and refrain at the end of both lines

08:53.080 --> 08:56.120
instead of only at the end of the second line.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.440
If it does this it's called an opening verse there's a special name for it matla.

09:00.440 --> 09:05.320
Under oral performance conditions this feature enables the listeners to perceive the formal

09:05.320 --> 09:10.760
structure of the guzzle more quickly and we'll illustrate this when we look at an example

09:10.760 --> 09:11.760
later on.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.800
The last verse commonly includes the poet's chosen pen name.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.480
If it does this it's called a closing verse a monk the both these features reflect the

09:21.480 --> 09:25.600
guzzle's expectation of oral performance.

09:25.600 --> 09:31.680
The traditional venue for oral performance was the mushyra, the poetry place.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Shared is poetry.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.040
Shyra is the poet.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.680
Mushyra is the performance of poetry.

09:37.680 --> 09:43.160
The mushyra consisted of a smallish group of patrons connoisseurs, master poets called

09:43.160 --> 09:46.760
wastads and apprentices shoggards.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.720
Most mushyra's were based on a well-known pattern line announced in advance so that

09:51.720 --> 09:57.560
everybody's guzzles composed in this pattern were formally identical, sharing meter, rhyme

09:57.560 --> 09:59.000
and refrain.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.560
This formal identity made them extremely comparable to each other so that individual achievement

10:04.560 --> 10:07.640
stood out very strikingly.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.280
Resitation of the first line of a verse was always followed by a long pause full of praise

10:12.280 --> 10:18.280
and carbon from the audience after which the first line was repeated and then finally followed

10:18.280 --> 10:20.240
by the second line.

10:20.240 --> 10:25.480
This style of presentation created a time period when the audience had access to the

10:25.480 --> 10:33.800
first line but not the second with possibilities for creating suspense, misdirection, surprise

10:33.800 --> 10:41.080
and so on that became major factors along with complex word play in the development of

10:41.080 --> 10:44.200
the guzzle's poetics.

10:44.200 --> 10:50.760
This recited in order of increasing seniority because the emphasis on apprenticeship over

10:50.760 --> 10:58.320
time and the required mastery of technical skills made it apparent to the organizers

10:58.320 --> 11:04.200
of Mushyra's that the senior most poets must be politely assumed to be the finest.

11:04.200 --> 11:09.000
Of course sometimes they weren't so their tensions were created there.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.840
Many had a small notebook in which he, and we have to say he because women very rarely

11:14.840 --> 11:19.840
attended Mushyra's, a small notebook in which he quickly jotted down verses that struck

11:19.840 --> 11:23.560
his fancy for later discussion with friends.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.040
Famous poets were often the rock stars of their day.

11:27.040 --> 11:32.040
Bands of their apprentices were even known to riot when they encountered each other in

11:32.040 --> 11:34.200
the streets of Lucknow.

11:34.200 --> 11:41.040
Though the majority of guzzle poets were upper or middle class Muslim men, guzzles by women,

11:41.040 --> 11:46.120
by people of other religions including Hindus, Sikhs and Christians and by people of working

11:46.120 --> 11:50.520
class backgrounds are amply documented.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.840
All poetry is made out of other poetry but not all poetry is glad of it.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.880
The guzzle however delights in its huge treasury of earlier verses.

12:00.880 --> 12:08.000
The very origins of Urdu poetry included macaroni or mixed Persian Urdu lines and verses.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.560
The classical training for a poet included memorizing literally thousands of verses by

12:12.560 --> 12:15.880
earlier Persian and Urdu-ostads.

12:15.880 --> 12:20.360
There were various technical terms for the deliberate or inadvertent use of another poet's

12:20.360 --> 12:22.800
line or idea or image.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.960
If deliberate it was either a tribute or a challenge or usually both.

12:26.960 --> 12:33.560
If inadvertent was it a creative coincidence, an innovative development or a vulgar imitation

12:33.560 --> 12:40.120
and was every usage of the early masters sacred or should modern idiom have legitimacy as well.

12:40.120 --> 12:45.360
Mushyra's functioned as technical workshops in which issues like these could be publicly

12:45.360 --> 12:47.600
debated.

12:47.600 --> 12:52.800
At the most basic level the guzzle is the first person voice of a passionate lover who

12:52.800 --> 12:56.280
laments his lack of access to his beloved.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.680
This lover is always construed as masculine.

12:59.680 --> 13:05.480
In some verses the beloved is very clearly feminine as for example when women's clothing,

13:05.480 --> 13:07.840
veiling, etc. is mentioned.

13:07.840 --> 13:13.080
She is then either a courtesan or an inaccessible lady in Parda.

13:13.080 --> 13:18.720
In other verses the beloved is very clearly masculine as when the beginnings of the coquettish

13:18.720 --> 13:25.000
adolescent boy's beard are said to appear, destroying his androgynous charm.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.920
In most verses the gender of the beloved can't be decided for sure.

13:29.920 --> 13:35.320
This undecidability is partly due to the brevity of the verses and to the emphasis on the lover's

13:35.320 --> 13:38.680
feelings rather than the descriptions of the beloved.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.560
In Persian it's also due to the nature of the grammar.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.800
Verb endings don't vary with gender.

13:43.800 --> 13:48.560
In Urdu the beloved is always treated as grammatically masculine.

13:48.560 --> 13:54.520
And ultimately this abstractly masculine gender is also due to the desire to keep open a mystical

13:54.520 --> 14:01.560
sufistic reading in which the supremely powerful and irresistibly beautiful divine beloved is

14:01.560 --> 14:04.520
the real object of desire.

14:04.520 --> 14:11.560
Since an erotic pursuit of God, especially by a male lover, is not only supremely transgressive

14:11.560 --> 14:17.440
but also bound to end badly, the lover knows from the beginning that his passion is doomed

14:17.440 --> 14:19.280
and will destroy him.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.840
God he doesn't care since it's so much more powerful and beautiful than anything on offer

14:24.840 --> 14:28.760
in this flimsy, transitory, real life.

14:28.760 --> 14:35.200
Thus the great metaphors of the lover's condition are the universal mystical ones of helplessness

14:35.200 --> 14:37.080
and or transcendence.

14:37.080 --> 14:41.400
And the four biggest are, not surprisingly, you'll recognize them if you know anything

14:41.400 --> 14:46.960
about mystical poetry, drunkenness, sex, madness, and death.

14:46.960 --> 14:50.440
Here's where we connect with no doubt psychoanalytic interests too.

14:50.440 --> 14:55.680
The stylized settings of the guzzle world, the garden, the desert, the wine house, the

14:55.680 --> 15:01.960
prison, and so on, and its supporting cast of characters, the rival, the messenger, the

15:01.960 --> 15:08.640
doorkeeper, the advisor, the ascetic, etc., are all carefully calibrated to accompany this

15:08.640 --> 15:10.920
passion play.

15:10.920 --> 15:16.120
Some modern readers in South Asia have worried over the depiction of the beloved as a beautiful

15:16.120 --> 15:20.640
boy, the implications of Pederasty distress them.

15:20.640 --> 15:27.240
But if the beloved can be envisioned as a beautiful boy or a courtesan, he can also be God,

15:27.240 --> 15:31.800
and plainly the guzzle lives in a world of its own, and thus is the very reverse of

15:31.800 --> 15:33.880
autobiographical.

15:33.880 --> 15:39.040
For if the beloved is a denizen of that guzzle world, so too is the lover, who can speak

15:39.040 --> 15:45.960
as a caged bird, a hunted animal, a naked madman, a drunkard, or as himself after his

15:45.960 --> 15:46.960
own death.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.320
This is one of the enjoyable parts of the guzzle.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.600
The lover is doomed, he dies, but it never stops him.

15:52.600 --> 15:59.760
He doesn't shut up, he keeps right on composing poetry about what happens after his death.

15:59.760 --> 16:06.160
The point is the transgressiveness, the liminality, the rush to break out of this flawed, doomed,

16:06.160 --> 16:11.600
limited, worldly life into a larger, truer universe of passion.

16:11.600 --> 16:17.640
The moth lying into the candle flame is thus one of the guzzles' emblematic images.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.400
The burning, melting, self-consuming candle itself is another.

16:22.400 --> 16:30.320
And the blossoming rose, whose smile is also her death warrant, as she blooms, is a third.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.160
The classical guzzle world with its aristocratic patronage and its famous ostads was killed

16:35.160 --> 16:39.440
off in the aftermath of the rebellion of 1857.

16:39.440 --> 16:44.920
Guzzles nowadays in Urdu are often either obscure and elite, printed in small poetry

16:44.920 --> 16:53.840
journals, or else popular and personally expressive, or even filmy, composed for Bollywood movies.

16:53.840 --> 16:59.200
Modern Musharas too, though they still exist and though they happen all over North America,

16:59.200 --> 17:02.200
including quite a number in our town.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.360
Modern Musharas are greatly changed.

17:04.360 --> 17:10.280
They are public performances, like concerts, presided over by popular MCs who adjust the

17:10.280 --> 17:13.200
performances to the mood of the audience.

17:13.200 --> 17:18.080
To some extent, these Musharas constitute a middle ground for the guzzle between the

17:18.080 --> 17:23.080
elite and the popular in which it can continue to survive.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.440
There is also now English guzzle to add to the picture.

17:27.440 --> 17:35.760
It's become a popular genre in recent decades and a very influential and fascinating book

17:35.760 --> 17:44.400
called Ravishing Disunities by the late Agashahid Ali is a very good point of entry for the

17:44.400 --> 17:46.840
English guzzle.

17:46.840 --> 17:53.960
So I've studied the guzzle for most of my scholarly career, but otherwise I'm an outsider.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.880
I'm from Arkansas.

17:55.880 --> 18:01.400
My started studying Hindi at 20 and Urdu at 22.

18:01.400 --> 18:09.400
So it's very nice that we also have here a very extreme insider, my friend Mustafa Minayi,

18:09.400 --> 18:15.920
who is of course not only an insider as a South Asian, but also he is an insider as

18:15.920 --> 18:23.480
a direct descendant of a well-known Urdu poet called Amir Minayi, who was a junior contemporary

18:23.480 --> 18:30.560
of Gollibs, and in Gollibs old age, the young man Amir Minayi often helped him write his

18:30.560 --> 18:33.440
letters and acted as a secretary to him.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.120
And so we have actually a sort of blood connection here.

18:37.120 --> 18:43.920
So I'd like to ask Mustafa what he would add to this description or what he would change.

18:43.920 --> 18:44.920
Sure.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.920
Thanks a lot, friend.

18:45.920 --> 18:54.240
First of all, just as Urdu has the ability to really absorb so many different words and

18:54.240 --> 18:59.120
philosophies and styles from all over the world, I would say that you're not at all

18:59.120 --> 19:05.760
an outsider because Urdu has embraced you with open arms just as you have embraced Urdu

19:05.760 --> 19:07.440
as well.

19:07.440 --> 19:11.120
And thanks a lot for your introduction.

19:11.120 --> 19:19.340
And I would just say that, yes, just as Fran made the point that she's had a scholarly

19:19.340 --> 19:26.600
connection to Urdu and its study, which of course is very deep and very expansive.

19:26.600 --> 19:33.800
I had an experiential connection to it before I had a scholarly connection.

19:33.800 --> 19:39.360
So I was, when I was coming off age and really understanding poetry, I was reacting to it

19:39.360 --> 19:46.080
on an emotional level, which of course is the experience that most people have of poetry

19:46.080 --> 19:50.280
rather than studying it to begin with.

19:50.280 --> 20:01.920
And so the experience of Ralib and poetry in general is at a very deep emotional level

20:01.920 --> 20:02.920
as well.

20:02.920 --> 20:10.280
And so an emotional understanding based on one's life experiences, on personality, on

20:10.280 --> 20:14.960
one's psychology, personality, et cetera, comes first.

20:14.960 --> 20:19.320
And then after that, because the gazal can be, and gazal poetry can be interpreted in

20:19.320 --> 20:29.880
so many levels, when you start studying it, more meanings, et cetera, come to light.

20:29.880 --> 20:35.560
And just because I was experiencing it in the modern times, so I would say that, yes,

20:35.560 --> 20:43.000
the gazal definitely had growing pains, was battered by the outrageous slings and arrows

20:43.000 --> 20:45.040
of fortune, et cetera.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.880
But it does survive.

20:46.880 --> 20:53.560
It has changed quite a bit, although the formal structure of the rhyme and meter still

20:53.560 --> 20:55.560
remains as well.

20:55.560 --> 21:00.960
But a lot of new themes have been infused into it.

21:00.960 --> 21:07.160
And I believe that that process would not have been as robust of innovation if it were

21:07.160 --> 21:09.120
not for Ralib.

21:09.120 --> 21:15.720
Because Ralib, I feel, was a major innovator in terms of using the same kind of classical

21:15.720 --> 21:22.360
metaphors and vocabulary, but infusing new themes, which were coming from his personality,

21:22.360 --> 21:27.320
as well as his times as well.

21:27.320 --> 21:35.480
Just a small point about what Fran had mentioned, that the first verse is called a matlā.

21:35.480 --> 21:44.360
And in true Urdu literary tradition, even that is a beautiful wordplay, because matlā

21:44.360 --> 21:46.920
also means the sky.

21:46.920 --> 21:53.080
And so figuratively, the first share of a gazal, when you call it the matlā, you can

21:53.080 --> 21:58.000
poetically think of it as the sky, the rest of the shares, the rest of the couplets are

21:58.000 --> 22:00.840
descending from it after that.

22:00.840 --> 22:07.480
And so that sets up a whole range of poetic images as well.

22:07.480 --> 22:14.560
And even one thing that has also changed is the grammatically masculine reference in Urdu

22:14.560 --> 22:18.440
poetry has also evolved and changed as well.

22:18.440 --> 22:27.240
So now in these days and times you find a lot of women poets, and they use the feminine

22:27.240 --> 22:36.120
gender as well as the masculine gender according to however they prefer to apply it as well.

22:36.120 --> 22:40.880
And yes, without further ado, I think we can get more into Ralib then.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.480
Are there any special questions?

22:44.480 --> 22:49.000
I think we're basically planning to have a question period afterwards, but is there

22:49.000 --> 22:53.720
anything anybody would like to raise or to ask at this point, since we're a small group

22:53.720 --> 22:55.680
it seems that we should be informal.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.480
Did you have a question?

22:57.480 --> 23:02.560
The actual translation of the words that are conversations with women.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.280
With women, that's what I'm talking about.

23:05.280 --> 23:12.960
Now there's another etymology that attributes the word to the dying cry of a gazelle, but

23:12.960 --> 23:15.200
I think that's a sort of folk etymology.

23:15.200 --> 23:23.600
Right, there's the word gazala as well, which I think a friend you might know better.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.120
Does that refer to a deer?

23:26.120 --> 23:32.680
Well there is, gazelle has a cognate for a gazelle in Urdu, but I think that the etymology

23:32.680 --> 23:36.280
is a folk etymology.

23:36.280 --> 23:47.200
The true comment on the role of sukism in this form and also used to be written in the

23:47.200 --> 24:02.720
form of a gazelle.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
Absolutely.

24:03.720 --> 24:08.480
Actually it's interesting about Omar Chayam because we think of him through Fitzgerald,

24:08.480 --> 24:09.480
right?

24:09.480 --> 24:15.040
We read the rubayat, the Fitzgerald the quatrains translated from Omar Chayam, but it's one

24:15.040 --> 24:19.760
of those very free translations that we nowadays would call trans creations.

24:19.760 --> 24:25.560
So actually Fitzgerald wrote an original poem in English that was very loosely based on

24:25.560 --> 24:32.920
Omar Chayam and it was far more successful in English than Omar Chayam ever was in Persian.

24:32.920 --> 24:37.280
And in fact I think Penguin has, one of the publishers has put out literal translation

24:37.280 --> 24:43.240
of Omar Chayam and you can barely recognize the Fitzgerald approach.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.520
You can really see that he's taken a lot of liberties.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.640
As has happened with the rubay, by some measures, the rubay is now said to be the most popular

24:50.640 --> 24:55.240
poet in America, but he's popular in the translations of Coleman Barks.

24:55.240 --> 25:02.240
And of course if you actually look at the rubay in Persian, the difficulties, I mean

25:02.240 --> 25:09.760
many difficulties are smoothed out and many things are ignored or altered in getting into

25:09.760 --> 25:14.400
what makes Americans feel good in terms of modern poetry.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.040
Let's, oh, any question?

25:16.040 --> 25:24.280
I recently learned that Sufism may have originated among followers of rubay.

25:24.280 --> 25:34.520
And at what point did these religious prohibitions begin to become, I'm not used to associating

25:34.520 --> 25:45.280
drunkenness and such with spiritual, Muslim, or trade, anything because of statements,

25:45.280 --> 25:46.280
most of statements.

25:46.280 --> 25:50.280
So it meant to be here at all with history.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.680
It goes back very far in the tradition.

25:53.680 --> 25:59.480
And there is also a very nice back and forth sort of, you can always flip the coin and

25:59.480 --> 26:05.800
look at the other side effect because you find that the lover is transgressive because

26:05.800 --> 26:09.840
he loves his own beloved more than God.

26:09.840 --> 26:15.360
He calls his beloved an idol and he worships his beloved and uses very explicitly religious

26:15.360 --> 26:20.880
terminology for his beloved and he gets drunk and he runs out into the desert and carries

26:20.880 --> 26:23.560
on like a crazy mad lover.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.920
But of course his beloved may be God.

26:26.920 --> 26:31.480
And so we have the picture of the lover with his clothes all ripped up, drunk, lying by

26:31.480 --> 26:32.720
the side of the road.

26:32.720 --> 26:37.560
And the pious shake goes past him on the way to the mosque and sneers at him and averts

26:37.560 --> 26:43.680
his eyes because he thinks of this reprobate as a very unsatisfactory, badly behaving person.

26:43.680 --> 26:49.120
But of course, in the guzzle world, the lover knows the real inward joy of the presence

26:49.120 --> 26:54.440
of God and the pious person is just observing the letter of the law but not the spirit of

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
the law.

26:55.440 --> 27:01.360
And so when we see the lover madly drunk and carrying on in a sacrilegious way, it can

27:01.360 --> 27:09.920
be both sacrilegious and it could be a sign of real absorption in God and of having the

27:09.920 --> 27:14.000
fuses of your mind and heart blown by contact with God.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.920
Because after all, everybody, this goes to mysticism and sufism in general.

27:19.920 --> 27:25.420
Every claim or attempt that you can comprehend or feel in your heart and your mind, the presence

27:25.420 --> 27:30.600
of the power that made the universe, is obviously, it's inexpressible and it's also impossible,

27:30.600 --> 27:31.800
you're going to blow up.

27:31.800 --> 27:38.360
And so the imagery always comes from out of control areas of human life, drunkenness,

27:38.360 --> 27:40.880
madness, sex and death.

27:40.880 --> 27:46.040
And this is true in almost every mystical poetry that you can think of, that it fries

27:46.040 --> 27:50.040
your brain and it blows up your heart to try to encounter God.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.480
But of course, that doesn't stop people.

27:52.480 --> 27:59.920
So the poetry is always balanced on that tension of doom and ecstasy and suffering.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.200
So it's a remarkable and all this in little poems two lines long.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.200
So it's a very powerful genre.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.200
What would you add to that, most of all?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.200
Right.

28:10.200 --> 28:17.600
And I would say that just going back to the chronology of Sufism, that the earliest known

28:17.600 --> 28:26.560
Sufism, I feel, would be around a couple of centuries even before Rumi, the tradition

28:26.560 --> 28:27.800
I think had started.

28:27.800 --> 28:33.920
It may not have come to be known as Sufism itself, but it had started.

28:33.920 --> 28:42.760
And the in Sufism actions can lead to philosophies and philosophies can lead to actions as well.

28:42.760 --> 28:51.880
So the physical manifestation of drunkenness and sex and death can be the result of certain

28:51.880 --> 28:58.960
philosophies, et cetera, or they can then compel a person to think a certain way.

28:58.960 --> 29:07.040
So on the philosophical plain, there were very established and still evolving philosophies

29:07.040 --> 29:17.000
such as Vahadatul Vajud and Vahadul Shahud and stages of mysticism called Fana and Baka.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.320
And so these are all Vahadul Vajud for instance, the unity of existence Vahadul Shahud holds

29:23.320 --> 29:32.160
that God's existence is separate and man's existence is separate as well.

29:32.160 --> 29:41.120
And Fana is sort of the last stage or the second last stage, I should say, of a wonder

29:41.120 --> 29:47.880
with the divine and sort of Nirvana, if you would.

29:47.880 --> 29:54.000
Where things began to change as going to your question about how when the prohibitions,

29:54.000 --> 30:05.680
et cetera, came in and what we see today in the media and in the public eye in general,

30:05.680 --> 30:12.480
this brand of Islam that may be called Vahab-yism for instance, a very strict orthodox fundamentalist

30:12.480 --> 30:14.080
kind of strain.

30:14.080 --> 30:23.560
So the strain I feel was always there, but yes, it was not as powerful or dominant or

30:23.560 --> 30:33.240
as a gallib, excuse the pun, as it is now, gallib also means dominant and sometimes overwhelming

30:33.240 --> 30:34.800
as well.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.280
And so, but these things also seem to go in historical cycles.

30:39.280 --> 30:44.040
So there were throughout the centuries, over a thousand years, various time periods, various

30:44.040 --> 30:52.280
areas, where yes, the current practice of Islam as put forth by the Taliban for instance,

30:52.280 --> 30:59.560
was dominant, but there are large, large pockets of Muslims.

30:59.560 --> 31:08.040
I would say who are still in the majority, who still heart back to the more poetic and

31:08.040 --> 31:13.080
romanticized form of Islam than the orthodox form that we see today.

31:13.080 --> 31:20.920
Let's stop for a minute with our general discussions and just take a look at the specifics of

31:20.920 --> 31:25.960
one guzzle, just if you bear with me, I think it will be worth it for examples.

31:25.960 --> 31:32.280
So I maintain a website here and you can look up any of any of gallib's guzzles, there's

31:32.280 --> 31:42.120
234 of them and they contain 1,459 little two line verses and this is guzzle one and it

31:42.120 --> 31:47.800
has all sorts of extra things that go with it that most of the guzzles don't have.

31:47.800 --> 31:53.200
It also has, as all the guzzles do have, the power for you to decide whether you want to

31:53.200 --> 32:02.920
look at the website in Urdu script or in the Hindi script because many people nowadays

32:02.920 --> 32:09.200
in India don't know the Urdu script but they're able to read the same content very nicely in

32:09.200 --> 32:10.680
the Devanagri script.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.160
So thanks to one of my really good graduate students who knows how to do these things

32:14.160 --> 32:15.640
with Java script.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.600
You have your viewing choices.

32:18.600 --> 32:22.880
So this is diacritic such as is convenient for most of us.

32:22.880 --> 32:31.720
And this is the first guzzle in Gallib's Devan, it has five verses and you can see that every

32:31.720 --> 32:35.240
verse ends in ka, right?

32:35.240 --> 32:38.480
So that's the refrain, it means of.

32:38.480 --> 32:46.840
And every syllable before the ka is ir, has the form of ir, shir ka, sham shir ka, etc.,

32:46.840 --> 32:52.000
and that's the rhyme syllable which is compulsory, the refrain is optional but the rhyme syllable

32:52.000 --> 32:53.280
is compulsory.

32:53.280 --> 32:59.000
And then you can see that the first verse has the rhyming elements at the end of each line

32:59.000 --> 33:03.920
that makes it a muttla and that means that in an oral performance once you'd heard the

33:03.920 --> 33:09.840
rhyming elements twice you could tell how much was rhyme and how much was refrain.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.880
And until you'd heard them twice you couldn't.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.440
So this is a preparation for oral performance.

33:15.440 --> 33:22.400
And then the last verse very commonly contains the pen name of the poet.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.640
And so here it is.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.040
And it's a way of signing an oral poem.

33:27.040 --> 33:30.440
You work your pen name right into the last verse.

33:30.440 --> 33:36.000
In the Pukti tradition in medieval Hinduism we have exactly the same sorts of devices including

33:36.000 --> 33:41.960
the pen name at the end of the verse to be able to sign an oral poem.

33:41.960 --> 33:46.800
And the first verse of the first guzzle is particularly interesting.

33:46.800 --> 33:51.160
And the reason I chose it for today's talk because I knew we wouldn't have time to look

33:51.160 --> 33:52.320
at much.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.520
And in a way it's the most interesting guzzle in any poet's divan.

33:56.520 --> 34:01.280
The divan is the full volume of his poetry because it's the only one for which there

34:01.280 --> 34:09.080
are extra expectations because it begins the divan and so many works by traditional Muslims

34:09.080 --> 34:14.200
always begin with some sort of humb, some sort of praise of God.

34:14.200 --> 34:21.160
And so it's very, very strong expectation that when you prepare your divan for copying,

34:21.160 --> 34:27.840
and copying by a scribe or for publication, and Garle got his poetry published, he was

34:27.840 --> 34:33.280
right at the first decades when it was possible for a poet to get his own divan published.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.320
So he did.

34:35.320 --> 34:41.760
And he knew that the expectation was that the first verse of the first guzzle had better

34:41.760 --> 34:44.440
be in praise of God.

34:44.440 --> 34:45.800
Everybody expects that.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.840
It's just how it's supposed to be.

34:47.840 --> 34:56.480
So he himself created a very clever way of not quite fulfilling those expectations but

34:56.480 --> 34:58.920
not too conspicuously flouting them either.

34:58.920 --> 35:03.600
I'm just hesitating on this because I just want you to think that if you go home and

35:03.600 --> 35:06.160
are interested in this, you can look at these.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.360
They're completely open to the public.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.560
And every verse has its own commentary page.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.440
And this one has a particularly long bunch because the commentators have argued about

35:15.440 --> 35:16.920
it a great deal.

35:16.920 --> 35:23.440
But every verse has a lot of, some of them have pictures just because I like pictures.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.080
But this is the kind of thing I provided for him.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.240
And it's a study site for my work.

35:29.240 --> 35:34.440
And it also aims to provide lots of materials and resources for the guzzles, for people

35:34.440 --> 35:39.040
to study them, even if they don't have a university library at hand.

35:39.040 --> 35:46.680
So here is a very close, a very close study of this one verse.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.720
So nux here's the definition, right?

35:49.720 --> 35:54.840
Nux means a shape of painting, a picture, a form, etc., etc.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.880
The nux.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.280
And then furiadhi.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.600
Furiad means complaint.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.920
And a furiadhi means one who has a complaint.

36:02.920 --> 36:08.120
And in legal terms, it's like plaintiff in English, which also means one who has a plaintiff

36:08.120 --> 36:09.720
or a complaint.

36:09.720 --> 36:21.960
So the picture or the form is a complainer, a plaintiff, of whose mischievousness of writing.

36:21.960 --> 36:26.360
So that's our first line.

36:26.360 --> 36:31.280
And of course writing, the word for writing, has the meaning also of setting at liberty,

36:31.280 --> 36:35.400
which is why we talk about the Harrier Square when we talk about the Arab Spring.

36:35.400 --> 36:37.800
It's not about writing, it's about liberty.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.560
So you can see the multiple possibilities here.

36:41.560 --> 36:46.920
And Adam O'Shire, I remember, you only get the first line and then you have to wait.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.480
And you can't look ahead.

36:48.480 --> 36:53.400
You have to, there's a narrative, students call this the authoritarian narrator, that

36:53.400 --> 36:55.320
you're stuck, you can't look ahead.

36:55.320 --> 37:02.520
So the shape is a plaintiff of whose mischievousness of writing.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.760
Why don't you go ahead and recite it nicely?

37:04.760 --> 37:09.240
Well, yeah, lots of stuff.

37:09.240 --> 37:25.120
of paper.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.740
Cara's is the paper.

37:26.740 --> 37:37.880
Of paper is the garment of every form, face, countenance, shape, of or in the picture.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.720
So obviously people ask, Galleb, about that.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.960
What is this paper business?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.560
What are paper garments?

37:43.560 --> 37:45.520
And he had to reply in a letter.

37:45.520 --> 37:50.800
So here is his reply, which is my translation from the Urdu.

37:50.800 --> 37:56.080
And you can see that he's used to being asked questions like this, because he says,

37:56.080 --> 37:59.640
bele mani a bhiate bemani suniye.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.600
First, listen to the meaning of the meaningless verses, meaning at the beginning of his letter

38:03.600 --> 38:08.920
to someone, he's going to answer someone's complaint that several of his verses were meaningless.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.920
And he does.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.320
He answers it for several verses, but one of them is this.

38:12.320 --> 38:17.840
As for Nakhshvariadi, that's this verse that he's going to explain, in Iran there is the

38:17.840 --> 38:24.240
custom that the seeker of justice, putting on paper garments, goes before the ruler.

38:24.240 --> 38:32.920
As in the case of lighting a torch in the day, or carrying a blood-soaked cloth on a bamboo

38:32.920 --> 38:40.000
pole to protest an injustice, thus the poet reflects of whose mischievousness of writing

38:40.000 --> 38:46.480
is the image a plaintiff, since the aspect of a picture is that its garment is of paper.

38:46.480 --> 38:52.360
That is to say, although existence may be like that of pictures, merely notional, it

38:52.360 --> 38:56.400
is a cause of grief and sorrow and suffering.

38:56.400 --> 39:02.320
And the commentators have complained, the early and authoritative commentator famously

39:02.320 --> 39:06.520
said that's a meaningless verse, that's very bad, and the other commentators disagree,

39:06.520 --> 39:07.520
and so forth.

39:07.520 --> 39:12.800
But you can see how cleverly framed it is, because it doesn't attack God, but you would

39:12.800 --> 39:15.400
certainly not call it a praise of God either.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.160
It presents itself as a naive question.

39:18.160 --> 39:23.640
Gee, I'm looking at a picture, and I notice that all the shapes and forms in the picture

39:23.640 --> 39:25.880
are wearing robes of paper.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.440
So they must be plaintiffs.

39:27.440 --> 39:31.400
They must be seeking recourse against injustice.

39:31.400 --> 39:35.320
And so against whom are they seeking recourse?

39:35.320 --> 39:41.000
So after you hear the second misra, you realize the base, sorry, misra means line.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.400
After you hear the second line, you realize the basis of the first line, that once you

39:46.400 --> 39:50.760
have seen a picture and thought about all those paper garments that those poor, static,

39:50.760 --> 39:58.000
helpless people in the picture are wearing, then you realize that you may wonder whose mischievousness

39:58.000 --> 40:03.120
of writing are they complaining of that they were drawn badly, because obviously a figure

40:03.120 --> 40:06.120
in a picture has no power of movement.

40:06.120 --> 40:08.320
It can't control its looks or its appearance.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.520
It has no volition.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.640
It looks like it looks as though it's moving.

40:11.640 --> 40:16.240
It looks as though it has human attributes, but it actually doesn't.

40:16.240 --> 40:20.320
Someone has mischievously drawn it, or mischievously drawn it badly.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.480
It's very hard to tell about that.

40:23.480 --> 40:29.720
So there's a lot of word play here of words for writing and drawing and paper and such.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.120
But this is an extremely famous verse.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.320
It was used.

40:35.320 --> 40:43.000
Nokchferiadi was used as a slightly transformed form within Azafat as the title of a collection

40:43.000 --> 40:50.760
by Faz Emmeth Faz, who is a very popular modern Urdu poet, kind of the favorite poet of a

40:50.760 --> 40:53.720
lot of Pakistanis along with it all.

40:53.720 --> 41:00.240
So everybody has been a GALIB fan, or the literature ever since, kind of officially a

41:00.240 --> 41:04.600
GALIB fan, and almost everybody.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.160
There's Yoganna who hasn't, but most everybody has.

41:08.160 --> 41:13.640
And this verse is known to everybody who knows anything about GALIB.

41:13.640 --> 41:18.920
So it's a good verse for us to look at, and just to see how what tiny little poems these

41:18.920 --> 41:25.800
are, and how they have to make use of lots of resources to make a powerful effect on

41:25.800 --> 41:30.360
us, even though they're only like 15 or 20 words long.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.680
So this is our first look at.

41:32.680 --> 41:36.920
Our first look at the verse, which is sort of raw material for discussion.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.040
So what would you add, Mustafa?

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
Sure.

41:40.040 --> 41:51.120
I'd say that the Indo-Persian languages tradition, you could call it, is that a lot of words

41:51.120 --> 41:59.600
have multiple meanings and shades of meaning as well, which lends such a beautiful complexity

41:59.600 --> 42:05.800
and multilayeredness to Urdu and Indo-Persian and Arabic poetry.

42:05.800 --> 42:11.000
As you can see from Fran's website that just, you get, that there are so many different

42:11.000 --> 42:19.720
words for just one word, and you can literally take each word and plug in a different meaning

42:19.720 --> 42:25.600
and shade of meaning and come up with a different interpretation or a slightly different shade

42:25.600 --> 42:29.400
of meaning and experience as well.

42:29.400 --> 42:37.000
So that's there, and I would say especially on the point of G-alib choosing this as the

42:37.000 --> 42:39.240
opening verse of his divan.

42:39.240 --> 42:46.520
So we know of G-alib's personality and his through his life as well that he was a very

42:46.520 --> 42:49.360
self-assured person.

42:49.360 --> 42:57.320
And you can see his personal as well as poetic conceit, as it were, to choose this couplet

42:57.320 --> 43:05.880
over there, and ironically we can interpret it in terms of irony as well because as he's

43:05.880 --> 43:15.320
asking the question of whose mischievousness is this naksh creation of, he himself is the

43:15.320 --> 43:19.960
person who is actually writing, he is creating the naksh himself.

43:19.960 --> 43:27.000
So in a very tongue and cheek way he is referring to himself as divine, as God as well.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.320
And especially if you take the meaning, a shade of meaning of shokhi as not just mischievousness

43:33.320 --> 43:44.040
but wantonness and the meaning of tahri as setting free, by the act of creating something,

43:44.040 --> 43:49.640
you are actually setting it free or creating it, you are actually freeing it from your own

43:49.640 --> 43:52.760
mind.

43:52.760 --> 43:58.440
You can also see a lot of shades of meaning coming in there.

43:58.440 --> 44:08.000
So he could be referring to himself as well and it reminds me of that line from King

44:08.000 --> 44:15.120
Lear as flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport.

44:15.120 --> 44:18.560
And so you can see that in there as well.

44:18.560 --> 44:24.600
And France's right, this particular couple it has been debated endlessly as well.

44:24.600 --> 44:28.160
But you should notice that of course the first line is a question.

44:28.160 --> 44:34.280
And so it does not say it's perhaps a naive question, gee who has done this mischievous

44:34.280 --> 44:38.040
or bad writing or drawing, I don't know.

44:38.040 --> 44:42.680
And so if anybody says it's God, it's we who say it's God, it's not the speaker.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.480
The speaker simply asks a question.

44:45.480 --> 44:52.120
And in fact, there's a lovely rhetorical feature of the guzzle that's a common trait, especially

44:52.120 --> 44:55.640
in Raleigh and Meer, the two greatest masters.

44:55.640 --> 45:00.120
The preference for inshaia over habariya speech.

45:00.120 --> 45:06.600
And this is a sort of rhetorical distinction that exists in Persian poetic theory also.

45:06.600 --> 45:10.320
Habariya gives you habari, it gives you information.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.680
Like the sky is blue is a habariya statement.

45:13.680 --> 45:18.040
And inshaia statement would be, is the sky blue?

45:18.040 --> 45:20.360
How blue the sky is.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.080
I wish the sky were blue.

45:23.080 --> 45:25.440
Perhaps the sky might be blue.

45:25.440 --> 45:28.040
If the sky were blue, et cetera, et cetera.

45:28.040 --> 45:34.920
So almost anything that's not a falsifiable informative statement is called inshaia.

45:34.920 --> 45:41.400
And it opens so many possibilities because a first line like that, it could be an exclamation

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
also.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.200
Oh my, how extraordinary.

45:44.200 --> 45:48.080
Why are all these figures in the picture wearing paper robes?

45:48.080 --> 45:52.520
Or it could be an innocent question of someone who really has no idea.

45:52.520 --> 45:53.920
Or it could be a cynical question.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.720
Yeah, who are they complaining about?

45:55.720 --> 45:58.200
You and I know who they're complaining about, don't we?

45:58.200 --> 46:02.920
So in a lot of these little two line verses, the tone is everything.

46:02.920 --> 46:07.400
But you have to provide the tone because nothing in the verse tells you the tone in

46:07.400 --> 46:09.280
which it is to be recited.

46:09.280 --> 46:14.240
So you may hear it recited if a very small number of people would ever have heard, gala,

46:14.240 --> 46:15.800
recite that verse.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.520
So when you read it on paper, which is how most people encountered it, every time someone

46:21.520 --> 46:25.880
recites it, you have to recite it in a tone.

46:25.880 --> 46:29.000
And that guides the interpretation too.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.520
You inevitably help to create the verse yourself.

46:31.520 --> 46:36.920
And that's part of the fascination and enjoyment of these tiny little, tiny little poems that

46:36.920 --> 46:38.640
are partly do it yourself.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.560
And so you have to work extra hard on them.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.240
And that enhances their meaning.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.240
Did you have a question?

46:43.240 --> 46:49.320
Is he concerned with someone, this to me by the way seems almost like a one, one,

46:49.320 --> 46:54.280
floating down on the face of whatever reader-like cake events or not?

46:54.280 --> 46:59.760
But is he concerned about where the parents slipred his without language and so many

46:59.760 --> 47:01.520
poets in the book about it?

47:01.520 --> 47:08.520
And so you have to be aware of the fact that you're saying, one word, you go to hell,

47:08.520 --> 47:11.520
and you say, one word, you go to hell as fast as an arrow.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.520
So is that something about the reader?

47:14.520 --> 47:16.320
He's talking about language itself.

47:16.320 --> 47:20.920
He wasn't worried about going to hell because all the guzzle poets knew that the themes

47:20.920 --> 47:24.680
or the musmoons of these verses were given by the tradition.

47:24.680 --> 47:30.040
So if he wrote a verse that said, oh, I tear my clothes off and run around in the desert

47:30.040 --> 47:31.280
getting drunk.

47:31.280 --> 47:34.840
No one would think that was an autobiographical statement.

47:34.840 --> 47:39.160
Everybody would realize that was just an expression of the themes of the guzzle world.

47:39.160 --> 47:44.000
And he was speaking in the voice of the mad lover, who essentially is the inhabitant of

47:44.000 --> 47:45.520
the guzzle world.

47:45.520 --> 47:50.920
So there are lots and lots of verbal devices he used, and he certainly cared about them,

47:50.920 --> 47:54.680
and people have tried to analyze them and figure them out ever since.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.800
But there's no indication that he had a lot of anxiety about them.

47:58.800 --> 48:07.080
Even in his generation, he was controversial because a lot of times earlier guzzle poets

48:07.080 --> 48:14.400
had gone in for straightforward love poetry, lyrical, romantic, sweet, adorable, nice.

48:14.400 --> 48:18.520
And then he brings in, sort of like John Dunn, the metaphysical poet.

48:18.520 --> 48:22.360
He brings in the flea and writes about the flea that bites his beloved, John Dunn does,

48:22.360 --> 48:26.520
I mean, or the drawing compass image that are not smooth and romantic.

48:26.520 --> 48:29.720
They're kind of lumpy and cerebral and metaphysical.

48:29.720 --> 48:34.040
So I think that Galleb is more like Dunn than like any other English poet.

48:34.040 --> 48:41.960
And he delighted in using awkward, edgy, unheard of kinds of word and image play.

48:41.960 --> 48:46.840
And he had many detractors, but he also had many great admirers.

48:46.840 --> 48:54.400
He was very famous for his poetry and his letters also in his ordew and Persian ones

48:54.400 --> 48:55.560
both.

48:55.560 --> 48:59.280
So there's a lot to be said on this subject.

48:59.280 --> 49:04.120
And God knows any of you who are interested can probably find more information than you

49:04.120 --> 49:11.480
want on my website.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.480
Did you have anything to add?

49:12.480 --> 49:13.480
Oh, sorry.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.480
Oh, sorry.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.480
Sorry.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.480
If you could answer it briefly, it's a big question.

49:18.480 --> 49:25.200
What are the origins of the bazelle?

49:25.200 --> 49:29.480
The deer or the poem?

49:29.480 --> 49:31.920
Well, it started in Arabic.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.960
I'm not so good on this because I do not know Arabic.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.840
So it grew out of longer forms of poetry.

49:38.840 --> 49:48.880
It was one part of an introductory part of a kind of longer genre in Arabic shortly before

49:48.880 --> 49:50.360
the coming of Islam.

49:50.360 --> 49:58.600
So like the sixth century, and it really was a minor genre in Arabic.

49:58.600 --> 50:04.240
But when it came into Persian, then it exploded and became extremely important and became

50:04.240 --> 50:13.000
a major form of literary, romantic and mystical expression in Persian and then in Turkish

50:13.000 --> 50:14.680
and ordew also.

50:14.680 --> 50:18.160
So it's never been a big deal in Arabic, but it did begin in Arabic.

50:18.160 --> 50:21.160
Yeah.

50:21.160 --> 50:28.400
I was surprised to hear you say that there was no performances of bazelle.

50:28.400 --> 50:38.280
There were no longer than popular because there was a woman and there was an international

50:38.280 --> 50:41.600
re as a puzzle of a singer.

50:41.600 --> 50:48.880
I think she was Egyptian, I was where the guy some years ago, he was 70.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.680
Oh, ohm kalsum, right?

50:50.680 --> 50:51.680
Yeah.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.680
Yes.

50:52.680 --> 50:53.680
And there was a national deal.

50:53.680 --> 50:58.680
There was a great passion for that for you, the beef and all.

50:58.680 --> 51:06.600
And I had the impression that bazelle and singer were sort of like rock stars.

51:06.600 --> 51:08.840
Well now in ordew, this can be the case.

51:08.840 --> 51:15.520
But I believe om kalsum sang modern poems that were not guzzles or older poems that were

51:15.520 --> 51:16.520
guzzles.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.520
I really don't know.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.280
Does anybody know Arabic and know what om kalsum used to sing?

51:20.280 --> 51:28.280
I don't know Arabic, but I had a mention of the tradition of what was the great, great

51:28.280 --> 51:30.280
minor of the poem.

51:30.280 --> 51:37.520
We also had political, not only one thing in front of the left, but my impression was

51:37.520 --> 51:44.520
that she was singing about popular things and not anything to do with this book.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.520
She talked a lot about broken violinist lovers.

51:47.520 --> 51:53.520
I don't think of any religious, but she was providing it.

51:53.520 --> 51:58.360
She made a lot of it, she made a lot of it, and she wrote it all.

51:58.360 --> 52:07.360
I'd say that the kind of ground that violin broke and set up, then gave, it was a very

52:07.360 --> 52:15.200
great way to a lot of evolution in the way that Mosheirazah held, their frequencies,

52:15.200 --> 52:21.960
the way that Urdu poetry has sung, how it's read, how it's practiced, the whole range

52:21.960 --> 52:23.480
of experiences.

52:23.480 --> 52:31.800
So I agree with Fran when she says that yes, Mosheirazah are not as popular today as they

52:31.800 --> 52:38.640
used to be, and Mosheirazah are the gathering of poets who are going to be reciting their

52:38.640 --> 52:40.840
own work primarily.

52:40.840 --> 52:47.760
So there's that performance, and yes, their frequency, at least in Pakistan and India,

52:47.760 --> 52:51.520
from what I know and have experienced, has gone down.

52:51.520 --> 53:00.680
And I would say to a large degree, it's because of the times and the pace of life now and

53:00.680 --> 53:06.960
the modernization process, et cetera, that's going on in these, in Urdu-speaking societies.

53:06.960 --> 53:12.560
There's also, of course, the big question in Pakistan, the big issue of security, as

53:12.560 --> 53:19.800
well things have not been very stable for the past two decades or so.

53:19.800 --> 53:27.080
So there's a certain risk to having large gatherings and having people be in one place

53:27.080 --> 53:32.800
and Mosheirazah were usually held during the evening and night hours, et cetera.

53:32.800 --> 53:36.080
So that's one reason for that as well.

53:36.080 --> 53:40.840
Performance-wise, there are singing performances of poetry as well.

53:40.840 --> 53:48.560
So more along the lines of Ummikul-Sum and individual singers who became famous for singing

53:48.560 --> 53:56.880
Urdu poetry, they have found outlets and survival through modern media.

53:56.880 --> 54:03.360
So through the intervention of radio and TV and now the internet, you find that the

54:03.360 --> 54:10.400
razal singing performance of the razal live on as you witness the opening razal that we

54:10.400 --> 54:16.480
had that was playing when you were walking in by a singer called Talat Mehmud, who was

54:16.480 --> 54:23.880
singing it a good 30, 40 years ago, if not earlier than that, but because of YouTube,

54:23.880 --> 54:26.920
we have those as well.

54:26.920 --> 54:34.720
But yes, even on that side of performance, things are getting tougher in terms of the

54:34.720 --> 54:40.800
sheer number of people who are now practicing the classical art of razal singing, which

54:40.800 --> 54:48.880
is also, and razal would then be fused with the whole science and art of Indian classical

54:48.880 --> 54:54.400
music, which has its own, which is a whole science on its own.

54:54.400 --> 55:01.360
And interest and patience in acquiring that art is also going down.

55:01.360 --> 55:05.320
But now with the intervention, again, evolution keeps happening.

55:05.320 --> 55:13.240
So now you have this mixing of pop genres coming into contact with classical Indian music and

55:13.240 --> 55:21.480
modern Urdu poetry coming into contact with classical and sort of a mishmash occurring

55:21.480 --> 55:24.560
and something new coming out of it.

55:24.560 --> 55:33.600
So if you ask members of the younger generation, especially in Pakistan, if Urdu music, they

55:33.600 --> 55:39.960
would call it Urdu music, is alive and well there, you would definitely get a very affirmative

55:39.960 --> 55:44.840
answer, even if they do not listen to it much.

55:44.840 --> 55:48.720
And there's of course also the regional folk influences.

55:48.720 --> 55:53.600
In the regions of India and Pakistan, Urdu is of course just one of the languages that

55:53.600 --> 55:54.600
is spoken.

55:54.600 --> 55:59.160
It's the official language of Pakistan and the official language of five states in India,

55:59.160 --> 56:02.480
but then there's a myriad number of other languages that are spoken.

56:02.480 --> 56:09.080
And they all sort of interact with each other, flow in and out of each other, and new things

56:09.080 --> 56:12.120
come out of those as well.

56:12.120 --> 56:19.000
People have said a lot and perhaps you folks know something about the Hindi Urdu split.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.400
Are they two languages or one?

56:20.400 --> 56:24.200
Are they kind of a Siamese twin compound or what?

56:24.200 --> 56:28.760
And there's been a lot of tension of course because Hindi is the official language of India

56:28.760 --> 56:35.240
and Urdu is the official language of Pakistan and yet they share a common grammar and a large

56:35.240 --> 56:39.720
amount of common basic vocabulary and then they have two different sources for their

56:39.720 --> 56:42.760
fancy vocabulary and two different scripts.

56:42.760 --> 56:46.920
But the real threat to both of them in my view is English now.

56:46.920 --> 56:51.600
South Asians are picking up English at an astonishing pace.

56:51.600 --> 56:56.480
And the really sad thing is there is as most of us said there's a long and strong tradition

56:56.480 --> 57:01.080
of being multilingual in South Asia, not in a pretentious way but perhaps you would speak

57:01.080 --> 57:02.800
one language in your village.

57:02.800 --> 57:07.080
And if you want to mark it in a neighboring town there would be a different dialect there.

57:07.080 --> 57:11.240
And if you were a highly educated man of an upper class you might have a separate language

57:11.240 --> 57:16.880
that you would use for diplomatic or literary purposes.

57:16.880 --> 57:24.080
But so you would think that English could be sustained along with at least one South

57:24.080 --> 57:27.520
Asian language but in my observation this is not happening.

57:27.520 --> 57:32.200
My friends who are Urdu, or the Ualas or Hindi Ualas who are really interested in these languages

57:32.200 --> 57:36.080
and literatures, their kids have all been sent to English medium schools.

57:36.080 --> 57:39.120
Meaning the medium of instruction is in English.

57:39.120 --> 57:43.880
And they have tried very hard to make their kids fluent in Hindi or Urdu with varying

57:43.880 --> 57:45.080
success.

57:45.080 --> 57:48.720
But if you go to the kids' rooms and look at what they're choosing to read you know

57:48.720 --> 57:49.920
it's English.

57:49.920 --> 57:53.120
And if you put two of those kids in a room together you know they're going to be speaking

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
English to each other.

57:54.120 --> 58:02.160
I mean it's a big problem for the future of this language at an elite level.

58:02.160 --> 58:07.560
Because of course they may know Urdu for speaking to servants or something like that.

58:07.560 --> 58:13.360
But their fancy education, their literary and artistic vocabulary and thinking often

58:13.360 --> 58:16.120
happens in English.

58:16.120 --> 58:22.240
And so this is the high end side of Urdu where if you don't have a good background in grammar

58:22.240 --> 58:26.800
and the sense of the meter and the poetry and the Persianized vocabulary it's very hard

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
for you.

58:27.800 --> 58:34.080
In fact the most heartfelt letters of thanks I get are from South Asians living in the

58:34.080 --> 58:37.160
West who say thank you for your website.

58:37.160 --> 58:42.400
I always wanted to understand the poetry of Gollib and I never could but you've explained

58:42.400 --> 58:44.800
it all in English so now I can't.

58:44.800 --> 58:50.240
And it's just something that's happening and then the migration of the Gazal into English

58:50.240 --> 58:51.800
is kind of fascinating too.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.640
Because of course what is it in English?

58:53.640 --> 58:56.120
It doesn't have the meter or so is it the Gazal or not?

58:56.120 --> 58:59.760
A whole set of questions but new things are happening all over the place.

58:59.760 --> 59:02.880
And so we might as well celebrate and enjoy them.

59:02.880 --> 59:10.080
But the definitely English in South Asia is just becoming, with every generation it's

59:10.080 --> 59:15.680
absolutely taking over and I don't know what the future will hold but this is a very very

59:15.680 --> 59:16.680
strong trend.

59:16.680 --> 59:20.680
And I don't see any retreat from it or any counter trends do you?

59:20.680 --> 59:27.960
No I wouldn't say that there's a retreat from it I would say that again there is a process

59:27.960 --> 59:32.520
of sort of or doising it or Englishising it.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.520
Yeah new hybrids.

59:33.520 --> 59:42.080
As it were new new hybrids are coming out and slowly so I think even if every person in

59:42.080 --> 59:49.480
South Asia became an English speaker exclusively that English would differ markedly from the

59:49.480 --> 59:55.840
English spoken in England or the US because it would still have that flavour because of

59:55.840 --> 01:00:01.720
course as we although that language is more than just the words in that language it's

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:09.400
a whole set of historical and cultural experiences and values that come with it as well.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:10.400
Yes.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:20.400
I mean one thing for us whether we just poetry you know the end of youth's name culture

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.400
and what percentage of the population did that audience represent?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.400
Was it widespread or was it just a particular echelon?

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.400
How many women read it or who were they people that were reading it?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
Who was he talking to?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Well.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:50.400
Who had the word it's a lame dollar so that the thing could be so that it could be either

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.400
presented with a bad problem or was it a political problem?

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.400
If there were the characters of political problems to get it to be heard then did someone show

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.400
it to me?

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:14.520
Well remember most of them were not reading it because most people were illiterate for

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.520
one thing but certainly in Gollib's deli and in Agra where he was born and lived before

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:25.960
he moved to Delhi this kind of language the Hindustani or what we now call Urdu was a

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.960
lingua franca increasingly Persian had been the elite language of the local court but by

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.200
the time Gollib was living there the British were in charge and gradually the balance was

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.720
shifting away from Persian toward the local languages and so many people would understand

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.520
this poetry and in fact there are anecdotes in Tazkura's about how it would disseminate

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.360
because there would be Mushyra's where poets would recite their latest verses and of course

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:59.040
that those Mushyra's would be servants serving the food and drinks and taking care of people

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.800
and so instantly the servants would pass the word on because these things are so short

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.600
and if you know the meter system and the language they're very memorizable and very

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.800
recordable so the dancing girls would know them immediately and have them memorized and

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.280
the dancing girls and the musicians would want to have the latest verses and they would

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:22.400
arrange for disseminating them and there doesn't seem to have been a problem because

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.080
remember most poets were not as complicated as Gollib so most of the time people were

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.920
doing more straightforward love and longing poetry or perhaps mystical mystical poetry

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:40.120
but it wasn't exceedingly difficult or complex or in your face hard the way Gollib's verses

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.960
often were.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.920
And there was also the aspect of being very alive to the preferences of one's patron

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.720
as well although Gollib was exceptional in that as well that he was a very self assured

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:04.840
person and he could get away with a lot that other poets could not because again in 18th

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:11.720
century India you could be only way that you could be earning your living by our pen was

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:17.560
if you had patronage from a wealthy noble or an emperor and were associated with their

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:26.600
court and so even if you were not writing something for the court you still had to you

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.160
it carried a little bit of risk if you wrote something that would not be well received

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:39.680
by our patron then yes you were really writing yourself out of a livelihood kind of thing

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.560
and but Ralev of course because of his stature etc was would be given a lot more leeway than

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:53.440
anyone else would have read and he had troubles right he got into some troubles as well so

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:59.640
yes so the short answer to your question would be that yes they were writing primarily for

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:06.200
the courts and people who of socio-economic and educational status who are associated

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:12.000
with the courts but that does not mean that their their poetry was not understood by people

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.600
outside of that circle.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.680
I have a question.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680
Yes.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.040
I'm fascinated by the whole city of meetings in the building and I am the depth or the

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.440
layers of interpretation that allows for it.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:37.280
Do you think that's a fundamental factor in the formation of this form of poetry that

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:44.280
can be read but very resonant at the same time would it have worked as well with another

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280
type of language?

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.160
That's such an interesting question I'm glad you asked that.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.520
In the strong sense since Urdu Gazal comes right out of Persian Gazal.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.960
In fact the birth of Urdu Gazal was part of the death of Persian in India.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.200
People kind of took all the devices and the structures and the meters and the technical

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:09.080
and genre features that they loved in Persian and started doing them in Urdu and then they

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.880
didn't need Persian anymore.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.080
At that point people were starting to feel that Persian was an alien language in a way

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.040
that they hadn't before for a lot of reasons.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.120
In the strong sense it came right out of Persian but there are so many things that you can

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:32.320
do in Urdu because of constraints that you don't have, that we do have in English, that

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.000
it's quite striking.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.760
For example you don't have capital letters and the kind of punctuation.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.480
If you see punctuation in modern dewans of galle which you do it's imposed by a modern

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:44.480
editor.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.440
They put English style punctuation into Galle's poetry which is of course quite ridiculous

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.320
because he certainly would never have done that or have wanted that to be done.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.840
But there is also a lot of things like in English we have to make a distinction between

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.200
the sky is blue and is the sky blue.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.000
It's because of the inversion.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.120
In Urdu you have Asman Nilahe and there's a kya, yes or no question marker in front.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.080
Kya Asman Nilahe but it can also be colloquially omitted.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:21.200
So Asman Nilahe can register as a question or an exclamation if you wish as well as a

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.480
statement.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.520
So there's a lot of features that are very well mobilized by Galle and Mih and other

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:34.280
poets but especially by Galle and Mih to create multiple meanings in these little tiny poems.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.800
And I don't think you could do it as well in certainly you couldn't do it as well in

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.800
English and that's why translations of Galle as a rule just fail.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.880
I have a couple of guzzles with anthologies of translations so that anybody who wishes

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.920
can compare and see what the translators have achieved.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.320
You have to honor them because they're bound to fail but it can't be done but you can see

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.080
my translations are totally lousy and clunky and they're just meant to help push you back

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.800
to the Urdu with more understanding.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:07.040
They're not remotely meant to be literary.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.080
And no doubt there are things we can do in English that you can't do in Urdu but there's

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:17.920
a lot of things that you can do in Urdu partly because you have a different word, instead

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.400
of prepositions you have postpositions.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.400
So instead of saying in the house you say house in.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:29.040
And so at the ends of sentences and at the end of lines you also have your verbs there.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.440
So it's easier to rhyme in Urdu than it is in English because your verbs often have common

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.240
endings that make all verbs in a certain tense, easy to rhyme with each other.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.800
And postpositions end and can end the line.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.080
That postposition, that means of.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.240
And so it can be of this and of that, you know, of writing, of a picture.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.280
But since the of comes at the end in rhymes and in English you'd have to say of the picture,

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280
of the writing.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.640
And so you can't get the same facility there.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.600
But of course, you know, it's hard to make any meaningful comparison because really nobody

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.760
has tried to do what Gollib did exactly in English.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.240
But we do have other effects.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:16.160
I think a fascinating analysis to your question might be to compare Urdu with the Native American

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.160
languages.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:27.040
For instance, the Hopi language spoken by the Hopi Indians also did not have had a very

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:35.440
loosely constructed sense of time which you see in Urdu is also very different from the

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.480
concept of time in English.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:45.240
So once in Urdu we have the same word, one word for yesterday as well as tomorrow.

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.080
And it would be a fascinating line of inquiry.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.800
I haven't done this and I don't know if anyone else has done it or not.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:59.840
But I wonder if someone like Native American poetry as it was written, would that remind

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:06.280
one of Urdu poetry or not simply because of the way that the words were constructed,

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280
etc.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:14.760
And Urdu as well, it's a syllable time language as well in the sense that the syllables are

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:22.000
approximately of the same length and so they occur at approximately regular intervals as

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.800
well as well.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:29.720
So you don't find one very short syllable but with one very long syllable as well which

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.880
also adds a lot to the rhythm of the poetry as well.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:47.280
There were stresses right because when you were reciting the spoken verse I could hear

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.280
the stresses.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.280
Right, I was introduced, right.

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.920
Because it was my own sort of bias and internalization of my own experience as I was growing up.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:10:00.360
It was, I was reading it the way that I had heard it recited and the traditional way of

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.440
reciting it as well.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:27.600
And the meter has the feet are there as well so a lot of people would recite it as, so

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.960
I was actually adding those.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.120
I can add an interesting little highlight here.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:40.960
My friend Ralph Russell, a very well-known writer in the field of Urdu literature and

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.280
the author of the best book on Gollib's life.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.600
It's called Gollib Life and Letters by Ralph Russell and his collaborator Khushidul Islam.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.560
But he also was interested in meter and I've made a little handbook to teach people meter

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.040
and put it on my website.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.840
He also made a handbook to teach his students meter but he had a slightly different approach.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:06.800
But for this particular meter he had an English folk song that he thought corresponded to

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800
it.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.320
Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.680
And this meter is, dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.640
Nok chafur ya di hechiski shou rieta hirikah.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.840
But of course the difference is we have stress meter in English of a very flexible and disputable

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:29.840
kind.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.040
Whereas the meter here is strictly speaking, it's supposed to be quantitative.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:40.600
So that a long syllable is supposed to take twice as long to say as a short syllable.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.800
Not to go higher or lower or more or less stress.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.920
So that you have the opportunity to do as you like with your voice provided you're keeping

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.920
to the time structure of it.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.760
And some people extend that privilege very far of my two main listads, one of them recites

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:03.840
very elaborately nok chafur ya di hechiski shou rieta hirikah.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.080
Carras is the words and my other listad snorts when he hears that performance and he considers

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:14.280
it improper and one should just recite plainly and let the words do the work.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.680
But of course we don't know how Calleb recited so.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.680
Oh please.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.680
So especially in this, there are many instances, especially in the body sport, when you go

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.680
in the week of the month line then the month you go back to the month line you would read

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680
it differently.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.680
And I have almost parented for this particular lesson that when you read the month of the

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:41.680
last chair you will come back to this and you would read it and then you would interpret

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.680
the stress on the different words that you could be at knowing what the rest of the shot

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680
were.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.320
And much more than that I would say there are great many verses of Calleb because the real

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.520
poetic unit is the verse and not the guzzle that after you had heard the second line you

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:03.600
would go back and reread or re-understand in your mind the first line which is really

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.560
a way of making a two line verse feel like a three or four line verse because you have

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.560
to go back in your head and reinterpret the first line which is quite spectacular.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.560
I'm going to do this at the best.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560
Oh.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560
Sorry.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
Sorry.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
This is a little interdisciplinary.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:26.560
First I just was thinking of the bar in the ancient Persia, the kind of same song way of

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.560
speaking when they told the story about Alexander the Great or what it looked.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.560
But I'm also being a painter.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:39.560
I'm also thinking of the Persian miniatures and the Indian miniatures and the compartmentalization

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.560
of little images and the way they interact with one another and the very tight structure

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:49.560
there involved with and the metaphors that are involved between a cloud and a dragon

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560
and the water.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.560
There are certain signs for it.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.560
And I wondered what interaction did the painters or I guess it's the whole culture but what

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.560
I mean it's an interesting analogy that there are these interactions that take place.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.560
Do you have any, do they relationship between the miniatures or anything?

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.560
Do you know anything in that area?

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.560
Anne Marie Schimmel actually used a very nice image.

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:22.560
When people used to complain that oh the guzzles themes were too hack need and boring and we

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.560
needed to give up the guzzle and start writing much freer forms of poetry and Urdu.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:34.560
She compared classical guzzle and its themes to paintings of Majunun in the desert.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:39.560
You know the lovers Leila and Majunun ran off into the desert and became a naked man

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.560
man cared for by the animals when he couldn't get his beloved Leila.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.560
And so painter after painter has painted Majunun, scrawny and naked hanging out in the desert

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560
being taken care of by the wild animals.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:58.560
But every painter as Anne Marie Schimmel said would show his individuality by small touches.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.560
So everybody painted the same scene but the great painter painted it differently, had some

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:09.560
extra thing or some trick of the light or some new way of framing the figure of Majununun

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.560
that made it all the more memorable because then it stood out from the similar paintings

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560
of everybody else.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:20.560
And I think something like that happens when you all use the same musmoons.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.560
The same themes that your treatment of the theme becomes much more striking if you've got

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:32.560
something original out of it against a background of sort of well established tradition.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.560
But there's also something inherent in the structure of the language and the structure of the images

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:42.560
because they're so highly terse and tight and...

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560
They're miniatures.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560
They're miniatures.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560
Yeah.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.560
And each little image has a universe within it and yet also the whole as a learn.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:57.560
So I wondered something in the Philasonic tradition or where this concept of structure is so deep

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.560
in that middle, you know, in the Southeast Asia.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:10.560
Do you have a sense of where this could go?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:18.560
I'd say that yes, it's a great observation and honestly I haven't thought too much about it.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:28.560
But again, just yes, thinking of the poetry and the art and the visual art as it was occurring.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:38.560
Then yes, there are, you could say that the art is very poetic and the poetry is very, very visual as well.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:50.560
And I really... But can we say that, for instance, if we look at Western art and Western poetry,

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:58.560
that the same kind of that are the images and the language structure or the political structure much more

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.560
much looser, like what would be an example of that?

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:08.560
It's not as the, I mean, romantic painting maybe in romantic poetry you could make some analogies, but this is so tight.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:16.560
Being within the structural, the very thing, the building blocks or so have such an interaction with one another.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:25.560
Because I mean, I've always been struck by the Persian miniatures by their telling stories that unfold and unfold

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:34.560
and then go off the borders, but they're still so, but they're still so enclosed and at the same time escape the border.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:40.560
I don't think this happens in the poetry, does anything ever escape the structure go off?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.560
I mean, will you leave the structure?

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Yes, occasionally it does and now you find it happening more and more as the razelle structure itself becomes looser

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.560
or poetry is written in other formal structures other than the razelle.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:07.560
So yes, especially for instance in postmodernist or the literature, yes, you find multiplicity of images that may not be connected

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:13.560
with any kind of deliberate intent on the writer's part as well.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:22.560
At the time, we'll go to the very good song. I think that that poem is on the ministry itself.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.560
Oh, is he meaning their connected, their writing and yes?

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Yes, many of them.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.560
A good part of the song.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.560
She's not much familiar with this poem, she's not familiar with this poem.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.560
Absolutely.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:40.560
Well, think about how English poets now complain because up until recently English poets could assume that everybody knew the King James Bible

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:47.560
and the imagery from the Bible and they had a common set of stories that everybody knew and names they could refer to

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.560
and comparisons they could make and that was also informed European painting.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:58.560
Of course, there were so many paintings of biblical scenes and such poems or poems from the Iliad and the Odyssey

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:04.560
and the classical tradition, but now an English poet, where does he or she go to get common imagery?

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:12.560
It's much harder in the culture now because we just don't have that same body of guaranteed known material.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.560
I mean, what do we have Star Wars? I mean, it's a touchy subject.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.560
Right, we did it on the subject of Star Wars.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:31.560
And you mentioned Shanaama, for instance, so there were these, there's a long tradition of epics and epic prose

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:37.560
in Indo-Persian literature as well, just as there is an investor in the literature, so you have King Arthur's,

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:45.560
Stills, etc. and for the way you have the Dostania, Mirhamza, which Franek actually has done a lot of extensive work on.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:59.560
And it's funny you mentioned visual arts and poetry because the Emperor Akbar in 1600s in India had commissioned a whole panel of paintings

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:05.560
that are just depictions of scenes from the Dostania, Mirhamza as well.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:14.560
And so, yes, in a way, the written word sort of dictates as well what will be painted and how it will be painted as well.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:20.560
And now I wonder if the reverse can happen as well.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:28.560
I know a lot of literary works which have been painted, but I don't know about a lot of paintings

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:37.560
which have actually been then written about in terms of, has there been a poem written on a certain picture or not in India?

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:58.560
Which Japanese language sometimes will, in a way, they're always putting this kind of like an experimentation, so a lot of years have these.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:12.560
And so, I think the literary or older experiments with language itself, this language would be modified from an artistic point of view or a form of each other.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Sure, actually, and I believe Fran is probably looking for the link to the calligraphy side that you have.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:32.560
So, I'm going to look for the Shah Qarang Rupi-Bessar Osama because, in that case, Gollib commented about painting.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:36.560
It's the one case that I know of. Give me a minute to find this.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:45.560
And yes, calligraphy definitely, there's a long tradition of calligraphy in Indo-Persian Indian culture as well.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:59.560
And yes, there were different styles as well. I'm not sure if the styles themselves were influenced by the particular language or not.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.560
But yes, that is a question worth an answer to.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:16.560
Here's a present for you and any other art history fans. Here is the one verse about which Gollib explicitly commented in painting terms.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:21.560
Just look at what he said and then we'll look at the verse. He says, Rakhib, of course, has the meaning of opponent.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:30.560
That is to say, Alder is the enemy of proper possession. The proof is that Kries, which Kries is the real name of the lover Majnun.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:42.560
Therefore, he was called Majnun, which means possessed by gins. So, Bess is the mad lover who in life wandered around naked, remained naked even within the veil of a picture.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:48.560
The pleasure of it is that Majnun is always pictured with his body naked whenever he is pictured.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:56.560
But of course, this is atypical. This is the only case I know where he actually interpreted his own verse in terms of painting.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:01.560
This is a neat case because remember you'd only get the first line.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:12.560
Rakhib, Surosama, Nikla, Alder in every color mood mode aspect. It literally means color, but of course it has related meanings of all sorts.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:24.560
Turned out to be a rival or enemy or opponent of Surosama, which means something like dignity, proper possession, being a bourgeois kind of thing.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:31.560
And when you hear that line, you have no idea what's going on. It's a very abstract statement and it's incomprehensible. It's uninterpretable.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:37.560
So then you have to wait at the Mushyra after the poet has read the first line, and then everybody says,

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.560
Vava, Subhan the law and starts praising him. And maybe they make him repeat the first line.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:46.560
And there's a big interval when you're trying to think of what the second line would be.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:53.560
Only when you hear the second line, Kries is Majnun. There's that same word, Tassvere, that we saw in the earlier verse.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:24:03.560
We were looking at. Tassvere, part of that may be, part of that means veil. It's like the word people use in English, P-U-R-D-A-H, which they pronounce poor dust sometimes,

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.560
but it's part of that means being in a curtain or being behind a curtain.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:21.560
Kries, even, this is even, in the curtain of a painting, turned out to be naked or emerged naked.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:30.560
So, in other words, Kries, or the figure of Mad Majnun who ran off and lived nakedly with the animals in the desert,

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:39.560
was so opposed to all civilized bourgeois, urbane existence that even in the part of a picture,

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:47.560
which ought to veil him or cover him like a paper garment as we saw in the other verse we were looking at,

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:53.560
even in the part of a picture which ought to make for modesty, he turned out to be naked.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:25:03.560
And Gaulib is very pleased because he's created that nice little effect that he feels is very enjoyable, and that surely the Mushyra,

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:12.560
here is probably, probably enjoyed it as well because Nick La can mean turned out to be, but it also can mean literally emerged.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:26.560
So, it can actually mean even in the part of a picture as emerged naked as though he was so much breaking, so much concerned to break down the dignity and pompousness of bourgeois life,

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:35.560
that his incisiveness just cut through all the pomp and circumstance that surrounds him even in a picture.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.560
So, it's a lovely verse, and it's anchored to the depiction of Christ and the wilderness.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.560
Let me interpret the verse.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560
I'm sorry, I don't need to.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:52.560
We only got five minutes left, and I'd like to pass around this material on the Hoshar Foundation for people to take a look at as we're finished.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:02.560
Oh, that's lovely of you. It's a wonderful foundation, and we know the people who are running it, and every penny goes right to women's education in Pakistan.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:11.560
It's not a big organization buying range rovers for a lot of outside experts coming in. It's people working with local schools.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.560
So, people can make a note of their website if they want to.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:25.560
It's interesting. My initial question was just answered very rapidly, and then who talked about this one, and also the question of the vocabulary, sex, death, madness, and nakedness.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:38.560
In a way, it seems as if this type of culture was a breakthrough in terms of committing people to talk about things that weren't really supposed to talk about.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:45.560
And using the proper language to talk about stuff that was not proper.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:52.560
So, I'm suggesting that this kind of was a barrier, as I said, a breakthrough in the language.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:27:11.560
First of all, being able to talk to in a valid manner, is that it was that sort of controversial thing in and of itself talking about, talking about the effect of women on a death station, being protected, and all that sort of.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:26.560
Right, and yes, with the caveat that, yes, it was many times within the veil of the masculine gender, but everyone knew who to interpret it as both as well.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:37.560
And yes, I completely agree. They did use their poetic license to very good and very intense effect to talk about these things.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:46.560
And to really link them as Fran was mentioning earlier that these were mystical themes.

01:27:46.560 --> 01:28:06.560
And even in this couple of over here, the interplay of Parda and Orya of nakedness and hidden, it's always the native speaker or reader will automates almost subconsciously be drawn into the contradiction between the two.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:16.560
And the contradiction between the hidden, what we really know, do we really know anything going to decartian philosophy, etc.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:33.560
But yes, I do feel that they did use their poetic license as a thing to talk about things that weren't the topics of everyday conversation in prose, for instance,

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.560
between a couple of people who were just chatting in the marketplace, for instance.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:29:03.560
But I think what you do say is not my impression, it's not my impression that I don't think the, for example, the most reference to my thinking is from Parda and many of the others, and in person poetry.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:13.560
And the idea is never really the one that I own that is kind of expressing what couldn't be expressed because of society within the other.

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:19.560
So it's never being put in the symbolic, everything the right, the symbolic is not literal.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:31.560
Drinking, there's nothing to do with actually drinking, it's a symbolic of a change of level of consciousness.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.560
Right.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.560
Is there anything you would like to listen to that is safe room in all of this?

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:45.560
I mean, I'm just thinking now that Greeks couldn't have something come true.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:58.560
Sure, yes, it could have because in the middle ages, there was a whole flowering of Andalusian and South, Southern, Spanish, Moorish culture.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:09.560
And the Arabs are famously supposed to have a rescued Greek science and philosophy from oblivion, while Europe was going through its dark ages.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.560
I mean, these are of course very loose time periods and categorizations.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:25.560
You know, the Queen of Shiva, the song of Solomon, and the biblical, you know, it was supposedly for the love of God, but also, you know, both human love, physical, but beyond his love.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:38.560
Yes, definitely. Right, definitely. So there's hardly any poetry in the classical period which talks just about sex or drunkenness or death just on their own as phenomenon.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:51.560
It's always tight, it's always a road, a metaphor for a broader achievement of consciousness or dissipation of oneself into the divine whole.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.560
Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.560
Thank you very much.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:01.560
I feel like a door has opened into a wonderful mansion.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.560
Thank you so much.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:23.560
Thank you.
