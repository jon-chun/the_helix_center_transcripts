00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
I have the pleasure to present you, George L. Ebermann.

00:05.480 --> 00:08.680
I don't know exactly how I will do that.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.920
I saw that in the program of Hans-Wakie-Wiege,

00:11.920 --> 00:15.400
it was your book in the middle of the program

00:15.400 --> 00:19.640
in an excellent position, the surviving image.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.560
I don't know exactly how to say in English about Nachlebahn.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.440
It's an excellent book of George L. Ebermann,

00:27.440 --> 00:32.120
which is not yet translated in English, perhaps no.

00:32.120 --> 00:35.160
We are waiting for that because it is an important book

00:35.160 --> 00:40.160
about Abi-Barbog and this unnamed science,

00:40.160 --> 00:45.200
which include and extended beyond the limit

00:45.200 --> 00:47.360
of different sciences.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.160
And I think we are in the same dispositive

00:50.160 --> 00:56.480
at Nachlebahn created the same frame of thinking.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.360
We are with history, philosophy, anthropology,

01:01.360 --> 01:06.960
ethnology, perhaps metrology, psychology, and also biology,

01:06.960 --> 01:14.480
looking for another science which is beyond the limit

01:14.480 --> 01:17.120
of these different sciences.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.400
And I think it is the experience that we will do

01:21.400 --> 01:23.800
during these two days.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.960
And the purpose of our own table is to revisit

01:27.960 --> 01:33.120
the important concept of Abi-Barbog, like Nachlebahn,

01:33.120 --> 01:37.040
Patos Formal, Memosin, and it is important

01:37.040 --> 01:41.800
to have now a discussion with you.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.080
And you have to use the podium.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.400
Thank you very much, Francois.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.280
I'm so happy to be posted.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.000
How is the type of knowledge inaugurated

01:55.000 --> 02:01.040
by Warbog useful as today, useful for us today?

02:01.040 --> 02:04.680
Shouldn't we say simply that it is useful

02:04.680 --> 02:11.280
for opening the territory of that major science,

02:11.280 --> 02:18.080
this royal science has to use the vocabulary of gildolos

02:18.080 --> 02:21.320
and phillics gateri from their essay

02:21.320 --> 02:24.680
on the cartography of knowledge, mil plato?

02:24.680 --> 02:27.920
That is history as such.

02:27.920 --> 02:36.640
Notice, opening can be understood in two senses at least.

02:36.640 --> 02:44.240
To open is to enlarge, but it's also to wound.

02:44.240 --> 02:50.160
Now, this is not the same thing for the science of history,

02:50.160 --> 02:53.560
which is my interlocutor here.

02:53.560 --> 02:59.080
To accept its opening to images under the angle of enlargement

02:59.080 --> 03:03.240
as it is under the angle of perforation.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.280
To enlarge its domain to images means

03:06.280 --> 03:10.120
to accept certainly new objects, but it is also

03:10.120 --> 03:12.920
to capture them, to enclose them,

03:12.920 --> 03:17.720
under a common administration that pre-exists them.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.400
This is to envisage interdisciplinarity

03:20.400 --> 03:25.080
from the perspective of territorial relations,

03:25.080 --> 03:30.800
so that opening itself to images reduces, more or less,

03:30.800 --> 03:36.360
reduces the extending of its empire,

03:36.360 --> 03:40.960
its authority over new landscapes and objects.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.600
Totally different is the opening that wounds perforate

03:45.600 --> 03:49.640
traverses the territory that hosts the operation.

03:49.640 --> 03:55.760
This opening alone possesses a critical dimension,

03:55.760 --> 03:59.920
dimension, I think, an extraterritorial capacity

03:59.920 --> 04:03.680
to cross the frontiers, to create

04:03.680 --> 04:08.960
unsuspected paths and to modify the plane of consistency

04:08.960 --> 04:11.000
of the territory traversed.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.480
The work of Vabog has long been recognized

04:15.480 --> 04:20.120
for its capacity to enlarge the territory of the historian

04:20.120 --> 04:22.280
and also art history.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.480
But it seems more difficult today, even as yesterday,

04:26.480 --> 04:29.800
to recognize its capacity to wound,

04:29.800 --> 04:33.600
to critique this territory itself.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.600
It is not by chance that the importance

04:38.600 --> 04:43.600
of this critical aspect of Vabog's work has been recognized

04:43.600 --> 04:49.600
before everyone else by historians of art who were careful

04:49.600 --> 04:53.600
to construct their arguments philosophically,

04:53.600 --> 05:00.600
like at Garvinte in the 30s, and by philosophers who are aware

05:00.600 --> 05:04.600
of cultural history as, for instance,

05:04.600 --> 05:08.200
Georgiou Agamben, because your quotation of the La Chienza

05:08.200 --> 05:12.600
sensea no me is an expression taken by Georgiou Agamben

05:12.600 --> 05:17.600
from the art historian Robert Clam.

05:17.600 --> 05:34.600
This meant that we are in this discipline, like in a battlefield,

05:34.600 --> 05:37.600
a field of battle.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.600
It's a perpetual replenaging into the game of clashing theories

05:42.600 --> 05:46.600
where certain objects are studied against others

05:46.600 --> 05:51.600
in order that certain models of historicity are meaning,

05:51.600 --> 05:56.600
and meaning, excuse me, are made to emerge against others.

05:56.600 --> 06:03.600
It is thus that confronting the iconographic sign

06:03.600 --> 06:09.600
that Erwin Panowski enlarged into an iconological symbol,

06:09.600 --> 06:12.600
a Vabog will in advance,

06:12.600 --> 06:16.600
construct the hypothesis of a regime of images

06:16.600 --> 06:21.600
based on a paradoxical economy, a visual, a temporal,

06:21.600 --> 06:25.600
a signifying economy of what I would call,

06:25.600 --> 06:31.600
and here in this house, it's significant, the symptom,

06:31.600 --> 06:36.600
that third at the same time was elaborating into

06:36.600 --> 06:40.600
illuminating new shocking theory.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.600
It's impossible for me to go into the details here,

06:44.600 --> 06:48.600
concerning the complexity of these epistemologic debates.

06:48.600 --> 06:54.600
Perhaps it will be enough to recall certain lines of divisions.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.600
There where Panowski was thinking of the symbol.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.600
By way of the logical development of a theme,

07:03.600 --> 07:07.600
as was shown, for instance, in his brilliant deduction

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
of the iconography of DÃ¼rer's Melancholy

07:10.600 --> 07:15.600
as deriving from ancient and medieval premises

07:15.600 --> 07:19.600
synthesized for the occasion,

07:19.600 --> 07:24.600
Vabog was exposing figurative symptoms

07:24.600 --> 07:29.600
through the paradoxical not the deuxion,

07:29.600 --> 07:35.600
eruption of a memory of unconscious movement.

07:35.600 --> 07:40.600
That entered into conflict with the common sense

07:40.600 --> 07:44.600
given of a shared culture.

07:44.600 --> 07:48.600
In short, when the symbol unites,

07:48.600 --> 07:51.600
the symptom divides.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.600
There where the symbol brings into accord

07:55.600 --> 07:58.600
in a common cultural territory,

07:58.600 --> 08:02.600
the symptom mobilizes a disturbing transversal

08:02.600 --> 08:05.600
across that territory.

08:05.600 --> 08:09.600
There where the symbol is handed down by a tradition,

08:09.600 --> 08:12.600
for instance, humanism, the symptom

08:12.600 --> 08:15.600
migrates and perforates the traditional evidence

08:15.600 --> 08:18.600
of common sense by what I call an

08:18.600 --> 08:22.600
anachronistic accident, for instance,

08:22.600 --> 08:26.600
the unexpected eruption of a Arab astrologer

08:26.600 --> 08:30.600
at the heart of a cycle of Renaissance frescoes.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.600
There where the symbol speaks of a conformity

08:34.600 --> 08:39.600
of images and of discourses, the symptoms reveals

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
as many of their differences,

08:42.600 --> 08:45.600
their failures to communicate,

08:45.600 --> 08:49.600
their conflicts, their incommensorabilities.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.600
There where the world of symbols

08:51.600 --> 08:55.600
appear in the coherence of its unity,

08:55.600 --> 08:58.600
that of symptoms puts into play

08:58.600 --> 09:02.600
an unexpected diversity of montage, montages,

09:02.600 --> 09:04.600
heterogeneity.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.600
There where the symbol includes us

09:07.600 --> 09:10.600
in the encompassing world of a great

09:10.600 --> 09:13.600
cultural infrastructure where everyone

09:13.600 --> 09:18.600
needs to recognize, the symptom brings to the surface,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.600
as though pulling it up from below,

09:22.600 --> 09:26.600
perforating elements that, in their local space,

09:26.600 --> 09:30.600
booby traps, such an identification.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.600
Therefore, the symbol cementizes

09:34.600 --> 09:38.600
the present from a prolonged past,

09:38.600 --> 09:42.600
the symptom de cementizes the present

09:42.600 --> 09:45.600
from an instance of forgetting that

09:45.600 --> 09:48.600
explodes as a repetition,

09:48.600 --> 09:52.600
nachthaglicate, return of the repressed, etc.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.600
One should understand that

09:55.600 --> 09:59.600
it's the entire psychic, temporal, and visual economy

09:59.600 --> 10:03.600
which finds itself here, divided,

10:03.600 --> 10:08.600
in this way between the encompassing territory of symbols

10:08.600 --> 10:11.600
and the traversing movements of the

10:11.600 --> 10:14.600
critical movements of symptoms.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.600
One example, will perfectly, I suppose,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
illustrate this economy.

10:20.600 --> 10:24.600
We could even think of it as a kind of a lagerie.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.600
It is Abi-Vabo's gradiva.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.600
The name of her is NINFA.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.600
Singled out by Vabo in Florence during the period

10:36.600 --> 10:40.600
between 1888 and 1893

10:40.600 --> 10:44.600
when he was preparing his thesis

10:44.600 --> 10:49.600
on the mythological paintings of Botticelli.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.600
Vabo was attempting to make an archaeology

10:52.600 --> 10:55.600
of the first Italian Renaissance

10:55.600 --> 10:59.600
based on a new object that was first assigned

10:59.600 --> 11:02.600
to representation and then generalized

11:02.600 --> 11:05.600
to all forms of cultural life,

11:05.600 --> 11:08.600
symbolic lives, therefore.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.600
This object, that object, was the

11:12.600 --> 11:17.600
living motion for which

11:17.600 --> 11:20.600
Befobaticelli, Donatello, for example,

11:20.600 --> 11:23.600
Montenier II, especially Donatello,

11:23.600 --> 11:26.600
went in search of models from

11:26.600 --> 11:30.600
paradoxically living motion,

11:30.600 --> 11:34.600
but the models were found on the sides

11:34.600 --> 11:38.600
of Roman sarcophagi, death,

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
where they found impassioned poses

11:41.600 --> 11:45.600
of lamentations, but also erotic

11:45.600 --> 11:49.600
pursuits, dramatic scenes of war, etc.

11:49.600 --> 11:53.600
What fascinated Vabo as he stood

11:53.600 --> 11:56.600
in front of Botticelli's paintings,

11:56.600 --> 12:00.600
or similarly reading the poem of Politiano,

12:00.600 --> 12:04.600
the theoretical press question of Alberti, etc.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.600
was thus, I quote,

12:07.600 --> 12:10.600
the remarkable attempt to delineate

12:10.600 --> 12:14.600
transitory movement, basing his research

12:14.600 --> 12:17.600
on such a common evidence,

12:17.600 --> 12:20.600
therefore I repeat, symbolic form.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.600
Vabo wanted to focalize his gaze

12:23.600 --> 12:25.600
on a figure-out, a particularity,

12:25.600 --> 12:28.600
which in the art of Renaissance Florence

12:28.600 --> 12:32.600
repeated itself from place to place,

12:32.600 --> 12:35.600
never finding itself thematized as such,

12:35.600 --> 12:39.600
but breaking the surface and insisting

12:39.600 --> 12:42.600
like a symptomatic form,

12:42.600 --> 12:46.600
modifying in-depth the economy of images.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.600
Whether they were employed as

12:49.600 --> 12:51.600
corporal resemblances,

12:51.600 --> 12:53.600
perspectival constructions,

12:53.600 --> 12:55.600
likeness of Vabo,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
Alberti's Historia.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.600
Thus, this symptomatic form

13:00.600 --> 13:04.600
modifies the representation of motion,

13:04.600 --> 13:09.600
for example, of a character who walks or runs

13:09.600 --> 13:12.600
transversely to the supplement

13:12.600 --> 13:15.600
of two fundamental processes,

13:15.600 --> 13:19.600
firstly, as a question of a displacement

13:19.600 --> 13:25.600
of intensity, which marks itself

13:25.600 --> 13:29.600
notably in an unexpected contrast

13:29.600 --> 13:33.600
between the sculptural impenetrability

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
of Venus in Botticelli,

13:35.600 --> 13:39.600
and the impassioned dance of the

13:39.600 --> 13:43.600
bevectors by Vek, the accessory in movement,

13:43.600 --> 13:46.600
unbound hair, draperies,

13:46.600 --> 13:48.600
the wind.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.600
The second process, fundamental,

13:51.600 --> 13:54.600
is insufferable from the first.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.600
Here, it's a matter of something that one could name

13:58.600 --> 14:01.600
an eccentric,

14:01.600 --> 14:05.600
transversal symptomatic forces at play,

14:05.600 --> 14:10.600
and of their capacity to sweep the representation

14:10.600 --> 14:13.600
like a breath of air,

14:13.600 --> 14:16.600
be it a breeze or a high wind,

14:16.600 --> 14:20.600
to sweep the space where it's superviness,

14:20.600 --> 14:25.600
where it passes, where it occurs

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
in French,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
passÃ©, and ilse passquÃ©,

14:28.600 --> 14:31.600
que chor.

14:31.600 --> 14:35.600
A lot of troubling things outside of the center

14:35.600 --> 14:37.600
of Renaissance paintings,

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
as for instance, in the primavera.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
Look at the right, the right border.

14:43.600 --> 14:47.600
ZÃ©fir is fecundating the nymph Clarisse,

14:47.600 --> 14:51.600
and the latter already vomiting her children

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
in the form of a bracelet of flowers

14:53.600 --> 14:55.600
escaping from her mouth.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.600
One must define these weird scenes

14:59.600 --> 15:01.600
as transversal,

15:01.600 --> 15:06.600
since they modify from one border to the other,

15:06.600 --> 15:10.600
the totality of the image is affected by those motions,

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
be it on this chromatic level,

15:13.600 --> 15:17.600
but photographs of the verbal thesis,

15:17.600 --> 15:21.600
so the chromatic level is,

15:21.600 --> 15:23.600
I'm sorry, it's not here,

15:23.600 --> 15:26.600
the level of the dynamism of forms

15:26.600 --> 15:30.600
or of their significance, of course, finally.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.600
It is equally necessary to qualify them as eccentric

15:35.600 --> 15:39.600
in so far as especially their emerged,

15:39.600 --> 15:43.600
most often along the borders of the painting,

15:43.600 --> 15:47.600
and metaphorically they denote what Verbo wanted to call

15:47.600 --> 15:50.600
the external cause of the image,

15:50.600 --> 15:54.600
external cause of which he sought to theorize

15:54.600 --> 15:59.600
the psychic tenor from the side of Fantasia

15:59.600 --> 16:02.600
and dream images, images of memory,

16:02.600 --> 16:05.600
images of desire at the same time,

16:05.600 --> 16:08.600
images tied to passion, that is to say,

16:08.600 --> 16:13.600
to a regime situated below that of consciousness,

16:13.600 --> 16:18.600
just as a wind is eccentric by definition,

16:18.600 --> 16:22.600
to the place it sweeps, of course,

16:22.600 --> 16:26.600
the id to the ego that is upset,

16:26.600 --> 16:29.600
and the symptom to the symbolic world

16:29.600 --> 16:33.600
where we have taken our bearings and habits

16:33.600 --> 16:37.600
so to the ninja that figure in movement

16:37.600 --> 16:40.600
who seems in Renaissance images

16:40.600 --> 16:43.600
to have emerged from the backstage

16:43.600 --> 16:46.600
and come to modify the total economy of the representation

16:46.600 --> 16:49.600
in making something impassioned,

16:49.600 --> 16:52.600
something of the memory of the desire,

16:52.600 --> 16:55.600
which passes here.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.600
Verbo recognized innumerable instances,

16:59.600 --> 17:03.600
but it's a leaf, leaf, peep, peep,

17:03.600 --> 17:05.600
in turic, manteÃ±a, Leonardo, perugino,

17:05.600 --> 17:07.600
rafero, et cetera, et cetera,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.600
but when they, looking at the border

17:11.600 --> 17:14.600
of one of Girlandaio's frescoes

17:14.600 --> 17:17.600
in the Santa Maria novella in Florence,

17:17.600 --> 17:21.600
he discovered something like the contestants of this phenomenon,

17:21.600 --> 17:26.600
and yet it was only a serving girl,

17:26.600 --> 17:32.600
modest, humble, carrying a plate of fruit on her head.

17:32.600 --> 17:36.600
But it was a photograph of this gracious figure

17:36.600 --> 17:40.600
that came to be carefully framed and glued

17:40.600 --> 17:44.600
on the cover of a new notebook from 1900,

17:44.600 --> 17:47.600
entitled, Ninfa Fiorentina.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
The manuscript presents us with a collection of fragments

17:51.600 --> 17:56.600
for what Verbo envisioned as his noon-fenn project.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.600
At first, it takes the form of a friendly correspondence

18:00.600 --> 18:07.600
between the historian and the linguist Andrei Yales.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.600
On the question of Girlandaio's female figure

18:11.600 --> 18:14.600
that we see enter, so to speak,

18:14.600 --> 18:18.600
from the right handboarder of the fresco,

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
which is depicting the birth of Saint John the Baptist

18:21.600 --> 18:25.600
in the Tona Boni Chapel in Santa Maria novella.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.600
There's no doubt that Yales, in his text,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.600
has already integrated all the aesthetic

18:31.600 --> 18:34.600
and theoretical observations contained

18:34.600 --> 18:37.600
in the preceding analysis of Verbo

18:37.600 --> 18:40.600
on the representation of living motion.

18:40.600 --> 18:45.600
Thus, what Verbo had revealed under the iconographic angle

18:45.600 --> 18:52.600
of the erotic pursuit, Zeffi, Chlorix, Apollo Daphne,

18:52.600 --> 18:59.600
Yales had maliciously displaced as a virtual play

18:59.600 --> 19:04.600
between the spectator himself and the Ninfa,

19:04.600 --> 19:07.600
like the le Porcivir,

19:07.600 --> 19:11.600
which so's it grace in the works of Girlandaio.

19:11.600 --> 19:17.600
In the manuscript, there is this phrase by Yales,

19:17.600 --> 19:22.600
ChÃ©chilapham, mine Lieber.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
He wrote this in order to make clear

19:26.600 --> 19:29.600
that it's a matter of desire,

19:29.600 --> 19:32.600
like an inadmissible symptom

19:32.600 --> 19:36.600
in the midst of the religious sin depicted

19:36.600 --> 19:38.600
in the Tona Boni Chapel.

19:43.600 --> 19:48.600
He evokes the ethereal grace of her steps,

19:48.600 --> 19:51.600
making of her a cosy pagan goddess,

19:51.600 --> 19:56.600
a practically extraterrestrial, he says,

19:56.600 --> 20:02.600
creature, just as the air seems equally animated,

20:02.600 --> 20:07.600
just for her, this is a close space,

20:07.600 --> 20:12.600
with a local wind that swells her antique dress,

20:12.600 --> 20:15.600
swells her antique dress, in short.

20:15.600 --> 20:20.600
This young Ninfa seems to be something like a phantom

20:20.600 --> 20:23.600
of feminine grace, who traverses the scene

20:23.600 --> 20:26.600
with her light footsteps,

20:26.600 --> 20:29.600
and almost high aerial creature,

20:29.600 --> 20:33.600
an apparition that even provokes in Yales

20:33.600 --> 20:36.600
a sentiment of imma-repressible unheimly,

20:36.600 --> 20:42.600
something between a nightmare and a tale for children, he says.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.600
So new questions present themselves,

20:45.600 --> 20:50.600
questions that VÃ¡burgi was really asking himself,

20:50.600 --> 20:53.600
this question especially,

20:53.600 --> 20:58.600
where have I already seen

20:58.600 --> 21:03.600
her, which is very psycho-analytical, of course.

21:03.600 --> 21:08.600
This was a wave of VÃ¡burg to dialogue not only with Yales

21:08.600 --> 21:12.600
but with himself, through the most radical prism

21:12.600 --> 21:15.600
of his conceptual scheme,

21:15.600 --> 21:18.600
namely that of Naftleben,

21:18.600 --> 21:23.600
as the symptomatic model of the temporality of images.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.600
Not only did Gerlandaio not respect

21:27.600 --> 21:31.600
the dogmatic iconography of the religious order

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
that owned the church, but he even in accordance

21:34.600 --> 21:40.600
with Tarnabroni instructions, probably,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.600
sprinkling that figure of the Ninfa,

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
all over the place, which soon provoked

21:47.600 --> 21:50.600
the anger of Savonarola, by the way.

21:50.600 --> 22:00.600
This is presentation of the Virgin in the same channel.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.600
You see these two charming children

22:11.600 --> 22:17.600
who emerged from the two borders of the Marriag of the Virgin,

22:17.600 --> 22:21.600
here on their female dancers,

22:21.600 --> 22:26.600
traversing the nomination of John the Baptist,

22:26.600 --> 22:32.600
of course, Salome,

22:32.600 --> 22:36.600
in the operation of the angel to the Carriers.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.600
There is a representation in Barriagliaef

22:40.600 --> 22:43.600
and also this angel, a young, effeminate,

22:43.600 --> 22:47.600
winged man, clothed, alantica.

22:47.600 --> 22:52.600
And in the ultraviolet massacre of the innocence,

22:52.600 --> 22:57.600
there are some quasi-menads transformed into furies,

22:57.600 --> 23:00.600
avatars of media.

23:00.600 --> 23:11.600
Finally, there is this young woman

23:11.600 --> 23:15.600
who is a wonderful young woman,

23:15.600 --> 23:20.600
carrying fruits as in the birth of John the Baptist,

23:20.600 --> 23:24.600
and she emerges in Grisail, like a phantom,

23:24.600 --> 23:29.600
from the background, the background of the visitation.

23:29.600 --> 23:35.600
We are thus put confronted with a truly figurative strategy,

23:35.600 --> 23:41.600
a strategy of nomadic apparitions,

23:41.600 --> 23:44.600
eruptions, interruptions.

23:44.600 --> 23:48.600
Ninfas do appear here and there

23:48.600 --> 23:54.600
as this symptomatic figure coming from who knows where.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.600
Again, antiquity surely, but which one?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.600
Under what name?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.600
The nymph, graciously,

24:02.600 --> 24:08.600
opens the symbolic conventions of the space

24:08.600 --> 24:11.600
which she traverses and modifies

24:11.600 --> 24:15.600
with the kind of perverse innocence, if I may say so.

24:15.600 --> 24:19.600
In reality, two territorial logics

24:19.600 --> 24:23.600
are attacked, critic,

24:23.600 --> 24:30.600
that is to say, put into crisis by this nomadic figure.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.600
The first territory is that of church itself,

24:34.600 --> 24:37.600
in its role as a sacred place,

24:37.600 --> 24:41.600
and also in its role as a community of believers,

24:41.600 --> 24:44.600
values, taboos, of course.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
From this point of view,

24:46.600 --> 24:51.600
it's almost indecent in such a context

24:51.600 --> 24:57.600
to see the emergence of a figure as clearly sensual as this,

24:57.600 --> 25:01.600
on whose drapery accentuates the contours

25:01.600 --> 25:04.600
at the anterior level of the arms,

25:04.600 --> 25:07.600
the thighs, the breasts,

25:07.600 --> 25:10.600
with that gravity-defying body

25:10.600 --> 25:13.600
from the bare feet to the denser's pace.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.600
Doesn't the Atlantic address by itself

25:17.600 --> 25:22.600
impose already an image of a pagan goddess or nymph

25:22.600 --> 25:27.600
in this scene consecrated to the chaste,

25:27.600 --> 25:31.600
precursor of Christ?

25:31.600 --> 25:34.600
The second territory that is attacked

25:34.600 --> 25:38.600
and perturbed by the emergence of the nympha

25:38.600 --> 25:43.600
is none other than the solemn bourgeois one

25:43.600 --> 25:49.600
of the Tonaboni family, the church, the family.

25:49.600 --> 25:54.600
George O'Vazari has well described the birth of St. John the Baptist

25:54.600 --> 25:57.600
as a scene of a kind directly referring

25:57.600 --> 26:02.600
to the rights of maternity in Quattrochante Florence.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.600
He says there is a beautiful woman

26:05.600 --> 26:08.600
who carries following the Florentine custom,

26:08.600 --> 26:13.600
fruits and flasks of wine from the country.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.600
We can see then,

26:16.600 --> 26:21.600
with this precise example, how far the cycle of GÃ©ralandayo,

26:21.600 --> 26:24.600
in spite of his religious iconography,

26:24.600 --> 26:29.600
is inscribed with the lay cymbals of the Florentine bourgeoisie,

26:29.600 --> 26:32.600
whom Christian Clapiers-Yubeyer has dedicated

26:32.600 --> 26:35.600
a wonderful and tropical study,

26:35.600 --> 26:40.600
and of whom Joseph Schmidt has analyzed the issues

26:40.600 --> 26:44.600
in work on the Tonaboni chapel itself.

26:44.600 --> 26:49.600
In the symbolic economy, I say symbolic,

26:49.600 --> 26:51.600
of the birth of St. John the Baptist,

26:51.600 --> 26:55.600
the younger who emerges from the right-hand side

26:55.600 --> 26:59.600
of the image is thus only a simple servant.

26:59.600 --> 27:03.600
According to a long-established custom in Florence,

27:03.600 --> 27:08.600
she carries from the country, from Villa,

27:08.600 --> 27:12.600
outside to Palazzo in the city.

27:12.600 --> 27:17.600
Fresh fruits and wine, which will give force

27:17.600 --> 27:20.600
to the mother, lying in bed after the birth

27:20.600 --> 27:24.600
within the walls of her Palazzo.

27:24.600 --> 27:28.600
But the symptomatic economy of the Ninefa

27:28.600 --> 27:32.600
appears when we discover in that very conformity

27:32.600 --> 27:35.600
the critical effect resulting from differences

27:35.600 --> 27:40.600
that are incarnated by the young serving girl in her stride.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.600
We observe, for instance, how much she differs

27:44.600 --> 27:48.600
from the other serving girl, the one who, in the background

27:48.600 --> 27:52.600
of the scene, carries also the same flasks

27:52.600 --> 27:56.600
to her mistress, and we catch ourselves,

27:56.600 --> 28:00.600
imagining that the two figures are perhaps

28:00.600 --> 28:05.600
two versions, two fashions, to see the same serving girl.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.600
Why not? Just an hypothesis.

28:08.600 --> 28:12.600
The effect of strangeness is found in any case,

28:12.600 --> 28:16.600
doubled. On one side, the young serving girl

28:16.600 --> 28:22.600
with no name. In the economy of the portraits,

28:22.600 --> 28:27.600
the young lady in the center, she has a name,

28:27.600 --> 28:32.600
a prosopography, artistry, history of portraits,

28:32.600 --> 28:35.600
okay, names.

28:35.600 --> 28:39.600
This serving girl with no name in the economy of the portraits,

28:39.600 --> 28:43.600
which are besides those

28:43.600 --> 28:47.600
of the great family, sorry.

28:47.600 --> 28:53.600
And the young lady has also two servants,

28:53.600 --> 28:57.600
with her. On the other side,

28:57.600 --> 29:01.600
the young serving girl comes from

29:01.600 --> 29:05.600
elsewhere, from another

29:05.600 --> 29:09.600
symbolic space, from another time,

29:09.600 --> 29:13.600
the past epoch of paganism,

29:13.600 --> 29:17.600
and another time than that of the bourgeois ceremony,

29:17.600 --> 29:21.600
the now of Florentine customs, or the

29:21.600 --> 29:25.600
evangelical event, the past of sacred history.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.600
They are all means, these are

29:29.600 --> 29:33.600
all means, to denote the extraterritorial

29:33.600 --> 29:37.600
ity, the eccentric and perturbin,

29:37.600 --> 29:41.600
and in short, what I would call critical character of the

29:41.600 --> 29:45.600
NINFA. Why does this figure travel not only the figurative

29:45.600 --> 29:49.600
production of the Renaissance, but as well, the entire

29:49.600 --> 29:53.600
body of Abba Vabo's work? Because

29:53.600 --> 29:57.600
she crystallizes, and up to a point

29:57.600 --> 30:01.600
of view, and she realizes, just like

30:01.600 --> 30:05.600
Graziva for FjÃ¶d, a goodly portion

30:05.600 --> 30:09.600
of his theoretical choices, his objects of interpretation,

30:09.600 --> 30:13.600
and his models of historicity. We are hardly surprised

30:13.600 --> 30:17.600
that a panel of Mne Mosine atlas has been

30:17.600 --> 30:21.600
dedicated to her. The NINFA,

30:21.600 --> 30:27.600
the idea of the idealandios, a legurized first,

30:27.600 --> 30:31.600
naphleben, the survival, the afterlife, constructed

30:31.600 --> 30:35.600
by Abba Vabo as a model of temporality, necessary to understand the

30:35.600 --> 30:39.600
economy of a recollection of images

30:39.600 --> 30:43.600
that was reducible neither to the

30:43.600 --> 30:47.600
idealistic principles of the imitation of the engines,

30:47.600 --> 30:50.600
nor to the positivistic recourse to an iconographic

30:50.600 --> 30:54.600
tradition. NINFA, consequently,

30:54.600 --> 30:58.600
offers us the complexity of a trans- iconographic

30:58.600 --> 31:02.600
and trans-historical model in the context

31:02.600 --> 31:06.600
of a representation that refers to the classics.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.600
The NINFA is still only

31:10.600 --> 31:14.600
an adequate sitation. Iconographic

31:14.600 --> 31:18.600
sign, perfectly consistent with the symbolic universe

31:18.600 --> 31:22.600
that stages it. Classics,

31:22.600 --> 31:26.600
Roman, Greek. But in a context of

31:26.600 --> 31:30.600
Christian representation as

31:30.600 --> 31:34.600
the case here in the nerve center of the largest

31:34.600 --> 31:38.600
Dominican church in Florence, with

31:38.600 --> 31:42.600
the, it's the same in the case of St. Mary Magdalene

31:42.600 --> 31:46.600
being represented at the foot of the cross

31:46.600 --> 31:50.600
with the features of a minute, a hair

31:50.600 --> 31:54.600
unbound, stripped of clothing, violent,

31:54.600 --> 31:58.600
such as with unbound hair, violent, and

31:58.600 --> 32:02.600
stripped of clothings, which is how Donatello,

32:02.600 --> 32:06.600
or here, Bertoldo de Giovanni, present her, for instance.

32:06.600 --> 32:10.600
Therefore, the NINFA becomes a critical

32:10.600 --> 32:14.600
sitation. It's a sitation, but a critical one. She makes

32:14.600 --> 32:18.600
something surface as a counter motif, an unconscious

32:18.600 --> 32:22.600
of representation. In short, it's a symptom.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.600
It's a fleeting, fossil, traversing figurative space

32:26.600 --> 32:30.600
like an accident or an unbidded phantom.

32:30.600 --> 32:34.600
Moreover, the NINFA incarnates and allegorizes

32:34.600 --> 32:38.600
the economy of that Patos formel

32:38.600 --> 32:42.600
that Abba Abbivarborg tried to describe

32:42.600 --> 32:46.600
the lateral transmissions and the missing links

32:46.600 --> 32:50.600
in the long du dure of occidental art.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
It's not simply a matter of opposing static representation

32:54.600 --> 32:58.600
of medieval to the living motion in Renaissance,

32:58.600 --> 33:02.600
but it's also necessary to understand the phenomena of

33:02.600 --> 33:06.600
intensification of movement. This problem is crucial

33:06.600 --> 33:10.600
in which Italian art from Polayolo to Michelangelo

33:10.600 --> 33:14.600
experimented with all the possibilities.

33:14.600 --> 33:18.600
In the fresco of Guillen Dio, the NINFA opposes

33:18.600 --> 33:22.600
her dynamism against the immobility of

33:22.600 --> 33:26.600
all the other figures, but she's not satisfied

33:26.600 --> 33:30.600
with merely working graciously

33:30.600 --> 33:34.600
as everything converges in intensifying her motion.

33:34.600 --> 33:38.600
The position of her body, her left foot

33:38.600 --> 33:42.600
is slightly lifted up, the robes streaming in the wind

33:42.600 --> 33:46.600
and therefore enlarging her gesture

33:46.600 --> 33:50.600
and propagating it around her.

33:50.600 --> 33:54.600
We rediscover here a characteristic of Renaissance visual culture

33:54.600 --> 33:58.600
the importance of which has been shown,

33:58.600 --> 34:02.600
of course, by Michael Betsendall and also Charon Fermour.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.600
That is the strictly choreographic fashion of envisioning

34:06.600 --> 34:10.600
the human gesture in representation.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.600
There is no doubt besides that the recognition of these

34:14.600 --> 34:18.600
processes of intensification responded in

34:18.600 --> 34:22.600
VÃ¡bog's work with a theoretical awareness of

34:22.600 --> 34:26.600
intensified forms in the total epistemic

34:26.600 --> 34:30.600
of his own time, aesthetic of intensity

34:30.600 --> 34:32.600
Nietzsche,

34:32.600 --> 34:36.600
and the passion of attitudes Charon Fert.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.600
Let's also recall that VÃ¡bog in order to

34:40.600 --> 34:44.600
explicate the patos formel in terms of

34:44.600 --> 34:48.600
superlatives of the language of gestures

34:48.600 --> 34:52.600
Utilizai utilized as an

34:52.600 --> 34:56.600
anthropological argument the analogy with

34:56.600 --> 35:00.600
this famous separation function,

35:00.600 --> 35:04.600
in the Indo-European languages studied by the linguist

35:04.600 --> 35:08.600
Herman Ostov, doesn't

35:08.600 --> 35:12.600
the intensification of bonus

35:12.600 --> 35:16.600
into malia and the intensification of malia

35:16.600 --> 35:20.600
into optimus, so three different radicals

35:20.600 --> 35:24.600
suppose a change in the linguistic route

35:24.600 --> 35:28.600
therefore the graceful serving girl

35:28.600 --> 35:32.600
with the light footstep who is an expectedly

35:32.600 --> 35:36.600
invited into the iconography of John the Baptist

35:36.600 --> 35:40.600
would thus be fundamentally

35:40.600 --> 35:44.600
deracinate, a strange woman,

35:44.600 --> 35:48.600
a stranger, an extraterritorial

35:48.600 --> 35:52.600
no green card

35:52.600 --> 35:56.600
anthropologically speaking

35:56.600 --> 36:00.600
the serving girls anonymity

36:00.600 --> 36:04.600
reminds us of one of Abbivabog's first intuition

36:04.600 --> 36:08.600
when reading the work of Edward B. Tyler

36:08.600 --> 36:12.600
concerning the survival observed in Mexico around

36:12.600 --> 36:16.600
1860, he understood that the

36:16.600 --> 36:20.600
survival only appeared contrary to the assumed

36:20.600 --> 36:24.600
traditions as transversal symptoms, phenomena

36:24.600 --> 36:28.600
where unfit to use Tyler's own

36:28.600 --> 36:32.600
expression unfit, that is to say

36:32.600 --> 36:36.600
in adapted, obsolete and congruced, ephemeral

36:36.600 --> 36:40.600
and acronistic, thus in 1895

36:40.600 --> 36:44.600
and 6, when Abbivog visited

36:44.600 --> 36:48.600
the Indians of New Mexico, he would be interested

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
in impersonal rituals and

36:51.600 --> 36:55.600
anonymous persons, stubborn symptoms like that

36:55.600 --> 36:59.600
Pueblo woman on the right,

36:59.600 --> 37:03.600
that he photographed at the moment that she promptly

37:03.600 --> 37:07.600
regained the back hole of her quarters, fleeing

37:07.600 --> 37:11.600
the eye of the black chamber of the camera or

37:11.600 --> 37:14.600
fleeing the reach of the accidental

37:14.600 --> 37:18.600
logos. The figures and the paradigm of the

37:18.600 --> 37:22.600
human being that helps us finally to better understand

37:22.600 --> 37:26.600
where the history of images must find

37:26.600 --> 37:30.600
its efficacious end to appear

37:30.600 --> 37:34.600
and act as a knowledge that is a repeat against

37:34.600 --> 37:38.600
transversal to those disciplines

37:38.600 --> 37:42.600
constituted in the social sciences

37:42.600 --> 37:46.600
the question is in you for me, the

37:46.600 --> 37:50.600
neurology,

37:50.600 --> 37:54.600
the psychology, but in the social sciences

37:54.600 --> 37:58.600
according to the limits of more or less

37:58.600 --> 38:02.600
defined territories, in photographing himself

38:02.600 --> 38:06.600
a lady, peasant lady

38:06.600 --> 38:10.600
in Setignano here.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.600
Vabog made evident the temporal

38:14.600 --> 38:22.600
transversality of his

38:22.600 --> 38:26.600
concept of Naftleben, setting an image

38:26.600 --> 38:30.600
of a gold star.

38:30.600 --> 38:34.600
Between coins of antiquity and representations of

38:34.600 --> 38:38.600
media, he also made evident the social

38:38.600 --> 38:42.600
transversality of his notion of Patos Formel, but

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
chiefly he made evident the critical

38:46.600 --> 38:50.600
and finally in the last plates of

38:50.600 --> 38:54.600
Naemozune, political dimension of this transversal

38:54.600 --> 38:58.600
especially when he spoke about Geistus

38:58.600 --> 39:02.600
politics, for example, which remain inherent of all

39:02.600 --> 39:06.600
his analysis, which remain agonistic, generally

39:06.600 --> 39:10.600
as they were to the point of madness

39:10.600 --> 39:14.600
with the devastation of the First World War

39:14.600 --> 39:18.600
to, in general, the tragedy of western culture

39:18.600 --> 39:22.600
which is an expression he used as well as

39:22.600 --> 39:26.600
Georzimel, for example. Perhaps we should

39:26.600 --> 39:30.600
read the Vabogian transversals today in the light of

39:30.600 --> 39:34.600
Michel Foucault's writing in which eccentric

39:34.600 --> 39:38.600
transversals fall under the term heterotopias

39:38.600 --> 39:42.600
all of Gildolous and Felix Guattari,

39:42.600 --> 39:46.600
I come back to Dulous because we learn in

39:46.600 --> 39:50.600
a thousand plateau this, which is a major

39:50.600 --> 39:54.600
point that nomadic knowledge

39:54.600 --> 39:58.600
nomadic knowledges, however

39:58.600 --> 40:02.600
dismissively they are ranked, however

40:02.600 --> 40:06.600
light are the footsteps, can act

40:06.600 --> 40:10.600
in spite of everything like a real what

40:10.600 --> 40:14.600
Dulous

40:14.600 --> 40:18.600
says is a machine of war against

40:18.600 --> 40:22.600
the territorial instrument of

40:22.600 --> 40:26.600
Royal Sciences, so to speak, always

40:26.600 --> 40:30.600
monastÃ©, monast, by their self-sufficient

40:30.600 --> 40:34.600
Thank you.
