WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
Good afternoon. We are ready for this afternoon's panel, which will be on classical and Renaissance art

00:09.160 --> 00:15.880
essentially. We have several participants. The first one we already heard this morning,

00:15.880 --> 00:21.080
Georges D. Ubermann, who is a philosopher and art historian and he teaches at the Echol

00:21.080 --> 00:27.680
de Zoudde to the South Social, is the author of several books, just to mention a few images

00:27.680 --> 00:33.160
in spite of all, for photographs from Auschwitz confronting images, questioning the ends of

00:33.160 --> 00:39.360
certain history of art. And this is just a sampler. You have more in the description.

00:39.360 --> 00:48.520
The next member of this panel is Thomas Dacosta Kaufmann. And Dr. Kaufmann is Frederick Markman,

00:48.520 --> 00:54.400
professor of art and archaeology at Princeton University. He's authored several books also

00:54.400 --> 00:59.840
and again the list is in the leaflet, but I can just mention a couple, Archimbaldo, visual jokes,

00:59.840 --> 01:07.120
natural history and still life paintings, painterly enlightenment, the art of France, Anton Malbert.

01:07.120 --> 01:17.440
The next member of the panel is Francois Quivizier. And he is actually curator of digital resources

01:17.440 --> 01:22.600
and librarian and researcher at the Warburg Institute in London. And we owe to him the nice

01:22.600 --> 01:30.160
iconography that we have for the current workshop. He has written recently a book on the sensory world

01:30.160 --> 01:38.680
of Italian Renaissance art. The other member of the panel is Dorothea Rockburn. She's an artist

01:38.680 --> 01:45.800
who works with both industrial and natural materials, paintings and she cuts, draws, falls and calculates

01:45.800 --> 01:52.560
to create complex works of art built upon mathematical foundations. She has been, she has had several

01:52.560 --> 02:01.120
exhibits and actually currently she has an exhibit at the MoMA until January 20th on drawing which makes

02:01.120 --> 02:10.960
itself. And the last member of the panel is Christopher Wood who is a professor at Yale since 1992.

02:10.960 --> 02:18.000
He is currently visiting professor in the German department of NYU. He has taught as a visiting scholar

02:18.000 --> 02:24.640
at different universities and he's author of several books including Albrecht R. Dolfer and the

02:24.640 --> 02:31.840
Origins of Landscape, Forgery, Replica, Fiction, Temporalities of German Renaissance Art among other

02:31.840 --> 02:43.120
books. So I just have another announcement to make that actually Ed mentioned. There is here as a

02:43.120 --> 02:52.320
participant to the workshop Eric Breitbart and he has actually made a documentary on Abi Warburg

02:52.320 --> 03:01.600
entitled Abi Warburg Archives of Memory. It lasts I think 27 minutes if I to be precise and so those

03:01.600 --> 03:08.160
of you are interested in watching it we could actually have it after the round table have a look at this

03:08.160 --> 03:17.120
documentary so I actually think it's a good idea to stay on for another half hour. So have the panel

03:17.120 --> 03:23.360
and I don't know who will start. Ed, are you on the back of the ceremony? I can stand by asking

03:23.360 --> 03:31.760
what I can ask you. Perhaps, well I'm listening to this this morning someone told me that not much

03:31.760 --> 03:39.600
has been spoken about Warburg but really about what he opened and his method and when I open my

03:39.600 --> 03:48.000
computer now I see hundreds and thousands of images and the problem is how to make sense of these images.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.920
So really my first question would be to Jor did you bear man what is the relevance of Warburg to

03:53.920 --> 04:01.680
the current practice of iconography because indeed in this time Warburg was accumulating his collection

04:01.680 --> 04:08.320
for his own purpose. Now we can log into an image database like art store to take a very obvious

04:08.320 --> 04:16.880
example which has 1.5 million images and it's really a sign of the internet this kind of overwhelming

04:16.880 --> 04:23.760
quantity of images which increasingly demand for most scholars an ability to make sense of that

04:23.760 --> 04:31.920
mass of data. So Jor maybe you like to start by pointing out what would be the kind of relevance

04:31.920 --> 04:38.400
of Warburg's method to the current state of the practice of looking at images.

04:38.400 --> 04:50.320
It's a big question. Let us say first that in the beloved Warburg Institute there are two

04:50.320 --> 05:04.800
two things. One is the photo library which is very big and the other is Nemozinian class.

05:05.600 --> 05:11.840
You spoke about hundreds of thousands of images and in the Nemozinian class there is only

05:11.840 --> 05:25.440
1000 image so to speak. Therefore I think that the question of databases the hundreds of millions

05:25.440 --> 05:33.440
of billions of images you are dealing with as a librarian as an archivist is one thing. The other

05:33.440 --> 05:40.480
thing is to make a night-class. I mean there is a crucial and conceptual difference between

05:40.480 --> 05:51.360
an archive and atlas. Archive is a tool. Atlas is a work. It's a decision. It's an act of

05:51.360 --> 06:03.600
interpretation and I would say that I am more interested I use thanks to you and other. I use

06:03.600 --> 06:12.240
archives but my aim my work is directed towards atlas. That is to say to make a decision

06:13.200 --> 06:21.760
to make a montage an editing a proper editing to make sense with the relation of two images three

06:21.760 --> 06:34.240
four fourteen one thousand why not more but this is a complete difference very big difference that

06:35.360 --> 06:43.200
to organize an archive a database and to make a night-class. Absolutely so the question really

06:43.200 --> 06:50.640
is how to make an atlas out of that proliferation of images. What kind of

06:50.640 --> 06:57.200
methods for instance this morning there was a discussion about aesthetic art etc if you look

06:57.200 --> 07:03.280
at the way 16th century people look at images they don't think of art if you look for instance

07:03.280 --> 07:10.320
at records of iconoclasm people attack images in general whether they're on their painting

07:10.320 --> 07:17.360
whether they're on liturgical utensile etc so I was wondering whether precisely that proliferation

07:17.360 --> 07:25.280
of images that accessibility force us to think outside these categories of aesthetic experience

07:25.280 --> 07:34.720
and think rather in terms of of response to two images. You want to say something?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
On that?

07:46.800 --> 07:52.720
What is the question? What is the question? What do you do when you're trying to make a point

07:52.720 --> 08:00.320
about the Renaissance and instead of I think you know 100 small reproduction you have 10,000

08:00.320 --> 08:06.880
images when you're looking for mercury instead of I think you know six photocopies and three

08:06.880 --> 08:12.720
books do you have? How does the quantity affect the art non-art distinction? It seemed to me that

08:12.720 --> 08:19.200
in the 19th century with a much smaller database and this was what George was saying,

08:20.000 --> 08:25.040
Varbour and many others he wasn't the only one we're perfectly capable of a distinguish between

08:25.040 --> 08:30.000
works that have been or let's say images that have been institutionalized as art works and functioned

08:30.000 --> 08:34.560
within some kind of art system and those that weren't so are you suggesting somehow that it's

08:34.560 --> 08:41.360
the quantity of images today that's available that blurs the distinction? Or perhaps that calls

08:41.360 --> 08:49.600
for different approaches to two images. For instance if I search for mercury in the Varbour

08:49.600 --> 08:58.800
guy demographic data I won't only find images by femme spencers. I would find mercury in the

08:58.800 --> 09:06.080
view of beer mugs and stuff. If you search on Google you might do better. Yeah possibly but what I mean

09:06.080 --> 09:12.480
is that with these instruments you can see images in a far broader context than you could earlier

09:12.480 --> 09:19.600
and perhaps think more in terms of responses to images than in the kind of rather basic symbology

09:19.600 --> 09:32.160
that is implicit in the iconographic method. Fucu said to know is to cut. So I didn't answer

09:32.160 --> 09:37.360
exactly your questions because your question was what do you do now which by the way is not

09:37.360 --> 09:46.960
a round table about renaissance it's about now but why not? Okay now I can just speak of an

09:46.960 --> 09:54.000
experience I did. I organized an exhibition at Reina Sofia Museum about atlases of images.

09:54.000 --> 10:08.880
So for my own stake I did on my own personal scanner 20,000 scans and of course the exhibition

10:08.880 --> 10:17.520
was cut in this. It was a choice but what is interesting is the choice. It's not my archive

10:17.520 --> 10:27.200
which is 20,000 images is today nothing but this is important this is it is the choice.

10:29.680 --> 10:34.640
You're making a natural class rather than a straightforward paper and perhaps that would

10:34.640 --> 10:41.680
be an approach. Well I just want to pick up on what you said because I want to ask a more general

10:41.680 --> 10:47.680
question. This idea of knowing is cutting which is related I think to what you were saying about

10:48.320 --> 10:55.840
Ponce de Tuaveres, some idea like that. Well and I think it picks up from what I heard what David

10:55.840 --> 11:05.280
was suggesting about how interest in Warburg had changed and you know if one thinks as Christopher

11:05.280 --> 11:11.200
said quite well that this was an esoteric interest. Warburg was very esoteric and now as you put quite

11:11.200 --> 11:19.520
nicely it's become exoteric and why we're all here hearing about this person when in a way you

11:19.520 --> 11:27.120
would have had to have been a kind of fair dank. Kind of. A fair danker as the Germans say or the

11:27.120 --> 11:33.920
Austrian say that you in order to as you were I mean you were interested in this and Warburg

11:33.920 --> 11:41.360
as 30 years ago but not everybody was and unless you had been at the Warburg Institute or thought

11:41.360 --> 11:46.560
about the history of the classical tradition this would not have had the kind of broad resonance

11:46.560 --> 11:52.880
that does. Now you gave a good explanation about why this you know why this particular person cuts

11:52.880 --> 11:59.360
across many fields and why there are many ideas but why my question is even related to going to

11:59.360 --> 12:04.000
talk about now why independent of Renaissance or classical whatever we're supposed to be talking

12:04.000 --> 12:10.960
about directly here does this have four four panels that could have many more I mean why why is

12:10.960 --> 12:18.320
Warburg suddenly resonating as it just that he's been translated into this lecture or is there more

12:18.320 --> 12:24.400
to it I don't know if it's a huge question yeah maybe we could could could I yeah I'm sorry to go

12:24.400 --> 12:30.880
head but I'm yes try to frame the an answer in terms of the Renaissance actually because I mean

12:30.880 --> 12:38.080
it does seem to me that it's significant in the late 19th century and he's not alone in this regard

12:38.080 --> 12:45.520
he's he's following in Warburg's path but that he's framing the self-understanding of modernity

12:45.520 --> 12:51.920
Warburg is attempting to frame the self-understanding of modernity in terms of the Renaissance and

12:51.920 --> 12:58.880
the question here that I'm trying to put forward is what what was his theory of history what did he

12:58.880 --> 13:07.200
think the role of modernity was and there's an there's an alternative to framing the modern

13:07.200 --> 13:12.560
experience or let's say dating the initiation of the modern experience to the Renaissance and that's

13:13.440 --> 13:19.600
and that's focusing on romanticism that was the that was the alternative that's the absent in

13:19.600 --> 13:28.000
Warburg he was he was not a romantic thinker he and this is related I think to his unwillingness

13:28.000 --> 13:33.040
to engage with the problem of the subject subjectivity it's romanticism right I'm talking about the

13:33.040 --> 13:40.240
heart of German romanticism 1800 that puts the subject right at the center and proposes the subject

13:40.240 --> 13:48.640
as the kind of you know irreplaceable foundation for for for private and collective experience and

13:48.640 --> 13:55.760
he's rejecting that and instead re-embracing an older theory of history which proposes that it's

13:55.760 --> 14:02.000
the dialogue with the past with the ancient past an anguished dialogue with the ancient past which

14:02.640 --> 14:10.800
essentially guides our path and he sees I think and Pernofsky and Cassieur and others who followed

14:10.800 --> 14:18.880
him agree with this they see the period from the Quattro cento to 1800 so let's say the 15th century

14:18.880 --> 14:28.320
to the 18th century as essentially a kind of well this was a kind of a period without significant

14:28.320 --> 14:35.920
internal development it was it was a period when the humanistic project kind of found its bearings

14:35.920 --> 14:39.840
maintained its bearings and then it was disrupted again by romanticism and it's that disruption that

14:39.840 --> 14:45.520
he's contesting he's he's trying to re-establish against I would say that the all the currents of

14:45.520 --> 14:52.880
his time re-establish the the the what we now call the early modern period as as the matrix let's

14:52.880 --> 15:01.040
say of so what I would want to ask even those who framed the conference is what is what aspects of

15:01.040 --> 15:16.960
Varborg's concept of modernity and modern experience are presumably being found attractive again

15:16.960 --> 15:32.160
well if I can give perhaps immediate reaction in my view one of the interesting things of

15:32.160 --> 15:39.760
Varborg is its use of neuroscience and when I when I studied the 16th century I found looking at

15:39.760 --> 15:45.840
art you have to look at how the brain works and if you start to look at the 16th century discourse

15:45.840 --> 15:51.440
on the brain that's essentially Aristotle and it's it's kind of naive and anachronistic to

15:52.000 --> 15:56.400
to think that because this thought very startle you have to read Aristotle to understand their

15:56.400 --> 16:02.720
their thinking so at least from my point of view what Varborg would point towards is to use to

16:02.720 --> 16:08.720
take the responsibility of the present and to understand the brain function in a certain way

16:08.720 --> 16:14.720
and then to look out for manifestation of this functioning outside the realm of science which

16:14.720 --> 16:22.080
in the 16th century doesn't really encompass as much brain activity as neuroscience does I mean

16:22.080 --> 16:30.400
you can see that at the very very obvious basic level if you open a university manual for doctors

16:30.400 --> 16:36.560
the concept of five sensors has stopped existing for a long time so you have to think perhaps in

16:36.560 --> 16:44.960
terms of of postural sensors of a hallucetron etc etc so what I find is that it really opens

16:44.960 --> 16:51.280
art history or the history of images to the full function of the brain and the brain has

16:51.280 --> 16:58.720
produced producing or productive of culture I mean from my point of view that that would be the

16:58.720 --> 17:08.880
most interesting interesting side perhaps it could be also said that it's remarkable how

17:10.160 --> 17:21.040
there is a kind of mirror between the object and the method I mean many of great art historians

17:21.040 --> 17:34.000
were reborn as art historian because they studied Renaissance

17:34.000 --> 17:53.520
so you really defined your own practice as an art historian finding in a Renaissance

17:53.520 --> 18:08.320
which is so rich so a new way of damage of course and it's this correspondence between the object

18:08.320 --> 18:24.800
you study and the process as a as a researcher think historian is also in the study of images

18:25.360 --> 18:31.680
what Vabberg said mostly about images is that they were

18:31.680 --> 18:44.080
subject to processes of van derungen migrations like a stamp it's wonderful a stamp because it's an

18:44.080 --> 18:53.120
image which can go from a country with the enemy country crossing the border you can write to your

18:53.120 --> 19:03.120
friend from Germany to Italy during the first world war this is the magic of images and it involved

19:03.840 --> 19:10.560
the thinking of images as possibility of crossing the borders it's the reason I was interested in

19:10.560 --> 19:17.440
this topic I agree with you about the importance of the notion of von derungen and I would say

19:17.440 --> 19:23.920
to answer your question about the modernity here that is certainly something in which Warburg was

19:23.920 --> 19:30.960
responding to his own time I mean not only posted stamps but also the other metaphors I mean just

19:30.960 --> 19:38.960
like we're reusing these metaphors of territoriality which of course just territoriality crossing

19:38.960 --> 19:46.720
borders the border guards this kind of thing but also he does write about he pays attention to

19:46.720 --> 19:57.760
submarines and airplanes and he refers to tapestries as the vehicles or the well Farsawiga which could

19:57.760 --> 20:06.240
be cars automobiles by which images images pass from one place to another so it's not only

20:06.880 --> 20:14.160
the that images wander it's also the the vehicles or the means by which or the media and as we say

20:14.160 --> 20:20.480
now by which they wander including prints and so he talks about the importance of prints and also

20:21.920 --> 20:26.720
so-called decorative arts I mean small objects which were passed and which also carry images on them

20:27.360 --> 20:34.880
so there's something about that which is very modern in that sense or would point to the notion

20:34.880 --> 20:41.440
of modernity being also the invention of newer media or newer vehicles for the transmission

20:41.440 --> 20:46.560
of images not just that they are transmitted or that they exist or that there's some psychic

20:46.560 --> 20:52.320
reason why they're picked up but how they are and that would be I mean that is one reason why it

20:52.320 --> 20:57.520
would be of interest you know to be I mean where one goes from that rather than recognize ah you

20:57.520 --> 21:03.200
already thought about these things of course it goes back to what I you know to the question

21:03.200 --> 21:11.200
that I was asking initially which is why you know why is he now of interest and why wasn't he of

21:11.200 --> 21:16.640
interest because with all of this the history of the classical tradition and one thing that one

21:16.640 --> 21:22.240
must say and that you would be very well aware as you mentioned Shastel and all the rest that the

21:22.240 --> 21:26.800
history of when talks about the Renaissance that the history of the classical tradition and his

21:26.800 --> 21:32.400
interest in it was something that was passed on and was regarded as important but all of these

21:32.400 --> 21:40.240
other kinds of notions of how one would develop a broader conception not only in terms of opening

21:40.240 --> 21:45.280
up to other disciplines opening up to neuroscience or whatever it might be but thinking about notions

21:45.280 --> 21:52.160
of the Renaissance or cultural transmission as being something that was broader than in one place

21:52.160 --> 21:57.040
broader than Italy than Florence's was something that was you could almost say or you were to

21:57.040 --> 22:04.160
experience it suppressed in France or whatever so I mean that so that's interesting that that

22:04.160 --> 22:10.000
comes back so maybe as a model it's important and certainly the modernity I don't know if Christopher

22:10.000 --> 22:16.880
agrees with this or not it's part of that aspect of things and that's something that's also just

22:16.880 --> 22:21.920
makes him a person in the 20th century at least as late 19th as opposed to for the early 19th

22:21.920 --> 22:28.640
except that today it would be hard to find voices among his more progressive adherents

22:28.640 --> 22:33.680
who still consider the engagement with antiquity to be the fundamental so there's a sense of there's

22:33.680 --> 22:39.920
been a translation involved there's been a translation involved right that that that that

22:41.360 --> 22:45.120
vobber didn't think anything in the middle ages you know he said it again and again he said that

22:45.120 --> 22:50.240
they were you know he had it would would now be unacceptable he had it would now be an unacceptable

22:50.240 --> 22:57.200
view of the middle ages namely that it was a period of kind of obscurantism you know limitation

22:58.080 --> 23:04.720
spiritual blindness that was waiting its emancipation he speaks openly in those terms and the renaissance

23:04.720 --> 23:11.040
for him was a heroic liberation of the human will Cassieira will pick up on this later remember

23:11.040 --> 23:17.440
this is completely I mean it's relatively new it's I mean the term renaissance was coined only by

23:17.440 --> 23:24.480
Michlé you know only you know less than 20 years really about 10 years before voborg was born

23:24.480 --> 23:30.480
okay before then no one talked about the renaissance and then bork arts you know just a few years

23:30.480 --> 23:36.080
after that produces his book this interest it launches the concept of the renaissance which by now is a

23:36.080 --> 23:42.960
is a cliche so voborg it still feels fresh I think in the late 1880s to go to Florence and to identify

23:42.960 --> 23:48.960
the quadricento as the matrix of the modern of the modern experience but that had to do with this

23:49.680 --> 23:56.000
relationship to antiquity right and then as George was saying eloquently how it's striking how art

23:56.000 --> 24:01.680
history as a discipline has allowed itself to be guided by the project of the renaissance itself

24:01.680 --> 24:06.000
Panoschi said this explicitly he just said that's what it means to be a historian is to

24:06.000 --> 24:14.080
is to inhabit two time frames at once and to and to and then to have them doubled so that when he

24:14.080 --> 24:21.680
says the humanists already the the humanists in reviving antiquity already already predicting

24:21.680 --> 24:26.880
panoschi who then studies the renaissance which so this is kind of recursive process this kind of

24:26.880 --> 24:35.040
infinite regress where by each generation identifies a revivalist moment in a previous generation so

24:35.040 --> 24:40.000
forth on and on backwards and this this sense of a kind of specular notion of history always

24:40.000 --> 24:46.160
reflecting itself repeating itself maybe this is close to your transversals this I mean you know

24:46.160 --> 24:51.920
this is this is this is voborg's renaissance to what extent is that still alive today I would say

24:51.920 --> 24:58.640
that the voborg literature is split you know on the whole it's split between those who for whom

24:58.640 --> 25:05.200
voborg the anachronist the survivalist the voborg the teller of ghost stories and so forth is still

25:05.200 --> 25:10.880
the fundamental one and those who think that it's about neuroscience so to that extent I see this

25:12.880 --> 25:20.160
panel as potentially a kind of space of um I don't know what resistance is too strong but

25:20.160 --> 25:25.760
let's say a pause in the what seems to be the overall agenda of the conference but maybe I'm

25:25.760 --> 25:32.240
wrong about that but one thing that you don't really bring up is that the renaissance artists

25:32.240 --> 25:37.920
themselves were involved in antiquity they were involved in breeding ancient writings there was a

25:37.920 --> 25:44.480
sort of a flow from ancient Greece to Italy it was kind of underground at that time but it was big

25:44.480 --> 25:53.040
and it shows up in this greeny chapel the the jatto small corner or small figures in the corner that

25:53.040 --> 26:00.240
are black and white or figures from antiquity and so on absolutely yeah

26:06.160 --> 26:14.080
I apologize because I was late this morning so I missed some of the discussions but I had a

26:14.080 --> 26:23.600
fascinating lunch with my friends of a genebra and one thing I can say is

26:25.680 --> 26:33.600
something we as art historians we share with sacroanellists is both

26:35.840 --> 26:42.400
the fact that for a psychoanalyst an image is not here or there it passes through

26:42.400 --> 26:53.120
the second thing is about the uses of past past is not somewhere past is depends on the use we have

26:53.120 --> 27:03.200
of the past so in um it's interesting that the renaissance is precisely a period in which two

27:03.200 --> 27:11.040
models of the uses of the past were developed one is the nationalist one so to speak Vasari

27:11.040 --> 27:23.560
Renaissance equals Tuscany that's all then there is the alternative the movement van der

27:23.560 --> 27:33.920
ungen the work of Thomas for example so it's about the uses of the past some weeks ago I was in

27:33.920 --> 27:43.440
Athens in Greece I went to the musical musical museum there was a bowl of eight century

27:44.720 --> 27:57.280
before Christ with a beautiful swastika okay it's a motif it's linked to the motif we call Greek

27:57.280 --> 28:11.040
okay now what happens I went out of the museum and I was able to observe the work of I don't know

28:11.040 --> 28:20.880
in English L'ob d'Oré this nadzi party which is extremely efficient now in Greece and which uses

28:20.880 --> 28:28.000
the swastika and the Greek motif and the swastika as a nationalist

28:31.760 --> 28:47.920
discourse and I met some poets or filmmakers very very modern who use the past in a completely

28:47.920 --> 28:56.240
different way so this is a question of use value it's not a question of uh uh renaissance is not

28:57.600 --> 29:04.240
the renaissance is exactly what we do with this no it's very simple because I believe

29:04.240 --> 29:11.760
Barbara thought that the past bore down on us that the past uh yeah governed us in a way we were

29:11.760 --> 29:20.960
not there were limits on our freedom to use yeah but uh vabog is not the gods we can also read

29:20.960 --> 29:29.920
Valter Benier along with vabog and make something which works too you agree I agree I don't

29:29.920 --> 29:59.840
know the last I think Barbara gets god but I mean around here he's got a little bit uh certainly not god in London but one aspect that has that has been it tends to be referred in this premise as an art historian but I believe he defined himself as what he called a psycho historian or historian of the psychology of humanity so would you would you see that one aspect of art history would be precisely to diagnose the tensions of

29:59.840 --> 30:10.160
humanity as recorded by by images of course I mean that's why I'm not sure whether the historical

30:10.160 --> 30:21.440
sense is well developed in in the disciplines of the body I was fascinated by the fact that in the

30:21.440 --> 30:31.680
before the second world war there is a kind of constellation of thinkers namely Kal Einstein

30:33.440 --> 30:46.160
a bit barborg Valter Benier me so who plays the image at the center of the question of history

30:46.160 --> 30:55.760
or even time at the same moment they placed the question of time at the center of the notion of

30:55.760 --> 31:08.000
image just before the second world war what happened before after it's quite different but I am extremely

31:08.000 --> 31:18.480
impressed that at this moment there was a kind of urgent emergency to think images through time and

31:18.480 --> 31:27.600
to think time through images no but don't you think that the in order for the image to become a time traveler in the way

31:27.600 --> 31:34.560
barborg describes it and you describe it doesn't the image have to be desycollegized it has to it has to

31:34.560 --> 31:42.080
leave the body essentially it has to be externalized and and and become a formula so that it can move

31:42.080 --> 31:48.320
freely right and to that extent it makes it a historical instrument but it also puts it beyond

31:48.320 --> 31:56.000
the reach of the of the sciences of the body it seems to me therefore the interest to to look to

31:56.000 --> 32:07.200
have a look to psychoanalysis I mean metastatic psychology as a way of desycologize the the the

32:07.200 --> 32:14.480
structures of the yeah yeah psychoanalysis is a human eudic that's of course that's of course but

32:17.680 --> 32:24.000
you speak of science you are laughing oh yeah as an artist this is simply not how it works

32:24.000 --> 32:32.400
you know it's overly intellectualized it's a it's intellectual certainly being an artist as an

32:32.400 --> 32:39.920
intellectual pursuit and historical pursuit it's also visceral and sexual and you're not

32:41.120 --> 32:46.560
you're not talking about the juices you're like refining it into language and I'm missing

32:47.200 --> 32:53.200
you know the guts of it because barborg wasn't interested in art he was interested in images

32:53.200 --> 32:58.000
and in history but art for him had no meaning he never spoke about it I didn't know that no in fact

32:58.000 --> 33:02.560
every time he always did it disparagingly he said oh that's that's that's that's aesthetics that's

33:02.560 --> 33:10.240
for you s-thetes I'm interested in images and I'm interested in time and and and the past and so

33:10.240 --> 33:18.480
forth if you're speaking about images though and the quetricental how can you separate art from images

33:18.480 --> 33:24.160
doesn't exist he did he separated images from art he said I'm going to look at these as images

33:24.160 --> 33:30.080
and whether they're works of art or or or or material culture that doesn't interest me the the

33:30.080 --> 33:37.200
initial the initial question that is asked is a historical question but it's the answer given

33:37.200 --> 33:43.280
is a psychological one and that may also affect the making of things in other words looking at

33:43.280 --> 33:50.160
things abstractly he would say well what is the reason for the development of this style which is

33:50.160 --> 33:56.560
he said that's what he says this station is and the psychology of the style why is there a change

33:56.560 --> 34:02.320
not that there is a change which we could recognize by looking at images or looking not involved in

34:02.320 --> 34:08.320
the process of making but looking to sequence of images saying this is different from that we see

34:08.320 --> 34:13.920
the nymph here and there and then he looks and knows the nymph being there and he gives an explanation

34:13.920 --> 34:19.840
which is and then that leads that can lead into other directions it doesn't necessarily so it's

34:19.840 --> 34:25.120
not as a whether it's art or not it's it's the phenomenon that he's still trying to describe

34:25.120 --> 34:32.320
which he's which is responding of course perhaps to a particular moment which described as being

34:32.320 --> 34:38.720
style if you go something else with your doing but renaissance art i mean yes culturally but

34:38.720 --> 34:48.000
i mean there are only there is only art to take images from and if you look if you spend any time

34:48.000 --> 34:59.920
in seano or sec or uh florants you cannot help but observe how the work is made because they layered

34:59.920 --> 35:08.480
pigment and with time sometimes some pigment has peeled off and some has come through it you know

35:08.480 --> 35:15.760
a green has come through a white or whatever and all of that there's something about the making of

35:15.760 --> 35:23.760
the work which the actual making makes the image the image isn't there before the making you're

35:23.760 --> 35:30.480
completely right but that's not what vardard believed he wasn't interested in fabrication and he wasn't

35:30.480 --> 35:39.600
interested in creativity it does contemporary art historian who inherit from the past what what to

35:39.600 --> 35:45.920
do with with this would be the the question and if if i may just make quick observation you mentioned

35:45.920 --> 35:52.240
sciences of the body i think referring to neuroscience the little i've read of neuroscientific literature

35:52.240 --> 35:58.000
i find it very exciting because it's a literature that points out what the orientals knew very well

35:58.000 --> 36:03.360
long before the 20th century and what the west knew before they came out that is body and mind

36:03.360 --> 36:10.160
they're they're not two different entities they're constantly interconnected but i could name objects

36:10.160 --> 36:19.840
of me of of study which are neither body nor mind namely texts or images they're not body or mind

36:19.840 --> 36:26.640
they're external and i would propose that that's those are the entities that i deal with

36:27.760 --> 36:35.120
not mind not mind's or body but it depends what you call psychology usually there is a big

36:35.120 --> 36:44.000
distinction between uh wirthing and verbal from a formalist i cannot i think and i look at uh

36:44.000 --> 36:51.360
andreopinote who knows very well these things that the difference is not so big i mean when

36:52.080 --> 37:02.880
wirthing speaks about psychology it's not at all a question of ego what time my my choices what i

37:02.880 --> 37:12.960
love my feelings no not at all it's fundamental it's a kind of anthropological psychology

37:12.960 --> 37:22.160
it was the reason i i was recalling the meter psychology the Freudian one so this is very important

37:22.160 --> 37:30.720
to make the distinction and just an quick answer to your question to your difference between

37:30.720 --> 37:44.240
the intellectuals and the creative or i don't know i would say that verbo was as everybody it was

37:44.240 --> 37:54.880
not only verbal verbo did very well he was working all the day and he was transforming things he was

37:54.880 --> 38:07.360
constructing something a library writing organization of images making the work of art yes at the end

38:07.360 --> 38:17.600
at the end one of the greatest painters of the 20th century Gerhard Hichter took the the the model

38:17.600 --> 38:33.680
from verbo to make his own atlas so there is no no even better even better

38:36.000 --> 38:43.280
of course he knows i agree i mean there is no there is a consistency

38:43.280 --> 38:52.800
which begins in the 20th moholynaji did atlases lokorbusier did atlases everybody

38:52.800 --> 39:00.640
so all the members are meant that it's true no it's not a question no no i don't mean maps

39:00.640 --> 39:16.400
atlas the kind of professional like a death by thing in in in verbal atlas there is a temporary to start

39:16.400 --> 39:23.600
very important thing i mean that is never about text the text be important because it brings to mind

39:23.600 --> 39:31.680
it brings to our kind of body and mind something otherwise the text is so many and the images for

39:32.640 --> 39:41.840
for vowels and by all is in the absence of collective in the absence of religion don't forget that he

39:41.840 --> 39:52.320
was because i already mentioned by our friend from los angeles he was in a simulated family that

39:52.320 --> 40:00.640
kept Judaism at home he refused to participate in it i must say that i was also very good friend of his

40:00.640 --> 40:09.040
niece of her in the battle in Rome for four years and i know this detail is very intimately

40:09.040 --> 40:19.200
and his attempt to his fantasy was to reconstruct the co-activity human justice correct to cultural

40:19.200 --> 40:28.400
cultivated way and he believed in you simply you can say naively then by coming to town with the

40:28.400 --> 40:38.000
longest possible path you can reconstruct the co-act form for human life in the absence of religion

40:38.000 --> 40:46.720
in the absence of collective identity with which you could identify it that for me there was no

40:46.720 --> 40:53.840
co-activity got any further and that is the grand purpose of this art history very different

40:53.840 --> 41:01.360
fundamentally different from both are very very great you're right you better be on psychology

41:01.360 --> 41:13.120
of style so thank you for if i appreciate your comments and i consider that the discussion has

41:13.120 --> 41:20.000
been stimulating enough and you've been stimulated by it but what i would prefer is you wait until

41:20.000 --> 41:27.600
the round table finishes their discussion and then we open for comments and questions otherwise if

41:27.600 --> 41:33.200
everybody start jumping in we'll have a problem i also wanted to just remind you that this is about

41:33.200 --> 41:40.960
classical and renaissance art i wanted to come back to one thing that you were saying yes that is

41:40.960 --> 41:48.400
that is if and indeed i can't recall the exact places where he was taking things from but if

41:49.200 --> 41:56.800
if we were to go with him to with warberg to florants we would have not only been looking at you know

41:56.800 --> 42:02.960
the parucio bardi chapels of the cajada we would also be going to the bargello but not to look at

42:02.960 --> 42:08.960
the paintings in the bargello but at the door knockers and the locks and that kind of thing and the

42:08.960 --> 42:15.840
and the and the those are you bring up my very point yeah now as an artist you know um i didn't

42:15.840 --> 42:24.640
grow up in america i grew up in um i i grew back in montreal and life was as much uh juicier in a

42:24.640 --> 42:31.680
certain way the butter was real the bread was real my family they talked about what they had eaten

42:31.680 --> 42:37.360
yesterday what they were going to eat today and what they would eat tomorrow and it was very it had a

42:37.360 --> 42:47.600
reality to it a real reality and when i'm in italy or an aspect of france as well i can sense the

42:47.600 --> 42:57.440
same thing that they were they were the images they're making are a living they're part of their life

42:57.440 --> 43:06.960
and of course there's a journals of pran tormel talk the way my family talked exactly and uh and

43:06.960 --> 43:13.520
they're very concerned with of a food is medicine in the way that to eat healthily was to live longer

43:14.080 --> 43:21.280
and um i think it's very important to talk about this in relation to the images

43:24.080 --> 43:30.000
i also speaking a little bit out of turd i i think that rickter when he built his

43:30.000 --> 43:38.480
complex of buildings was i think we should stick to the renaissance and well i did but it is i'm

43:38.480 --> 43:45.280
talking about warberg you know i think it it was a warberg associated the buildings that people

43:45.920 --> 43:47.600
the same idea as the library

43:52.720 --> 43:59.280
i mean we you were mentioning a verbose notion of the renaissance which is quite outdated now

43:59.280 --> 44:05.040
or not not followed by by current scholarship and indeed if you if you study the renaissance

44:05.040 --> 44:11.040
you realize that so many texts written in the middle ages were still published were still active

44:11.600 --> 44:18.560
if you look at the at the reception of classical art one way of looking at the ways in which

44:18.560 --> 44:23.280
renaissance artists receive classical classical artists to look at the demand of religious

44:23.280 --> 44:29.360
art which the amount increasing realism increasing physical presence to convey the image of a suffering

44:29.360 --> 44:36.960
god etc so basically what is what does remain of our work stuff and the renaissance for the present

44:43.440 --> 44:52.480
for the present um i live in paris and so in paris now there is a wonderful

44:52.480 --> 45:01.360
exhibition about renaissance which comes from Florence so here there is everything i love

45:01.920 --> 45:16.080
donatello it's wonderful really wonderful um kind of uh focus is done about

45:16.080 --> 45:28.320
the model of roman republic in a 15th century uh florantin renaissance and it is shown through

45:28.320 --> 45:39.440
some manuscripts and uh okay good perfect yeah at the end there is the so-called nicolo daudzano

45:39.440 --> 45:46.560
now attributed to deziderio de cetinho and not donatello

45:50.640 --> 46:00.400
i mentioned that nowhere in the very big catalogue in the discourse of curators nowhere

46:00.400 --> 46:11.120
there is a mention to what verbogin produced in 1902 namely the famous boate the ex-voto's

46:12.160 --> 46:22.640
of la santissima anunceta which were a kind of artisanal religious vulgar

46:22.640 --> 46:33.120
kitch oful in deziderio of madam tussos but it was it was an hyper realism the kind of which

46:34.320 --> 46:42.640
um Alessandro Baronqui spoke about about the realism of the first renaissance uh already in 14th

46:42.640 --> 46:54.800
century so verbog introduced the fact that confronting the actual images which you can see in museums

46:54.800 --> 47:03.040
which were kept through the curatorial work of of viserie and the museum etc so you have

47:03.040 --> 47:10.640
masterpieces but all these objects ex-voto's were destroyed in 17th century and the

47:10.640 --> 47:21.280
the the the big work of verbog was to interpret the actual objects which are masterpieces along with

47:21.280 --> 47:33.440
vulgar objects which all disappeared this is a masterpiece of anthropology but now in a big

47:33.440 --> 47:40.800
exhibition on renaissance there is no mention of this despite the fact that to understand the

47:40.800 --> 47:50.080
nickele of the odes anor you need these ex-voto which themselves are linked to the famous roman

47:50.080 --> 47:58.000
republican model of the imaginess so there is something which does not work today these

47:58.000 --> 48:03.920
exhibitions are just the entertainment industry they have nothing to do with uh yes but sexuality

48:03.920 --> 48:09.920
but okay you're just making a comment i just make a because but there is a very big catalog of

48:10.880 --> 48:19.040
specialies and so on but this is a critical point i would say but why verbog today but to speak

48:19.040 --> 48:26.320
again about the ex-voto's you know there's another part of the exhibition which i saw in

48:26.320 --> 48:32.560
Florence which also involves making but also this question of transmission of images not only the

48:32.560 --> 48:39.360
images where they're repeated a memorable room in which there are all the terracadas and casts

48:40.000 --> 48:47.600
so that um suggesting how uh and very interesting also from point of view of art and making things

48:47.600 --> 48:54.960
how the same image is repeated x number of times and then i think it's something that you definitely

48:54.960 --> 49:00.960
um you know we're much more conscious of that as a result perhaps of a long tradition but again

49:00.960 --> 49:08.080
not not going back to this whole why this was done in the first place however uh seeing

49:09.120 --> 49:13.600
seeing the renaissance as warberg might have done that is to say for the transmission of images

49:13.600 --> 49:17.920
in a different way in terms of materiality in terms of making which is what you might have

49:17.920 --> 49:24.880
been interested in which you uh as Christopher says wasn't uh so uh was so concerned concerned

49:24.880 --> 49:35.200
with the question of um making things i mean actually going back to your point that is also of

49:35.200 --> 49:42.240
course how we are much different i mean you know now than than then uh one thing i quite right

49:42.240 --> 49:50.880
about uh making objects in the past sculpture painting whatever took a long time you know you

49:50.880 --> 49:56.320
had to grind your pigments still does well you well particularly if you had to grind your pigments

49:57.200 --> 50:01.040
and you had to find your pigments and you had to find your pigments and you had to find your

50:01.040 --> 50:06.400
pigments and you had to mix them with the medium etc and you had to prime your canvas and all that

50:06.400 --> 50:12.880
or if you have to make paper and making paper and preparing paper and making the drawing

50:12.880 --> 50:17.920
implements or whatever that's why drawing old drawings are small they couldn't make big paper

50:17.920 --> 50:24.560
well paper is valuable too yeah but uh so i mean there's all all of that which is also

50:24.560 --> 50:30.800
uh an experience that we don't have although he would have had it and been more related to it

50:30.800 --> 50:38.320
that's the the shocking thing now of course is uh as we're aware is the older crafts have gone

50:38.320 --> 50:43.680
or the number of places that are gone so that it's increasingly difficult even to repair objects

50:44.400 --> 50:50.080
not just talking with somebody who is a store there and very few places that even exist in the

50:50.080 --> 50:56.800
place like Florence where you know you where if you remember what it was like in the past where you

50:56.800 --> 51:03.680
know you can wear furniture is made where a frame was repaired or can be made relatively speaking

51:03.680 --> 51:08.960
to what you know one over experience a hundred years ago or 150 years ago it's so interesting

51:08.960 --> 51:15.920
in my studio when I hire assistants it used to be that they knew how to stretch canvas and

51:15.920 --> 51:24.080
jesso and now they know how to make websites things just to elaborate on what you're saying

51:24.080 --> 51:34.160
but when I started wandering around Florence was uh the first time was in 66 and a lot of the old

51:34.160 --> 51:41.440
Florence was still there there was a place where you could buy pigment ground pigment and it

51:42.000 --> 51:50.240
didn't it burned down in about 1974 but for a long time I bought pigments there and and

51:50.240 --> 51:57.600
there were there was a wonderful color I mean this isn't a side of Renaissance color

51:58.640 --> 52:06.080
called capuchin yellow which is really pink which was made by the capuchin monks it's just an

52:06.080 --> 52:13.600
incredible material but when I started wandering around I did I actually did a mural that's in

52:13.600 --> 52:21.040
um a bun fresco that's in um main and it's based on the virtues of good government

52:21.680 --> 52:28.960
and so I was studying sienna up and down and spending a lot of time there and I was interested

52:28.960 --> 52:35.440
in the fact that the bank of the sienna was the first bank in Europe and that that tradition had

52:35.440 --> 52:42.320
actually in a certain way come from Egypt via Greece I mean that's the I'm making a lot of shortcuts

52:42.320 --> 52:51.120
to Italy when when the Medici brought the Greeks over to teach the Italians how to paint because

52:51.120 --> 52:59.600
they had lost that skill through invasions and uh all of that I find you know that that whole legacy

53:00.240 --> 53:06.480
uh what happened in Egypt and how it went to Greece and how was brought to Florence and how those

53:06.480 --> 53:15.120
images that we all adore came about that way if I made I think that's an extremely important

53:15.120 --> 53:21.200
comment and coupled with with with with with Thomas remarks about uh transmission and uh and

53:21.200 --> 53:26.960
George on the transversals and the traveling images and so forth we're probably all arrived at a sense

53:26.960 --> 53:35.520
today of a kind of permanent multiplex flow of ideas and images that knit culture together and

53:35.520 --> 53:42.800
therefore we would probably I would think be willing to relativize the epochal significance of the

53:42.800 --> 53:51.920
Renaissance it is to say uh maybe be unwilling to join VAR board in his celebration of the Renaissance

53:51.920 --> 53:58.480
as a as as a fundamental emancipation right because the ex-vodos after all continue straight through

53:58.480 --> 54:02.640
from antiquity straight through the Middle Ages to the Renaissance the forms that you were referring

54:02.640 --> 54:07.520
to travel straight through they're constantly being imported and transmitted and translated and so

54:07.520 --> 54:12.720
forth so then why privilege the Renaissance as he did and that would be that would be the question

54:12.720 --> 54:19.840
I would ask again I mean who who's willing to allow that um perception of an elective affinity

54:19.840 --> 54:24.640
that the Renaissance felt with antiquity classical antiquity you want us to talk about the classical

54:24.640 --> 54:31.840
and I think we should because um who's willing to let that elective affinity between the Renaissance

54:31.840 --> 54:37.840
that is to say European modernity and classical antiquity be a guiding principle and use a rhetoric

54:37.840 --> 54:42.960
of emancipation liberation and so forth though human will human freedom and so forth it seems

54:42.960 --> 54:47.280
very important because not everybody's willing to give up on the idea of human freedom psychoanalysis

54:47.280 --> 54:58.720
is about freedom it seems to me well I'd like to sort of dive in uh I think that the idea of the

54:58.720 --> 55:05.040
Renaissance is is an art historians idea actually I think what artists were living was a continuum

55:05.760 --> 55:10.560
from Egypt through Greece to through Rome through classical Rome

55:12.800 --> 55:16.560
yeah I'm reading a book forever which is because it's very hard to read

55:18.880 --> 55:24.400
calm it's about drawing and it's about a different kind of perspective

55:24.400 --> 55:33.360
than Renaissance perspective and so clearly there was a whole different field of perspective going on

55:33.360 --> 55:40.640
before three point perspective and afterwards so and this is coming from Egypt Greece Renaissance

55:40.640 --> 55:47.520
so I think you know the idea that you know these bunch of English men suddenly discovered the

55:47.520 --> 55:57.120
Renaissance you know is because probably England was really dull and you know and here's this juicy

55:57.120 --> 56:04.880
painting going on and especially when you I mean the whole idea of calling the Mannerous Mannerous

56:04.880 --> 56:11.920
as as Nied Remark and sort of like the Big Bang kind remark is you know they were shocked by the

56:11.920 --> 56:19.520
homosexuality in in Mannerous painting which you know is a very English thing to be shocked at since

56:19.520 --> 56:24.800
there was a high frequency of homosexuality in England well there's something highly

56:24.800 --> 56:29.840
suspect about the whole late 19th century cult of the Renaissance centered in Florence and you

56:29.840 --> 56:35.040
know you might ask what is the isn't it significant that Varbog is an intellectual gravitate towards

56:35.040 --> 56:41.840
Florence in the 1890s and not Paris right Paris is was the center of the intellectual world for

56:41.840 --> 56:48.320
for any for any intellectual and and and Varbog is Paris ophobic right instead it's Florence where

56:48.320 --> 56:53.040
he's in the meteor of Walter Pader Berenson he wasn't friends with Berenson but and many many

56:53.040 --> 56:59.120
others who are all taking refuge from modernity basically taking refuge from technological modernity

56:59.120 --> 57:05.520
taking refuge from the vulgarity of America taking refuge from also German romanticism I believe

57:05.520 --> 57:12.160
so there's a triple threat there I'm talking about Henry James and Sargent and all the rest of it

57:13.040 --> 57:18.160
so the rest they invented the Renaissance yeah but I don't think artists thought about that

57:19.040 --> 57:25.920
you know I think you know they were living art and living I mean artists no matter where they

57:25.920 --> 57:32.320
they're using videotapes they're involved in art history and they know what's going on and they're

57:32.320 --> 57:38.480
you know absorbing it some are more knowledgeable than others but it's always it's always a threat

57:38.480 --> 57:44.560
through everything perhaps there's one problem with Renaissance artists when you read the artistic

57:44.560 --> 57:49.760
literature of the Renaissance is that they never talk about making and they really conceal the

57:49.760 --> 57:57.520
aspect of making and technique from from the literature that they produce but Leonardo is never

57:57.520 --> 58:03.360
published is not published until the late 17th century and these are his personal notes if you

58:03.360 --> 58:11.120
look at the published literature it's about invention disposition by subject by Alberti by

58:11.120 --> 58:16.800
Paul Opino by a lot of the literature he's talking about perspective he's talking about perspective

58:16.800 --> 58:22.960
but that's an intellectual thing that's automatic that's optics perspective and in fact what what

58:22.960 --> 58:29.280
strikes me in that discussion one of the contribution of our works precisely in perspective was optics

58:29.840 --> 58:36.080
Renaissance is also connected but it is connected to optics if you read the beginning of the La

58:36.080 --> 58:42.400
Pittura Alberti explained the visual rays as something optic that goes from the eye and it's based on

58:42.400 --> 58:47.280
but anyway that's an academic discussion what I just would like to emphasize is that it seems

58:47.280 --> 58:53.520
that the verbal doesn't take for granted the message of Renaissance artists who are responsible for

58:53.520 --> 59:00.160
that distinction between so-called decorative art and fine arts and precisely that that's one of the

59:00.160 --> 59:05.760
use of a verbal to take the image as a matter of well if neither as a body nor as a mind but I'm

59:05.760 --> 59:12.800
not quite sure as what but certainly at something that travels across media and that should be studied

59:12.800 --> 59:23.920
through its traveling across media it recalls me a discussion about the the question why

59:23.920 --> 59:46.800
the Natello didn't have a foundry studio of its own a gibberti had the Natello no so you can

59:46.800 --> 59:53.840
interpret it and especially the one of the most the Natello's masterpiece the Judith

59:55.600 --> 01:00:10.240
is made by various studios of foundry bronze how do you say found so you can interpret in

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:20.800
two different manners you can say the Natello is now a Renaissance artist in this sense he is an

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:30.880
intellectual so he does not touch the bronze foundry the material and he lives he conceived and

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:40.640
the artisans are his assistants and he's the intellectual artist why not it's it's a good

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:47.680
interpretation but insufficient the other interpretation to complete this one is to say

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:59.600
he was so interested in the material because if you look at the Judith the face is completely

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:12.000
classic classic but there is a mold there is elements of gothic there is elements of hyperrealism

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:20.160
there in the same sculpture so he needed various ways to deal with the material

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:30.560
so this is wonderful this is the Renaissance for me and by the way has to do with money then

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:37.120
just as it is now is it the person with their own money had their own money money money money

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.920
and money in space i mean because if you think about money in space yeah money money in space

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.800
because you think about what was happening in the in the 16th century some people had foundries

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:55.280
in their own studio and others and the ship not and money is not a sufficient explanation no money

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:02.080
okay but if you look at the Natellos in general it's not by chance that in the diacrony the

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.960
differences of style you find the same in the single Judith so it's not only a question of money

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:16.640
oh money money can i say something about the classical i don't know whether this how

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.840
you know how this will strike you but how would it change things if i made the proposition and

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.040
and you agreed with this the viborgh scholars agreed with this that viborgh didn't actually

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:32.960
know much about classical antiquity that his classical antiquity for him was a known a known

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.840
quantity a fixed quantity he knew what every cultivated person knows i'm not sure he knew much

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.560
more about classical antiquity than say Freud did and it would i think would be instructive to

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:50.560
compare their images of antiquity that essentially his he was able to construct the system of

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.200
world's psychohistory of art that he did because antiquity remained a stable quantity he didn't

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:08.000
go too deeply into it he used only cliched images i would say that for vabor classic art classic was

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.760
the contrary that classic was for vincalmon for vincalmon classic was a norm a normatability

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:26.800
for vabor classic meant a way of instability classic means instability for him

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:36.320
this is the instability of greek tragic for vaborgh i i a mistake oh sorry sorry for vaborgh

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:46.640
it's instability so um once away once again it's about what do you do with the past

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:59.520
it's not about a news better i agree with you it for him classic is is kind of matrix it's a matrix

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.760
if i may just bring there's another element of metric which is in the classification of the

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.200
library and it begins with primitive art and then it's followed by pre-story card and then

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:16.960
classical art so there's this sense that primitive art even if it's something made in australia in

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.040
the 19th century should be put in a section before the historical section which are arranged

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.160
chronologically rather than alphabetically yes you you you're saying that this is the

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.080
doctrine of survival like the british folklorists right whom he was very influenced by that that

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:44.000
modern folkloric customs in rural england counted as archaic art archaic customs right yeah yeah

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:51.600
it might not be correct but that's certainly a starting point right that makes a classification

01:04:51.600 --> 01:05:01.600
of knowledge so it right indeed that's right and yet that that notion is overlaid upon a in fact

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:08.400
a rather conventional bourgeois conception of what classical art was which included all the

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:16.000
the agitated and tragic features yeah but they're also in vinkleman's canon i mean the you know the

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.080
lachlan is he for for for vibor right it's right in the 1905 duress he ends it by talking about the

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.440
lachlan and the main ads and the and and all of these figures they're they're all in vinkleman's

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.600
canon it's not as if he's expanding the canon of ancient art he's just flipping through

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:36.400
illustrated books about ancient art and picking the images he likes which happens to be the

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:42.720
agitated ones but but there is a very thorough so to speak reception of antiquity in the 19th

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:48.800
century if you look at flobere salambo and the temptation of centantony it's not at all a calm

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:56.240
and our monious antiquity on the contrary it's a delirium for emotion color violence blood i mean

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:02.240
everything in donatello it is like in flobere it is completely chaotic this is the point i

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:08.320
like to throw a little bit of a wrench into what you're saying uh that's my role here

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.400
uh i think the way in which museums to this day categorize so-called primitive art

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.960
is they don't quite know what to do with it and since you know we are the white imperialists

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:29.200
right and we know everything right why are these funny yellow people black people

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:36.000
red people making work that you can recognize as art i mean the metropolitan is put together

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.160
that way and it sounds like the warburg museum was put together that way too i mean there's no

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:51.040
sense of equality between different kinds of people none well we're already as concerned that's

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.720
there there's a point that touches on to the whole problem of an also an older idea of anthropology

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.560
which may be one of the reasons of course why warburg has regained some interest because it's

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:09.840
supposedly owns onto anthropology as uh we're becoming increasingly sensitive the notion that

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:16.240
the others are those who don't have history that's uh you know they do have history of course

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.400
some of course of course of course of course but what i'm saying is that that older

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:28.080
anthropological idea that ethnology or ethnography was a study of other peoples because those people

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:34.960
showed us what we were like when we were in the past and therefore history has stopped in those

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:42.880
parts of the world where supposedly uh progress has not come and others who don't have machines

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:48.880
or whatever it might be but it's always artists that would pick up so-called primitive art like

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:57.280
pakaso and and treat it as contemporary art and i i wonder if that's another actually a sort of a

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:05.200
problem behind some of the assumptions of warburg's work you know i think so going to going to New

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:17.840
Mexico and so forth but and and and actually brings up a question i wanted to ask to this group

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:26.240
because one of the ways in which why would have answered is the question of why warburg's of

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:30.880
generally of interest but i'll bring it back to the renaissance question and relate it to what we

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:38.720
were talking about a minute ago is uh that as you said he's nomencl it's been said that his

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.680
writing is enigmatic you could say that it was vatic that it's a prophetic and so it's like

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:49.840
banyam and you can read a lot into it you can read what you want but um i wonder if there aren't

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:57.600
some other things that can be said about that about why this is um attractive now that is to say

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:13.280
war uh yeah um and uh um if uh there is uh this kind of uh tension that is to say the idea of how

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:20.880
there's an underlying presence which is always there and something else uh in terms of the renaissance

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:27.760
too the assumption and what does it mean therefore uh what when we have a dual kind of meaning this

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.480
relates to both of the things that we've been talking about warburg says on the one hand

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:41.760
whether they say Athens and uh Oribi always won uh and then but at the same time using Athens

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:51.680
perhaps in another way he says uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:59.600
Athens once once to be conquered again back from Alexandria again and again i mean what does Athens

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.880
mean in both of these instances the same yeah it just means low logos yeah reason as

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:14.960
a star astra asta so um so and now is andry is a

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.720
is a meta-linear is not right but it used to it used to be Jerusalem but he switched it to

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:30.720
Alexandria to orientalize in a non-Jewish way yeah um but uh we're thinking of Oribi also being

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.880
what is always present underneath why why does it want to be why does it what do you how do you

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:45.120
interpret the vial the vola the the wanting why and how does that relate to the renaissance in

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:51.040
some sense that's that will to freedom that what wants to be reconquered from uh Alexandria wants

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:57.680
to be delivered from the clutches of the oriental uh bottle you know somaticism and drives and

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.800
some work right i mean and that's still how he's i mean we didn't even talk about that but that's

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.000
still how he saw the in i mean the renaissance for for him was this you know this uh this this

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.400
connection across time back to you know back to uh back to logos overcoming whether we're medieval

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:22.800
demons as well not perhaps it is also the fact that uh it is strange in vabo that when he speaks

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:32.720
about uh archaism primit archaism greek archa it's never greek archaic art it's always

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:43.360
alexandrin i i mean elenistice period always the laocoon style the peregamon you know so it's not

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:53.280
a cake at all for a history on the point of view of the history of greek art but for him this is the

01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:00.640
so alexandrin alexandrin should mean something with this kind of no i think his point is the classical

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:08.400
yes i think his point is the classical greek art alexandrinized itself and sort of allowed itself to be

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:13.920
contaminated by the oriental and that's what unleashed all these kind of baroque passions

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:19.200
which then needed to be tamed by by the renaissance which received them and corrected them

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:25.120
thank you

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:32.800
thank you

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:39.840
vaboque chose the renaissance as his focus his trap point or maybe the renaissance chose

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:49.360
vaboque um to speak to chris's point precisely because it was the period in which the oscillation

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.280
both the temporal and spatial oscillation between what he called the phobic legacy

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:04.800
and the mathematical resulted most clearly in batonin heights in in in this prudencia this

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:14.720
moment in which um a kind of clear-eyed wisdom could exist and therefore the classical ideal

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:22.560
was revivified but the renaissance has the double or the meta value that

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:32.480
it revivifies that classical ideal once removed and then you put vaboque as twice removed and so

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.920
he is able to as it were see himself reflected in that renaissance doubling

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:45.920
which raises the question of where we are now right one step further removed

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:55.200
which wing which which factions among the vaboque um literature are participating in that

01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:02.560
specular regression regressive process in which are abandoning it and setting up other beachheads

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.680
occupying other beachheads i would be in the neuroscience well i don't want to do it

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:12.560
no i think it's more complicated than that certainly the neuro i would say the neuro biological

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.920
i mean i don't want to label it so much but this kind of it that aspect of interest in vaboque

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.320
is not interested in these questions of history that's all i was saying at the beginning and it

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.960
except in so far as the memory is the place where it's way unique

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.320
or other places too that's the place that person appears to me

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
mm-hmm maybe

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.280
first of all a quick comment to as your your um

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.320
reference to psychology which is i completely agree a very ambiguous word if you use it

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:59.600
referring to authors like very flin whose prolegomena to a psychology of architecture

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:08.400
uh work characterized as psychology without psyche because they are very symmetological and this is

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:18.720
true for many authors of the ein film theories as well he'll the brand fish authors very well

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:27.360
known to to vaboque um my question refers to your very dense paper of this morning

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:37.440
um and particularly on the notion of symptom which is crucial and central to the paper and to

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:47.440
the whole of your reflection and particularly to the polarity opening closing because if i think

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:56.720
of the notion of symptom as used in ordinary language but also in the discourse of the medical

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:03.440
discourse in therapy perhaps even in psychotherapy and in psychoanalytical discourse

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:15.280
symptom is referred to one manifestation of the body fever for example that can have different

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:27.840
causes so the in the medical semiotics you see something an image of the body the rush the red

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:37.120
the high temperature and you have to close the perspective because you have many i.t.i. many

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:47.360
causes and you need to close the perspective the optics until you have found the cause that

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:56.480
determines that symptom on the contrary if i understand well your position and your hermeneutics of the

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:07.600
symptom leaning on vaboque it seems to me that the use of symptom here is here is rather the opposite

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:19.840
it's not closing the perspective closing it on a single meaning because if we take a patos former

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:30.480
it is symptomatic but it is a bodily posture the nymph the manad that can be inversed and

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:36.960
transformed into a christian makdalene like in bertol vudijovani or the serpent that can be

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:50.000
a sign of pathology of evil and a sign of therapy a far macon so in this second perspective that

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:58.480
seems to me yours and verbal perspective symptom and perhaps even froy's perspective symptom is

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:10.000
not closing to a single cause but rather opening up the image to its possible multiple meanings

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:21.520
you know that it is a big question of course i began on this problem

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:32.320
um long ago studying and confronting charco's notion of symptoms and froy's one

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:43.520
it seems to me that the difference between them one could be said positivist and the other

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:54.960
okay for a new way of you find the same in art history the exactly the same

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.760
I love the essay by ginsburg about the the clues the indexical but he does not recognize

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:15.360
this battlefield so perhaps i invent a battlefield or if i am wrong or he does not recognize there is

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:28.160
a fundamental difference um you have fever the doctor comes and says uh influencer okay when

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.520
you have the name you have the solution because there are some medicine for influencer

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.400
you are in front of painting from the

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:55.280
the some collection in parma your name is morality and you say it's i don't know lon franco okay

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:10.480
the name means the solution symptom is an enigma and the name is a solution you have a series of

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:22.480
portraits and through a big graphic analysis you say he is loreann so the image is he is the son

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:31.360
the first son etc this is a kind of interpretative way

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:43.120
uh linked to this first interpretation of what is the symptom the second is of course in my mind

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:55.840
influenced by psychoanalysis i would say if you i am not an analizan but i'm sure that if you go

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:07.840
to a psychoanalysis and one day you say it's mama mami it's not the end of the interpretive

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:20.400
process perhaps it's the beginning and so is art history when you recognize a name an attribution

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:30.720
a signification iconography it's not the end it's the beginning this is my view and i think

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:40.640
there is a big struggle today without even which is not named as such between the symptom in the

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:51.920
first sense so to speak closing and the opening one the most delusian so to speak most rheismatic if you

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.160
want

01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:01.840
isn't that implicit in your notion of transversal that is metonymic

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:10.800
completely much like delusian fall which may be a single thing but it opens up

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:26.000
absolutely absolutely yeah i'm glad you just opened up a bridge which i wanted to speak about

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.920
i'm i'm kind of the devil in between i'm a painter and an art historian and when i was very young

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:38.720
i studied with i guess varbergian influence art historians like the toenai and vittkover

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:45.760
and panofsky was there and oscar christella i wasn't ready for all of them but what i want to say

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:52.960
it opened up a world for me because it formed a kind of armature or a bridge to inter inter

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.800
disciplinary worlds because here i suddenly saw the renaissance as an integrated culture where

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:05.200
we got literature and philosophy and all the different disciplines came together and it it

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:11.840
performed amazing kind of mystery for me of how to delve how to get into the intercesses of all

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:17.360
these fields and find a transmission of culture a kernel of culture i never took it literally

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.760
and of course we all criticized gombrick for calling primitive art and later it became tribal art

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.920
and of course there was a lot of christianists and a lot of problems with with um

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:37.040
um with what we call tribal art today an archaic art but it gave me a sense of how can culture be

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.840
contained it's contained in the word but it can also be contained in images so though it's not

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:49.920
the way painters will often discuss a painting it had it gave it another dimension and that

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.560
dimension um should be opened up that dimension of a transmission of a total culture um there are

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:02.880
um there are some painters today that attempt that uh unselylm kefer maybe kentridge a few who

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:10.160
attempt to kind of cultural transmission through imagery uh or as or just what we're talking about

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.560
now association so that there are there's no such thing as a closed image it's infinite in it

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:23.920
it's historical line lineage and we can go back and forth so it has in it to me speaking also of

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:32.000
bothlyn who was fascinating and i fascinating because he gave words for um for the beginning

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.120
of exploring a painting open and closed forms of course he said baroque renous a contrast at

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:43.040
everything we don't have to contrast it as simply but it is an interesting way of perceiving uh is

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:48.720
there such thing as a more closed culture and a more open culture or ways of talking about things

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:57.760
so i think this tradition is very important uh as again as a vessel for culture and shouldn't be

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:03.760
the dichotomy of artists and art historians and scholars should be opened up in a much freer way

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.280
and speaking well oh that's that's enough

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:27.280
i i i don't um object to the basic uh statesman by panofsky that art history is a humanistic

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:38.000
discipline i don't object to this uh this article by panofsky and artist uh scientist genius it's

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:48.080
the title artist savagini yes it was about the humanism as de cluison mo how do you say

01:25:48.080 --> 01:26:00.400
what is the compartment? the compartment so the in the age of renaissance we have a new kind of

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:12.000
interdisciplinarity so to speak this is wonderful okay uh i am uh i was born to so to speak in the

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:21.120
stricturalist french school at this time uh it was useful to say the humanism is over

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:33.600
i don't agree with this i agree with a very much revolutionary french writer whose name is

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:44.880
josh batai who said that we need a more he says it's a quotation we need a more complete humanism

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:57.440
and he meant we need a humanism which includes the ineshive mo how do you say

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:08.800
incompleteness what is to say of course we need the hypothesis of the unconscious that's all

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.560
you know that's all can i just add i mean i very much appreciate what you said because you've

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:20.000
been introduced a term which has been absent from our panel it should have been here and that's

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.920
the concept of a cultural cultural history or kulturvissenshaft is the germans called it a

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:34.160
total study of culture which within which varburg loom is very large and it's an ongoing process

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:39.120
and subject today of much debate about what would be an updating of this of this project that you

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:44.160
so well described and experienced the only objection i would have and it's a little bit parallel to

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:50.880
to josh and i would invoke not batai batai de gur who said of the humanists in his letter on

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.000
humanism he said the problem with humanism is that its conception of man is not elevated enough

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:02.480
it's this parallel he and batai were contemporaries and a parallel concept of the of the incompleteness

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.520
of the project and to that extent i would object the only objection i would have is to the very

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:14.960
concept of culture because the concept of culture it seems to me presupposes already an ideal of

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.600
how it should turn out but the culture in fact is something we haven't achieved and we'll probably

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.400
never achieve culture is some kind of this total connectedness so i don't i don't think that works

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.720
of art can transmit a culture or that they can in any way kind of deliver a culture to us they are

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:39.040
simply attempts or steps towards some kind of project called culture

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:44.480
i meant a historical evolution development by the word

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:51.120
the positivity of things that have existed right

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.000
okay okay but the word is in the in high degrees debate with casser and in barberges involved here

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.040
because remember varborg is you know casser's close to varborg and identifies his project with

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.720
varborg in high degrees debate with casser that's what it comes down to whether culture is is

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.000
something we can start with or whether we need to end with it but that wasn't necessarily the

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:19.440
line that one had to take because they were also close to boas here close to close to boas boas here

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.280
the anthropology here i mean in new york and that would that would have been another

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:31.680
lie i mean culture is the way you would have heard us and understood here in new york and uh as

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.800
you know the other side of the anthropology is being developed which also then enters into the

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:43.920
frang anthropology and so forth so it's uh it doesn't have to be the line you're describing as

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:50.880
as in which shall we say the mandarin view of five inch class

01:29:50.880 --> 01:30:00.880
happy yeah just just a short comment um many elements that came from this uh afternoon very

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:09.200
interesting discussion i think point uh or brother to put it slightly differently convince me even

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:18.960
more why we still need fraud and perhaps why we need more varborg in a way i think in

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:32.640
the present moment what is really of the incredible importance uh is uh to focus on images

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:41.600
their power their pervasive presence in our life i i take this to be even more important than

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:50.000
their supposed aesthetic quality because and uh there is a trend which keeps going on

01:30:51.280 --> 01:31:03.920
so to speak the more or less explicit tendency to sterilize images to reassert the necessity to

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:13.040
have a subject and an object to externalize images so that we can contemplate uh uh for

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:20.160
hand then so to speak but uh the problem is they are simultaneously very much through hand then

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:28.560
and this through hand the night of images speaks in my opinion also from the very narrow peeping

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:38.400
hole that our level of description allows that of neuroscience they uh put us into question uh so

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:46.480
they are not just the external object or contemplation but they look at us so there is a

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:53.120
charismatic relationship between the image and the beholder and to make full sense of that i think

01:31:53.120 --> 01:32:03.280
uh we need uh approaches uh like that of a fraud and and varborg they specifically focus on this

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:11.440
aspect that that needs to be more and more uh at the center of uh of our reflection now i think

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:18.720
and what do you think about phenomenology i mean for the but what's about uh merlot pointi

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:26.640
uh which i'm very fond of the late merlot pointi visible and invisible and particularly um i see

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:37.200
there is uh more and more people are are looking back to merlot pointi um in film theory for example

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.160
in this country there are people like vidian subject uh that since maybe 20 years with carnal

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:52.160
thought has brought back phenomenology and particularly merlot pointi in the debate of uh of film theory

01:32:52.720 --> 01:33:02.240
uh the publication of his notes for the course uh the collage difference uh the word of expression

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.480
and i don't remember exactly the the english title uh that has been recently published

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:17.920
marocarbonne for example in lion is working uh and uh this is perfect for also for for guiding our

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:28.960
approach uh to our relationship to images so i think this uh reversibility of the relationship

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:38.240
between the image and the beholder is something that uh can be inspired by by barber approach beside

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:46.160
uh as i said uh phenomenology so and i i'm i'm pretty much convinced that the debate on on images

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:53.840
will be more and more uh uh focusing on this aspect also because of the real volatile nature of an

01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:01.520
aesthetic definition of an image uh as an artistic one everybody seems to be aware of that nowadays

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:11.200
thank you can i say something just uh a small point reacting to your discourse

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:24.000
um if we take seriously the lesson of the phenomenological lesson uh through i mean even

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:35.520
beansbanker which tells merlot pointi lacco we must say that the the relation the visual relation

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:45.040
is complexified when lacan said you are looked by i am looked by you

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:55.440
uh the the the the the the the visual relation the the gaze is also something which is not only

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:04.400
frontal it's a complexification of our our work and i mean when we study a work of art

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.240
especially for example or renaissance one we are extremely interested in what happened

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:20.720
in the space what space the cell the the the palazzo what happened of course the painting here

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:29.520
the tapestry but what happened there what was the specialty uh to look at is not only to look at one

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:40.560
point i think do you agree yes in fact that that makes a very nice foundation for an art history

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.880
which we normally artists are intent to try to find out who did what for who mapped our march

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:53.440
and when but then the next step is then with all this what is looking at us but that certainly

01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:00.160
doesn't exclude finding out the you know contract documents it's fundamental to reconstitute

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.160
that's still that is looking at us and that is not of course yeah what are the conditions

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:10.080
in which it were made and what was happening of course um i mean in terms of all kinds of things

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.120
that could be said or not about indeed about as we were talking earlier about the speed in which

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.800
something was made in other words of people are traipsing through the space where you're trying

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.920
to work all the time that's going to slow you down or if there's all kinds of other work going on

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.920
and what's happening if they're putting indoors or windows where you're trying to paint your

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.880
wall and that's happening for one reason or another or they're trying to conduct services in the very

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:38.720
place where you're working and so forth so all of that kind of thing is also related which is also

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.240
some things that we don't necessarily talk about but in a way uh the things that were opened in a

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:50.080
sense by warberg in terms of some of the aspects of cultural history and the other sense of what

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:57.520
goes on in it what goes on in the space uh yeah it's interesting it goes back to images so i was

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:03.520
just thinking about the other aspects of things it may be because we do have just to go back to

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:11.680
dr kiwije's so initial comments it may be because we do have this instrumentarium of uh imagery that's

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:19.440
so great that we talk about images rather than actually objects because the artifacts or what

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:25.840
whether they're art or not what we always you know what artifacts are the pro are what makes

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.040
culture i mean culture consists of artifacts now there i guess there could be visual artifacts too

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.720
but you know there's still there's still things that are man-made and that's it's

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.560
whether or not that's going to change the discussion that is to say that you have images which do not

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.280
exist in a in a materials in a material way and warberg could i don't think warberg envisioned that

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.640
he was still talking about prince carrying the image or whatever and the photograph carrying the

01:37:54.640 --> 01:38:01.680
image but yeah i'd like to say a little bit about what you're saying about gays something that

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:08.640
interests me very much about the Italian Renaissance art in churches uh is that the way

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:16.560
to go into contemporary art the way french artists made paintings still lives and so on

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:26.720
in the 19th century you you go right into the picture plane but with Renaissance art you do not

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:34.000
the work is hung high and it looks at you the different gaze

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.640
okay and i'm sorry

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:52.000
my name is saffron hula saffron i'm a professor of architecture at columbia university and they

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:01.680
uh i have run with my students workshop on how to design redesign the bob institute

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:10.320
as part of columbia imagining that at the time when the institute had to move from Berlin to

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.200
london it didn't move to london perhaps we now realize that that london perhaps was not the best

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:23.760
choice considering the fact that the university is prepared to disperse the library just threatening

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:32.240
it's still threatening it's still threatening so we decided to design a place for the bob institute

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:39.520
at columbia and so we looked at many aspects of the physical aspect of storing images

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:46.880
and even in the half i know i now know that it takes two cubic meters as a physical form

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.120
to store it and the fact that historically there was a connection with columbia because

01:39:53.120 --> 01:40:00.800
when bob was on his way to visit new mexico he spent some time with bars bars was a

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:07.680
anthropologist from Berlin who started the first department of anthropology in american

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:13.280
universities and bars invited bobwood to come and speak at columbia accepted

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.960
bobwood in the meantime which i and therefore couldn't have and this led me directly to the

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:24.000
question of consolgia i think it's still be confusing for everybody including yourself

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:33.280
probably to mention lacan in the same branch because like what nobody would call a concon

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:42.720
from the other hand i think that they they for my point of view a

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.520
pathological chance it would be much better to understand

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:55.760
bobwood in technological challenge than any other challenge precisely there isn't even

01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:05.920
a kind of solid background today because he was in contact with ludic bingsbanger as we know

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:12.480
ludic bingsbanger treated him over many years and ludic bingsbanger after all was the first

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:19.840
psychiatrist who takes technology on board reading both whose words aim honey and so that

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:27.680
should have meant quite a lot and it seems to me up to this moment that this has not yet

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:34.320
filtered through and perhaps that's one of the reasons didn't feel that through is

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:42.480
uh the authority of uh grombick because grombick famously wrote as the director of

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:52.000
the bob institute he wrote a book on uh vahu in which he more or less dismissed him as a serious

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:03.200
artist of uh grombick was totally committed to prepare the point of view and from prepare the

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:13.840
prepare point of view none of the thesis of a bobwood made sense about all empathy didn't make sense

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:21.360
and couldn't stand a kind empirical verification not at the time of but of of gromb by now we have

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:30.480
to be a new audience that basically this is a little bit more appealing to the basis not to me I mean I

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:40.560
wrote the thesis of a body uh a body and embodiment from a logical point of view in 1972 which meant

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.720
that I had a good basis to approach art from an equal point of view and I was responsible for art

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:54.640
in in the studio for the work of school art at the time that was um you know obstetric for some

01:42:54.640 --> 01:43:04.800
on the other hand don't it I dislike you in the application I like you very much but I think I

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:11.920
like I like it because it's you and because it's bound to a kind of rich intellectual of the last

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:22.080
10 years you see the problem of culture as nature or in point art is the balance between the external

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:30.800
in term when the Germans in Berlin built an instant museum and thought that by collecting great

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:40.640
object of art artifacts from the high point of Greek culture they could guarantee their own culture

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:47.200
and tradition obviously they make a big mistake because they believe the possession of these things

01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:53.840
is in itself guaranteed for some kind to in fact I made this joke when it was recently

01:43:53.840 --> 01:44:01.200
uh restored they instantly said they would chip it with the English architect was responsible

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:09.440
for the French which is a masterpiece but I said to him you see the program of this museum was to

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:18.640
safeguard certain quantization obviously the structure of it is approved of an historical fact that it

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:27.760
did not have to safeguard any culture any visualization the state of crime tried to have a collection

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:34.880
of so-called anti-culture right it's a considerable collection it turned out that it wasn't a different

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:44.800
whole state what does it tell us it tells us that it doesn't matter that's what it tells us because

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:52.720
for him this object that were fake and obviously he never died to distinguish between me treated

01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:00.400
them as authentic works but he didn't matter he didn't matter just it doesn't matter how you write

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:10.000
go without you in the famous book that the handwriting of garbou was unwritten it would not be said

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.800
so Edgar Wayne in the famous league in anonymous or you in the theater at the time you know you

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:24.720
could write the news anonymously and Edgar Wayne wrote interesting on one hand you claim you can

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:34.000
read barbou and writing on the other hand you claim that he's included so either is claimed

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:43.360
in confide with that so i think the secret of barbou is precisely can be understood best

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:52.480
infineargica terms in serelian terms in which according to which the photos cannot the image

01:45:52.480 --> 01:46:05.200
is residual is only like letters are not important in themselves as the Chinese say

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:15.920
when you want to fish a fish you make a nice road and a nice something at the end of the

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:27.600
thread to capture the fish but once you cut the fish the road and all the rest of no interest

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:40.320
i just can answer about paris i mean lacquer okay

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:51.680
okay can i answer to the just about if you think the recourse to lacquer is confusing

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.960
perhaps it's because you think that paris is a territory but paris is like new york it's a

01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:11.200
place of cost-popolitism i want to recall that the french so so called french thought french

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:20.080
stretch regularism i want to recall that michael fuckel began his work translating carefully

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:29.600
Ludwig bizvanger i want to recall that lacquer uh dedicated a lot of time to translate martin

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:37.600
heidegger and Freud of course and there are there were many connections especially between lacquer

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:45.520
and bizvanger because as you know bizvanger died in the 60s i think in the even in the 70s perhaps

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:54.480
i don't remember but a great psychoanalyst french one whose name is pia fredida who is not

01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:02.080
translated into english i guess was precisely the man who was able to go between between lacquer

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:11.520
and bizvanger fredida was the assistant and bizvanger at kreutlingen so there is no isolation of lacquer

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:21.920
and parisianism there is a link between uh profound link between uh french philosophy french

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:27.280
structuralism and german psychiatric

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:37.280
i want to make a distinction between the phandology of melopontic is incompatible with the phandology

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:44.400
of heidegger heidegger was in principle and he says so you know in contrast is a is a

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:52.480
turning turning upside down huster yeah but for t is much more in the huster egan

01:48:52.480 --> 01:49:00.320
yeah but contrast contrast is dialogue that is in the way for example we contrast but we dialogue

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:10.240
i think the two of you should fight this after the meeting we set aside a room for you to do this

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:18.320
two quick and really efficient points for your response um following on the idea of uh students

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:27.600
designing uh warberg library at columbia long before that in 1933 even as all the books and

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:34.480
artifacts were being packed up there was a very real possibility and i invite you to imagine

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:40.800
if that had happened where we would be right now at 17 east eightieth street the paul warberg

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:49.520
house was offered as the home of the ab warberg library paul warberg died in early 1932 um he

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:57.120
was my great grandfather his brother ab had died in 1929 i think but 33 they're packing up the

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:05.520
library where can it go london was originally seen simply as a safe harbor phillics warberg

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:14.640
another brother put up half a million dollars 1933 dollars to finance this library and it was

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:22.880
going to happen and the state department put sand in the gears the state department memo exists

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:31.840
saying there was a fear that it could stir anti-semitism in new york if this german library had come here

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.800
so i am i'm so it stayed in london where it where it was parked so i invite you to imagine

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:48.320
the warberg library here in new york cross-pollinating with the analytic community that was arriving

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.960
all through the thirties assisted in part by ab warberg's niece patina warberg who was once

01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:00.800
someone who walked the halls of the new york cycle analytic what would the warberg library

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:07.040
have been like and what would his influence have been like without gombrick annihilating

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.800
the legacy of ab warberg in and undercutting him in that fascinating way um the other

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:21.760
point to consider and i'm anticipating tomorrow obviously but i find it curious that we could talk

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:30.320
talk about in such a fascinating way ab warberg's relationship to history and his sense of the past

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:38.320
bearing down on us when you consider that his flight into madness that precipitated this day

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:46.320
uh at bellview in the treatment by bens vanger was in fact his sense in his intersection of

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:53.120
psychosis and brilliance that by delving into antiquities he had stirred these angry spirits

01:51:53.120 --> 01:52:00.800
and started world war one he felt responsible uh among other mad thoughts but he specifically

01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:10.960
thought that it had to do with his delving into the past so would welcome response

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:24.640
it's i want to return but perhaps it is a program for tomorrow for the next year

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:33.520
uh to the question of the torio galese uh it is important because we are here in the

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:39.600
psychoanalytic new york psychoanalytic society and institute and i think the question was

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:48.960
very central why we need fraud why we need verbog and between these two fields of research

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:57.360
it is an intersection and for me the intersection today was really the question of unconscious

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:05.600
what is the place of unconscious in the process of creation and in the process of interpretation

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:14.720
of the creative work unconscious and drive we can say unconscious in memory it is the question

01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:23.120
of the trace and the relation to the time which is very central in our discussion a lesson about

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:31.200
time and survival apre coup afterwards i don't know exactly how to translate always apre coup

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:39.920
and the question of drive is also patos formal and the question of gaze in the division between gaze

01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:50.000
and eye it is important in lack of phenomenology like on this question with meadow point three about

01:53:50.000 --> 01:54:03.040
the question of the opposition between gaze and eye and i think it is in this distinction that we

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:10.720
have the resistance to the image it's really central we were discussing together a few minutes ago
