WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
I'm Ed Nurse-Escion, director of the Helix Center.

00:03.400 --> 00:09.760
I want to welcome you all to these two days of roundtables focusing around the ideas of

00:09.760 --> 00:12.560
Abby Warburg.

00:12.560 --> 00:19.600
I would like to say primarily that I want to thank all of you who are here.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.040
I realize it's an early morning time.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.720
We are usually not here at this hour.

00:25.720 --> 00:31.720
I thank all the participants who come from various places in the world to be part of this

00:31.720 --> 00:33.960
meeting.

00:33.960 --> 00:39.120
From our side, I think Rob Penzer has done a tremendous amount of work to organize this

00:39.120 --> 00:48.200
and I'd like to thank him.

00:48.200 --> 00:54.320
And I would like also to thank Konstwakwie Bejie, who is here from London and who is director

00:54.320 --> 00:57.520
of the Abby Warburg Institute in London.

00:57.520 --> 01:02.840
The beautiful poster that you see out there and the brochure that you have here were all

01:02.840 --> 01:05.960
designed by him and sent to us from London.

01:05.960 --> 01:18.160
So I'd like to thank him.

01:18.160 --> 01:24.400
We are very honored today here to have the ambassador, Francois Bava from Switzerland

01:24.400 --> 01:28.080
and I'm going to ask him to say a couple of words.

01:28.080 --> 01:32.520
Yeah, Ed.

01:32.520 --> 01:40.280
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a pleasure for me to be here and to have Switzerland associated

01:40.280 --> 01:42.360
to your symposium.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.720
You may ask why Switzerland is associated?

01:45.720 --> 02:05.380
Well, you know the relationship between Warburg and Switzerland, K

02:05.380 --> 02:12.380
and is supported by another foundation called the Will's Dog Foundation which owns the Rolex

02:12.380 --> 02:13.960
Watch Company.

02:13.960 --> 02:21.160
So it's really rooted in Geneva and as an important, I would say, an important support.

02:21.160 --> 02:28.360
The mission of the Agalma Foundation is to explore the relationship between neuroscience,

02:28.360 --> 02:31.000
psychoanalysis and art.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
And the two persons in charge of the foundation are here today, Pierre Magistreti and Francois

02:38.000 --> 02:39.660
and Francois Auncereme.

02:39.660 --> 02:47.220
And the idea of this symposium, if I understand well, is born or was born from a conversation

02:47.220 --> 02:53.900
between Professor Galese from Parma, Pierre and Francois in a train between Geneva and

02:53.900 --> 03:00.620
Lausanne.

03:00.620 --> 03:10.100
So, they were talking about Warburg and about his concept of science without name which basically

03:10.100 --> 03:16.900
tries to bring together various disciplines and anthropology, history of art and biology.

03:16.900 --> 03:25.380
And the objective of the Agalma Foundation is also to build bridges between the sciences

03:25.380 --> 03:28.460
and art and humanities.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.660
So they said, that's interesting.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.460
Warburg as a resonance for us means something for us.

03:36.460 --> 03:42.460
So let's try to do something and then they spoke to the endocision and today we are here.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.020
So that's the link to Switzerland.

03:45.020 --> 03:49.900
I wish you a very successful conference and have a good day.

03:49.900 --> 03:50.900
Thank you.

03:50.900 --> 04:00.380
Hello, Professor Magistreti from the Agalma Foundation.

04:00.380 --> 04:06.740
A very brief introduction now.

04:06.740 --> 04:14.140
Actually Ambassador Barras, you can see how professional our ambassadors because he told

04:14.140 --> 04:17.220
everything I asked to tell.

04:17.220 --> 04:24.140
He really made his homework and said everything I wanted to say about the Agalma Foundation.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.900
So thank you, Francois, thank you Ambassador Barras.

04:27.900 --> 04:33.660
Anyway, as president of the Agalma Foundation, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you all

04:33.660 --> 04:34.660
here.

04:34.660 --> 04:41.100
It's true that we actually had the idea of this symposium, Victoria Francois and myself.

04:41.100 --> 04:48.260
And even after, I should say, there was some facilitating substances like wine.

04:48.260 --> 04:55.100
We actually had quite some wine and then suddenly we had this idea of organizing something here.

04:55.100 --> 05:02.020
And more seriously, again, as mentioned very clearly by Ambassador Barras, the Agalma Foundation

05:02.020 --> 05:17.260
as its mission to try to bridge neuro-science, psychoanalysis, culture and society.

05:17.260 --> 05:27.180
And in these days, I think, of super-specialization and where academic life has lost a little bit

05:27.180 --> 05:29.220
of its freedom, I think.

05:29.220 --> 05:34.180
I can say this after having been in academic life for 30 years.

05:34.180 --> 05:40.500
It's really very refreshing and very important that there are places like the Agalma Foundation

05:40.500 --> 05:47.780
and I think the Helix Foundation where there is a freedom of thinking, a freedom of making

05:47.780 --> 05:57.100
connection, thinking outside the box and trying to move fields forward, not necessarily in

05:57.100 --> 06:00.380
a very disciplinary way.

06:00.380 --> 06:03.540
And this is really the goal of the foundation.

06:03.540 --> 06:12.620
In terms of activities, the foundation organizes discussions, I should say, between a guest

06:12.620 --> 06:15.180
that Francois and I invite.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.940
And then we speak for about 45 minutes.

06:17.940 --> 06:25.500
I have to say we were very much influenced by what Ed launched many years ago with the

06:25.500 --> 06:33.020
Philocht etes foundation, again, very free discussion on not necessarily even on a specific

06:33.020 --> 06:41.060
topic, but just in our case, what we try to do is what we say an experiment with someone

06:41.060 --> 06:47.380
outside neuroscience and psychoanalysis and see how he or she, particularly from the case

06:47.380 --> 06:56.340
of the art and culture, how we can have some ideas emerge from this kind of strange mix

06:56.340 --> 07:01.900
between neuroscience, psychoanalysis and someone from the cultural world.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.700
And these discussions are filmed, again, very much inspired by what Ed has launched and then

07:06.700 --> 07:07.780
they are on YouTube.

07:07.780 --> 07:15.340
So if you go on the Agalma website, you can see we have now about, I think, over 20 of

07:15.340 --> 07:20.100
such discussions and you may find them interesting.

07:20.100 --> 07:24.220
Some of them are in English, I have to say most of them are in French, but then other

07:24.220 --> 07:30.140
activities of the foundations are to organize occasionally small workshops like this one.

07:30.140 --> 07:36.260
We just did one last week in Geneva for the 100th anniversary of the death of Férino de

07:36.260 --> 07:38.940
Socio, the linguistic from Geneva.

07:38.940 --> 07:44.820
It turns out just out of curiosity you may be interested that a member of the Agalma of

07:44.820 --> 07:51.060
the board of the Agalma Foundation is a Christian de Socio, a descendant of Férino de Socio,

07:51.060 --> 07:55.900
so that was even more appropriate for us to discuss this.

07:55.900 --> 08:02.060
And we had, again, a little bit in a smaller scale, but the same idea, neuroscientist,

08:02.060 --> 08:07.340
psychoanalysis, linguist, philosophers, I think quite productive and we will have actually

08:07.340 --> 08:11.260
a small publication come out of this workshop.

08:11.260 --> 08:20.020
And then we tried to sponsor certain research efforts which, for those of you who have tried

08:20.020 --> 08:28.780
to engage in experimental approaches, bringing together psychoanalysis and neuroscience, it's

08:28.780 --> 08:32.540
quite difficult without kind of denaturing both of them.

08:32.540 --> 08:37.300
So it's a really very difficult exercise, but we think it's a worthwhile exercise.

08:37.300 --> 08:42.260
So we have some fellows who work on this topic.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.860
Actually, we have with Christina Berrini, who is quite unique because she's a prominent

08:46.860 --> 08:50.980
neuroscientist and also a psychoanalyst here at NYU.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.660
And so we have a project with her and we have a couple of other projects at the Federal

08:54.660 --> 08:57.540
Institute of Technology where I work.

08:57.540 --> 09:03.940
So this is to give you the context and the interests of the Agalma Foundation and it

09:03.940 --> 09:08.940
looks like I've been looking at the program and I would like to thank Ed, of course, and

09:08.940 --> 09:15.020
all the people who contributed to organizing and bringing together the people.

09:15.020 --> 09:20.500
We have now an experiment that will go on in the style we like at the Agalma Foundation

09:20.500 --> 09:22.460
and I think also at the Helix Foundation.

09:22.460 --> 09:32.220
So thank you very much and I hope we have a very productive two days.

09:32.220 --> 09:35.180
Thank you Pierre.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.900
I didn't say anything about Helix.

09:36.900 --> 09:41.020
I assume everybody knows about Helix, but if you don't, I'd be happy to talk to you

09:41.020 --> 09:43.700
after the meeting.

09:43.700 --> 09:51.540
So what I'm going to do is introduce the participants in this round table in the briefest way possible

09:51.540 --> 10:00.020
and then we'll get going.

10:00.020 --> 10:08.820
I will start with Ludovica Loomer who is sitting there and she's a philosopher and a neurobiologist

10:08.820 --> 10:16.220
and has worked with Samir Zeki who is one of the founders, I guess, of the Neuroesthetics

10:16.220 --> 10:18.980
movement in London.

10:18.980 --> 10:27.660
Next to her is Vittorio Galese who is professor of physiology in the Department of Neuroscience

10:27.660 --> 10:34.260
of the University of Palma and well known for his discovery of the mirror neurons.

10:34.260 --> 10:42.060
Sitting there is Anjan Chatterjee who is a neurologist and member of the Center for Cognitive

10:42.060 --> 10:47.980
Neuroscience and the Center for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania

10:47.980 --> 10:52.180
and I believe he has a book coming out on neuroesthetics or it's already here.

10:52.180 --> 10:58.660
I don't know but it's certainly coming out this week.

10:58.660 --> 11:04.060
David Friedberg who has participated in a number of our round tables in the past is professor

11:04.060 --> 11:09.900
of Art History at the University of Columbia and director of the Italian Academy for Advanced

11:09.900 --> 11:13.220
Studies in America.

11:13.220 --> 11:21.020
And finally Andrea Pinotti teaches aesthetics at the University de l'estud de di Milano

11:21.020 --> 11:28.900
and is director of the program at the College International de Philosophy in Paris on the

11:28.900 --> 11:34.300
project Monumont, nonumont, correct?

11:34.300 --> 11:45.220
Okay, so we'll get going.

11:45.220 --> 11:52.100
To get this round table started I asked Vittorio to just say very, very brief words, a few

11:52.100 --> 11:59.180
words to get oriented on the subject and then everybody else would jump in.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.940
Thank you.

12:00.940 --> 12:02.420
Thank you Ed.

12:02.420 --> 12:11.060
It's a great pleasure to be here particularly because that dream that was conceived in Switzerland

12:11.060 --> 12:16.100
between Genève and Luzon is now real.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.940
I mean we are here.

12:18.940 --> 12:28.180
We will spend two days discussing this amazing figure of Abi Warburg.

12:28.180 --> 12:39.420
I think we begin to appreciate how innovative this approach was, perhaps particularly today.

12:39.420 --> 12:51.340
When we are experiencing a new form of dialogue between disciplines that the first site may

12:51.340 --> 12:59.020
look as remote as possible like the study of the brain, the study of art, of culture.

12:59.020 --> 13:09.780
When Vittorio embodies I think in a marvelous way this curiosity and this attempt to bridge

13:09.780 --> 13:20.340
different field of expertise particularly because cognitive neuroscience is very popular.

13:20.340 --> 13:26.340
Every day we read the big headlines in the newspaper, we discover what romantic love

13:26.340 --> 13:33.500
is all about, we discover a tiny little area where beauty sits and the like.

13:33.500 --> 13:44.980
This I would say, outrageously excessive form of reductionism needs to be tempered by an

13:44.980 --> 13:54.860
open dialogue with people that because of the background tend to look at the individual

13:54.860 --> 13:57.140
in a more holistic way.

13:57.140 --> 14:04.300
So we must bring back the brain to where it belongs to the body in the first place but

14:04.300 --> 14:13.620
this brain body complex it makes sense to study it to the extent that even if we move

14:13.620 --> 14:20.140
from a methodological reductionist approach so we are dealing with the nuts and bolts so

14:20.140 --> 14:27.780
to speak of what it means to be human the ultimate goal must be to go back to the holistic

14:27.780 --> 14:36.340
view of human nature and if we want to do that we cannot live out from our investigation,

14:36.340 --> 14:44.860
artistic expression, creativity and how this relates to something which is hidden in our

14:44.860 --> 14:46.220
psychology.

14:46.220 --> 14:55.380
So I think that the chicanelises, neuroscience, the humanities broadly speaking now finally

14:55.380 --> 15:05.140
are in a position to collaborate to this very exciting enterprise of shedding light on who

15:05.140 --> 15:15.280
we are exploiting also this new level of description that cognitive neuroscience and I think a

15:15.280 --> 15:23.380
prominent figure to bless so to speak this enterprise I couldn't imagine a better figure

15:23.380 --> 15:28.380
than Abhi Babu.

15:28.380 --> 15:36.040
So as I was thinking about today's meeting I thought I didn't think of myself as a neuro

15:36.040 --> 15:42.020
esthetician I think of myself as an art historian who makes use of tools that seem to me that

15:42.020 --> 15:49.740
will illuminate the objects of our studies and as many of you know I have long insisted

15:49.740 --> 15:55.380
on the importance of opening one's mind to science and not getting too anxious about

15:55.380 --> 16:00.460
the alleged reductivism of science but as I was thinking about today's symposium I realised

16:00.460 --> 16:07.860
that probably once one was a child and suddenly one is old and probably I may have been in

16:07.860 --> 16:13.660
this audience the first person to have gone to the Warburg Institute.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.940
So I wondered when I could just begin with a little background.

16:16.940 --> 16:22.820
So I arrived in Oxford to do my graduate work in art history at the end of 1969 and Francis

16:22.820 --> 16:29.900
Haskell who had just taken over from another great and extraordinary hermeneute and art

16:29.900 --> 16:36.700
historian Edgar Vinte who was a Warburgian of course was a high British positivist and

16:36.700 --> 16:41.860
he looked at me and he said you can't study here go to the Warburg Institute in London.

16:41.860 --> 16:47.220
So I went to the Warburg Institute so that was at the end of 1969 and as I was reflecting

16:47.220 --> 16:52.740
on the direction of Warburg in studies and the ways in which many of us here including

16:52.740 --> 16:56.800
myself and Vittorio have sort of seen the links between A.B.

16:56.800 --> 17:02.980
Varbog and neuroscience I realised that it wasn't always so because when I got to the

17:02.980 --> 17:09.180
Warburg Institute the emphasis was completely on both Michael Baxondall and Anne Sconbrick

17:09.180 --> 17:12.380
were completely on the Naheleb and Der Antica.

17:12.380 --> 17:17.180
Gombrick had done his own stuff on perception as we all know in art and delusion but the

17:17.180 --> 17:25.020
real Warburgian work at that time and throughout the 1970s and even into the 1980s was really

17:25.020 --> 17:29.260
about iconography and the Naheleb and Der Antica.

17:29.260 --> 17:35.380
So when I wrote the power of images sort of thinking about the other aspect of A.B.

17:35.380 --> 17:41.180
Varbog which has now come to the fore in other words this kind of psychological roots of

17:41.180 --> 17:47.460
human responses to images embodied above all in the whole notion of the pathos formula

17:47.460 --> 17:49.100
the patos formula.

17:49.100 --> 17:54.980
In other words those aspects of art which move us because of the collocation of emotion

17:54.980 --> 17:59.940
and movement in the body and its effects on the bodies of others which of course tied

17:59.940 --> 18:05.380
up eventually with the work of the Mira Neuron group in Parma.

18:05.380 --> 18:12.820
This was really a very late cumber on the Naheleb and of Varbog himself in London.

18:12.820 --> 18:19.020
No one would have thought that the cognitive neuroscience offered any access to the works

18:19.020 --> 18:20.020
of A.B.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.020
Varbog.

18:21.020 --> 18:24.300
So actually this is all a late development.

18:24.300 --> 18:29.860
And it was always there in Varbog the notion of the emotional consequences of moving drapery

18:29.860 --> 18:31.940
and dancing bodies and so on.

18:31.940 --> 18:36.100
But nobody until fairly recently, I mean we have lots of people here, Chris Wood has

18:36.100 --> 18:41.660
written eloquently about it, Chris Johnson also.

18:41.660 --> 18:50.100
But for a long time the original conception, the rarely original aspect of Warburg's contribution

18:50.100 --> 19:01.580
was relegated to this more positivist decoding of the great iconographies of the Renaissance.

19:01.580 --> 19:10.580
So now we have reclaimed what seems to be the most moving aspect as it were of A.B. Varbog

19:10.580 --> 19:14.940
and its finding its fruition in the kinds of work which we have seen done amongst the

19:14.940 --> 19:19.060
cognitive neuroscience and with the development of the neuroscience of emotion movement and

19:19.060 --> 19:20.060
so on.

19:20.060 --> 19:22.060
So I think we have a lot of people who are going to be able to move ahead in this direction.

19:22.060 --> 19:28.260
But I just thought that that historical background would be useful.

19:28.260 --> 19:33.460
Adding perhaps another issue to this question of the historical background more generally

19:33.460 --> 19:38.860
as regards German culture in the 19th century.

19:38.860 --> 19:47.740
Victoria, you told us about this figure, a special figure of Varbog as a possible bridge

19:47.740 --> 19:54.860
between natural sciences and humanities.

19:54.860 --> 20:01.660
We know that the German philosophical and epistemological discourse was responsible

20:01.660 --> 20:08.780
for the division, the terminus technique was between Geistes Wiesenshaften on one side

20:08.780 --> 20:13.660
and Mathur Wiesenshaften on the other side.

20:13.660 --> 20:24.540
For the rest it was not unfrequent that students and scholars training in one field took courses

20:24.540 --> 20:26.700
in the other.

20:26.700 --> 20:34.780
Varbog himself is an example, an emblematic example because he was trained as an art historian

20:34.780 --> 20:42.060
but in the 90s he went to Berlin to attend courses in medicine, at the Faculty of Medicine.

20:42.060 --> 20:50.020
There is studied neurology and you find in the fragments on the psychology of expression

20:50.020 --> 20:56.980
very interesting sketches and drawings on the structure of the nerves, on the problem

20:56.980 --> 21:08.300
of the reflex and there are drawings about the relationship between stimulus and response.

21:08.300 --> 21:16.660
And then he read neurologists like Evelle Herring and the very important lecture in 1870 on

21:16.660 --> 21:24.860
memory as organized matter and then among his sources there was Richard Zehmon, a zoologist

21:24.860 --> 21:33.580
and neurologist as well who gave him the terminus technique was Mime N. Graham.

21:33.580 --> 21:43.860
So he was really imbued with this literature and I think that just taking one of the most

21:43.860 --> 21:53.300
famous concepts in Varbog's discourse, Sophros Zune, the ancient Greek world that it translates

21:53.300 --> 21:55.300
with based on and height.

21:55.300 --> 22:07.100
I'm not sure what an English possible translation would be, caution, prudence, being wise, not

22:07.100 --> 22:09.100
being impulsive.

22:09.100 --> 22:16.540
There you find this idea of distance as interval, pose as crucial.

22:16.540 --> 22:21.140
It was not only a question of symbolic distance.

22:21.140 --> 22:27.900
The one that he discusses, for example, in the certain ritual lecture that modern technology

22:27.900 --> 22:37.700
destroys the distance that magic and art had instituted between man and world.

22:37.700 --> 22:45.460
It speaks also of distance in a neurological way, meaning the distance between the stimulus,

22:45.460 --> 22:56.500
the response and the human being has the creature that can procrastinate, that can introduce

22:56.500 --> 23:05.780
mediation, a postponement, a creature that is not obliged to immediately respond to the

23:05.780 --> 23:13.580
stimulus but that can respond and Zehmon was very important to him in this context in a

23:13.580 --> 23:17.300
procrastinated way, in a delayed way.

23:17.300 --> 23:28.620
Image plays in this frame, I think, a very fundamental role because image has a biological

23:28.620 --> 23:39.700
meaning in this biological utility in helping men in negotiating between stimulus and response,

23:39.700 --> 23:47.140
corresponding the response, even for centuries, even for thousands of years.

23:47.140 --> 23:54.700
And so this idea was thistchen round, bank round, the space in between, the space for

23:54.700 --> 24:01.980
thought, the space for memory and that's around, all terms that Warburg evokes as a

24:01.980 --> 24:05.740
constellation around the Sophros unit term.

24:05.740 --> 24:12.020
I think they can also be usefully investigated from a neurological perspective, rooted in

24:12.020 --> 24:16.860
those young years of studies in Berlin.

24:16.860 --> 24:30.020
I wonder if I could pose a question as I've been listening to this, that I'm still trying

24:30.020 --> 24:33.580
to get my head around.

24:33.580 --> 24:41.980
Which is on the one hand, there are cultural theories of which I am relatively ignorant

24:41.980 --> 24:51.380
of and on the other hand, there is psychoanalysis of which I am relatively ignorant and a sconst

24:51.380 --> 24:52.380
in between.

24:52.380 --> 24:59.620
Is that like a double negative?

24:59.620 --> 25:09.460
And then there's neuroscience of which I have some knowledge and in part, I'm trying to

25:09.460 --> 25:12.780
figure out what the relationships of these things are.

25:12.780 --> 25:19.460
And on the one hand, you can think of cultural theories as something that is an emergent

25:19.460 --> 25:25.060
property of a whole lot of things but can't be reduced to what one individual person or

25:25.060 --> 25:28.740
what one individual brain is doing.

25:28.740 --> 25:38.140
And at the other end, at least my medical school knowledge of psychoanalysis is a deep dive

25:38.140 --> 25:44.860
into the individual at the level of the content of what they're talking about, what they're

25:44.860 --> 25:50.500
thinking about, what they're dreaming about, what they associate, so on and so forth.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.900
But neuroscience in some way seems to be somewhere in between, at least the way it's typically

25:54.900 --> 26:02.500
practiced which is on the one hand, our methods are driven to try to generalize, it's the

26:02.500 --> 26:08.020
inherent nature of much of empirical research is you want to get generalizable principles

26:08.020 --> 26:13.860
but not typically so generalizable that they are applicable to cultural theories.

26:13.860 --> 26:20.220
And the very inherent nature of generalizing is that we typically tend to be less interested

26:20.220 --> 26:21.860
in the individual.

26:21.860 --> 26:27.980
The individual becomes one exemplar of a general principle that we're trying to derive.

26:27.980 --> 26:35.180
And psychoanalysis on the one hand seems to be, seems to drill down at the individual

26:35.180 --> 26:40.740
and the content of the experience of the individual that we typically try to do away with in most

26:40.740 --> 26:43.580
neuroscience studies.

26:43.580 --> 26:49.620
But our generalization doesn't generalize to the point of having at least in a transparent

26:49.620 --> 26:54.780
way making contact with cultural notions.

26:54.780 --> 27:01.940
And I'm just curious what people think about, are these tensions that are inherent in the

27:01.940 --> 27:08.340
disciplines or are these just historical tensions that have to be traversed and settings like

27:08.340 --> 27:10.780
this might help in that regard?

27:10.780 --> 27:20.700
It's my turn to answer.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.700
Thank you very much.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.500
It's a small issue.

27:25.500 --> 27:36.660
Actually, one of the things that was fascinating, the most about Warburg, is that he's expressing,

27:36.660 --> 27:41.540
I'm not sure for the first time in the history of thought because we can always go back to

27:41.540 --> 27:48.940
the Greeks for almost everything, but exactly the tension between subjective and objective

27:48.940 --> 27:53.780
individuality and socially.

27:53.780 --> 28:07.860
I think one of the most striking things that make us what we are, this tension of being

28:07.860 --> 28:17.260
a self, but this self is developed and we reach our concept of being who we are in the interaction

28:17.260 --> 28:18.260
with the others.

28:18.260 --> 28:23.300
So this tension is exactly what makes us what we are.

28:23.300 --> 28:31.740
But I think at the beginning of the century, the end of the 1800, beginning of 1900, there

28:31.740 --> 28:43.940
was this crack somehow that opened a discussion that we are still trying to solve today even

28:43.940 --> 28:42.800
with the songs of yesterday of Jesus'

28:42.800 --> 28:52.900
life, this mind-body matter over mind and mind over matter.

28:52.900 --> 29:05.540
And this crack opened up a sort of view came from which came out the destroying of all

29:05.540 --> 29:11.580
our stability and certainty about our conscious life, about space and time, about the possibility

29:11.580 --> 29:13.840
of measurement.

29:13.840 --> 29:18.020
And everything came out at the same time.

29:18.020 --> 29:25.160
And even Warburg was there at the same time and was striking with the notion of magical

29:25.160 --> 29:33.400
and real and art, science, religion, because we don't talk about it, but it's still there

29:33.400 --> 29:39.040
is the big part of our life anyway.

29:39.040 --> 29:49.440
We were there to try to find a solution about this gap to give some uncorch which was done

29:49.440 --> 29:53.480
because otherwise we would collapse into this crack.

29:53.480 --> 30:03.240
And opening this volcano of things, we had to find sort of solution, we had to find our

30:03.240 --> 30:07.840
way through to build a bridge.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.360
And I think Warburg was amazing in trying to do that.

30:11.360 --> 30:17.480
Probably was not a solid, probably I'm not an expert on, I write quite a lot about what

30:17.480 --> 30:22.760
he wrote, but I'm not an expert on him.

30:22.760 --> 30:30.280
But it was one of the first to try maybe unconsciously to find a bridge to a world like

30:30.280 --> 30:31.720
this gap.

30:31.720 --> 30:39.240
And this was, most of our life is an individual experience.

30:39.240 --> 30:43.960
We lived with deep-seatering culture and culture is a big part of what we are, but we live

30:43.960 --> 30:47.600
in our individual life and experiences.

30:47.600 --> 30:57.080
And so he describes the experiences, for example, in front of a war of art as the most private

30:57.080 --> 31:03.360
thing is that the impact is there, is talking to you and you have to give life to the image

31:03.360 --> 31:05.280
you have in front.

31:05.280 --> 31:12.040
But then you have to insert in the history, in the culture, there is no history of culture

31:12.040 --> 31:14.120
without the history of an idea.

31:14.120 --> 31:22.120
So to make sense of this individual experience, you have to insert it in the development of

31:22.120 --> 31:26.920
something broader which is more or less the history of.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.720
We cannot even say the Western thought because it was linked to everything and everywhere.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.760
It destroyed completely space and time.

31:34.760 --> 31:40.960
The symbol could travel and live without barriers in every time and every space.

31:40.960 --> 31:48.880
And this tension between the private experience of something and the objective is exactly

31:48.880 --> 31:56.880
what art is about and what art came about when there was this huge brain.

31:56.880 --> 32:03.600
In the postmodernism, art became an idea more than an image.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.600
Duchamp was the master of that.

32:06.600 --> 32:12.120
I was putting us in front of a urinal saying, now you have to perceive it as a piece of

32:12.120 --> 32:16.200
art and until you don't perceive it as a piece of art, this is not going to be art.

32:16.200 --> 32:22.480
So you have to make this become something which can travel in history.

32:22.480 --> 32:31.360
I don't know, it's funny what you said because it's something that I'm struggling with trying

32:31.360 --> 32:44.920
to make sense of it, this tension between the aesthetic private experience and the history.

32:44.920 --> 32:53.360
I think Anyan raised a very important point about the relevance and the specific status

32:53.360 --> 33:02.240
of cognitive neuroscience when addressing these specific topics that traditionally as Andrea

33:02.240 --> 33:12.800
was reminding us of, belong to these separate domains, Natur, Visinshaft and Geistus Visashaft.

33:12.800 --> 33:18.640
I think it's time to seriously question this distinction and division.

33:18.640 --> 33:26.000
However, we should also bear in mind that when we speak of cognitive neuroscience, we basically

33:26.000 --> 33:29.440
describe a methodological approach.

33:29.440 --> 33:36.960
So we all recognize ourself as cognitive neuroscientists to the extent that we all have a daily practice

33:36.960 --> 33:46.040
with this very expensive choice, we call it the Marai, Hidens-D-E-G, Pet and the like,

33:46.040 --> 33:53.760
but you can use employ these toys to ask completely different kinds of questions.

33:53.760 --> 34:05.160
And it's true that to lay the grounding, the foundational basis of an approach to human

34:05.160 --> 34:15.000
nature based on this specific methodological approach, it is unavoidable to start with

34:15.000 --> 34:26.040
an approach that so to speak, a privilege generalizing results where we take the average

34:26.040 --> 34:46.920
undergraduate most of the time white first world college student to be a sort of typical

34:46.920 --> 34:59.240
example of the human species, so to speak.

34:59.240 --> 35:05.640
Not only reductive, but heavily biased view of human nature.

35:05.640 --> 35:12.200
Indeed, in the field of the study of emotions, people, there is a growing number of people

35:12.200 --> 35:20.200
also of colleagues that begin to question the supposed universality of some of the findings

35:20.200 --> 35:28.600
upon which the empirical study of emotion was based starting from the second half of last

35:28.600 --> 35:30.000
century.

35:30.000 --> 35:42.040
And interestingly, more and more of our colleagues are exactly thinking about how to study these

35:42.040 --> 35:49.280
distinctive aspects of human nature, which is the individual quality of being a human

35:49.280 --> 35:50.360
being.

35:50.360 --> 36:02.760
And it is remarkable that as soon as you decide to leave behind this approach to the supposed

36:02.760 --> 36:12.120
generality of the finding, you are up to trying to dig more about the distinctive relationship

36:12.120 --> 36:18.880
between how your brain works and what your personal life history was, your attachment

36:18.880 --> 36:28.360
style, the early experiences you had with your parents, with other individuals, all of

36:28.360 --> 36:33.400
a sudden you realize that you spot incredible differences.

36:33.400 --> 36:41.800
I'm thinking about a study where people were required to watch videos portraying the facial

36:41.800 --> 36:45.080
expression of their partner in pain.

36:45.080 --> 36:52.080
And it turns out that according to your personality profile, different brain networks activate

36:52.080 --> 37:01.160
in spite of the exactly the same cognitive response when you are asked to evaluate the

37:01.160 --> 37:11.000
unpleasantness and the intensity of the pain that supposedly your partner is feeling by

37:11.000 --> 37:16.160
merely watching to this video showing the facial expression of your partner.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.400
This cognitive evaluation is the same in all participants.

37:20.400 --> 37:29.960
However, when you look at which part of their brain is active, you discover that people

37:29.960 --> 37:37.760
with a different affective style activate the standard called the circuit for the empathy

37:37.760 --> 37:42.920
for pain, the anterior part of the insular and the anterior cingulate cortex, while other

37:42.920 --> 37:46.480
individuals don't.

37:46.480 --> 37:53.160
They tend to activate more the visual part of the brain, the mesial aspect of the brain,

37:53.160 --> 37:59.880
part of what we call the default mode network, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

37:59.880 --> 38:07.440
So they most likely experience that particular image of their partner in pain in a completely

38:07.440 --> 38:17.360
different way, which can be partly also identified with our peculiar methodological reductionist

38:17.360 --> 38:18.760
approach.

38:18.760 --> 38:24.640
So I think there's a lot to do and this is why I think this time is really exciting

38:24.640 --> 38:32.480
for all of us because now that we learn how to use this machine, we are perfectly familiar

38:32.480 --> 38:38.440
with the instruction manuals, so to speak, we know what to expect from a technical point

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
of view.

38:39.440 --> 38:44.720
We know the limitation of the technique, but at the same time we should perhaps think

38:44.720 --> 38:52.320
a lot more and someone said a long time ago that science doesn't think.

38:52.320 --> 38:59.760
I think it's way too extreme view, but when reading some neuroscientific papers sometimes

38:59.760 --> 39:02.400
I think Heidegger was right.

39:02.400 --> 39:11.400
So there's a lot of room to improve the realistic value of this particular approach that I repeat

39:11.400 --> 39:19.840
offers you a further perspective on human nature, which will never be able to give the

39:19.840 --> 39:28.080
final answer to the question that keep us busy all the time, who we are.

39:28.080 --> 39:43.080
But I think it can bring in new data, new perspective that if interestingly discussed

39:43.080 --> 39:48.200
with the contribution of scholars from other disciplines can lead us to very interesting

39:48.200 --> 39:51.480
results, I think.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.480
So I'm rather optimistic.

39:53.480 --> 40:03.160
I just wanted to say although Victoria and I have known each other for a long time, work

40:03.160 --> 40:06.320
together, I noticed a slight backsliding here.

40:06.320 --> 40:12.240
And I'm not sure that he's making slightly unnecessary concessions, but never mind.

40:12.240 --> 40:16.640
I think the point is that, and I'll explain in a moment, I think Anyan's question is

40:16.640 --> 40:18.400
a really important one.

40:18.400 --> 40:24.560
It's one which the people in the humanities, whom I work with, mostly ask all the time.

40:24.560 --> 40:30.640
I mean, the question is how can the generalizing aspects of science be reconciled with the

40:30.640 --> 40:36.560
status of the individual, the effects of cultures and contexts?

40:36.560 --> 40:44.720
So whenever I hear this question, I always inclined to say it's not a view which is well

40:44.720 --> 40:49.160
received, but I'm inclined to say what's so difficult to understand about the situation?

40:49.160 --> 40:53.840
I'll tell you why I think this.

40:53.840 --> 41:00.640
What I think has happened now as the sciences have come closer to the humanities, it's offered

41:00.640 --> 41:02.840
us an extraordinary opportunity.

41:02.840 --> 41:07.840
And that is the best neuroscientists that we just heard are attentive to context.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.680
There's no question about that.

41:09.680 --> 41:16.040
But how do we arrive at the understanding of the individual with all this generalization

41:16.040 --> 41:17.040
around us?

41:17.040 --> 41:22.960
And this is what I'm trying to say is not so difficult to understand.

41:22.960 --> 41:30.640
In order to grasp the effects of individual contexts of past histories, both personal

41:30.640 --> 41:39.480
and historical, we still need to know what happens in the brain of all individuals, possibly

41:39.480 --> 41:41.000
even primates.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.600
But neuroscience also gives us the tools.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.880
This has been the great privilege for me.

41:45.880 --> 41:53.680
It also gives the one the tools to understand better what happens when the human brain is

41:53.680 --> 42:01.440
modulated by the effects of individual cognitive experiences, individual inputs, individual

42:01.440 --> 42:02.720
circumstances.

42:02.720 --> 42:08.720
There is no, in my view, no distinction really between the task of the neuroscientists in

42:08.720 --> 42:15.200
establishing basic structures in the brain and figuring out how individuality is constituted

42:15.200 --> 42:19.560
on the basis of those, you know, we all have an amygdala.

42:19.560 --> 42:24.080
If the amygdala is lesion, you just walk straight into the traffic across the way.

42:24.080 --> 42:27.520
A amygdala is activated when you have a fear response.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.880
Now, obviously, some of us know snakes better than others.

42:30.880 --> 42:35.920
You know, her pathologists are probably less likely to be afraid of seeing a cobra, or

42:35.920 --> 42:38.880
be seeing a, when I see a snake, I jump away.

42:38.880 --> 42:44.000
I don't make any distinctions, any taxonomic distinctions between those that are poisonous.

42:44.000 --> 42:49.400
But when you see, as Joe did as shown, when you see something that moves a bit like a snake,

42:49.400 --> 42:51.600
everyone is going to have a startled reaction.

42:51.600 --> 42:57.400
And thereupon succeed, I mean, you know, the great beauty of the neuroscientists now, it

42:57.400 --> 43:03.400
also gives us a sense of temporal operations and temporal distinctions within the brain.

43:03.400 --> 43:09.880
So I think the prospect here for understanding the individual is not curiously diminished

43:09.880 --> 43:14.960
by the kinds of techniques which we have available, but in fact enhanced.

43:14.960 --> 43:18.400
And that's why the backsliding, I just want to briefly, I don't think you need backslide

43:18.400 --> 43:19.400
away.

43:19.400 --> 43:24.000
So we need slide away too far from basic emotions and so on and so forth.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.960
To be more outspoken, I'm really annoyed.

43:26.960 --> 43:38.960
Keeping reading articles where it seems that people are even unaware of the absurdity of

43:38.960 --> 43:47.600
translating the personal level description at the level of typically amenable to our approach.

43:47.600 --> 43:54.480
So I'm not reducing the impact of neuroscience, actually the opposite.

43:54.480 --> 43:56.040
I mean, I'm a neuroscientist.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.040
That's my job.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.240
I mean, I'm not an art historian.

43:59.240 --> 44:09.080
I'm happy to spend time with people like you, but my approach is completely different.

44:09.080 --> 44:21.600
What I meant to say is that there is not enough, people are not enough aware that our approach

44:21.600 --> 44:29.720
could be a lot more fruitful if we would abandon this kind of neuro hubris leading us to establish

44:29.720 --> 44:38.360
a one-to-one map between the words we employ to describe our inner life, our emotion, our

44:38.360 --> 44:41.360
experiences and brain networks.

44:41.360 --> 44:46.920
Because such a one-to-one map between words and neurons probably doesn't exist.

44:46.920 --> 44:58.400
So the methodological reductionism that became available by the possibility of investigating

44:58.400 --> 45:09.320
human nature with the tools of cognitive neuroscience is an invaluable tool enabling us to deconstruct

45:09.320 --> 45:10.960
such words.

45:10.960 --> 45:19.200
And for example, showing that many people got it right when they were saying that vision

45:19.200 --> 45:25.600
in a way is a sort of haptic experience.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.200
I'm thinking about Merlot-Ponti, for example.

45:28.200 --> 45:35.680
Now with our expensive toys, we can show that Merlot-Ponti was right because indeed all

45:35.680 --> 45:40.640
of our perception in a way is a synesthetic.

45:40.640 --> 45:51.040
So it is really becoming hard to find parts of the brain that are unimodal.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.720
Even primary sensory areas, it has been shown.

45:54.720 --> 46:00.720
The visual cortex can be driven by auditory stimuli.

46:00.720 --> 46:06.040
Primary auditory cortex activity can be modulated by visual stimuli.

46:06.040 --> 46:15.160
We were the first to show that your somatosensors cortex is activated visually when you see

46:15.160 --> 46:20.280
the tactile experience on someone else's body and the like.

46:20.280 --> 46:30.760
So it is really our, our, our, our realistic value of this approach is greatly amplified

46:30.760 --> 46:38.240
is if before addressing this empirical question you have a broader picture of the cultural

46:38.240 --> 46:44.080
context and you discovered that many people were smarter than you are and gave serious

46:44.080 --> 46:47.640
thought to this issue and came up with very interesting solutions.

46:47.640 --> 46:53.280
So I'm not denying the realistic value of cognitive neuroscience, actually the opposite.

46:53.280 --> 47:00.640
What I would like to see it employed in a better way than it still is by many of our

47:00.640 --> 47:02.040
colleagues that don't.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.040
That's my point.

47:03.040 --> 47:08.400
Let me make a few comments from the psychoanalytic end of things.

47:08.400 --> 47:16.320
I was very struck about with what you said about Warburg's interest in the neuron and

47:16.320 --> 47:24.040
the transmission of the impulse because that's what Freud was interested also.

47:24.040 --> 47:30.200
And when he worked on the project for a scientific psychology, that's essentially what he was

47:30.200 --> 47:31.200
doing.

47:31.200 --> 47:37.680
And what he was trying to do was take his observations which came primarily from observing

47:37.680 --> 47:44.880
patients who at the time were diagnosed as hysterics and had all sorts of crazy symptoms

47:44.880 --> 47:51.600
and tried to see how he could explain those symptoms by understanding the function and

47:51.600 --> 47:58.440
the energies that moved within neurons via the axon and so on.

47:58.440 --> 48:04.280
And he also talked about, therefore, the blocking of the impulse which is eventually

48:04.280 --> 48:10.720
what led to the theory of repression which then became the central theory in psychoanalysis

48:10.720 --> 48:19.000
because repression is what then defined and led to the notion of a dynamic unconscious

48:19.000 --> 48:23.400
which is, as Freud himself, distinguished it from other unconscious.

48:23.400 --> 48:31.120
The dynamic unconscious is what then influenced you in life by running your life a certain

48:31.120 --> 48:33.920
way as opposed to the other way.

48:33.920 --> 48:43.040
He also, of course, did do a lot of generalizing and he at times generalized too much.

48:43.040 --> 48:51.000
And part of those generalizations were the, and I should also just say, I think, because

48:51.000 --> 48:59.880
it's not often recognized that three or four of Freud's major works took, occurred within

48:59.880 --> 49:04.720
a period of two and a half to three years.

49:04.720 --> 49:12.280
Neuropsychology of defense studies in hysteria, interpretation of dreams, and the project.

49:12.280 --> 49:17.520
Now he was using some cocaine at the time, but it's a tremendous amount of work that

49:17.520 --> 49:23.600
came out from one brain.

49:23.600 --> 49:29.040
But one of the things he did, and because of the time he was working on these and things

49:29.040 --> 49:34.680
were not as complex and complexity wasn't recognized the way it is today, is that he

49:34.680 --> 49:41.240
did create some simplifying formula so that you had psychosexual phases of development,

49:41.240 --> 49:47.840
you had things like edipal complex which then served to generalize so people had castration

49:47.840 --> 49:49.320
anxieties, people.

49:49.320 --> 49:55.760
So it wasn't just on the individual level, but was generalized and then applied to larger

49:55.760 --> 49:58.440
issues.

49:58.440 --> 50:05.520
Psychanalysis I think has increasingly, without saying so, moved away from that and it has

50:05.520 --> 50:18.720
become a lot more about the careful long-term intense investigation of how one person's

50:18.720 --> 50:22.360
brain mind worked.

50:22.360 --> 50:29.880
And in every possible detail that can be made available by the patient in the mental frame

50:29.880 --> 50:36.800
of investigating himself or herself on the couch four or five times a week, and that does

50:36.800 --> 50:42.840
give us significant amount of information and what it does give us also is what you were

50:42.840 --> 50:53.240
saying is that everybody smiles, everybody dances, everybody says they love, but it's

50:53.240 --> 50:56.400
tremendously different.

50:56.400 --> 51:00.960
And that investigation I think is very important.

51:00.960 --> 51:06.040
When neuroscience became so popular, I mean there wasn't even neuroscience when I was

51:06.040 --> 51:13.000
in medical school, we talked about neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroscience, but neuroscience

51:13.000 --> 51:18.440
suddenly took off, there was also an overt excitement from the psychoanalytic end and

51:18.440 --> 51:24.520
similar things that are being done in neuroscience, putting somebody in an ephemera and saying

51:24.520 --> 51:31.720
there is the point of love happened in psychoanalysis by saying this behavior is because of this

51:31.720 --> 51:33.680
part of the brain.

51:33.680 --> 51:36.320
It's inevitable, those kinds of things.

51:36.320 --> 51:42.680
But I had a very interesting experience yesterday, I was honored by Christina to be invited

51:42.680 --> 51:50.880
to her lab, and I went to her lab and one of the graduate students presented his research

51:50.880 --> 52:00.960
to my mind, I'm not a scientist, it was very carefully done and well presented about an

52:00.960 --> 52:07.760
idea which he thought also confirmed Freud's idea, namely what we take for granted that

52:07.760 --> 52:13.160
his childhood experiences influence you later in life.

52:13.160 --> 52:19.760
But he did that with rats and showed how the effect of an electric shock and then showed

52:19.760 --> 52:27.160
it that what periods it becomes, if you will, a memory that has an impact on future behavior

52:27.160 --> 52:30.040
and at which point it doesn't.

52:30.040 --> 52:34.760
But then I was thinking about this and looking from the point of view of psychoanalysis, I

52:34.760 --> 52:45.080
was asking myself when a baby has experiences, he doesn't or she doesn't just have one thing

52:45.080 --> 52:47.960
happen, like an electric shock.

52:47.960 --> 52:54.080
But has a number of things and that these things interact.

52:54.080 --> 53:00.680
So the electric shock in the baby, hypothetical electric shock, may have an influence on the

53:00.680 --> 53:07.120
way he's going to feel about the milk and the way he's going to feel about the milk

53:07.120 --> 53:08.880
is going to influence something else.

53:08.880 --> 53:18.720
So that very early on, and the graduate student showed this beautiful slide of synaptic and

53:18.720 --> 53:25.840
neuronal development between the ages of six months, two years and four years and it's

53:25.840 --> 53:27.800
incredible the change.

53:27.800 --> 53:34.520
It's like you have a handful of neurons and synapses and then you have like a jungle.

53:34.520 --> 53:40.880
And so in this process, a lot of things are happening but they are all interacting with

53:40.880 --> 53:42.600
each other.

53:42.600 --> 53:49.320
And so I think this is where the fields can come together because you can have, you can

53:49.320 --> 53:54.840
just do that study or you can begin to think of it in a different context, in a larger

53:54.840 --> 54:01.440
way and see and begin to study how those experiences affect each other and what the consequence

54:01.440 --> 54:07.680
of it is, which may then have a connection to how, and this is the subject of this round

54:07.680 --> 54:12.680
table, you do or do not react or appreciate art.

54:12.680 --> 54:17.840
And so since you wrote a paper on this just recently, maybe you should say a few words

54:17.840 --> 54:18.840
about.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.840
Yeah.

54:19.840 --> 54:29.920
We decided to start investigating a static experience, not just dealing with the notion

54:29.920 --> 54:38.240
that are so heavily culturally determined like the sense of beauty, for example, but

54:38.240 --> 54:49.000
we were interested in investigating to which extent when you behold some artwork, particularly

54:49.000 --> 54:56.520
we decided with David to start from the most difficult part of this enterprise, namely

54:56.520 --> 55:02.560
to see what's going on in the brain body system of a beholder when there's no body to resonate

55:02.560 --> 55:03.840
along with.

55:03.840 --> 55:10.400
So we decided to start, not with the figurative art, but with modern abstract art.

55:10.400 --> 55:16.840
And the first experiment was done on Luchofontana's cuts.

55:16.840 --> 55:23.560
And the second one just came out on the brushstrokes of Franz Klein.

55:23.560 --> 55:30.400
And although we employed two different approaches, we employed high density EG.

55:30.400 --> 55:36.240
And in the first study, we just were happy to measure the level of this synchronization

55:36.240 --> 55:38.960
of the motor system of the beholder.

55:38.960 --> 55:45.600
So they're watching a static image, a cut by Luchofontana, and a controlled stimulus

55:45.600 --> 55:52.440
where the cut is substituted by a black line with the same length and width of the cut.

55:52.440 --> 55:59.360
But what is missing is the dynamic aspect of this static image, namely the shade produced

55:59.360 --> 56:03.240
by the cut in the depth of the canvas.

56:03.240 --> 56:07.000
And we never mentioned the word art, beauty, aesthetic experience.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.320
We only said to our volunteers, you're going to see images on the computer screen, please

56:13.320 --> 56:20.080
watch them carefully and try not to move as much as you can, because even blinking can

56:20.080 --> 56:26.040
introduce artifacts when you record brain activity with this net on the head.

56:26.040 --> 56:31.560
And the results were quite interesting and were fully compatible with the hypothesis

56:31.560 --> 56:41.480
David and I put forward in 2007, namely that when you see an object, a visual object which

56:41.480 --> 56:51.560
is the consequence of someone's hand gesture, the brain of the beholder, so to speak, produces

56:51.560 --> 56:53.880
an embodied simulation of the gesture.

56:53.880 --> 57:02.160
And what you see is the reenactment of that gesture, which is purely simulated because

57:02.160 --> 57:09.960
we recorded also the muscle activity of beholders and their muscles were completely silent.

57:09.960 --> 57:16.720
But a part of their motor system was, so to speak, reenacting the gesture of a perform

57:16.720 --> 57:18.680
by Lucio Fontana.

57:18.680 --> 57:28.360
And of course, we decided to employ Lucio Fontana's artworks, probably a cut done by myself or

57:28.360 --> 57:34.680
by Alessandro Milzka, the main author of this paper, would have worked the same.

57:34.680 --> 57:42.120
Although I was talking with the curator of the Contemporary Art Museum in Prato, the

57:42.120 --> 57:47.680
Pecci Museum, and he was telling me, you can cut a canvas a thousand times, but you will

57:47.680 --> 57:54.480
never accomplish the end result, Lucio Fontana's taste.

57:54.480 --> 58:02.040
And probably he's right, but nevertheless, and the second study was on the brush strokes

58:02.040 --> 58:10.840
of Franz Klein, here we had a more sophisticated approach that enabled us also to locate the

58:10.840 --> 58:14.120
sources of the signal in the brain.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.120
And so we found three components.

58:16.120 --> 58:23.560
So our analysis became a little more sophisticated, and you David will be happy to hear this because

58:23.560 --> 58:28.680
you left behind the infooloon part of aesthetic experience.

58:28.680 --> 58:35.000
You want to know more about the relationship between the brain and the evaluative aspect

58:35.000 --> 58:36.840
of aesthetic judgment.

58:36.840 --> 58:43.040
So basically we found three networks, a sensorimotor network which most likely responsible

58:43.040 --> 58:52.120
of the enactment of the gesture employed by the artist, so dynamic, so charged with emotion.

58:52.120 --> 59:00.760
Then we found activation in the orbit of frontal cortex, which probably I'm very cautious

59:00.760 --> 59:10.640
to establish this relationship because otherwise I would be guilty of the same oversimplified

59:10.640 --> 59:13.440
vision of the brain I was blaming before.

59:13.440 --> 59:19.800
But nevertheless, there is some evidence that links the activation of this ventral part

59:19.800 --> 59:25.000
of the frontal cortex with rewards.

59:25.000 --> 59:34.760
So probably has to do with the joy or the positive feeling induced by the aesthetic

59:34.760 --> 59:35.960
experience.

59:35.960 --> 59:42.280
And then we had the third cluster of activation in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex, which

59:42.280 --> 59:52.240
most likely has something to do with the more detached and evaluative observation of the

59:52.240 --> 59:53.880
artwork.

59:53.880 --> 01:00:01.880
Then we recently also investigated this relationship between the gesture employed to produce a

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:07.760
static graphic sign and what's going on in the bottom system of the beholder.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:17.360
This time we employed handwritten Roman alphabet letters, Chinese ideograms, and scribbles.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.400
All three stimuli activate the motor system of the beholder, but they do it with a different

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.640
intensity and with a different temporal dynamic.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.920
It is as if, and I'm very cautious, this is an hypothesis that has to be verified, it

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:44.360
looks as if the motor system of the beholder were unconsciously capable of distinguished

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:52.480
symbolic graphic sign which lead to a stronger resonance from the scribbles, which have no

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.480
symbolic value.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:04.000
Which brings in a further question, is there any bio-mechanic, primitive shared by all

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.640
forms of symbolic written language?

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:15.160
This is an open question, no one so far addressed empirically, but these preliminary results

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:23.040
seem to raise this as a possibility that can be empirically investigated.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:32.400
So far we focused on this relationship, the immediate relationship between something which

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:39.440
is static, but at the same time is very intensively dynamic.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:47.640
And we believe that we discover one component that gives this dynamicity to something which

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.640
is static.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.640
There is a wonderful decunic at the moment, the blue one, I don't remember the title of

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.200
the painting.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:07.200
And every time I see it, I stand in front of it, I feel moved, not only metaphorically,

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.760
but physically.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:19.280
And I think we can describe this component of the static experience, we can explain why

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:27.000
we are so moved that something that is still but induces a lot of movement.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And this is a possible way.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000
It's a very good way to say that you didn't mention the world art, static to the students,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
or whatever the issue.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Yeah, when we were measuring their brain activity.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.600
So, and were they aware that these were worked?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.360
Well indeed, at the end of the experiment, we asked them a lot of questions.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:59.000
You can imagine, we asked them to rate the quantity of dynamicity, of movement, they

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.160
could spot in the static images.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.040
We asked them if they saw them before.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:10.760
We asked them if they considered either the original artworks or the control stimuli as

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.000
artwork.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And one of the most interesting results of this study is that the same effect could

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.400
be detected in all participants, no matter how acquainted they were.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.760
And so why can you speak about the static experience?

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:34.720
So how can you speak about the static experience if they are not aware that this is something

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.600
link, I mean how do you define aesthetics?

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:40.960
Well, because for them is something.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.320
Well, no, I don't ask him.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.320
I have a similar and related question.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:53.400
When you go in front of the ducomic, you say that I feel moved.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.120
So you are aware of something happening.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:08.760
In these experiments you did, were the activations similar, whether the person said at the end

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.360
they were moved, they were not?

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:20.360
There is all people rated as more moving the original artworks than the control stimuli

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:26.040
irrespective from their knowledge, those images to belong to art or not.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:35.480
So there is a tight relationship between the dynamicity of the image recognized by the

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:40.680
beholder and the degree of activation of their motor system.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:49.160
Then coming back to your question, of course there is nothing intrinsically aesthetic in

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:55.400
a sense in this experiment, although the easiest way to answer your question would be to go

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:59.960
back to the etymology of the world, the eye stasis.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:07.160
So to put it shortly, but I am happy to leave it to David.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:14.640
We never claim that aesthetic experience is the activation of the motor system of mirroring

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.600
mechanism period.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:25.080
What we said that our point is that aesthetic experience is a multi-layered enterprise and

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:35.440
one key dimension of aesthetic experience beside the socio-cultural context in which it occurs,

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.640
the framing effect, blah, blah, blah.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.680
One key ingredient is this embodied ingredient.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:49.880
And this embodied ingredient is present in our relationship with all kinds of images,

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:58.000
not necessarily because of their artistic status, which by the way is historically determined.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.280
I was reading a paper in the New York Times about the recent research showing that reading

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.560
novels leads you to a more empathic.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.360
And they were making a distinction between a highbrow literature and I don't know what

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360
they employed.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.840
Fifty shades of gray, this kind of, we call it, Santini.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.200
One of them was a bit more amazing.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.400
So and journalist was asking me, what do you make of this distinction?

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:37.320
I said, well, one should be very careful because Honore de Balzac, who is now revered as a

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:45.160
classic, was publishing some of his Commedio men in newspapers.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:53.280
So all of these notion judgments, evaluation are very much historically determined.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:58.520
Even the very same notion of Bursat is historically determined.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:06.360
That's why the tension between the objective way of looking at it and the subjective is

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.880
something which you cannot get rid.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:18.640
I mean, when you talk about art, you cannot avoid feeling this, this tension between art

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.080
is made by by the evolution of culture.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.560
Art is, art is not only subjective thing.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:32.840
If you are a subject to be in front of something and you do not recognize it as art, probably

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.840
is not art.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840
I mean, it has to make sense.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:45.480
Yeah, but what we now call art, for example, think about people putting their hands in

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.720
cover with pigments on caves.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.560
We call that art.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.680
Now, for them, probably had a completely different meaning.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.120
It was religion.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.720
It was the possibility to get into a different dimension.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.920
Nobody really knows what was the meaning of this practice.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:17.120
But still, I mean, even if you bracket this social, cultural, historical aspect that change

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:25.320
a long time, there is something, I think, intimately related to our own human nature,

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:32.280
which is a notion that for many decades was considered politically incorrect.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:39.280
Okay, the human being is a construction, like Foucault put it, but this construction is

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:41.680
made of bricks that are always the same.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.680
That's the point.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.880
And cognitive neuroscience can reveal the nature of those.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880
And that's been widely included.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:56.440
Yes, I think that a word evoked by Ed should be introduced in this conservation that is

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.920
inhibition.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.160
I think that also David is working on this notion.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:10.240
Because when Victoria says that our response to images is a sort of motion and emotion

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:17.880
response, so there is this idea of a motor reaction, the question is in the aesthetic

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:30.400
attitude, where is the threshold between emotion that remains at a possible virtual or quasi-virtual

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.680
response, reenactment, virtual embodied simulation?

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:44.040
And when, for example, in front of some images, very often religious images, we are elicited

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.440
to a real response.

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:55.720
In Van der Lee's, for example, or in iconoclasm, David here is a specialist of these reactions.

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:03.800
There you have violent responses, and there the motor system responds to images in a very

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.600
effective way.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:15.440
Somehow, upholding the idea that the image, as I evoked in my first intervention, is a

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.400
mediation between the stimulus and the response there in vandalism and iconoclasm.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:29.680
Image seems rather to be a sort of bomb eliciting a very violent reaction.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:37.000
I think that this is important also because I have started a work research comparing some

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:54.100
images in which V

01:10:54.100 --> 01:11:02.440
Rosa and she is deciding to kill her kids, but she has not already killed them.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:08.920
She is there in the shadow, thinking of the strategy of the decision, but she hasn't

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.880
taken the decision definitely yet.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:19.520
Or again, Rembrandt, the cloud use chivalis, a painting, Barbara was very fond of.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:26.400
They had a copy made for the institute and the copy is still hanging there today.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:34.960
The cloud use chivalis is there with the batavians gathered around the sacred table.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:42.080
They are deciding to go against the Romans, the invaders, but they haven't decided it

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.160
yet.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:54.960
So what they will do, Freud Moses, in that essay Freud collects opinions from the Kuswissenschaft,

01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:09.880
from Borkert, from Verflin, and they all stress the fact that Moses is represented by Michelangelo

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.880
in the very moment preceding the action.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:19.240
Freud describes, and of course he is very interested in the foot and the position of

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.600
the angle of the foot of the statue.

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:27.360
And we know that Barbara was obsessed with feet, the lymphose feet.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:33.880
And if you compare the gradiva foot, you find that this gradiva foot is very similar

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.840
to the Moses one, almost 90 degrees.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:49.760
So this is Lesting's Lao-Kon, this is the pregnant moment before the decision.

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:56.440
And this elicits, I think, a very interesting kind of empathy in the beholder that I would

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:04.440
call the egetic, core narrative empathy, because your imagination starts working there.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:11.440
And you start asking yourself, what is it going to do?

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:17.400
Is it going to slash his brother and all the rave party around the golden calf, or deciding

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.400
something else?

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:26.880
We know the story, of course, from the early text, but we can also imagine possible different

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.360
options.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:33.800
And this is a saturation of narrative into a single image.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:42.440
It is an image of inhibition, it is an image of self-control, it is an image of the sofros

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:49.480
uni again, of Bezon and Knight, of caution, of pre-decision, which is, I think, could

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:57.960
be quite interesting to investigate even in the perspective of visual and motor systems.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:07.360
I'm hesitant to talk because it is not in direct response to what you said, but I do

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:11.160
want to pick up some of the themes that have come up.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.600
One of this idea, as you said, very early influences.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:18.360
Well, the influences actually go quite early.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:24.560
There is evidence, for example, that what a mother ingests and that their trimester has

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.600
an influence on the taste that the child would later have.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:32.920
And taste is an evaluative judgment, it is a preference.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:41.320
So these influences go very early, even before people are born.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.000
The question of this relationship between the individual experience and what can be generalized

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.440
or how do we deal with that?

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:55.920
There have been two strategies in cognitive neuroscience.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:02.040
And one, I think, in part, you alluded to, which was Freud's Roots, which came out of

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:09.960
Charco's clinic, and that there is a long history of careful observations of individual

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:16.840
patients and trying to make inferences of how systems work on the basis of the systematic

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.320
way in which brain damage produces consequences.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:25.720
And I would take one minor exception to what Vittorio said, which is, I do not think cognitive

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.760
neuroscience is a method.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:35.240
I think imaging has largely overwhelmed the public imagination of cognitive neuroscience,

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:43.040
but it is fundamentally asking questions about what the brain basis for behavior is.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:49.840
And this goes back to the same intellectual climate that Freud was working on, that Warburg

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.440
stepped into.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.360
You can take it back to Broca, Vernicki, Licktime, Lissar, Leepmann.

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:02.200
These are the people that set out the agenda and the framework that we're still dealing

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.280
with.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:10.360
And so part of what got me interested in neurosthetics was from the observation that when patients

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.040
have brain damage, some patients that are artists, that they continue to produce art,

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.720
and their art is actually, this is the exception, not the rule, but their art is actually better

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.200
or received as better than what it was before.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:31.040
This is the only major cognitive system where that observation has been made.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.640
There are sensory phenomenon in which that observation has been made, but if you talk

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:42.960
about language, if you talk about any complex phenomenon, this kind of paradoxical facilitation

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:47.680
in the setting of brain damage is something that has only really been reported in art.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.480
And that's telling us something important.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:58.760
It's telling us something important about the biologic infrastructure that is in the context

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.040
of producing art is sufficiently flexible.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:08.720
And one thing that these sort of detailed examinations of single cases I think can really be illuminating

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.880
in a way that you, as you were suggesting, that Freud did you take individual patients

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.320
and then you try to generalize from that in a way that analysis can only be done on individuals

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:24.200
because as soon as you take a group, you're washing away what is most interesting about

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.360
that behavior.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.080
The second strategy that I think Vittoria alluded to, which is that in cognitive neuroscience,

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.080
there has been an interest in individual differences.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:40.160
And I'll give you an example of art study we did which has been presented in abstract

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:46.360
form but not written up, which is there's a fundamental question of if you say, do you

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:53.280
like a Rothko painting or do you like Hopper that there is nothing inherently correct about

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.080
which answer you give, right?

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.760
This is an individual difference thing.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.720
Some people like abstract art, some people like representational art, some people like

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.640
historic art, some people like contemporary art, so on and so forth.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.280
So when you're dealing with that kind of massive variability, how do you approach this as a

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.440
scientist?

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:19.080
And what we did was, and this was with a group of schizophrenics and people with schizophrenia

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:26.040
as well as people with the normal controls, and basically did the kind of experiment where

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:31.000
people are shown pairs of paintings and they say which is better, which you like more,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000
right?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And you go through a whole series of these, and we also had these rather than evaluative

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.440
components, descriptive components where you say which painting is, has warmer hues versus

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.600
cooler hues and things like that.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:54.040
So the trick here is that the assumption is that if you're looking at preference, which

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.000
is variable, it's still showing that you're looking at the difference.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.160
So this should be the case that if someone prefers A over B and B over C, they should

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.200
prefer A over C, right?

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.960
Whatever your intro metric is, which may be different, it needs to be consistent.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:13.040
And so the question for us was then, using people's individual differences allows us

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.400
to give an access of what people's consistency are, so then the question becomes consistency.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.200
And what we are able to show is that in this group of schizophrenic individuals that as

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:32.640
a group to things, they're less consistent than people without schizophrenia.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:37.440
They are less consistent in the evaluative judgment, which is this preference as compared

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.960
to the descriptive judgment.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.440
So it's not that they're just inconsistent, they'll say whatever they want, it's specifically

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.480
about their preference.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:50.160
And then the other interesting thing is if you look across the people with schizophrenia,

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.840
of course it's not that they're all bad, that there's some variability, and then you

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.440
leverage that variability.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:07.160
And what we find is that the greater the variability in people's preferences judgment correlates

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.000
with how they also describe their hedonic experiences.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.480
So you give them other kinds of questionnaires, and so it turns out that people who have a

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:21.960
kind of what has been referred in the literature as anticipatory pleasure, the pleasure of

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:28.800
anticipating what might happen, that people who had decreased anticipatory pleasure were

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.560
also the ones that were the most variable.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:38.920
So now you take that back to the biology, it turns out that models of anticipatory pleasure

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.400
seem to really rely on dopamine.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.360
Dopamine is at least an important system that seems to be abnormal in people with schizophrenia.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.800
And what we don't know from this is whether this has to do with the medications they're

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.440
on or something inherent about the biology of their disease.

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.320
So that remains unknown.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.480
But I offer this as a suggestion how you can use, you can actually leverage the variability

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:10.080
of the individual responses to honor the individual response and at the same time try to get a

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.520
generalizing principle out of it.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:20.840
Yeah, I think most of us would probably agree that dopamine plays a role in aesthetic pleasure.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.800
But I want to go back, I mean these are really interesting historians, I want to go back to

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:34.240
the discussion we were having earlier, partly raised by Victoria and then affirmed by Andrea.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.560
And this is a discussion which brings together Freudian views of inhibition, Freudian views

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:45.080
of culture, the work of the neurosciences, but it's all a meeting I think in all our

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:50.760
discussions we are meeting one very significant issue which I'm going to come to in a moment.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:58.400
I think the issue is slightly vitiated by these statements, slightly apodictic statements

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.000
that people make, you made it, there's quite a lot, art is.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.080
I think we should probably just relinquish any kind of declaration about what art is.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.240
Because we kind of know now that we don't know what art is.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:17.080
I mean you go to any art gallery and you, art may just be what people pay the most money

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.640
for, we don't know.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.920
So this whole issue was brought home to me with some force, I remember Chris Wood said

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:31.440
he may have been drinking a bit much that evening, but he said exasperatedly to me after I gave

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.480
a lecture about the sort of motor dimension of aesthetic response which Victoria described

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.880
very accurately, he said oh, why don't you realize that all art is irony?

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:46.800
I mean he was being kind of epigromatic that evening and I was very exasperated by this,

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:52.160
but he raised a very important issue which is I don't think all art is irony, but consistently

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:56.200
with this view that I don't think we should say what art is or not.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:01.880
But you know we talk about aesthetic appreciation, aesthetic evaluation, aesthetic enjoyment,

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:12.240
I just did that, but what really lies at the bottom of all of this, as Kant wrote, is aesthetic

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.720
judgement.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:17.320
I mean we can talk a bit about aesthetic pleasure and aesthetic, you know how our feelings are

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:24.520
affected, but what is moot is not what art is, but what is that moment in which, you

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.160
know what happens at that moment when we make an aesthetic judgement.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:37.240
And that moment must surely be a moment of a certain kind of removal, of reclaiming of

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:42.040
the self against involvement with the work of art.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.400
And this seems to me our sense of absorption in the work of art to use, you know here's

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.400
Michael Friedkaring on for years about absorption's role in our aesthetic responses.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.920
What really we need now to do, and I think, I'm trying to convince Victoria to do an experiment

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:07.400
with me on precisely what removes the self from its empathetic engagement with the work.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:14.360
What happens then as it were, you know what exactly do we mean when we talk about inhibition,

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:18.520
what's happening in the brain, you know there are various candidates for the inhibitory

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.520
factor.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:25.040
And I somehow think it's somewhat down in Basil Ganglia, he says no it's much forward

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.680
in prefrontal cortex.

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:34.120
So here is a real issue which can be discussed which will get us back to what seems to me,

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:40.480
you know at least a clear framing of the question, which is the framing in terms of the moment

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:47.640
in which we realize we are not in the object, but we are sufficiently detached to make a

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.640
judgement.

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:56.320
And this is Andrea and Varburg's notion of Dankham in which you have the space for contemplation

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:03.600
and you have a sense of the realization of who you are as a judging self.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.440
So that's a project that you know we've got to get on with as it were.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:08.440
Yeah.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440
I can comment on that.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.920
So again going back to individual classes and this notion of inhibition of movements

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.040
in a way that might seem agentic.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:25.680
So there's a classic relatively rare but classic neurologic syndrome called the Alien Hand

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.920
Syndrome.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:35.880
And this is one in which we've done one of the few experimental studies of such a patient.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:40.080
So let me just describe it for people who are not aware of this.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.880
This is a situation where someone's hand, it's typically on one side, seems to be

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:53.640
to perform behaviors that seem complex but over which they have no control.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:59.720
And so the particular man that we studied about seven or eight years ago, I mean he would

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:03.360
come in and he'd sit down and he'd sit down on his hand because he didn't want his hand

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.040
doing things that he had no control over.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.960
These kinds of, or he'd grab a magazine or a cup and hold this because as long as his

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.360
hand was occupied it wouldn't do things.

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:20.760
But what are the kinds of things it does is that it will, he'll walk by a light switch

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.560
and his hand will reach up and start doing this turning on and off on and off on and

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.080
off the lights.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:32.680
And there are a variety of these kinds of behaviors and what we, and his lesion, just

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:38.200
so you know the part of his brain that was damaged is the medial part of the frontal

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200
lobe, right?

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.880
The classic location for this kind of phenomenon.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:51.400
What we were able to show is the conditions in which this happens are two.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:27:01.680
One is that the control over affordances that most of us normally have, he didn't have.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:02.840
And what do I mean by that?

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:11.520
Which is if you see a cup with a handle there is a kind of affordance that makes you want

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:12.880
to grasp it, right?

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:18.920
And it's likely that the mirror neuron system is in fact involved in that kind of experience.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.080
Most of us can choose to do this or not.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:27.320
And it should be clear that most of us, our motor systems operate below consciousness most

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.480
of the time, right?

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.160
Where usually you think about every time you drive to work or you walk to work you are

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.080
not really aware of all the little decisions you're making.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.720
We largely respond to things in the environment with our motor systems and that's what this

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:47.760
person was doing but unlike the rest of us is not able to control it.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.480
The second piece of this is he was exquisitely aware of this.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:55.320
So if you have damage bilaterally you get something called utilization behavior where

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.840
people do this but they're completely apathetic about it.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.520
So he had this monitoring system over his own motor behavior.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:09.800
At the same time he didn't have control over one side and then this creates this sense

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.880
that this limb is doing something of which he has no control over, right?

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.040
It's completely responsive to the environment.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.920
And so it's a kind of a problem within ambition.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.040
At the same time there's awareness you have to have both of those things simultaneously

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.200
to have this kind of phenomenon.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:36.520
I think even though I know we can talk a lot more about this it's time to go for question

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.840
and answers.

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:44.440
So anybody who has a question has to walk up to the microphone there and ask questions.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:47.640
Peter, there are two papers.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.640
Siri you want to ask?

01:28:50.640 --> 01:29:06.600
Most of the discussion this morning has been on the tension between generalization and

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:14.600
you begin with that and the particular case and your characterization of psychoanalysis.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.920
It's a single case and what do you have?

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.160
So I'd like to say.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:29.000
I practice analysis in Los Angeles and I've analyzed Chinese and Japanese and Latino,

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:38.920
I have a Latino, young lady, Iranians and so on and you get a picture of the culture.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:47.640
And with that I want to say with Abi Barbour today when we're getting to a man embedded

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:55.280
in the German-Jewish elite of Hamburg, major banking firm that you all know branches in

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.440
New York and so on.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:06.320
And he suffered and consciously from anti-Semitism.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:16.880
He was a soldier in the German army prior to World War I and was unable to get promoted

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.080
to reserve office here.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.360
He was a very symbolic, full of prestige.

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.760
Much's labor wrote a brilliant critical piece on the position of the German reserve

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:38.080
office here and he writes to his mother also as he's a student in Strasbourg.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:49.000
How he hears other students and people in pubs issuing anti-Semitic remarks.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.720
And he's very aware he's unhappy about it.

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:59.280
He calls it motion, which is an imitation of Yiddish.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:08.360
Now, that's not all.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:17.280
There is a huge, very significant Cartai, it's Cartai 61 in the archive, the Barbour

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:25.000
archive, and it is his collection, his method of working was to collect clippings from the

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:32.000
days newspapers of things that interested him and there are large collection of clippings

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:42.000
about the ritual murder myth in Eastern Europe, in Kiev, the Bayless case, in Konev, in East

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Prussia.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.920
You know, he collected these and this was the raw, savage underside of European culture

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.280
they was very aware of.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:32:01.440
And it's significant that the breakdown, the psychotic breakdown came in November 1918.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.840
Now that's not a random date.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:07.320
That's the date of the collapse of the Wilhelmian Empire.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:13.840
And it's a date where his peer and friend Albert Balene, whose name you might know,

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:20.800
the Hamburg America line, the Hamburg-Ost-Africa line, the Hamburg-Ost-Oggian line, these were

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:28.440
all creatures of, he was the CEO of this Empire of sea power in Germany.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.280
He suicided in November 1918.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:37.960
And that's where he had his psychic collapse.

01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:43.520
And we look for, in psychoanalysis, the specificity.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.760
Why on that date?

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.360
And what's the specificity of the delusions?

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.640
And the delusions were murder and blood poisoning.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.400
He tells Benzwanger, you're feeding me human blood.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:03.400
I'm not going to eat this meal.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:11.920
I suggest to you that what you really want to know out of psychoanalysis is the culture

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.120
that he comes from.

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:20.240
And he and his brother, there was an event in the middle of World War I in 1916.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:27.480
It's called the Yudin Seilung, where the Prussian general staff ordered a census of all the Jews

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.680
in the German military.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:37.240
Now nothing like that took place on the Italian army, the French army, British army.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:45.520
But they were with a purpose of derogating and deprecating the Jews, trying to show they

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.160
weren't doing their part.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:52.640
And fact is that after this census, the results were suppressed.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:59.520
They were never published until Franz Josef Strauss in the Boletus Republique was the

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:05.480
foreign strike, that defense minister, and he published the results because the contribution

01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:08.720
of Jews had been magnificent to World War I.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:12.560
So this is the world he comes from.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:21.480
And when he sees murders and so on, he saw them and he collected data on them, extensive

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:30.520
data on German anti-Semitism, on European primitive hatred of the Jews.

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:33.720
And I suggest it comes back in the psychosis.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:43.080
That's an intro to your panel tomorrow I think.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:48.040
This is quicker and it's about lesions and it relates to something David said and to

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:53.040
what you said, which is individual differences and lesions.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.120
So even in alien hand syndrome, you can get someone unbuttoning a shirt.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:04.600
But also the famous case that I've forgotten the neurologist name of the self-strangling.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:10.360
And also amygdala lesions do not produce identical results by the way.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.480
They're a huge variation.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:16.440
So I wanted to just pick that up about individual differences.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:23.960
Is there a question of content, individual psychic content in something like say self-strangling

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.760
in alien hand syndrome?

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.920
Maybe two comments about that.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.920
And thanks for the question.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:36.440
So one thing it turns out that an alien hand syndrome is that the repertoire of behaviors

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.280
are fairly restricted.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:42.320
There are certain grasping behaviors, there are repetitive behaviors.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:49.400
They're actually the kinds of things not unlike what you see when people have motor seizures

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:56.280
and what healing Jackson talked about as this sort of grammar of movements where you have

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.560
these elements that are built on.

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:06.760
What we argued in this paper is that what you see in alien hand syndrome are concatenations

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:13.000
of these motor primitives and that you would never ever have the situation where someone's

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.640
alien hand would, for example, write a poem.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.840
That could never happen on this model.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.920
Whereas if you really think of this as there's an alien being on the divided self, that the

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:30.200
divided self would actually perform some intentional goal directed behavior, it turns out that

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.600
that's probably not the case.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.000
The individual differences in terms of the consequences of brain damage is extraordinarily

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.440
interesting and the biology of that we don't really know very much.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:49.960
So it is the case that often what you will read in the literature are these sentinel cases.

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:53.960
But if you see a lot of the patients, what you are struck by is that the same kind of

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:59.800
damage that produces vernicus ephasia that was so instrumental and important in thinking

01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.160
of how language is organized in the brain is not what happens in everybody.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.560
And not only that, what happens six months down the road is highly variable in terms

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.320
of how people recover.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.600
Now what's the biology of that?

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.840
Why is it that some people do better initially?

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.320
Why is it that some people do better down the road?

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.120
There are some ideas around it.

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:24.560
There are certain genetic predispositions.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.400
For example, people better homozygous for apo-e-elleals that is a predisposing factor

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:33.920
for Alzheimer's disease.

01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:41.120
It looks like that might have been more generalizable to how the brain responds to injury.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:48.480
But what the mechanisms around that are not known, it may be a wiring issue, which is

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:55.720
where if we took everybody in this room that is over the age of 50 and got high resolution

01:37:55.720 --> 01:38:00.880
MRI scans, the amount of white matter abnormalities, assuming everybody in here is normal, is

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.040
going to be highly variable.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:12.440
And so the consequences of that, of this kind of subclinical low level, and I hesitate to

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:16.680
use the word damage because it's not expressed in any way, it might have consequences for

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:17.680
recovery.

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:24.320
And the individual differences in organization at that level, which is increases as you get

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320
older.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:30.840
So as Vittoria said, if you're doing 20-year-old college students, you've already filtered

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.400
this to a very narrow segment, right?

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:39.640
But I think those are exactly the kinds of questions a biologist needs to ask and try

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.640
to address.

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:47.640
Just walk through the microphone.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:50.640
Okay, sure.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:39:04.000
Professor Galese's correlation of the motor system and Lucio Fontana and Franz Klein,

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.840
I'm an art historian and a psychoanalyst and I've worked with a lot of artists.

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:16.560
I've thought a lot about Ernst-Chris's image magic, the idea that an artist is trying

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:20.000
to create life in the work.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.600
And I worked on Giacometti and Louise Nevelson and both of them, and I think many other artists

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.280
and many of the artists I've worked with, are aiming in some way, consciously or preconsciously,

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.840
to create a sense of life.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.720
And that is the dynamic quality.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:45.400
Looking at artwork that succeeds in doing that, even if it's the pregnant moment before

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:51.920
the action, there is a sense for an artist who is aiming to make that work that he or

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:57.640
she is trying to do something with what Louise Nevelson called livingness.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.120
I think artists have different ways of describing it, but it seems very related to the correlations

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.120
that you are finding in the work that you're doing.

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.120
Thank you.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:09.120
Pierre.

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:18.600
So I would like to make a comment on what Bitoro said and I fully agree with you with

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:27.080
the current trend of cognitive neuroscience and the reductionistic, let's call it, you

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:42.240
know, consequences of being subject to considerable pressure by journals to come up with papers

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:49.320
that have a large N, a number of subjects that you can make statistics on.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:51.560
And you know, I'm an experimental neurobiologist.

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:55.680
I also like you try to publish in the good journals and we all play that game.

01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:04.240
But the issue is that it looks like we may need and just, you know, comes out of this

01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:13.640
discussion and thinking, you know, a forum where this vicious cycle in a way which, you

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:23.480
know, you are forced in a way to have a large and erased individual differences or try to

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:32.400
focus on the data that show more consistency across individuals to be able to publish in

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.240
the best journals.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:37.720
And okay, you probably provide useful information.

01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.360
I don't say that this is not useful.

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:40.360
So I fully agree with you.

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.400
We are part of the game and we'll do it.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.480
But on the other hand, it's very impoverishing.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.800
We lose a lot of information like this.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:42:01.920
And so I think, you know, let's think about how to push this, the value of individual observations

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:08.360
and provide a forum for this in a way that is, of course, scientifically sound.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:12.600
It's not just to, you know, decrease the quality of the studies.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.600
Quite the contrary.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:20.840
But the tools, the expensive toys that you're talking about can be used much with a much

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:30.680
more incisiveness if we were able to provide the right framework for an rigor for studies

01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.120
of individuality.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.400
I think it's an excellent idea.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:41.360
And if I know you enough, it will.

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.920
We should expect some development.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:43.920
Yeah, let's think about it.

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.280
I think you're definitely right.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:54.560
And I'm very sympathetic with the onion because I think we share a strong background in clinical

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:56.200
neuropsychology.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.560
Because when people nowadays think about cognitive neuroscience, I'm speaking specifically of

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.160
cognitive neuroscience.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:13.640
Most people think about the defensive toys we were discussing before, neglecting the

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:18.440
fact that one of the most historically speaking, but also nowadays, although it's getting more

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:24.280
and more difficult to publish single cases, almost impossible.

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:30.360
We learned a lot about the relationship between brain behavior and cognition by studying single

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.240
patients.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:43.760
And I think it's really a sad thing that the enormous pressure we all receive, in a sense,

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.920
living in Italy is a privilege.

01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.920
You can take a lot more risk because nobody cares what you do.

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.680
It's interesting.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:56.800
I'm trying how to see the positive aspect of that.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.880
But in other countries where there's a lot of attention about what you produce, so the

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:10.440
emphasis is more and more on quantity, sometimes at the expense of, I mean, I'm not disputing

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:16.720
that all of these people have enormous technical quality.

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:19.960
What gets lost is why are we doing this?

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960
Why are we publishing?

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:24.120
No, that's why they want to make the brain.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:30.840
But I think cognitive neuroscience and all that, what has been published in those circles

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.640
and with that kind of philosophy, I think it's very useful and brought a lot of knowledge

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:39.640
to how brain works.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.040
I think we understand it's a major progress, so I'm not disputing this.

01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.840
But I think we are losing a lot of information.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.080
And that's a pity.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.320
Well, it's interesting because we had Professor Andrea Califano here.

01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.480
And he's at Columbia and he's a microbiologist and studies cancer.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.960
What seems to be happening more and more in cancer study is studies of N of 1.

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.960
Okay, interesting.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.200
Which would be great if it happened in R.P.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.520
I mean, I can give you an example.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.960
I do a Professor's rounds at a rehabilitation hospital in Philadelphia.

01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:16.600
And last week, the case that was presented to me turned out to be incredibly fascinating

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:21.000
and it relates to something that you were saying, which is this is a guy who was alexic,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.680
couldn't read, but had a very specific kind of alexia that I have not seen in the last

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:31.800
30 years, which is he had difficulty identifying individual letters.

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.480
But that has been observed.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.560
But what's different about him is that he could identify without any difficulty individual

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560
numbers.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.360
So the graphemic complexity of numbers and letters are exactly the same.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.360
He can see numbers.

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.280
He can't identify letters.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:51.320
My first thought is we need to bring him in the lab and really study this and sort out

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:56.840
what's happening at that level of visual processing in relation to these symbolic forms, which

01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:00.880
are letters and numbers, which have no inherent meaning other than our associations and how

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.280
is this even possible.

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.920
But no takers.

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:11.200
None of my postdocs are all involved in programmatic research.

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:14.520
And these cases require a lot of work because you have to really think through.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.920
You can't just set it in motion.

01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:23.040
But this is the kind of thing that I think because, again, our funding mechanisms that

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:37.200
it is not and publishing constraints, I mean, these sorts of little unique NF1 studies that

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.360
really have the potential to teach you something important.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.000
We're just letting them slip through our fingers.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.640
Okay, I think we need to stop because we have one more question.

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.360
And then we will stop because we have another, we have Professor D.D.

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.400
Woberman who is going to, is it right?

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.800
No, he's not right.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:55.800
You're not the right?

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.800
Yes, he's there.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:01.800
I thought I saw him.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.800
Yeah.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.000
So Christina, did you have a question also?

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.480
I wanted a comment.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:10.600
Okay, right after this one comment from Christina and then we'll move on.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.960
Okay, thank you, let me introduce myself.

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.200
My name is Lisa Farber and I'm an art historian.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.160
I'm the former student of Tom Kaufman.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.680
So that's probably why I'm here.

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.080
I've heard your discussion.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.480
Please forgive me, I have to use my notes.

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:33.000
Dr. Glazie was talking about the evaluation of immediate human sort of responses to visual

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.520
images and that these responses were in some way consistent.

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.520
And then you were all speaking about the relationship between neuroscience and the evaluation and

01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.640
reception of images.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:50.880
And there was one comment about the possible influence of early life experiences like mother's

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.920
milk, you know, on the aesthetic taste later in life.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:01.400
I would like to know if the scientists here have really thought about the part of the

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:10.440
brain that affects human memory and how that is a determining factor in people's responses

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.960
to images.

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.600
I would also like to suggest and I've studied Roboc naturally because I worked at Princeton

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:24.840
and Tom Kaufman as a student of the Roboc Institute.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:31.200
I would also like to suggest that human memory shapes responses to images and that in viewing

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:38.200
a work of art, it may be precisely that moment that David Freberg mentioned, the moment when

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:43.720
the immediate physical response stops and then your memory kicks in, you relate what

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:49.000
you're seeing to what you already know and that determines your human response.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.240
Anyway, I think that Roboc was interested in the gestures and the motifs that let's say

01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:02.760
Batacelli was using from ancient works of art and how that influenced the reception of

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.200
his painting in the 15th century.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:11.480
And then also he was thinking about the images of Albrecht Dürer and how the reception in

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:19.920
Germany in the early 20th century was in part affected by people's familiarity, people's

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.120
memory of those images.

01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:28.320
So I think that human memory is something that I haven't really heard discussed here

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:34.080
very much and is there a part of the brain that you could measure because I think that

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:40.880
some of the art historians here perhaps David Freberg or Christopher Wood or Andrea Beyer

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:48.720
or perhaps myself, we have a slightly different visual memory or ability to memorize images,

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:55.160
or call things and so that may determine why we become art historians and also how the

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:58.560
regular population understands images.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:02.840
The next comment was made from Christian, I was a memory expert.

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.280
By the way, we have a session on memory, right?

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.440
No, actually my comment was not about that but we're going to have a discussion tomorrow.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:10.440
Yeah.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:18.040
I know all dedicated discussion to memory and art and emotions and all those connections.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:23.360
My comment was actually about what Pierre was saying and all the discussion that was

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:33.240
going on and I think I hope this is not trivial but I want to make sure that we are distinguishing

01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.640
two different levels of analysis.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:39.920
One is the group analysis to understand the general principles and this is where we started

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:45.120
because we know basically nothing when we started in many fields and so that has to

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.120
be done.

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:54.440
That would be an individual analysis and then another level equally important is the individual

01:50:54.440 --> 01:51:01.360
analysis but that we need to find the way to do that scientifically in a very solid way.

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:08.560
So what are the controls and that it has now been developing more and more clearly.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:15.160
Even in the animal studies, there are the group studies as well now the individual differences

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.600
coming out of the group analysis.

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:21.720
So I don't think it's a matter of selecting which paper is going to be published.

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:25.720
I hope that's not what we're doing.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:32.200
I think those are two different levels that needs equally both to be understood and scientifically,

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.200
solidly.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.840
Thank you.

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:40.000
So we'll have about a 10 minute break and then Professor Hoberman will give his paper

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.000
and then we'll stop for lunch and we resume at what time Rob?

01:51:47.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Two o'clock.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Thank you for sending that to me by the way.
