WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
We're going to start the meeting.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.840
Francois, sir, may we introduce the participants of this roundtable.

00:12.840 --> 00:18.000
So if you would please sit down and we can get going.

00:18.000 --> 00:33.400
Okay, I have to present this roundtable about Nemo Sin, the roundtable about memory and unconscious.

00:33.400 --> 00:40.720
The definition and the different limits between the question of unconscious and the question

00:40.720 --> 00:43.080
of memory.

00:43.080 --> 00:49.320
In this roundtable, there are people that I know very well like Kristina Alberini, who

00:49.320 --> 00:59.320
is professor of neuroscience at NIU here in New York, and working about reconciliation.

00:59.320 --> 01:05.880
We are collaborating with Guillermo Gistretti and I with Kristina Alberini about the question.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.800
I have to present also Siri Housvet.

01:08.800 --> 01:16.040
I can say what little world about you because everybody knows your books and reading your

01:16.040 --> 01:17.040
books.

01:17.040 --> 01:25.720
I remember that Pierre said that in one of your books, you said that reconciliation is something

01:25.720 --> 01:28.400
like aprecur.

01:28.400 --> 01:37.560
And he asked me what I was thinking about the relation between reconciliation and aprecur.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.160
I said no, I don't agree.

01:40.160 --> 01:47.320
And after I said yes, that you were right, that I am very happy to see you and perhaps

01:47.320 --> 01:52.280
to discuss after with you about the notion of aprecur.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.280
And he is also Joseph Sledou.

01:55.280 --> 02:02.640
Joseph Sledou is well known for all the work about emotional memory and this famous book

02:02.640 --> 02:09.760
for me too was very important, the emotional brain and all the works that were about traumatic

02:09.760 --> 02:17.360
experience and memory and different emotional memory, emotional center of memory.

02:17.360 --> 02:28.640
And also Kristo Fargenson, who I discover here and he is professor of Spanish early

02:28.640 --> 02:32.680
modern literature at UCLA.

02:32.680 --> 02:38.640
And Pierre Magistetti, that I know well, but I don't know how to present you.

02:38.640 --> 02:47.200
We are working about neuroscience and psychoanalysis, but you are specialized in the energetic

02:47.200 --> 02:56.200
of the brain and astrocytes and he is a famous neuroscientist and president now of the Ebro,

02:56.200 --> 03:01.560
international brain research organization.

03:01.560 --> 03:10.400
And we are together in Agalma Foundation in relation with the Elic Center discussing about

03:10.400 --> 03:15.960
Vahburg and now it's time for the wrong table.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.800
Thank you.

03:19.800 --> 03:29.160
So I wanted to begin by following a thread that was thankfully begun in the last session

03:29.160 --> 03:36.560
and it has to do with method and memory, the topic of our session.

03:36.560 --> 03:47.640
The idea really is whether or not after he comes out of Kojtlingen, he produces or cultivates

03:47.640 --> 03:55.200
what he calls in a letter to Binswanger discussing the Cesseteses, discussing the 1920s A on German

03:55.200 --> 04:03.560
astrology, what Vahburg terms historical psychology and how Vahburg's own projects in the last

04:03.560 --> 04:08.760
five years fit in with this historical psychology.

04:08.760 --> 04:16.360
He says in this wonderful volume that David Aes, D'Amilly co-edits in a Vahburg rights

04:16.360 --> 04:18.240
in an autobiographical sketch.

04:18.240 --> 04:31.560
This is therefore in 1924 after Kojtlingen's diagnosis of manic depression has, as a word

04:31.560 --> 04:38.920
is being now applied and therefore Vahburg is on his way to healing and he's looking forward

04:38.920 --> 04:44.720
to going back to Hamburg and he's writing an autobiographical sketch and he recalls a

04:44.720 --> 04:48.960
time when he was six years old and suffered a mild, what he calls a mild, of typhoid

04:48.960 --> 05:00.920
fever and he says at that time began the fear of quoting, disproportional, context less,

05:00.920 --> 05:07.880
context less or without a context, memories of images.

05:07.880 --> 05:14.640
So my question is how does he, with the Bilda Atlas, name wasune Bilda Atlas, it has many

05:14.640 --> 05:20.320
titles, Vahburg could never settle on a particular title, how does he, with this constellation

05:20.320 --> 05:30.240
of images, there were about a thousand images, 63 or 72 different Tothan panels, screens,

05:30.240 --> 05:38.080
screen memories perhaps even, how does he come up with a new method by which he can

05:38.080 --> 05:47.840
oscillate between the immediate demonic sensual, these are all words that Vahburg uses and

05:47.840 --> 06:04.160
the ecstatic prudential, wise, calm, mediated pole, or I mean he literally talks about

06:04.160 --> 06:14.280
swinging between both poles, now the Atlas is, as we have it, largely wordless and it

06:14.280 --> 06:20.640
is based on a method that is frequently diagrammatic, if we look at his notebooks, if we look at

06:20.640 --> 06:27.440
the Zetto Kesten, he's not able to write it out anymore, he's not able, he was never,

06:27.440 --> 06:35.360
he always had difficulty as Gombrick and others have noted with polished academic prose, instead

06:35.360 --> 06:45.440
he condenses, he uses the word fadictus, his ideas, and he condenses them so dramatically

06:45.440 --> 06:58.120
in the non-verbal Atlas that the de-demonization process that Vahburg sees as both personal

06:58.120 --> 07:07.200
and cultural is achieved, so he moves in a chronological fashion from ancient Greece

07:07.200 --> 07:17.280
to 1929 in Rome, in the course of the 63 panels, but that motion is not only cultural, chronological,

07:17.280 --> 07:24.240
historical, but it's personal in that in many of the panels he is repeating his own research,

07:24.240 --> 07:31.560
he's revisiting his own research, so it's a form of personal memory and cultural memory,

07:31.560 --> 07:39.320
maybe just one last anecdote really, the last panel ends with the Eucharist, or he's meditating

07:39.320 --> 07:45.080
on the Eucharist, so we know that this was a kind of redemptive gesture on the part of

07:45.080 --> 07:51.440
Vahburg, both a religious and a redemptive gesture, but in light of some of the number

07:51.440 --> 07:56.160
of people every kind of the accident or the anecdote that in Christ again he felt that

07:56.160 --> 08:03.560
he was being poisoned with human blood, that he was forced to consume human blood.

08:03.560 --> 08:14.960
Clearly, Vahburg was able to transform that, displace that by metonymy, by his art of combination

08:14.960 --> 08:24.640
in the Atlas, maybe one further postscript is that he also becomes obsessed by the work

08:24.640 --> 08:31.960
of Giardano Bruno in his last year of life, and he sees that as another intellectual project

08:31.960 --> 08:42.480
that can satisfy his method and the fact that Cassieva, both in letters to Vahburg in this

08:42.480 --> 08:50.680
period and in his funeral oration for Vahburg in 29, confirmed that Vahburg's method was

08:50.680 --> 08:54.400
the right one to make sense of Bruno.

08:54.400 --> 09:00.240
I think again, these are other examples of his historical psychology that goes between

09:00.240 --> 09:01.240
image and work.

09:01.240 --> 09:07.920
Okay, I'm going to try to make a bridge because we have an expert on Abi Vahburg sitting next

09:07.920 --> 09:08.920
to me.

09:08.920 --> 09:15.480
I've read your book and he really knows his stuff, and then we have three neurosciences,

09:15.480 --> 09:20.600
one who is written with a psychoanalyst, so I'm going to try to make a bridge about

09:20.600 --> 09:25.880
memory in the unconscious so that we have a way of crossing it, because what happens

09:25.880 --> 09:32.800
in these discussions is that there are epistemological and methodological differences.

09:32.800 --> 09:38.720
So people working in labs need controlled circumstances and you need to be able to reproduce

09:38.720 --> 09:40.000
your results.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.600
You do not need to do that.

09:41.600 --> 09:47.280
You need to have important insights about metaphor and Vahburg, and you can write a beautiful

09:47.280 --> 09:48.280
book.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.440
I'm a novelist.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.680
I don't need any of it.

09:52.680 --> 09:58.560
But I think it's really crucial that we think about how this is going to work.

09:58.560 --> 10:04.640
So we have essentially here, if we're going to talk about the unconscious, first of all,

10:04.640 --> 10:11.000
we have a dynamic Freudian unconscious, something I think we're all here at this table familiar

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
with.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.320
We have something now called, has been called the cognitive unconscious.

10:17.320 --> 10:24.400
And if we remember in behaviorism, this wasn't even talked about in the early 20th century.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.080
It came about later.

10:26.080 --> 10:31.920
Now neuroscientists are talking about all kinds of higher cognitive material that is

10:31.920 --> 10:39.880
part of unconsciousness that can, some of it, which can be brought to memory.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.880
The Vahburgian unconscious, you will have to help me with.

10:43.880 --> 10:54.840
It seems to me that what Vahburg is talking about is a kind of collective unconscious

10:54.840 --> 11:01.760
that is perhaps more related to Jung in some ways than to Freud, but it's not clear.

11:01.760 --> 11:12.880
The one science link that I found to Vahburg memory and the unconscious is Richard Zeemon,

11:12.880 --> 11:18.200
the German scientist on memory who really got lost.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.760
I started looking at it.

11:19.760 --> 11:27.440
He was a Lamarckian, but as we know, not that Lamarck has returned, but there are studies

11:27.440 --> 11:38.240
in epigenetics where there are shocks or stresses delivered to mice which change methylation,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.560
which then can be inherited.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.080
Interesting little link possibly.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.840
Kristina knows a lot more about this than I do, and maybe you should take the ball from

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
there.

11:49.840 --> 11:55.840
I'm trying to make little connective tissue so that we have something to talk about together

11:55.840 --> 12:01.080
about the function of memory and how it works for Vahburg.

12:01.080 --> 12:08.000
There's a 19th century, 20th century example of a scientist working on memory who had some

12:08.000 --> 12:13.200
insights that Vahburg borrowed and transformed.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.640
Now I throw it to Kristina.

12:14.640 --> 12:20.680
I'll take it from there and just to start the discussion.

12:20.680 --> 12:27.720
I'm going to talk about memory in general, so what we define as memory and how is this

12:27.720 --> 12:29.480
related to the unconscious.

12:29.480 --> 12:38.680
We define memory, anything we learn, and then we keep as information over time.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.120
There are already keywords here.

12:41.120 --> 12:50.640
Learning, which is something that is perceived and changed in the brain as an oral scientist.

12:50.640 --> 12:58.320
Then it's maintained over time, so there is the other important issue of time.

12:58.320 --> 13:05.760
This already goes away a little bit, takes some space from the unconscious because there

13:05.760 --> 13:08.200
is no time in that.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.560
We can talk about that.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.840
Is there for memory always conscious, of course not.

13:14.840 --> 13:20.480
We know not only in psychoanalysis but in psychology and in neuroscience more and more

13:20.480 --> 13:30.000
that many of the experiences remain in a place that is non-conscious and therefore by definition

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
unconscious.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.080
Does that mean that is the Freudian unconscious?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.720
That's going to be up for debate and discussion.

13:36.720 --> 13:44.240
We actually wrote a paper together with Pierre and Francois exactly about these topics, so

13:44.240 --> 13:45.840
perhaps Pierre can take it from there.

13:45.840 --> 13:51.480
I comment about Freudian unconscious, cognitive unconscious, many types of unconscious.

13:51.480 --> 13:56.560
Obviously needs to be defined because the word unconscious is common to all of them,

13:56.560 --> 14:00.520
but do they have anything to do with each other?

14:00.520 --> 14:18.640
Freud himself wrote that memory is actually an unconscious process or the memory trace

14:18.640 --> 14:23.920
to be more precise is an unconscious entity.

14:23.920 --> 14:33.800
The memory of the trace can be conscious, so he is distinguishing what is inside that

14:33.800 --> 14:40.400
is maintained, let's say in the brain, the brain body connection, that is unconscious

14:40.400 --> 14:45.400
but the memory of it of something is the conscious part.

14:45.400 --> 14:50.480
So clearly in this trace there is something conscious that can be brought to consciousness

14:50.480 --> 14:54.200
and the remains in the unconscious.

14:54.200 --> 15:01.440
There is a lot that can be discussed and certainly a lot of interest, particularly in I am very

15:01.440 --> 15:07.920
interested in that, in understanding the memories during development, which are very linked

15:07.920 --> 15:15.760
to the psychoanalytic issues in question, how much are they conscious or unconscious?

15:15.760 --> 15:24.480
Then is the process of consciousness coming in and are these traces, these memory traces

15:24.480 --> 15:34.280
maintained and influenced our behavior later on, which is the answer is obviously yes.

15:34.280 --> 15:44.080
So here we can connect about the perceptions of an artist making the work of art or thinking

15:44.080 --> 15:49.240
or visualizing anything, any perception.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.040
How much is that connected to memories?

15:53.040 --> 16:00.480
Memories besides that is a biologically essential function for life without memories we will

16:00.480 --> 16:10.000
not survive is also a very important part of the individuality of who we are.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.560
And there is a lot of connection to emotions and then Joe is going to tell us more about

16:15.560 --> 16:16.560
the emotions.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.240
So there is so much to go through, I think I will stop here and I will leave it to you.

16:22.240 --> 16:30.360
Maybe I can take it from your distinction of three unconscious cognitive Freudian and

16:30.360 --> 16:33.560
what you mentioned the Warburgian unconscious.

16:33.560 --> 16:41.280
I think Christina already made a first pass to the first two cognitive and Freudian and

16:41.280 --> 16:42.280
we can get back.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.920
I mean as you say there is still a lot to be said.

16:45.920 --> 16:53.200
But the quote unquote Warburgian unconscious, which you, until yesterday I never thought

16:53.200 --> 16:58.000
that that could have anything to do with what you mentioned, some sort of collective

16:58.000 --> 17:03.520
unconscious because for me it is very difficult to understand the notion of consciousness

17:03.520 --> 17:06.280
collective unconscious.

17:06.280 --> 17:12.760
So let me try to give you what I think about it.

17:12.760 --> 17:17.880
I have been thinking about this quite intensively obviously because of this immersion since

17:17.880 --> 17:20.640
yesterday.

17:20.640 --> 17:26.680
That resonates by the way with what you were saying initially the cultural and the personal

17:26.680 --> 17:28.760
memory.

17:28.760 --> 17:37.440
It is another way, so this contrast, this paradox between something personal and something

17:37.440 --> 17:43.480
cultural or collective I think is a question in the Warburgian unconscious.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.920
Let us call it.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.120
What does it mean?

17:46.120 --> 17:54.160
So initially when with Vittorio and Francois we thought of this gathering here, I think

17:54.160 --> 17:58.040
one of the starting point was the notion of Navelleben.

17:58.040 --> 18:08.200
So this idea that there is something, as Jor-Vivolscom says, something that remains over time maybe

18:08.200 --> 18:13.400
is updated at different times and cultures.

18:13.400 --> 18:26.160
But there is these patterns that reemerge through different stages of culture.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.000
It is something that is puzzling.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.600
So it has something to do with memory but how do you talk about memory being maintained

18:34.600 --> 18:42.920
across centuries and cultures, unless you speak of this collective unconscious which

18:42.920 --> 18:45.440
I don't really think exists.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.880
So how do you connect this?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.760
So you can take two approaches.

18:50.760 --> 18:57.960
One is, and I think that's the one that triggered our interest, is the idea that also, and Kristina

18:57.960 --> 19:04.360
has worked a lot on this, the idea that traces are made after an experience and then somehow

19:04.360 --> 19:06.520
there is the memory is very dynamic.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.880
It can be updated, there are new associations of traces.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.800
And one could say, when Navelleben is kind of a concept that has a resonance with some

19:16.800 --> 19:24.000
neurobiological aspects of memory that there are traces that are re-abdated, re-associated

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
with time.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.560
But it's really purely conceptual because the notion of trace re-association, of reconciliation

19:31.560 --> 19:33.960
is linked to a single individual.

19:33.960 --> 19:37.880
So how can you imagine that this goes on across centuries?

19:37.880 --> 19:48.640
So it works as a model but I don't think it works in practice to explain this verborgian

19:48.640 --> 19:50.280
unconscious.

19:50.280 --> 20:01.960
So it's an idea that I put here with all the, because we are completely open and discussed.

20:01.960 --> 20:20.480
But I just thought that, how about if there are some patterns that activate in a particularly

20:20.480 --> 20:30.360
strong way or patterns of neurons that it's an invariant of the human species, at least

20:30.360 --> 20:35.440
over these two or three thousand years that we're talking about.

20:35.440 --> 20:43.920
And somehow they generate some emotional response or some, even maybe cognitive response or

20:43.920 --> 20:44.920
something.

20:44.920 --> 20:56.120
So there is kind of a signature in certain patterns that is an invariant across time

20:56.120 --> 20:57.520
and space.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.200
And maybe something very primitive.

21:01.200 --> 21:07.840
I can't actually help but thinking of in one of your early papers in the Scientific

21:07.840 --> 21:17.120
American, you had a man in a forest hitting with a rod, a snake.

21:17.120 --> 21:24.520
And the idea that the snake would go through the low way, the talamus amigdala and generate

21:24.520 --> 21:33.160
this very fast response, not at all cognitively interpreted, which is the long way through

21:33.160 --> 21:36.560
the primary sensory cortex and then back to.

21:36.560 --> 21:45.960
So as a pure speculation, is it possible that these patterns that verborg identified and

21:45.960 --> 21:53.680
that we can group under this idea of the verborgian unconscious actually reflect a neurobiological

21:53.680 --> 22:06.640
reality of very simple or even complex patterns that are an invariant in neuronal circuitry

22:06.640 --> 22:14.800
and then that triggers certain type of energy, if you wish, which then are then integrated

22:14.800 --> 22:22.440
in much more elaborated productions such as the giérlandaleo or your name.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.880
So this is my take.

22:24.880 --> 22:33.080
I think maybe it is possible to talk about some kind of biological there there.

22:33.080 --> 22:40.040
What happened yesterday I think is that in certain strains of poststructuralist French

22:40.040 --> 22:51.080
thought, the body as a non-ideological, non-textual phenomenon vanished, which is I think the

22:51.080 --> 23:00.040
spat about La Con and Malle Punti was connected to this, that there is real biology and neurology

23:00.040 --> 23:09.760
in Malle Punti in a way that La Con's relationship to drive theory, which I think there are people

23:09.760 --> 23:13.800
here that can explain it better than I understood it, but it is changed.

23:13.800 --> 23:21.440
He really revises that in relation to what is happening in French thinking of the period.

23:21.440 --> 23:27.800
But if we can agree that there is some kind of biological route to human experience, which

23:27.800 --> 23:33.680
I think there is, then this is from Vareberg's journal and I think maybe Joe will have something

23:33.680 --> 23:34.800
to say about this.

23:34.800 --> 23:45.600
He says, the inherited consciousness of maximized impressions stamped on the mind, engram,

23:45.600 --> 23:52.600
engram, passes them on without taking cognizance of the direction of their emotional charge

23:52.600 --> 23:59.560
simply as an experience of energy tensions, this sounds a little like Freud, this unpolarized

23:59.560 --> 24:08.240
continuum, the imparting of a new meaning, you can think of that as Freud drives attaching

24:08.240 --> 24:13.560
to an object, to these energies serves as a protective screen.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.640
Joe, this sounds like you.

24:16.640 --> 24:23.200
This is Bobo, this is Bobo, but I know Joe can pick up on this.

24:23.200 --> 24:31.240
I want to start with something that Christopher said about the arrangement of these images

24:31.240 --> 24:35.160
and the dynamic that is going on between conscious and unconscious processes.

24:35.160 --> 24:46.200
Let's really simplify it and think of the conscious perceptual mind as one thing and

24:46.200 --> 24:51.960
everything else underneath as more implicit systems that operate unconsciously.

24:51.960 --> 24:56.040
What about the Freudian unconscious, all of that other stuff and just talk about it as

24:56.040 --> 24:58.120
pure wiring of the brain?

24:58.120 --> 25:02.920
Some things are unconscious simply because they don't have connectivity with the systems

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
that make consciousness.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.960
We could call it cognitive unconscious, but a lot of emotion stuff is like that too.

25:07.960 --> 25:14.720
We'll just call it the implicit of psychological unconscious.

25:14.720 --> 25:19.840
Let's say he's there ranging these pictures, his conscious mind is looking at it, but his

25:19.840 --> 25:23.880
unconscious mind is controlling his behavior.

25:23.880 --> 25:32.080
The actual arrangement physically of the images is probably being done independent of what

25:32.080 --> 25:34.080
he's consciously thinking.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.240
That's how you're getting these.

25:36.240 --> 25:44.640
You make a move, you put this here just intuitively and now it's part of your consciousness.

25:44.640 --> 25:49.240
That gets incorporated into your present state.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.960
Now you make another move and so it's a dance between the conscious and the unconscious

25:53.960 --> 25:57.480
as all of life is every moment.

25:57.480 --> 26:05.840
I see that as how these systems are interacting, but now to bring in emotion and universal

26:05.840 --> 26:08.400
unconscious.

26:08.400 --> 26:14.280
There are definitely things that are wired into the brain that we're sensitive to, whether

26:14.280 --> 26:21.080
it's the certain shapes, the visual cortex for example, has things that it's innately

26:21.080 --> 26:26.240
sensitive to in terms of angles and lines and contrast between stimulants and so forth.

26:26.240 --> 26:31.240
There are more complex things that we might think of in a psychological sense such as

26:31.240 --> 26:34.040
the snake on the ground.

26:34.040 --> 26:41.480
We know that the low road that you talked about, which takes information into the amygdala,

26:41.480 --> 26:46.160
which is important for detecting danger, the low road takes that information in, but it

26:46.160 --> 26:50.960
has nothing, has no way to convey psychology.

26:50.960 --> 26:57.040
All it has is curvature, intensity and those sorts of features.

26:57.040 --> 27:01.360
The guy that's walking in the woods in this picture and is about to step on the snake and

27:01.360 --> 27:05.760
freezing before he steps on the snake is not responding to the snake.

27:05.760 --> 27:13.680
He's responding to a curve shape on the ground that activates this archetypal image that has

27:13.680 --> 27:21.760
been threatening to our ancestors and our animal ancestors and all the way back down for millennia

27:21.760 --> 27:24.840
and causing him to stop to freeze.

27:24.840 --> 27:29.760
Just as you walk out on 2nd Avenue and the bus goes flying by and you jump back and afterwards

27:29.760 --> 27:35.720
you consciously become afraid, the brain has this kind of capacity to respond this way.

27:35.720 --> 27:41.640
As you know, many phobias are based on these kinds of archetypal stimuli, whether it's

27:41.640 --> 27:48.600
snakes and spiders and heights and blood and things like that or social situations where

27:48.600 --> 27:54.000
you're not in a sense of uncontrolled is present.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.280
There are lots of things that go on below the surface of consciousness that then we

27:58.280 --> 28:04.480
consciously recognize and incorporate into ourself, our mind, our personality, including

28:04.480 --> 28:05.480
our own behavior.

28:05.480 --> 28:10.880
So we act in a certain way that becomes part of our conscious perception of who we are

28:10.880 --> 28:14.880
and in fact we learn a lot about who we are through the way we act.

28:14.880 --> 28:21.480
I'm just going to say this, you can relate this back I think to actually trauma as something

28:21.480 --> 28:28.200
important in Valvo and also to the images you mentioned first connected to the typhoid

28:28.200 --> 28:30.760
fever.

28:30.760 --> 28:36.520
And trauma and learned fear responses which is something that Joe has also written about

28:36.520 --> 28:44.240
I think are very much implicated in Valvo's life but also in his theoretical position

28:44.240 --> 28:50.320
about the shock that returns and you know Valvo I'm giving it to you.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.040
Well I was picking up on the notion of the Valvo walking in unconscious in the distance

28:55.040 --> 29:01.440
between or how we might move from a conscious level.

29:01.440 --> 29:11.000
The first phrase in the introduction to name Azune is conscious creation of distance.

29:11.000 --> 29:18.040
He insists upon the fact that he is this is a practice that this project is going to show

29:18.040 --> 29:26.360
the means by which he moves from the demonic to something more ecstatic or more mediated

29:26.360 --> 29:35.840
something something controllable and the fact that he insists on Nietzsche's polarity between

29:35.840 --> 29:42.080
the Dionysian and the Apollonian in the same text suggests to me that he's realizing that

29:42.080 --> 29:49.840
the method that he of collating combining separating which he worked on with collaborators

29:49.840 --> 29:56.360
but mainly was it was Valvo himself who insisted on the arrangement of the images was the means

29:56.360 --> 30:04.640
by which he could de demonize quote unquote these images but implicitly also his own past

30:04.640 --> 30:06.560
and his own demons.

30:06.560 --> 30:14.560
So if you take people into the lab and make them afraid of something create a threatening

30:14.560 --> 30:20.840
stimulus by pairing something with shock or so forth and then re-expose them to that

30:20.840 --> 30:26.560
stimulus and ask them to think about a pleasant field of daisies or something like that you

30:26.560 --> 30:31.640
can lower the the response of the autonomic nervous system and also reduce the amygdala

30:31.640 --> 30:39.480
activity to that threat by arranging a context for it so it sounds like this is similar to

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
what he's doing.

30:40.480 --> 30:46.440
It's similar I'm just afraid from the sort of philological comparison perspective that

30:46.440 --> 30:55.720
we're losing the historical richness of Valvo's knowledge that he knew things about the history

30:55.720 --> 31:01.960
of astrology the history of cosmography the history of art that history of literature

31:01.960 --> 31:08.560
that allowed him to as you suggested in your last as you suggested in your last sentence

31:08.560 --> 31:12.720
to lower the fear factor as a her.

31:12.720 --> 31:20.280
But at least when I sense is that and again you formulated it by speaking about cultural

31:20.280 --> 31:25.600
versus personal memory I think there are two aspects that one can bring to the discussion

31:25.600 --> 31:33.440
one is the the motivations let cool them or the drives that made Warburg organize the

31:33.440 --> 31:41.080
images in a certain way in Nemozin in the Atlas and and and that is clearly the result

31:41.080 --> 31:45.960
of his personal life his personal.

31:45.960 --> 31:53.960
Yeah I mean it's his unconscious drives and then his intuition about Naheleben these the

31:53.960 --> 32:02.160
constancy the the persistence the surveillance of of certain antique patterns and that relates

32:02.160 --> 32:08.480
to to the other point I was trying to make and to to propose to this maybe there are

32:08.480 --> 32:14.760
these archetypal forms that are not that nothing to do with a collective unconscious but simply

32:14.760 --> 32:19.960
with a biological reality and and and actually I was discussing last night with the under

32:19.960 --> 32:26.800
Pinoti about something that resonates with this and is the notion of ou built by Dülke

32:26.800 --> 32:38.040
and so this idea that there are certain prime primal or original or original images that

32:38.040 --> 32:42.920
that I have nothing mythical actually they have some they're biological for our species.

32:42.920 --> 32:49.400
Yes and I think I think you're right we don't want to fall into some kind of reductive position

32:49.400 --> 32:58.160
at least I don't maybe other people do where you're reducing this very complex historical

32:58.160 --> 33:02.840
and intellectual reality to say a part of the brain.

33:02.840 --> 33:07.120
Are we trying to understand him or are we trying to get more general ideas about the

33:07.120 --> 33:16.880
mind or I think for example the idea of Dankram you can move this across fields so this idea

33:16.880 --> 33:28.920
of distance or Dankram subject object can I think be related to unconsciousness or pre-reflective

33:28.920 --> 33:38.840
self-consciousness and reflective self-consciousness in in phenomenology or Kierkegaard said immediacy

33:38.840 --> 33:46.640
a motor sensory immediate you know perceptions that are coming into the body versus reflection

33:46.640 --> 33:58.120
so and this would relate to what you call the slow road in fear perception right so there's

33:58.120 --> 34:03.080
this immediate response to the snake on you know in front of you where your whole body

34:03.080 --> 34:10.720
is just in alarm mode and then there are the slower responses that have cognitive functions

34:10.720 --> 34:20.120
higher cognitive functions. So what this makes me think is perhaps the load of emotions

34:20.120 --> 34:29.600
and the demons attached to it so it's overwhelming it's emotions and then making this space or

34:29.600 --> 34:38.280
taking the distance by giving a context by giving something that is attached to it so

34:38.280 --> 34:46.440
that a story can be made or a continuity so that something can be said from the beginning

34:46.440 --> 34:54.440
to the end and that is a way to move from the pure emotional state that is overwhelming

34:54.440 --> 35:00.120
and therefore may be therapeutic. And you're really figuring the fundamental metaphor that

35:00.120 --> 35:09.880
Bobo uses well in all throughout the 20s namely the Vanda Strassa that the road by which he

35:09.880 --> 35:17.000
moves from the demonic through to something more reason more prudential but then of course

35:17.000 --> 35:24.680
he re-encounters the demonic maybe in 1929 Rome that it's never it's never unlike Gomberich

35:24.680 --> 35:33.880
Snyol Kantian account of a Boboque career intellectual career and George has said this

35:33.880 --> 35:39.320
in his book wonderfully it's never there's it's Boboque spot is not teleological never

35:39.320 --> 35:48.000
comes to an end a nice calm settled synthesis and so that he's always re-encountering these

35:48.000 --> 35:55.320
images in both in a manner that requires mediation and memory and the kind of work that you are

35:55.320 --> 36:02.040
describing. In a form possibly of visual narrative and maybe that's my narrative obsession but

36:02.040 --> 36:10.120
I do think it's making conscious meanings out of the terror I mean the the archetypal

36:10.120 --> 36:18.960
motor sensory visual overload is the flashback that you're just there's no linguistic material

36:18.960 --> 36:26.840
there. Exactly. There's no linguistic material so I think that the Varburgian reality is

36:26.840 --> 36:36.600
negotiating exactly what you said the demonic is this motor sensory terror. He talks about

36:36.600 --> 36:43.560
something like I have it somewhere the melancholy you know the the tranquility or no the oh

36:43.560 --> 36:55.760
god it's cannibalistic fury and melancholic something or other here it is. Entire range

36:55.760 --> 37:01.320
of emotional gesture and now he's talking about the image from helpless melancholy to

37:01.320 --> 37:15.160
murderous cannibalism. Yes. Although I just that he in fact consists that the possibilities

37:15.160 --> 37:21.760
of using his method can result in either this the ecstatic or the melancholic. Yeah. And this

37:21.760 --> 37:31.880
is after having the initial he uses the phrase which is very Nietzschean nerve and rights

37:31.880 --> 37:42.040
the initial initial pull draw of the of the nerves of the feelings of this bodily the

37:42.040 --> 37:50.520
corporeal and then the abstracted even mathematical view of images that he condemns in for instance

37:50.520 --> 37:59.360
Hellenistic astrology. It's either too visceral or too abstracted and Varburg is looking for

37:59.360 --> 38:07.080
a middle road a middle path in which both the immediate and the abstracted can be in some

38:07.080 --> 38:12.760
sort of balance. Therefore he's interested in logos and mythos at the same time. Yeah.

38:12.760 --> 38:18.560
And hallucination is an interesting aspect of this. How so? Well the hallucinations that

38:18.560 --> 38:26.240
he remembers from his childhood the and the fact that that he does organize his thinking

38:26.240 --> 38:33.560
in a kind of bipolar way. And that then he has a psychotic break which is not just a

38:33.560 --> 38:40.360
break but it lasts for years. Right. Which he then recovers from I think in a way through

38:40.360 --> 38:49.400
Dankham. Through this therapeutic aspect of finding the distance through both writing

38:49.400 --> 38:59.320
and maybe arranging his mind. Yes. These complexes of images. Just fascinating.

38:59.320 --> 39:08.400
And he was extraordinarily keen to have acknowledgement from his peers that this new method of the

39:08.400 --> 39:15.640
build a higher technique of sequences of images that it would successfully help others mediate

39:15.640 --> 39:22.960
this polarity. The famous example of him traveling to visit Einstein and show him some

39:22.960 --> 39:30.440
of the cosmographical images in this form of visual autonomy. And that Einstein was impressed

39:30.440 --> 39:35.520
and agreed and could argue with him about the mathematics of it suggested to Varburg that

39:35.520 --> 39:41.480
he had succeeded in finding a technique or method. Yeah. But I think also someone in

39:41.480 --> 39:51.880
the last session Ernst Chris was mentioned. And Chris talks about an aesthetic barrier

39:51.880 --> 40:02.800
in art in creativity. That in a way preserves the artist from you know complete ego disintegration

40:02.800 --> 40:10.640
in these imaginative flight. This is a this is a linked thought that the aesthetic barrier

40:10.640 --> 40:20.480
is what Varburg is trying to set up. And the stakes are very high in his case.

40:20.480 --> 40:30.960
But what just go back to this archetypal images that can then be re-put into different context.

40:30.960 --> 40:38.480
I mean the for example we show the images that we saw yesterday in Georges presentation.

40:38.480 --> 40:47.000
I mean the angle of the foot I mean this and and with all that it brings in terms of you

40:47.000 --> 41:00.920
know representations. I mean that is a very specific pattern that may have been remained

41:00.920 --> 41:09.640
across centuries. And that's what I was saying again activating particular circuits but then

41:09.640 --> 41:17.880
or neurons actually. But then obviously it's it's contextualized you know in a painting by

41:17.880 --> 41:22.760
Guillermo and I or in in others. So this detail that he points and mentions often this and

41:22.760 --> 41:29.560
others but the notion of detail that he gives so much importance maybe again I don't want

41:29.560 --> 41:34.560
to be reductionistic but maybe it has a biological underpinning. Yeah well and I think if we bring

41:34.560 --> 41:44.480
up Vittorio and you know mirror systems in the brain that are you know working preconceptually

41:44.480 --> 41:53.080
and you know those wonderful tapes about dancers who are watching other dancers. And how the

41:53.080 --> 41:59.000
activation is different from just a lay person like myself watching a dancer. So there you

41:59.000 --> 42:07.680
know there are these this is not a conscious connection but it activates you know motor

42:07.680 --> 42:13.800
sensory parts of ourselves and this may be a link to Valbo as you say. Not talking about

42:13.800 --> 42:20.920
a Jungian collective unconscious but certain aspects of human experience that are well to

42:20.920 --> 42:39.400
risk the word universal. And maybe you know Joe the notion of how the body is engaged I

42:39.400 --> 42:47.400
mean in terms of the somatic states in emotions maybe again I mean that's also an aspect I

42:47.400 --> 42:52.760
think in when he speaks I'm not sure maybe you have to correct me but he said you have

42:52.760 --> 43:04.160
patos formel is it some kind of affect some kind of emotion that such patterns can generate

43:04.160 --> 43:09.520
you know maybe there also there is a connection with you know something that from the amygdala

43:09.520 --> 43:18.160
activates endocrine or autonomic responses. There are certain systems in the brain obviously

43:18.160 --> 43:26.080
they control our autonomic nervous system and the patterns that occur often are in response

43:26.080 --> 43:32.320
to movement in response to behavior to meet the metabolic demands of the behavior. So if

43:32.320 --> 43:36.640
you move your arm you've got to get blood in there and as you begin to move it you're

43:36.640 --> 43:42.120
using energy until you have to resupply the energy. So every movement requires that the

43:42.120 --> 43:49.240
brain orchestrates set of responses to adjust the physiology of the body to that system.

43:49.240 --> 43:53.480
And all of those physiological responses whether they're of the autonomic nervous system or

43:53.480 --> 43:58.720
the endocrine system are providing signals that then feed back to the brain as is the

43:58.720 --> 44:03.000
movement itself through the proprioceptive systems. So there's a tremendous amount of

44:03.000 --> 44:07.600
information coming back to the brain and I'm not necessarily talking about it in the

44:07.600 --> 44:15.440
sense of the demazio kind of creating a feeling but it's certainly affecting the information

44:15.440 --> 44:20.680
processing functions of the brain in a massive way. So all of the hormones that are released

44:20.680 --> 44:26.040
for example cortisol is very important it's released in the adrenal gland goes into the

44:26.040 --> 44:33.560
brain and binds to the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, you name it it's a hypothalamus

44:33.560 --> 44:38.240
it's all over the brain and so it's going to affect the way all of those systems are

44:38.240 --> 44:44.280
responding to the external world whether they're processing information implicitly or unconsciously

44:44.280 --> 44:55.440
or in a conscious sense. So the detection of some significant stimulus in an image can

44:55.440 --> 45:01.480
trigger all of that and then it feeds back to the brain which then affects the perception

45:01.480 --> 45:04.600
and it becomes a feed forward circle.

45:04.600 --> 45:11.680
So I suppose my question then would be in the case of Bob Walk and using the word case

45:11.680 --> 45:17.960
after five years five plus years of institutions after having his voice there's a description

45:17.960 --> 45:22.840
of his voice having been affected by all the screening that he did when he was institutionalized

45:22.840 --> 45:32.440
it was kind of broken by it. Can, from a neuroscientific point of view could Bob Walk have how would

45:32.440 --> 45:38.440
his reaction to the image have been changed having gone through that dark night of the

45:38.440 --> 45:46.000
soul as it were and having learned or taught himself and been taught to see these images

45:46.000 --> 45:55.160
over and over again for 40 years physiologically is there something that has changed or could

45:55.160 --> 46:00.400
he have changed could he have cultivated a particular reaction is unique is he exemplary

46:00.400 --> 46:05.840
well every experience changes your brain and the book is sitting here talking changes

46:05.840 --> 46:11.560
your brain and the more profound the experience the more change there's going to be. So being

46:11.560 --> 46:17.280
in a prison and screaming and being in an awful or any kind of awful situation is going

46:17.280 --> 46:22.320
to change all of the systems in the brain because they're all responding and part of

46:22.320 --> 46:31.400
this activity. So yeah I mean he's going to change his result of that and the way he

46:31.400 --> 46:35.480
deals with the world after that will change as well. I don't know if that answered your

46:35.480 --> 46:36.480
question but.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.480
Which brings up plasticity.

46:37.480 --> 46:43.480
Yeah which you have something to say about I know but so that in other words what we're

46:43.480 --> 46:51.000
talking about are dynamic systems which does really relate to Volvo very in a profound

46:51.000 --> 46:57.720
way I think both methodologically and you know how we can know what we know he's always

46:57.720 --> 46:59.560
in motion. Yes.

46:59.560 --> 47:06.960
Right it's never I mean this is what I'm Jo who was here anyway. Jo Jo was saying that

47:06.960 --> 47:16.440
there's a kind of a day in flute you know to use the bin spong in the work itself which

47:16.440 --> 47:26.200
can be maddening when you're reading it but is very very interesting from an intellectual

47:26.200 --> 47:34.200
point of view that it can't be pinned down and so the idea of dynamism is implicit and

47:34.200 --> 47:39.280
explicit in his work might in fact in his latter years he starts to use the word dynamo

47:39.280 --> 47:47.560
ground yes yes as a replacement term for the pathos formula yeah yeah more or less yeah

47:47.560 --> 47:55.840
and so again pushing on this of course every individual every experience has shaped the

47:55.840 --> 47:59.400
way we see the world but I'm wondering.

47:59.400 --> 48:06.400
The world's conscious strategies the build out list dynamo ground pathos formulas that

48:06.400 --> 48:11.720
they they seem from a certain point of view to almost be not defense mechanisms but coping

48:11.720 --> 48:18.440
mechanisms by which he is able to still look at those images that right cause him such

48:18.440 --> 48:24.800
terror and uses the word terror fear over and over and over and over and so it's not

48:24.800 --> 48:31.800
either or just to bring up here to guardian it's not either or it's some kind of swimming

48:31.800 --> 48:39.560
and motion between these two poles that he you know he keeps thinking and it is a kind

48:39.560 --> 48:46.720
of mind body polarity you know and unlike the rest of I kept thinking of the spatial

48:46.720 --> 48:54.760
metaphor unlike the rest of western culture where it's mind over body the hierarchy.

48:54.760 --> 49:02.400
In Valbo it seems to be the spatial metaphors like this and it's a continuum between the

49:02.400 --> 49:05.160
two.

49:05.160 --> 49:11.680
But you know you mentioned the plasticity and yeah I mean obviously every experience

49:11.680 --> 49:17.560
changes the brain through the mechanisms of plasticity but maybe Christina you can say

49:17.560 --> 49:23.800
something about the dynamics of memory and of the traces I think maybe that could be

49:23.800 --> 49:27.040
of interest to the group.

49:27.040 --> 49:35.280
Yeah so mechanism of plasticity which is that we used to process and we very much used to

49:35.280 --> 49:41.440
make memories and memories can be short lasting or long lasting so there is short term plasticity

49:41.440 --> 49:55.320
and this mechanism can be actually studying out relatively in detail so we know some of

49:55.320 --> 50:02.640
the underlying mechanisms of long term plasticity important for long term memories and how those

50:02.640 --> 50:08.680
then when they are retrieved the memories can influence the present and the present

50:08.680 --> 50:14.400
is going to be made of the present experience plus the retrieval of the memories.

50:14.400 --> 50:22.000
So this I think is very important and relevant to think about how that can play and there

50:22.000 --> 50:27.480
is less known or understood about memory retrieval which is the other process that we are all

50:27.480 --> 50:28.480
interested in.

50:28.480 --> 50:36.040
I want to make a correction here actually Joe is the one who rediscover reconciliation

50:36.040 --> 50:39.720
and when I started to work on it.

50:39.720 --> 50:46.520
Carrying neither in your lab or in this conversation and those are processes that are very interesting

50:46.520 --> 50:54.560
to think about also in the context of how we feel and how these changes over time so not

50:54.560 --> 51:00.760
only this mechanism of plasticity which the brain changes and make long term changes to

51:00.760 --> 51:07.760
store the memories but these changes are not static they keep changing they are very dynamic.

51:07.760 --> 51:15.320
Which is related to Nacht-Triglickeit we can say to Freud's idea of what straight sheet

51:15.320 --> 51:21.320
translated as deferred action which is not a good translation but afterliness which is

51:21.320 --> 51:23.320
dynamic and not static.

51:23.320 --> 51:30.800
So Christian maybe the coping that he is talking about is it comes to reconciliation where

51:30.800 --> 51:38.440
the meaning is changed with each experience and maybe having the demonic and the ecstatic

51:38.440 --> 51:44.680
together re-consolidates the memory in a slightly different way which then allows the next

51:44.680 --> 51:46.280
experience to be less demonic.

51:46.280 --> 51:54.280
I love this idea of re-consolidation or some people have described it as Boboek's

51:54.280 --> 52:01.400
combinatory art which almost is based on a medieval combinatory art that he can take

52:01.400 --> 52:12.840
the heterogeneous copia and find a way to constellate it in such a way in a manner that is both

52:12.840 --> 52:19.080
instructive to others satisfying to him and ultimately a form of memory work.

52:19.080 --> 52:20.080
And that's...

52:20.080 --> 52:30.000
So just to be a little more precise about how it works, re-consolidation is when memories

52:30.000 --> 52:40.760
are retrieved and they become fragile and changeable and this is a temporal window during which

52:40.760 --> 52:46.320
changes can happen and then the memory becomes again less changeable.

52:46.320 --> 52:54.840
However over time because there are many inputs coming in, many new experiences, many

52:54.840 --> 52:59.680
re-elaboration, the overall trace is very very dynamic.

52:59.680 --> 53:06.640
But there are specific processes and temporal window during which there is a much more power

53:06.640 --> 53:12.080
and possibility and ability to make changes.

53:12.080 --> 53:17.480
So modulating obviously the state, the emotional state is one of those that happens to you.

53:17.480 --> 53:24.720
I mean this idea that the mechanisms of plasticity allow the traces to be inscribed in the neuronal

53:24.720 --> 53:28.880
circuits but that that's something that would seem like permanent.

53:28.880 --> 53:30.240
But actually that's not the case.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.960
I think this is why I thought it was important to discuss.

53:32.960 --> 53:38.560
They can be re-mobilized and re-associated with others in different contexts.

53:38.560 --> 53:40.960
So it's a really dynamic of these traces.

53:40.960 --> 53:45.880
It's very important and it's being studied by Christina, Joe and others.

53:45.880 --> 53:49.360
And this is a heuristic...

53:49.360 --> 53:52.800
You're speaking to the heuristic quality of Bob Olg's late work.

53:52.800 --> 53:58.920
He's constantly using these methods, whether in lecture or with sequences of images, to

53:58.920 --> 54:02.360
discover and bring people along with him.

54:02.360 --> 54:08.800
And people describe his four hour lecture in famous lecture in Rome, the Hitziana lecture

54:08.800 --> 54:17.720
in early January 1929 as a heuristic experience by which Bob Olg takes his viewers, and I

54:17.720 --> 54:23.080
say viewers, maybe that's a slip there, because he had 19 panels along the lecture room.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.280
And no one could see them.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.920
No one could see them.

54:25.920 --> 54:32.280
But yet people described the being in the lecture as this marvelous revelatory experience.

54:32.280 --> 54:42.160
And Bob Olg himself at one point in the lecture says, yes, this speaks of it in terms of phenomenology

54:42.160 --> 54:52.440
by which he mediates between the legacy of the phobic legacy on the one hand and the

54:52.440 --> 54:57.160
ability to engage the world.

54:57.160 --> 55:03.360
So let's take the images and then the historical images and then let's re-experience them.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.240
And he brings his audience along with him.

55:06.240 --> 55:11.640
Well, and also I think it's important to this, the idea of a dynamic changing concept, which

55:11.640 --> 55:18.520
I think has attracted so many contemporary thinkers and scholars to Bob Olg, is the idea

55:18.520 --> 55:22.800
that you could move the images, right?

55:22.800 --> 55:27.840
I mean that they were on a kind of black felt and then you could shift the arrangement,

55:27.840 --> 55:30.720
which is very similar to what happens in memory.

55:30.720 --> 55:40.040
I myself have noticed in my autobiographical memories, explicit memories, that I have

55:40.040 --> 55:43.160
actually changed the location.

55:43.160 --> 55:50.480
So I have a strong memory, emotional memory, of being embarrassed by laughing adults when

55:50.480 --> 55:52.600
I was four.

55:52.600 --> 55:57.200
And I always remembered it in my aunt's house.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.760
Well, it was remembered.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.520
It did happen, I believe, in my aunt's house.

56:02.520 --> 56:09.920
But because I couldn't remember the early house, I shifted the memory to the later location

56:09.920 --> 56:12.600
which I had memorized.

56:12.600 --> 56:16.080
This is an extremely interesting example, I think.

56:16.080 --> 56:21.800
First of all, that we need to pin our memories to location, which is a very ancient idea

56:21.800 --> 56:26.960
and medieval idea, to low side.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.200
Greek, yes, but the Greek was topos, topos, and then Cicero.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.800
Seminities is the story.

56:33.800 --> 56:43.520
And then it's Cicero who really codified this, who tells the story of Simonides.

56:43.520 --> 56:53.280
And that idea of topos, I think, is completely valid in these discussions of reconciliation.

56:53.280 --> 57:00.160
In this sense, I actually would say that our memories are very inefficient, our memory

57:00.160 --> 57:06.960
systems, or at least these type of memories, the memories that are declarative.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
Shakeful.

57:07.960 --> 57:12.000
Very shaky because we don't need really to remember all the details.

57:12.000 --> 57:19.720
Actually, if we think about how many days we learn every single day, we lose them all.

57:19.720 --> 57:27.560
What remains is an essential, very faint trace of something.

57:27.560 --> 57:31.840
And then that something, especially if it's an old memory, has to be placed somewhere.

57:31.840 --> 57:37.000
So then we make the connections, and this is how the false parts of the memories are

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
formed.

57:38.000 --> 57:47.000
I think imagination and memory, as Vico said, these are two functions of the same faculty.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.400
And if you look at hippocampal lesions in the brain, people who can't remember very well

57:53.400 --> 57:56.320
also can't imagine very well.

57:56.320 --> 58:05.840
So that Buckner Carroll paper about the perspective brain that maybe it's not about accurate memories

58:05.840 --> 58:11.360
of our past, but using that material to predict future events.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.360
Exactly.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.360
Right.

58:13.360 --> 58:19.760
So it's a forward-looking kind of function, and I think that's useful.

58:19.760 --> 58:26.080
And all of this actually is not very unvalvogian, except he was looking more past.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.480
He was a retrospective gamer.

58:28.480 --> 58:30.280
He was a retrospective looker.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.280
But he was fascinated by memory palaces.

58:32.280 --> 58:33.280
Yes.

58:33.280 --> 58:41.680
And he describes the atlas at certain points as a kind of neo-memory palace that would

58:41.680 --> 58:47.240
help salvage or retain those details that are lost.

58:47.240 --> 58:51.400
Without insisting on the details themselves, but just by making them present.

58:51.400 --> 58:57.440
Because there was no verbal thickening around them as it stands.

58:57.440 --> 59:06.720
Well, did.

59:06.720 --> 59:11.440
Where are we in our drama?

59:11.440 --> 59:19.800
Do you have a question?

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
How should we do?

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
Yeah, I think so.

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
Don't you think?

59:22.800 --> 59:29.800
Yeah, you mentioned that it's not normal in your life.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.800
Just for this.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.800
I'm doing this right.

59:34.800 --> 59:41.040
I can speak a lot.

59:41.040 --> 59:46.280
So two possible next sees for your discussion about memory and reconsolidation.

59:46.280 --> 59:52.080
One is about the nature of emotions research, which would be a nexus between neurobiology

59:52.080 --> 59:54.440
and the other stuff that we all do.

59:54.440 --> 59:57.280
I'm thinking of Paul Ekman's work on emotions.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:03.400
And of how you have rapid reaction about a quarter second before you become conscious

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:07.680
or show your emotional expression on your face and his work on gesture.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.080
And the second possible nexus, I thought of Bob Pinus's work on trauma when you were

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.760
giving your specific memory about space.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:24.040
And Bob points out how he has a developmental model of trauma, which I think fits with what

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.520
you were talking about, of reconsolidation.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.200
And there's entry points where one can change for better or for worse, the nature of memory

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200
of trauma.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:39.400
But also in terms of spatial location, Bob points out how a child, for instance, in a

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:46.080
sniping episode in LA remembers the sniping episode, remembers details of the soldiers'

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:51.400
boots, and misremembers his location next to his buddy, who was shot.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.600
As a way of protecting himself, it's different from your explanation, protecting himself from

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.200
the memory of how close he came to death.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.040
But my memory wasn't traumatic.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.840
It was emotional, but it wasn't traumatic.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:09.200
I think traumatic memory has a very specific kind of, and it can be hyper-detailed.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.680
I mean, I have a traumatic memory of being in a car accident, which was followed by flashbacks.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.280
And that's similar in the sense that I have avoided the actual impact.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.720
Everything else is hyper-clear.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.520
But the impact is missing.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:28.560
The research on that suggests that it's very clear, but not necessarily accurate.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.560
So you have very vid-specific-

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.560
Absolutely.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.560
Absolutely.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:37.000
I'm not claiming that it's what I'm remembering is how it happened, because actually I have

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.600
black and white memory.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:47.440
I mean, I think what the data show is that the main focus is remembered, and then the

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:51.960
periphery of the memory is where all the mistakes come in.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.520
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:03.800
Two things you said, Siri, sparked thoughts that I would love to just make two quick observations

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.800
and throw it back to you.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:13.960
Speaking of murderous cannibalism, A.B. Warburg became a vegetarian during his hospitalization

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:21.400
because of a very concrete, specific fear that he was being served the cooked flesh

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.640
of his own family members.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:30.720
He had these persistent fears of drinking blood, not just the Jews' blood, but his own family

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.720
members.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:39.200
He had visions, and he accused his doctor of in a very eerily prescient way, shipping

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.600
train cars packed with the flesh of Jews.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.400
This is 1921.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:51.640
So I'm asking a question for which I don't have an answer about his own ambivalence or

01:02:51.640 --> 01:03:01.660
even fear of his own aggression and his desire to not devour his relatives or their own

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.760
the Jews.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:09.120
The other spark from something you said when you talked about him and his endless flight,

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:15.560
his endless motion and how he couldn't be pinned down while he was hospitalized, a doctor's

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.600
note in his chart, and this is obviously translated, said, he practices a cult with the moths and

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.280
butterflies that fly into his room at night.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.120
He speaks to them for hours.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:31.440
He calls them his little soul animals, Celin Tarkin, and tells them about his suffering

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.440
and then direct quote from his notes, it's hard to know is this experience or fantasy

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.480
or a dream or what it is.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:45.920
The most beautiful butterfly I have ever pinned down suddenly bursts through the glass and

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.760
dances mockingly upwards into the blue air.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.000
Now I should catch it again, but I am not equipped for this kind of locomotion or to

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.440
be exact I should like to, but my intellectual training does not permit me to do so.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:04.440
I should like at the approach of our light-footed girl joyfully to whirl away with her, but

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.520
such soaring movements are not for me.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.520
Yeah.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.520
Yeah.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.360
That's in the letter to Jolas, isn't it?

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360
Yeah.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360
Yeah.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Jolas.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.360
Yeah.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.360
I think it's mostly like an elliptic.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.360
Yeah.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.360
Yeah.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.360
Francois.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360
Yes.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:26.360
Yes.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.360
Yes.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:36.960
I have a very nice question because here you are too from literature and free from neurosciences.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:44.240
And Kessina is also a psychoanalyst and neuroscientist.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:53.000
And I was asking me finally after this roundtable, what is a dynamic memory?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.440
Because we are looking in a new way, a dynamic memory.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:04.040
And you were speaking about verbal unconscious, new kind of unconsciousness.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.360
This gets me afternoon.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:10.200
Frigant unconscious, cognitive unconsciousness, now verbal unconscious.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:16.920
And after the discussion about dynamic memory, reconciliation, retrieval, transformation,

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.520
I thought it was possible to introduce a new concept.

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.160
It is reconciliation in culture because you have the incidence also of culture through

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:37.000
the process of reconciliation, rebuilding, transforming the memories through not only

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:46.640
the individual history of each one, but also through the impact of the culture in the inside

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.640
world.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:57.400
And I don't know if you can take this new view of thinking, reconciliation, also in

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.640
confrontation of the question of culture.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.680
No, I think this is really important because I think it relates again to the dankham, to

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:11.320
reflective self-consciousness, if you will, to Kierkegaard's reflection to all of this,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:17.560
that space where you have, necessarily, you have culture.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:27.600
So if we think about human beings as socio-psycho-biological beings with those hyphens in some way blurred,

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.840
I know this is not good in science, but I can do this.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:38.200
And that if we think about that, then we understand that these things are completely mingling

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.280
together because, of course, culture, everything we read, everything we see becomes part of

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:48.280
our, you know, psycho-biological reality.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:49.280
Yes.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:57.560
Because we have one part, plasticity means all is conserved, and for the other part,

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.840
plasticity all is susceptible to change.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:07.560
And if you have this double view, for example, the snake, and it is the conservation of something

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:14.720
through memory, we don't know where, it's very difficult, Liam James, hypothesis, and

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.800
so on.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:23.560
And we have also the idea of diachronic reorganization, permanent reorganization, each experience,

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.240
every experience modifies, we never use the same brain and so on.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:35.080
And here in that, it's difficult to think these two contradictory dimensions.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:40.360
It's all the same thing, so the snake is there, and so the place where you're bit by the

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:47.840
snake becomes stored as part of the, you know, becomes plastic and stored as a new memory.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:53.560
And then the people you were with, or if you go back to that place, the people you're

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:56.760
with at that time become part of that memory.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.800
And that's why I've argued that metaphor is precisely the way we need to read this dynamic

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:08.360
cultural space because it's able to keep contradictory things together at once.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:15.480
But Christopher, absolutely right, that metaphor is probably the beautiful motion here of all

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.040
the possibilities of changing meanings.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040
Yes, yes.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:26.360
Right, so that, and that can also be a form of dank realm between the two poles of metaphorical

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
thinking.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360
Sorry.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.360
Thank you.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:39.080
Thank you. I have a comment trying to link the two round tables and trying to go from

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.080
the notion of detail that was very much stressed in the previous round table to the notion

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:54.440
of this collective memory that on the contrary is at the center of some of your discussions.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:01.920
I will attention to the peripheral element, the particular, I would say, micro logical

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.320
attitude.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:10.240
It is true that it's something that, of course, is typical of Warburg, but of many other authors,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:13.840
not only art historians in the 20th century.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.560
I was thinking of Benjamin, of course.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:23.520
But Georgia yesterday mentioned Giovanni Morelli as even Leer Molliev, so important as we know

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.840
to Freud.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:34.840
We shouldn't be very cautious here because I think that detail is crucial, but at the

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:41.240
same time we should distinguish two very different approaches, micro logical approaches, because

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:49.240
as George already said, in Morelli you have the analysis, the exploration of the single

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:57.880
detail, Botticelli's nail, Filipino DIP is ear, but what is the task?

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:04.080
The task is that you have to identify the responsible of the image, the individual, the

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.400
artist responsible, the attribution.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:16.160
So detail here is used as I would say, Prince Chippium in the individual, the individual.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:22.880
On the contrary, if you read the conclusion of the Botticelli's essay by Barbara, there

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.440
it comes out very clearly that he is not at all interested in Botticelli as an individual.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:37.760
The detail is used there in order to see he uses Caliusti, in, of course, Aristotle's

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:45.160
categories, the notion of delta rauzi, the second substance, because he says the detail

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:51.400
evokes in Botticelli something that is not only Botticelli, something that Botticelli

01:10:51.400 --> 01:11:00.960
shares with the past, with a common ground, with other painters, and so it's rather the

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.800
common ground, the co-innae iced this, the common sense shared.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:13.480
And so I come to the second round table, what is this common ground shared?

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:22.320
It is not the collective unconscious, I have difficulties as well in thinking of this notion,

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:35.400
but here, hearing Zehmon, it is inherited cerebral substance, which is a very difficult,

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:42.040
as difficult perhaps as the collective unconscious to understand, but it is substance inherited

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:49.960
from centuries, through centuries, and if something can come up again in the Renaissance,

01:11:49.960 --> 01:12:00.120
it is because Donatello or Botticelli inherit materials, so it's anti-Bergsonian, it's

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:07.440
not memory or matter, but it's memory is matter, and it's something shared, so I would call

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:14.880
it Brinchipium David was the only, because it hints at something that is shared among

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:22.320
a group of a community through centuries or thousands of years.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.840
Yeah, we just don't know how that works.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:31.520
I will only quickly add that it is true that Barbara is not Jung as we know very well.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:40.040
It is also true, as we spoke, that's now the pair that Jung says, my notion of collective

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:51.480
unconscious is Zehmon's name, and my idea of archetype is Borquertz War built.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.920
We know that Borquertz and Zehmon are two very important sources in Barbara, and perhaps

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:03.600
we have a good idea to finally discuss how from Zehmon and Borquertz, common and shared

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:11.760
sources to different perspectives on the idea of the over builder and the collective

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.040
memory can be articulated.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.680
Well, it's true, but it may be, you know, we talked a little bit last night because I

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:29.800
started reading this guy Zehmon really because I found him in Valblud, and it's very interesting.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:35.680
But when you return to Valblud after having read Zehmon, you realize that it's not Zehmon

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.920
anymore.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:42.120
I don't know what your impression is because you're probably closer to this, but I just

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:47.120
thought, oh, so it's not like Jung.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120
It's denatured.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.160
The time you get back to it, it's not Zehmon anymore.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.360
It's a kind of, again, I think a dynamic principle that just keeps running through, which escapes

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.680
at least me as a reader.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.640
I can't literally pin it down.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.960
I can't do the butterfly.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.080
But the dynamism isn't with Valblud rethinking Zehmon throughout his life.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.080
No.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:14.320
As a rather static view of Zehmon, rather it is the dynamism of this synchronic immediate

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.960
presence that he feels with at Gilandayo, for instance.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.360
Yes, I agree with it.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.280
There's this kind of synchronicity between himself and the artist that he studies because,

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:35.440
in part, they're heroically, Valblud's words, struggling with this energy that he is struggling

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.160
with as well.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.000
And that's remarkable.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.440
It's very stimulating.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.520
So I have many questions.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:54.640
Two questions for Chris and Siri, and one question for Christina, Joe, and Pierre.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.440
The first question is, stemming from my ignorance, you talk a lot about collective and conscious

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440
Jung.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.720
So what about if any, well, not you, but we discuss Jung a lot?

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:15.080
What if any relationship between Wundt and Barbara Wundt was almost never mentioned this

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.080
more?

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:23.880
The second question, particularly for Siri, the relationship between creativity was not

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.560
so much addressed so far.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:30.840
So the relationship between mania or hypomania and creativity.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.720
And for the neuroscientists, we have a dream team here about memory.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.640
So something that really is puzzling me.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:46.600
The brain is about 2% of body weight, but it gets about 15% of the heart output.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600
25.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.600
25 or more than 20% of more than 20.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.160
Based on consumption of oxygen.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.200
So it costs a lot of energy.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.200
Episodic memory.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.480
It turns out I attended a lecture by Jerry Torb recently about music.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.080
So when you are a kid, you listen every day to the Beatles.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.080
Then you stop.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.520
You decide to shift to a different musical taste.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:20.440
You listen to, I don't know, shoots or some Baroque music.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:27.680
Then all of a sudden you listen to as little as 30 millisecond of a song.

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:35.520
You used to listen a lot, but in the last 30 years you never listened to.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.440
It hasn't to be helped because it's very easy.

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:50.320
But any song you listen continuously can be recognized immediately.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.600
Or at least that's what I learned.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:00.480
So if you can confirm that, what is your opinion about the neurophysiological mechanism?

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:07.920
Enabling this trace to be sleeping for 30 years if it's a trace at all.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.960
And then boom, to be recovered.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.200
And how much affect has to do with this?

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200
Thank you.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.280
Well, there's the first one.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:21.400
I'm just going to say something briefly about hypomania and creativity.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:30.280
First of all, I really think that there is a connection, deep connection between the nervous

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:34.960
system, motor sensory roots to imaginative acts.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:45.520
I can tell you just personally that for me when I'm writing, the rhythms are extremely

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.560
important.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:51.040
And I can feel when a rhythm is wrong and I correct it.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.920
And those rhythms and what I like to call emotional truth, which is why one story and

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.320
not another in my case, I mean this is a good question.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:05.480
A fiction writer can write anything.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.560
I can write about flying zebras if I want to.

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.760
And no one will say I can't do it.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:18.200
There's no truth truth with a capital T. What there is are emotional truths that are expressed

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.760
through the stories and a great deal of that is unconscious.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.960
And it's connected to motor sensory aspects.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.200
I think all creativity is alike.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.920
I don't care what fields you're in.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:36.160
And I always pull out this brilliant quote from Einstein who was asked by Jacques Hadamah

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.960
how he worked.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:47.160
And he said, none of my work has anything to do with signs, either mathematical or linguistic.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.800
The way I work is visual, muscular and emotional.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.360
And later it's translated into symbols.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:06.080
This for me is simply an experience that resonates with my own experience.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:16.000
And so I think that the roots of creativity and vlog, I think at least certainly implicitly

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.800
is talking about that.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:27.920
The question of subject and object where there's no difference, this kind of deep bodily experience

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:33.880
where there's really no reflection which then becomes a form of reflection, say, in the

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:40.240
act of making symbols, whether they are, I think they're different.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.600
Linguistic signs are different from images, but nevertheless they're all a form of creating

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.960
that distance.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.480
There's an aesthetic barrier that's protective.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.720
Yes, and we haven't really, speaking to the question of creativity, we haven't really

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:59.200
spoken about Vavwog's unpublished writings, especially in his late years, which are, he

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:04.720
calls them a laboratory, he uses this metaphor again and again, for his discoveries, for

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.280
his numerous unfinished, unfinishable projects.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:16.520
The way that he moves from one idea to another and condenses, fadictates his language in

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:23.880
a playful way, is extraordinary as he tries to discover new projects and new connections

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:30.240
that he hadn't previously contemplated, even as he returns to his old ideas.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:38.680
So, if you read the diary, the toggle book in the last three years, the palpable enthusiasm,

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:45.680
the inspiration that he feels with the new Bruno project is like a little kid.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:56.080
And it's as if he's persuaded himself that he's been able to remake himself.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:03.400
So, for instance, he says at one point, Bruno, with whom I've been engaged with for 40 years,

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:09.280
and there's no evidence whatsoever that this is anything but a new project.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.320
Just suggest the degree to which he feels it.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320
Yes, yes.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.320
It's a sibling.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.320
Yes.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.320
That's it.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:18.320
Okay.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320
Oh, good.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.400
Someone, Christina, maybe you'll talk about one star.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:31.840
Some answer or some talks, some comment about the question of how these memories can last

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.240
for such a long time and be retrieved later.

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:40.640
That is one of the outstanding questions to be addressed in neuroscience.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:46.960
There are a number of suggestive results.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.160
Launter memories rely on biological changes, that's a fact.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:56.520
So, what type of biological changes can maintain these information for more than 30 years?

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:04.600
And they are recalled in a fraction of a second or, you know, a very short time they can return.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:16.320
So, you know, study all these mechanisms in the last 20 years, we know that the making

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.400
of proteins, what's called gene expression that is required for long term memory and the

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.760
transition of proteins, because proteins have a much shorter life.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.240
They can not last for more than 30 years.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:31.400
But there are mechanisms that regulates those making of the proteins.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:37.560
One that was mentioned is, you know, chromatin changes, epigenetics.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.320
And those can really last for a long time.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.560
I would add to that that another possibility that is still not explored is feedback mechanisms.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.040
They can actually maintain a process for a very long time.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:57.440
One that has been very much discussed is actually the network of synapses, the contacts among

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:02.200
neurocells, including astrocytes, I would think.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:08.960
And maybe the network is what is able to maintain over time the information.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.560
So they can be changes because of this plasticity.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:16.840
You can make no association, take out others, modulate the intensity and so on.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:23.280
And there is a substrate, a combination of synapses that is maintained and when triggered

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.920
the memory returns.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.200
And I live to draw the emotional part very important.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:37.920
I think the music part is, you know, it's interesting that music does have the special

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.240
way of kind of getting to the sweet spot of emotion and memory in the way that nothing

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.880
else can.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:52.680
But I would maintain that the musical memories that do that most are the ones from your adolescence.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:57.480
And the reason for that is because, this is a total speculation, but because of the hormonal

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:02.640
upheaval and changes that are taking place at that time, consolidate those memories especially

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:08.000
strongly so that when you hear that fragment of the introduction to help or some other

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.880
song, it's because it happened at a time when your emotional life was just really starting

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.400
to happen in a profound way.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.400
Just a comment on the energy utilization.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:28.360
I mean, this idea that maintaining memories is an active process may be also reflected

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:35.640
in this very high cost for energetic cost of the brain, which is really ten times as

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:36.640
well.

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:42.960
What's puzzling is why the brain should invest energy to keep in memory something the brain

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:50.920
will never know if it will happen unless there's some very strong emotion of the evening.

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.080
But I mean, absolutely.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.640
I mean, long-term memories are always connected to emotion.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.440
Unless there is another way of making long-term memories, which is true repetition, those are

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.960
other types of memories.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.360
And who knows, maybe also repressing memories cost energy.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:09.360
Thank you.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:17.080
It occurs to me that hearing what we've heard last couple of days and particularly at this

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.520
session that what VARBORD needs most is what Freud received.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.000
I want to say 25 or 30 years ago, a book by Frank Soloway, Freud, The Biology of the

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Mind.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.520
We need, it seems like, and I think Andrea mentioned that, you know, VARBORD went to

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.640
study medicine after his military service.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:40.240
I don't think we fully appreciate the magnitude, particularly in some of the suggested passages

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:47.880
that Spiro has mentioned about VARBORD's reading of Darwin and that his belief that

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:55.920
perception involved a kind of energetic transfer, a creation of a symbol that is the stimulus

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:02.880
generated a response which became kind of the biological substrate for an internal image.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:09.200
But I believe Professor Rose talks about it very persuasively and that it's the expression

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.480
of these biological images in pathos formula, schlock, build-up and what have you.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:18.240
This is the stuff I think that VARBORD deserves.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:23.680
He deserves the serious kind of treatment as a the first affective neuroscientist.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:29.480
He, you know, and this business of this collective unconscious may not be as effective as what

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:37.320
Timothy Wilson talks about as in a, the, I think he calls it the adaptive unconscious.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.520
And so this adaptivity, I think, is one of the things that VARBORD was constantly aware

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.760
of and why you could have these recurrences, this knock-labin is because the biological

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:53.920
substrate remains the same through time and the, you know, the stimuli change but the substrate

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.220
remains.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:27:08.440
Any thoughts on that adaptive and solway connection?

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:12.080
I would just say you make a very compelling case.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:16.800
And I just want to address this idea of the mainia and creativity.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:24.200
I think Freud was right when he said a mild state of depression is for him the best state

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:30.640
of creativity and that's because in a depressive position to go to Winnicott you bring the

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:36.440
projections back home, take responsibility and it's not all enemies out there, it's

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440
inside.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.640
Yeah, but hypomania does not have to be that.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:47.280
I mean if you look at, you know, certain manic patients and the energy that's, that's produced

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:55.920
or even if you look at certain hypergraphic conditions that accompany temporal lobe epilepsy,

01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:03.120
I'm, for example, Dostevsky, Dostevsky was clearly hypergraphic.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.680
He had temporal lobe epilepsy and what he produced in those moments of I would, you can certainly

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.160
call it hypomania, we're, you know, brilliant works of art.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.120
I mean the content is not determined by his hypomania.

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:20.840
But I think it can go both ways that depressive positions can produce great art but so can

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.360
hypomanic positions.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.800
Anybody has a comment to the gentleman's question regarding adaptation?

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:27.800
Oh yeah.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.560
If not, then we will stop and we will regather here at two o'clock.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:37.280
That'd be a wrap up with about an hour and hour, 15 minutes where all the participants

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.440
would be, is it two o'clock?

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.880
Yeah, two o'clock.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.960
So we finish by about three-third, did the latest.

01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960
Right.

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960
Yeah.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960
Yeah.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:49.960
Yeah.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:50.960
Let's go.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:51.960
Let's go.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:52.960
Okay.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:53.960
Well, sure.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:58.960
Great for you to come.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.960
I do?

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960
Yeah.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:06.960
I, I, I was in immense power.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.960
Yeah.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960
Yeah.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960
Yeah.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:15.960
Yeah.
