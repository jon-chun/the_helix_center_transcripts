WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
So I thought to start us off, I might refer back to comments that were introduced by Peter

00:08.920 --> 00:14.600
yesterday on Bins-Vanger and Warburg, that foreshadow some of what we'll discuss, as

00:14.600 --> 00:22.880
well as Francois's comments in the latter part of the proceedings, where he referenced

00:22.880 --> 00:31.560
the role of the unconscious in creation and recognition of the creative products.

00:31.560 --> 00:38.480
So if either of you would like to start, we'll take it from there.

00:38.480 --> 00:46.440
It seems to me one point that's been overlooked so far in the symposium is that the psychoanalytic

00:46.440 --> 00:56.560
method is very analogous to Warburg's method of close attention to detail, the hair in

00:56.560 --> 01:06.760
a Roman sarcophagus and the hair in buttecelli, and that the small attention to detail is

01:06.760 --> 01:13.200
also, of course, a psychoanalytic method, that it's a different kind of listening and

01:13.200 --> 01:24.400
any kind of social slips that we hear in conventional conversation, we overlook them, and don't

01:24.400 --> 01:28.000
make out anything, make anything out of them.

01:28.000 --> 01:39.320
But in psychoanalytic work, you pay close attention to the most minor verbal and nonverbal,

01:39.320 --> 01:45.920
and the whole clinical teaching of Wilhelm Reich is to focus on the nonverbal, the body,

01:45.920 --> 01:52.680
the posture, the way the man comes into the room, and the way he sits down or lays down

01:52.680 --> 01:59.720
whether he straightens the cuffs and the seam of his pants and so on.

01:59.720 --> 02:13.560
It communicates a great deal and psychoanalytically, the emphasis on the small detail is also what

02:13.560 --> 02:19.200
Warburg has in common, and it was mentioned once yesterday, but I think it deserves a

02:19.200 --> 02:28.240
little more, the technique of Carlo Ginsburg, who looks at the single case history in depth

02:28.240 --> 02:40.200
and the minor things that took place in an inquisition interrogation and so on, and what

02:40.200 --> 02:45.760
the man had to say, the Miller, so on.

02:45.760 --> 02:57.200
So I think that when the illustration was made, there was a reference yesterday to the position

02:57.200 --> 03:00.560
of Moses's foot.

03:00.560 --> 03:08.960
Now I would say in that great statue of Michelangelo in the Church of San Pietro in Vinkoli, in

03:08.960 --> 03:19.040
Romain, the Corzo Cabor, the small detail that one should focus on and that Freud focused

03:19.040 --> 03:25.320
on was not the foot, but the finger which pulled aside that torrent of a beard.

03:25.320 --> 03:38.680
It looks like a waterfall coming down a masterpiece and designed for the Pope Julius' tomb, but

03:38.680 --> 03:48.680
this indicates for Freud, and I think we can go with him on this, ambivalence about action.

03:48.680 --> 03:56.920
The theory, it's the second time Moses came down from the mountain and he was again enraged

03:56.920 --> 04:11.720
and thought of smashing the tablets and thought of it.

04:11.720 --> 04:19.680
I think it's not a coincidence, it's time-specific.

04:19.680 --> 04:32.180
From there I would say that the fearful and the big thing that I'm not really hearing

04:32.180 --> 04:50.160
is the demonic, bestial blood consuming that Barbara feared that came out in his psychosis,

04:50.160 --> 05:05.860
murders, kidnapping, threat, and I think that there's been a decline.

05:05.860 --> 05:12.580
I think Freud was right in civilization, it's discontent, it's 1930, there's been a decline

05:12.580 --> 05:18.720
in civilized and that really should be put in quotation marks.

05:18.720 --> 05:25.020
He's behavior just as when he writes about civilized sexual morality and modern nervous

05:25.020 --> 05:35.060
illness, he's mocking it and that civilization by 1930 was in danger and he says so, this

05:35.060 --> 05:39.380
is explicit of Erebus is in danger of destroying itself.

05:39.380 --> 05:45.900
There's that much aggression and one of the things that happened in the psychosis is that

05:45.900 --> 05:59.700
the aggression wasn't contained, it wasn't bounded and it's really a comment on civilization

05:59.700 --> 06:08.780
and if Freud had lived until 1945 we can only fantasy what he might have written about the

06:08.780 --> 06:12.460
state of civilization but who are we to say he was wrong?

06:12.460 --> 06:19.020
I think there's been a decline and I think we're on American soil now and you may know

06:19.020 --> 06:25.060
that the American national anthem, the Stars Bangled Banner was written by Francis Scott

06:25.060 --> 06:32.860
Key as he was in Baltimore Harbor in the War of 1812 to 14 which is the American part

06:32.860 --> 06:42.140
of the Napoleonic Wars and he was not a prisoner, he was on a truth ship with a British admiral

06:42.140 --> 06:47.740
in a British general and he had gone down on this truth ship to free a certain Baltimore

06:47.740 --> 06:55.860
physician who she got out of British captivity and they were watching the bombardment of

06:55.860 --> 07:03.460
a fort, Fort McHenry and the British admiral in general said now you've been with us,

07:03.460 --> 07:10.260
you've dined with us and we can't let you go back because you now know our plan for

07:10.260 --> 07:17.340
invading Baltimore, that we're going to bombard the fort and then make a landing and try to

07:17.340 --> 07:24.580
come in on the east side and so on and so they held him captive during this night in

07:24.580 --> 07:30.820
which he watched the bombardment and that's those are the words of the Stars Bangled Banner

07:30.820 --> 07:38.660
but there's a level of civilization there between adversaries at war that you know they

07:38.660 --> 07:48.140
treated him well, he had to be held for an extra day for this reason and there's a level

07:48.140 --> 07:52.980
of civilization in the American Revolutionary War when you read in the letters of Thomas

07:52.980 --> 08:00.860
Jefferson, he was governor of Virginia at the time and he invited British captive officers

08:00.860 --> 08:07.180
to dine in Monticello and there's a nice exchange of correspondence where they thank

08:07.180 --> 08:14.260
him for his graciousness and he said you know we may have countries who are at war but we

08:14.260 --> 08:21.620
can still be civilized to each other, we've had a debasement really it seems to be of values

08:21.620 --> 08:30.340
and I think that the Warburg picture is very much a part of that.

08:30.340 --> 08:39.380
Okay, well I'll jump in later, go ahead.

08:39.380 --> 08:48.580
Okay, perhaps a question for me, confronting psychoanalysis and history of art who work

08:48.580 --> 08:56.580
of Warburg is the common point between these two fields of investigation of research.

08:56.580 --> 09:04.460
I think effectively that unconscious is a common point, an intersection and we have

09:04.460 --> 09:12.780
to know how Warburg informs fraud and how fraud informs Warburg about unconscious,

09:12.780 --> 09:20.300
the dimension of creativity of unconscious, the timeless dimension of unconscious, the

09:20.300 --> 09:29.340
dimensionality of unconscious is really important in the creative process and also to interpret

09:29.340 --> 09:31.420
artistic works.

09:31.420 --> 09:39.620
But today in this morning I think the question, very difficult question is the place of psychosis

09:39.620 --> 09:43.780
in the process of thinking of Warburg.

09:43.780 --> 09:51.140
I am a psychoanalyst and a psychiatrist and it's difficult to speak about psychosis of

09:51.140 --> 09:58.940
Warburg that I didn't know, I have no clinical interview with him, I've only his work.

09:58.940 --> 10:05.220
Freud said about Schreber that it was possible to read the psychosis directly in the text

10:05.220 --> 10:08.060
of the President Schreber.

10:08.060 --> 10:13.740
We don't need to see the patient but I think it's difficult because as a psychoanalysis

10:13.740 --> 10:21.980
analyst we have always the risk to be specialized in the prediction of the past.

10:21.980 --> 10:29.020
It is an important message to have the history of Warburg, of Warburg work, to look at it

10:29.020 --> 10:38.980
from Nemusin for example, Mark Leiben, the Atlas and so on and to use the creativity,

10:38.980 --> 10:51.340
the scientific creativity of Warburg to interpret this strange moment between 1918 and 1924 when

10:51.340 --> 11:00.860
he was first in Vienna for psychotic breakdown and after he was in the Binslangerklinik at

11:00.860 --> 11:09.740
Käuzlingen near Zurich and we have access to that description of everyday life of Warburg

11:09.740 --> 11:21.220
in this clinic and it was very ill, very difficult moment of his life and how can we make a relationship

11:21.220 --> 11:32.340
between these data of the clinical state of Warburg and his mental illness and also to

11:32.340 --> 11:39.620
make a relationship with his thinking and art investigation.

11:39.620 --> 11:49.020
And I think it is a clinical problem, it is a medical problem, it is also a theoretical

11:49.020 --> 11:57.220
problem to make this kind of causality, this kind of relation but we can try to do it.

11:57.220 --> 12:06.020
But for me it is necessary to be really prudent in the construction of something between mental

12:06.020 --> 12:09.620
state and intellectual production.

12:09.620 --> 12:20.740
It is very easy to make the relation afterwards and to use a retrospective projection, the

12:20.740 --> 12:25.220
illusion of a retrospective and a reflection is difficult.

12:25.220 --> 12:32.780
I have a point, it is important to think about unconscious for one part and about psychoses

12:32.780 --> 12:35.780
for the other part.

12:35.780 --> 12:47.540
For me the work of Warburg after the psychotic breakdown, perhaps we can discuss about a

12:47.540 --> 12:58.700
real access to something new through the psychotic breakdown of Warburg.

12:58.700 --> 13:09.620
Because I can speak about applied psychoses to investigation of art, applied psychoses

13:09.620 --> 13:16.140
we have to discuss about that, the hypothesis, applied psychoses because we can say it is

13:16.140 --> 13:25.500
delirium, delirium Freud was speaking about the question of truth in delirium, direct access

13:25.500 --> 13:34.420
to the other, to important access, to access to the meaning, too much meaning, like if a

13:34.420 --> 13:44.340
scanner of analysis of the world, delirium and truth, it is one question, one level question.

13:44.340 --> 13:57.980
The other level is for me invention, psychotic invention and Warburg created new ideas about

13:57.980 --> 13:59.340
art.

13:59.340 --> 14:12.420
It was perhaps inventions, but these inventions finally revealed to be discovery and for me

14:12.420 --> 14:20.780
to find how to associate delirium and truth, invention, why not, psychotic invention and

14:20.780 --> 14:25.740
discovery is a very important field of investigation.

14:25.740 --> 14:31.300
There are some mathematicians, we can speak about Nash, for example, we can speak about

14:31.300 --> 14:42.380
Newton, why not, we were people with these strange borders, strange limits between invention

14:42.380 --> 14:54.420
and investigation, when an invention and discovery, when an invention become a discovery, it was

14:54.420 --> 14:57.340
for me an important question about value.

14:57.340 --> 15:04.980
Really getting at the heart of a dialectical question that runs through much of psychoanalytic

15:04.980 --> 15:11.260
thinking about, you know, is there a dialectical relationship between psychosis and creativity,

15:11.260 --> 15:14.700
disorder and order, entropy and organization?

15:14.700 --> 15:21.900
Exactly, exactly, we can say that for artists, it is perhaps well known, better known, artist

15:21.900 --> 15:29.980
with psychotic problems, have a creative, or they lose completely the creativity or they

15:29.980 --> 15:31.580
have a possible creativity.

15:31.580 --> 15:42.540
But here we are speaking about scientific creativity in a psychotic thinking and I think

15:42.540 --> 15:51.620
it is a great question for us, for psychoanalysts, for psychoanalysts, but also to think the

15:51.620 --> 15:58.620
relationship between the process of creativity.

15:58.620 --> 16:09.860
We are historians too, I think you stated very well and within psychoanalytic history

16:09.860 --> 16:13.740
there is something of an anticipation of that, say, in Aaron's chris' regression in the

16:13.740 --> 16:14.740
service of the ego.

16:14.740 --> 16:21.100
It is very interesting to think how close Chris was to the Warburg school and how important

16:21.100 --> 16:31.100
it was to him and just to follow up on some of the comments here.

16:31.100 --> 16:38.540
In the work that I have done in studying Warburg's ideas and also for Zoxel's ideas in comparison

16:38.540 --> 16:51.020
to Freud and to Chris, what strikes me is not only an intersection in idea and theory, but

16:51.020 --> 16:58.260
a kind of methodological intersection that Peter also was referring to.

16:58.260 --> 17:02.140
I was interested first to see how psychoanalysts interpreted culture, and I was interested

17:02.140 --> 17:08.380
in seeing how the interpreters of culture were using psychology and Warburg was absolutely

17:08.380 --> 17:10.180
crucial in this.

17:10.180 --> 17:19.180
One idea I think that Warburg was advancing so to speak without putting it this way.

17:19.180 --> 17:25.740
He talked about the afterlife of antiquity, but the return of the repressed, and that

17:25.740 --> 17:35.140
this was an idea, an attitude or an interest of those in psychology and culture in the

17:35.140 --> 17:41.700
early 20th century that could bridge what they were doing.

17:41.700 --> 17:48.220
Warburg, what interested me in Warburg is not only the idea, but the methodology he was

17:48.220 --> 17:52.660
pursuing before his breakdown.

17:52.660 --> 17:59.140
What I found interesting was this, the very close attention to detail, when you read Warburg's

17:59.140 --> 18:07.180
essays, and don't before expanding upon the content of his ideas or theories, but just

18:07.180 --> 18:11.260
the methodological approach of his essays.

18:11.260 --> 18:17.660
How extraordinarily careful he is in building an argument.

18:17.660 --> 18:21.700
Excessively careful.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.140
It's very interesting to point out, because as we're talking about him, we're talking

18:26.140 --> 18:33.380
about very large, universalistic conceptions that stretch across time and borders that

18:33.380 --> 18:38.540
were very important to him, and that psychology was key to establishing this.

18:38.540 --> 18:45.620
In his own essays, how interested he was in particularities, and being able to cite the

18:45.620 --> 18:52.020
source of almost every single proposition that he was making.

18:52.020 --> 18:59.020
And so he could argue, you know, God is in the detail, right, was one of his phrases,

18:59.020 --> 19:00.020
right?

19:00.020 --> 19:05.060
He could also say the devil is in the detail, but God is in the detail.

19:05.060 --> 19:11.780
Also his idea that within the image, the image is an accretion across time.

19:11.780 --> 19:18.340
What attaches to the image is as important as the final product that we see.

19:18.340 --> 19:21.780
And that Warburg didn't follow this as much as they Zoxel did.

19:21.780 --> 19:28.820
I mean, Zoxel was very taken by the idea that you could trace these accretions and sort them

19:28.820 --> 19:31.700
out in an even more detailed analysis.

19:31.700 --> 19:39.700
And of course, Warburg thought that the image was in fact a kind of action, that to do art

19:39.700 --> 19:45.420
was repeating an action, the action that was portrayed, and that it was a step from ritual,

19:45.420 --> 19:52.140
which was too close to something that was further from it, more symbolic.

19:52.140 --> 19:59.020
And he was very careful, and he saw the images, he saw images not only as documents in the

19:59.020 --> 20:04.220
way we've been talking about it, but he saw it was essential to apply documents to an

20:04.220 --> 20:06.300
understanding of the image.

20:06.300 --> 20:10.740
And so when he was in Florence, he was not only looking, he was only looking within the

20:10.740 --> 20:14.940
churches at the images, he was going into the archives, the family letters, the family

20:14.940 --> 20:17.620
correspondences.

20:17.620 --> 20:24.540
And he was key to developing a method of studying art through the patrons, through patronage,

20:24.540 --> 20:29.380
through study of pageantry and ritual at the time.

20:29.380 --> 20:36.420
And to come back to the point I began with, before the breakdown, he is so careful to

20:36.420 --> 20:43.660
establish this context, that the context was almost away, was both an advanced methodology

20:43.660 --> 20:49.900
for interpreting the image, but almost a way you can almost feel him trying to keep composed,

20:49.900 --> 21:00.300
trying to keep these ambivalent, conflicting issues he's dealing with, both within himself

21:00.300 --> 21:02.940
and culture, to find this balance.

21:02.940 --> 21:10.140
And it's fascinating to read his scholarly method as a way of sort of trying to keep himself

21:10.140 --> 21:12.380
together, and moving forward.

21:12.380 --> 21:18.900
And then comes the stage, right, where invention and investigation suddenly merge.

21:18.900 --> 21:19.900
Perhaps not.

21:19.900 --> 21:26.860
And he can say something about your argument, because it seems to me very important when

21:26.860 --> 21:36.020
he was in Yanai, after in Bins Van Gehr clinic at Kuy Tlingen, he has this problem that was

21:36.020 --> 21:45.580
very important for Bins Van Gehr, the flight of ideas, and too much meaning, everything

21:45.580 --> 21:53.580
in relation to everything, and to have a too big access to the meaning.

21:53.580 --> 22:02.900
And I asked me about the process of healing of Verburg.

22:02.900 --> 22:13.780
And we can say that the question of the details is very important, and it has something like,

22:13.780 --> 22:22.780
if we can say, metonymic style of thinking, thinking from the part to arrive to the global

22:22.780 --> 22:27.660
meaning, starting from the part, from the detail.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.660
The God is in the detail.

22:29.660 --> 22:36.460
It's the idea is like he was looking for a root of himself in the detail.

22:36.460 --> 22:44.500
And we have for one part, flight of ideas, and for the other part, metonymic style of

22:44.500 --> 22:55.460
thinking, interval, detail, the movement, the foot of the Ninfia Furentina, the foot of

22:55.460 --> 23:06.260
the Gardiva for Freud, the foot of the boys, moments of suspension, a rupture in the flight

23:06.260 --> 23:07.940
of ideas.

23:07.940 --> 23:18.580
And I think perhaps we can have the hypothesis that he cured himself using the interval, the

23:18.580 --> 23:29.340
suspension of the action, because he was in a flow of action, and all his intellectual

23:29.340 --> 23:36.300
work and intellectual creativity was here to stop these flight of ideas.

23:36.300 --> 23:46.660
And perhaps it is linked together in the process of creativity, process of scientific creativity

23:46.660 --> 23:49.820
of verbal.

23:49.820 --> 23:56.180
We think this frame of mind of trying to find parallels between artists and psychoanalysts.

23:56.180 --> 24:00.900
I would like to introduce a third term, which I think is absolutely crucial, and that's

24:00.900 --> 24:02.460
historiography.

24:02.460 --> 24:07.980
I think that both complicates and expands the whole frame of what we're discussing, because

24:07.980 --> 24:09.300
it's precisely historiography.

24:09.300 --> 24:14.900
There is the analysis of the historical, the art historical text in this case, which is

24:14.900 --> 24:18.540
the form of analysis, or even a psychoanalysis.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.340
And what I find very, very interesting in this case is that the art historian himself

24:23.340 --> 24:30.420
in Christling becomes an object of analysis by a psychoanalysis, namely Ben Swanger, who

24:30.420 --> 24:34.340
not only analyzes him, but also his writings.

24:34.340 --> 24:40.020
We know that he had read before he heard Christling in a famous lecture on the snake

24:40.020 --> 24:44.940
ritual that not heard he had read carefully his works.

24:44.940 --> 24:50.060
He mentioned Luther in his correspondence, which was just published in 1921, year before

24:50.060 --> 24:51.820
he arrived in Christlingen.

24:51.820 --> 24:55.700
In a letter he mentions the society essay of 1907.

24:55.700 --> 24:41.740
And from certain comments we definitely understand that he had read the dissertation on B

24:41.740 --> 24:42.740
it's telling.

24:42.740 --> 25:06.740
I'd like to bring one example, which is he, Ben Swanger's comment after Barbara gave

25:06.740 --> 25:13.180
his lecture on the image of the Pueblo in 1923.

25:13.180 --> 25:15.860
And his comment was rather dismissive.

25:15.860 --> 25:21.980
He was very critical that the lecture was almost chaotic in its structure.

25:21.980 --> 25:26.460
And of course, that Barbara was content and he was met with success.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.180
But he had a lot of criticisms.

25:28.180 --> 25:33.060
And in fact, he mentioned something that I find very symptomatic.

25:33.060 --> 25:39.700
He says that what he does is he covers everything with so much accessory element.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
And he calls that bivac.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.980
He uses the term.

25:42.980 --> 25:49.020
And the main events are left as philological illusions that very few people in the audience

25:49.020 --> 25:50.340
can understand.

25:50.340 --> 25:56.700
I think that's the most ingenious diagnosis that Ben Swanger ever had of Barbara, beyond

25:56.700 --> 26:02.260
his mental condition, but of his own work, even if he's critical and negative.

26:02.260 --> 26:05.740
Because that's precisely the core of Barbara's logic.

26:05.740 --> 26:13.140
That is to bring the accessory or the detail, as we said, that is so much used in second

26:13.140 --> 26:16.900
analytic interpretation to the very center of interpretation.

26:16.900 --> 26:21.300
But of course, he's right to say that things are covered by accessories.

26:21.300 --> 26:28.220
But then we can start asking ourselves, what's precisely the function of these accessory elements,

26:28.220 --> 26:32.540
both in Barbara's historiography, but also in Freud's analysis.

26:32.540 --> 26:40.300
For example, that to me, if I can make a parallel function similar to the role of screen memories,

26:40.300 --> 26:45.380
images that appear again and again, and cover the main facts.

26:45.380 --> 26:50.260
And yet the only access we have to the main facts are these screen memories.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.060
And we have to go and move through them.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.660
And usually there are certain details.

26:55.660 --> 27:00.820
There's an image of the little botanical specimen flower, which is connected to all

27:00.820 --> 27:01.820
these different things.

27:01.820 --> 27:08.100
And to the flower bouquet that Freud wanted to give you his life, to the little book that

27:08.100 --> 27:13.820
he had seen in a bookstore, and finally to Opium and Prokene, which is the main effect.

27:13.820 --> 27:18.300
But we were never have gone there without the image of the little flower.

27:18.300 --> 27:23.420
So I'm thinking, what if we think of images in these terms, in art history?

27:23.420 --> 27:29.100
And see what appears as an accessory element that covers things can also reveal them.

27:29.100 --> 27:39.060
Oh no, it's an excellent discussion, because it's also a discussion about a lesson of clinic.

27:39.060 --> 27:51.140
To treat a psychotic breakdown, it's not only to put it away, but to use the solutions of

27:51.140 --> 27:52.740
the subject.

27:52.740 --> 28:00.860
And here with detailed historiography, the context, all these kind of things we can postulate

28:00.860 --> 28:11.740
that Ben Zwanger used that to treat verbal, not treatment, putting away the symptoms, but

28:11.740 --> 28:21.060
treatment using the solution that opened the symptoms of the patient.

28:21.060 --> 28:24.780
And perhaps it was an important contribution.

28:24.780 --> 28:35.620
I know, for example, that Ben Zwanger proposed that to Prince Horne will come to his clinic

28:35.620 --> 28:44.580
to meet verbal and to discuss with him about creation and art and so on.

28:44.580 --> 28:50.940
The thing is that he gave Prince Horne's book on publication in 1922, and gave it to

28:50.940 --> 28:54.340
Ben Zwanger, to Barbara.

28:54.340 --> 28:59.180
This is what today you'd call a relational method of treatment.

28:59.180 --> 29:06.580
He also had Barbara to tea and to dinner with the family, which is the method he acquired

29:06.580 --> 29:13.580
from his teacher, Euigen Bloyler, used to bring patients in the Bergholsley, including

29:13.580 --> 29:20.380
Sabina Spielrine, and you find letters from Bloyler to Mrs. Spielrine and, rest of them,

29:20.380 --> 29:27.500
the Don about her behavior is much better today, and we had her to tea and so forth.

29:27.500 --> 29:36.980
And I think the very humanistic treatment, the reward, would be you get to go for a walk

29:36.980 --> 29:43.580
with Ben Zwanger and his son when the...

29:43.580 --> 29:50.260
...Stubborn wouldn't need his breakfast.

29:50.260 --> 29:51.900
Ben Zwanger laid down the rule.

29:51.900 --> 29:57.700
You have to eat your breakfast by ten o'clock, and then you can go for a walk with me and

29:57.700 --> 29:58.700
so on.

29:58.700 --> 30:03.940
Now, I question this idea of really psychosis and creativity.

30:03.940 --> 30:06.060
I don't think it's that simple.

30:06.060 --> 30:17.420
I think that Lawrence Kubi had a correct intuition when he went back past the structural model

30:17.420 --> 30:19.020
to the topographic model.

30:19.020 --> 30:27.660
He said there's something that happens between the unconscious, which admits ideas to the

30:27.660 --> 30:31.820
preconscious, and then you can work with them from the preconscious.

30:31.820 --> 30:36.700
He goes back to the early model, and that's his model of creativity.

30:36.700 --> 30:43.820
I think when you read Kafka, for example, he says, an artist cannot be alone enough,

30:43.820 --> 30:49.820
meaning he has to go inside deeply and bring it up and work with it.

30:49.820 --> 30:59.740
Now, Warburg was not particularly creative after release from the Croitsling, and he gave

30:59.740 --> 31:04.980
a couple of addresses, talks to opening Congresses and so on.

31:04.980 --> 31:16.940
But there's another kind of creativity that psychoanalysis, free sexuality, and Warburg

31:16.940 --> 31:24.220
was able to enjoy a relationship with his assistant, Gertrude, and they went to Rome

31:24.220 --> 31:27.380
several times, long trips to Italy.

31:27.380 --> 31:37.300
There's a downside to that, that he necessarily, not necessarily strike that, that he didn't

31:37.300 --> 31:40.020
remain attentive to his family.

31:40.020 --> 31:46.980
When his wife writes, what shall we give the children for holiday?

31:46.980 --> 31:48.500
He's dismissive.

31:48.500 --> 31:51.220
Buy them whatever they want.

31:51.220 --> 32:02.300
But we have ample record that there he was in Roma and in Italy having a very good time.

32:02.300 --> 32:08.740
I suggest there's a new release of a sexual freedom that came out of his treatment.

32:08.740 --> 32:19.860
The harsh underside of European culture, remember that charming anecdote that in 1929, when

32:19.860 --> 32:27.660
the Pope signed the Concordot with Mussolini, and it meant that Catholic instruction would

32:27.660 --> 32:34.180
be given in schools and across in all the classrooms in the secular kingdom of Italy,

32:34.180 --> 32:42.740
which since 1871 had been secular, there was great activity on the streets of Roma, and

32:42.740 --> 32:47.340
they told him, don't go out, it's dangerous for foreigners, you don't know what's going

32:47.340 --> 32:48.620
to happen.

32:48.620 --> 32:54.340
He stayed out all day and half the night and came back and he said, you know, I've been

32:54.340 --> 33:01.540
studying the primitive underside of European culture for 40 years, and now you deny me

33:01.540 --> 33:07.020
the chance to see the rebirth of the primitive here in Rome.

33:07.020 --> 33:15.660
It was, I think, what he's looking for in culture, the primitive underside.

33:15.660 --> 33:25.340
And Freud also incidentally found this in himself during World War I, terrible.

33:25.340 --> 33:31.140
There was, mentioned yesterday, I think it was Diddy Huberman, that you could send a

33:31.140 --> 33:38.060
letter from belligerent Italy to Austria and vice versa.

33:38.060 --> 33:44.780
I don't know what his data is, but Freud's correspondence with Binswonger, detailed,

33:44.780 --> 33:57.020
how after the war, his son is still in captivity, in the Abruzzi, he's wounded, he's in a

33:57.020 --> 34:02.420
hospital, he's lost his pack, and Freud cannot communicate with him.

34:02.420 --> 34:08.180
All they had was a postcard from the Red Cross, and so Freud writes to Binswonger, and it's

34:08.180 --> 34:11.300
a long correspondence about this.

34:11.300 --> 34:17.380
If you are in neutral Switzerland, you can get money to him, please help him.

34:17.380 --> 34:25.100
And in fact, Binswonger did that, sent 500 Swiss francs to Martin, and we have Martin's

34:25.100 --> 34:30.540
memoirs, where he said, due to my father's excellent international collections, I was

34:30.540 --> 34:36.220
able to buy drinks for all the other prisoners.

34:36.220 --> 34:45.260
Now that's the ego functioning of a very good father, but in himself, Freud discovers.

34:45.260 --> 34:51.580
You remember the dream, which he, fortunately for us, the interpretation of dreams is something

34:51.580 --> 34:54.420
that he revised and added to.

34:54.420 --> 35:01.500
It's in the chapter on wish fulfillment in dreams, as a dream of 1919.

35:01.500 --> 35:11.780
Take a look at it, the text by the manifest, let me just tell you about the, the manifest

35:11.780 --> 35:21.700
content is that he gets a check and says to his wife, this is dream content, what is this,

35:21.700 --> 35:22.700
5000 croner?

35:22.700 --> 35:25.100
Do you know anything about it?

35:25.100 --> 35:26.100
And she said, no.

35:26.100 --> 35:36.860
And he said, well, we received this, an association, that's what a unit sends to the family of

35:36.860 --> 35:40.780
killed soldiers, under of a seer.

35:40.780 --> 35:50.260
And so then later in the dream, he sees a bandaged man reach for something up in a cupboard, and

35:50.260 --> 35:53.220
he says, can I help you and the man doesn't answer.

35:53.220 --> 36:00.700
That's the manifest content and the latent content that he then associates to is who doesn't

36:00.700 --> 36:05.260
answer, the dead don't answer.

36:05.260 --> 36:08.860
And he brings about the death of his son.

36:08.860 --> 36:13.460
I think the relation between manifest and latent content, you can see it in verbous historiography

36:13.460 --> 36:17.300
itself, that is, especially towards his sources.

36:17.300 --> 36:22.260
I wanted to mention Freud, for example, he does not appear in any of the published sources,

36:22.260 --> 36:28.780
but so do not appear at the people like Darwin or Vignonle that were important to him.

36:28.780 --> 36:34.660
So it's precisely his notes, the things that are today kept in the title custom that give

36:34.660 --> 36:39.220
us a much more complete idea of what he had read.

36:39.220 --> 36:43.100
And they give us the background beyond what has been published.

36:43.100 --> 36:47.940
And also, it's your remark that, well, he didn't do much after he came back, he did

36:47.940 --> 36:48.940
a lot.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.220
But no publication, you're right.

36:52.220 --> 36:53.220
Nothing was published.

36:53.220 --> 36:57.660
But he gave lectures, he gave courses, he gave a nice exhibition.

36:57.660 --> 37:02.660
And also, the work of our book throughout his life, even before the collabs, was precisely

37:02.660 --> 37:05.060
that of making research.

37:05.060 --> 37:08.180
And the research would not always lead to a publication.

37:08.180 --> 37:13.980
There are hundreds of unfinished lectures, just for the sake of research that are there,

37:13.980 --> 37:17.740
and somebody else perhaps later will come and finish them and publish them.

37:17.740 --> 37:18.740
Exactly.

37:18.740 --> 37:19.740
Yeah.

37:19.740 --> 37:20.740
And they'll be very happy.

37:20.740 --> 37:24.620
And I also wanted to mention, in terms of its relation to Freud, that's also a big

37:24.620 --> 37:28.860
mystery, because there are very few notes on Freud in the title guest.

37:28.860 --> 37:49.360
And I looked at it two or three, one of the town do

37:49.360 --> 37:54.100
one thing, okay, we know he didn't have his books with him at the time.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.100
Couldn't he ask his finger?

37:55.100 --> 37:58.900
You know, his finger had all the Freud's work at the time.

37:58.900 --> 38:05.820
So I really want to ask what the phrase I miss Freud taught him in taboo.

38:05.820 --> 38:06.820
And which chapter?

38:06.820 --> 38:08.540
The third chapter on animism?

38:08.540 --> 38:14.700
Or the second chapter on prohibition, or the killing of the father on the fourth?

38:14.700 --> 38:20.820
All of these issues, that as I say, Freud is somewhat a latent content in verbal.

38:20.820 --> 38:26.420
That's why we were also happy when the new Vermont book came out and made these connections

38:26.420 --> 38:28.460
manifest at that time.

38:28.460 --> 38:31.860
And I think the relation to psychonality is important there.

38:31.860 --> 38:37.860
But that's, I would say, the latent connection to all sorts of different authors and writings

38:37.860 --> 38:40.060
is an element of verbal.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.540
And also how he converts everything.

38:42.540 --> 38:49.020
I would not call Varebuk, either like Freudian or Davidian or anything.

38:49.020 --> 38:53.060
Anything that he takes from other authors, he totally metabolizes it.

38:53.060 --> 39:03.540
There's a huge distance between him, which is I think a thinking distance.

39:03.540 --> 39:15.020
An analogy which has to be limited in encountering Warburg as a scholar and the methods he used,

39:15.020 --> 39:23.100
I thought of a completely different type of historian, the completely different vision.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.420
And it was E.P. Thompson.

39:25.420 --> 39:32.060
Only because once E.P. Thompson was asked, how would you define your method as a historian?

39:32.060 --> 39:35.660
And his answer was anything that works.

39:35.660 --> 39:40.300
And I think that sums up E.P. Thompson brilliantly.

39:40.300 --> 39:44.940
That was his mindset.

39:44.940 --> 39:53.060
And you read through Warburg's pre-1923 writings and even the Hopi lecture.

39:53.060 --> 39:57.500
He was willing to try anything that worked.

39:57.500 --> 40:03.820
And I think that it's very significant to keep in mind when thinking about why discuss

40:03.820 --> 40:08.740
Warburg in connection with psychoanalysis, with neuroscience.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.980
I keep going back to the method.

40:11.980 --> 40:20.140
And the theories, I find they can be inspirational.

40:20.140 --> 40:26.100
But for people who are pursuing work from different disciplines, I think it's the methodological

40:26.100 --> 40:31.220
spirit, the methodological activity that seems so crucial.

40:31.220 --> 40:37.500
When he says, you know, God's within the detail, when Freud talks about the importance of detail,

40:37.500 --> 40:46.660
I also think, for example, of a neuroscientist, right, Erkendell, who in search of memory described

40:46.660 --> 40:52.220
that, you know, his methodology was one cell at a time.

40:52.220 --> 40:53.900
One cell at a time.

40:53.900 --> 41:02.460
And that's not so far removed from Warburg and that in that early 20th century approach.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.580
You know, one detail at a time.

41:04.580 --> 41:10.740
Now what Warburg found in the sort of detail of the nymph, right, I just add to follow

41:10.740 --> 41:16.140
up on where there could be intersection and instinct theory.

41:16.140 --> 41:20.420
Warburg also found death in the nymph.

41:20.420 --> 41:24.500
Not just the sort of return of the repressed, but death.

41:24.500 --> 41:29.220
And I think it's possible to compare, for example, what he was doing in interpreting

41:29.220 --> 41:34.580
the Botticelli with what Freud was doing in the theme of the three caskets and interpreting

41:34.580 --> 41:40.500
the fates and interpreting, especially Cordelia in the end, that this too, I mean, Shakespeare

41:40.500 --> 41:43.300
was Renaissance in that sense.

41:43.300 --> 41:51.420
And Cordelia, you know, is in a sense Freud's nymph as Grediva was.

41:51.420 --> 41:54.940
And Cordelia is death.

41:54.940 --> 41:59.340
And represented very much, very similarly in the sort of mental image, which is another

41:59.340 --> 42:00.620
issue that I thought would be interesting.

42:00.620 --> 42:06.260
You know, Warburg's, you know, that the image that we see is also accompanied by mental

42:06.260 --> 42:08.100
image that has to be understood.

42:08.100 --> 42:17.740
But the, those links as well, but methodologically, I think, yes, if one wants to build upon Warburg,

42:17.740 --> 42:20.940
I think one turns to the methodology.

42:20.940 --> 42:26.620
But that's speaking from someone who comes at it as a historian, and neither an art historian

42:26.620 --> 42:27.620
nor psychologist.

42:27.620 --> 42:37.860
I wouldn't have if you'd agree that the Croydselian lecture, the method is presendges, Fernand

42:37.860 --> 42:44.100
Braudel, and the method we call Anal today.

42:44.100 --> 42:47.380
The environment, the climate, the really.

42:47.380 --> 42:49.380
That's very, yes, there's elements of that.

42:49.380 --> 42:53.740
The first time that you use the term oovald, right, which is very negative.

42:53.740 --> 43:01.820
I think it's an important field of research in this conference, is the research conference

43:01.820 --> 43:10.220
that we have to work about it, because it's not for me important to know if Freud was before

43:10.220 --> 43:14.860
or marble before, or the marble knows Freud and so on.

43:14.860 --> 43:25.380
But we have the same questions at stake in the same moment, and in different fields of

43:25.380 --> 43:26.380
research.

43:26.380 --> 43:30.620
It's very, something very impressive for an historical point of view.

43:30.620 --> 43:35.660
Why do you have, simultaneously, Freud?

43:35.660 --> 43:40.780
Why not the so-so for the question of the meaning in Geneva?

43:40.780 --> 43:45.020
You have Schoenberg changing completely the music.

43:45.020 --> 43:47.500
You have Cézanne in painting.

43:47.500 --> 43:52.060
You have a simultaneous change in different fields.

43:52.060 --> 43:57.740
And for me, it's very surprising, very, very strange.

43:57.740 --> 44:04.260
Even if they don't know them between.

44:04.260 --> 44:10.540
I don't know for historical point of view, what is this kind of simultaneity?

44:10.540 --> 44:15.620
Paul Ombart had the idea of an encounter between different intellectual living at the same

44:15.620 --> 44:21.580
time, discussing what will be the discussion between, we have to create the discussion between

44:21.580 --> 44:29.700
Freud and Verborg about detail, if you have a prior fiction.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.700
They come together.

44:31.700 --> 44:42.460
It's not me and you, it's Freud and Binswanger and Verborg discussing about the function

44:42.460 --> 44:50.660
of metonymic thinking in the analysis of detail in clinic and history of art.

44:50.660 --> 44:54.060
We are in this kind of situation.

44:54.060 --> 45:00.700
The other question that was presented about the tournament taboo, I miss my tournament

45:00.700 --> 45:04.900
taboo, is fascinating and my association would be to murder.

45:04.900 --> 45:10.700
It's the murder of sons and then the murder of the father and this is something he was

45:10.700 --> 45:15.340
very obsessed with.

45:15.340 --> 45:25.180
The outbreak of the psychosis was getting a pistol in Homburg, 1921, 18, but it's not

45:25.180 --> 45:33.140
a country that had the Second Amendment and weapons all over the place.

45:33.140 --> 45:39.540
He was afraid of murders, of his family, of himself and so on.

45:39.540 --> 45:42.020
Tournament taboo, it's a wonderful.

45:42.020 --> 45:49.220
The other question about your president discussion is the fact that for me I had the impression

45:49.220 --> 46:03.540
like you said that Verborg, after the breakdown after the clinic of Binswanger between 1924

46:03.540 --> 46:08.660
and the death in 1929, had a very important creative work.

46:08.660 --> 46:10.180
After life, ready to be.

46:10.180 --> 46:11.180
Exactly.

46:11.180 --> 46:12.180
Reanimated.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.100
Yes, have the impression of that.

46:14.100 --> 46:15.580
It is the second language.

46:15.580 --> 46:22.540
The library, the nemosign, all these research we discussed yesterday was very central after

46:22.540 --> 46:25.300
this experience of psychosis.

46:25.300 --> 46:27.900
What you see is a kind of condensation of the things.

46:27.900 --> 46:34.660
He goes back to the early things, even the Bodicelli and others, and condenses and I

46:34.660 --> 46:37.180
don't want to say systematizes.

46:37.180 --> 46:39.940
Somehow he puts together in the Nemo Ximian, Atlas, etc.

46:39.940 --> 46:44.660
All of these themes that come back with all the Bodicelli and others and some new ones

46:44.660 --> 46:51.540
such as Northern Renaissance, Baroque art that he never had touched before.

46:51.540 --> 46:58.740
So, he revisits his own work with a new point of view.

46:58.740 --> 47:03.540
I want to mention one other detail in the Kreuzlingen lecture.

47:03.540 --> 47:10.180
There's one word that comes up and it's the only pathological one and it's the term schizoid

47:10.180 --> 47:13.500
in the very second page of the published text.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.820
And he says that to us, and that's a critique.

47:16.820 --> 47:21.740
I don't know who he means us, the westerners, the audience, etc.

47:21.740 --> 47:29.260
This dual practice between fantastic magic and sober perpersonist seems to be the symptom

47:29.260 --> 47:31.340
of a cleavage.

47:31.340 --> 47:36.500
But to the Indian, this is not schizoid, that he uses the term schizoid, but the sign of

47:36.500 --> 47:41.020
an endless communicability with the environment.

47:41.020 --> 47:45.260
So this is one time, and I don't know who he refers to.

47:45.260 --> 47:55.140
The Indians, himself, it's one of these really dramatic moments that his own state and the

47:55.140 --> 48:00.460
state of an entire culture that is considered schizoid, and that's his accusation.

48:00.460 --> 48:03.300
This is not schizoid.

48:03.300 --> 48:09.780
And that also sounds less far-book and more, I would say, Ben Zwanger of the phenomenological

48:09.780 --> 48:14.180
era, the endless communicability with the environment.

48:14.180 --> 48:16.180
That's not for the audience.

48:16.180 --> 48:21.620
The Freud would consider the finely-hish oomphat, the hostile environment that we have to protect

48:21.620 --> 48:22.620
ourselves.

48:22.620 --> 48:28.620
It's a very interesting remark, and perhaps you can say something about that through your

48:28.620 --> 48:35.740
work about verbal, because I was surprised that in the beginning, and it is also present

48:35.740 --> 48:46.060
in the letter of Ben Zwanger to Freud in November 1921 for Ben Zwanger for a verb was a schizophrenic

48:46.060 --> 48:47.060
patient.

48:47.060 --> 48:55.340
In the School of Zurich, Bergelsli, he looked at the pre-senial delirium and something

48:55.340 --> 48:58.460
like a schizophrenia.

48:58.460 --> 49:09.220
And after the consultation of Kraplin in 1923, I think, Kraplin said it's not schizophrenic,

49:09.220 --> 49:18.060
it is an endless flight of ideas, a mania.

49:18.060 --> 49:25.220
He said it is a mixed mania codepressive state with a very good pronostic.

49:25.220 --> 49:36.660
And after this diagnosis of Kraplin, the vision of Ben Zwanger about verbal changed completely,

49:36.660 --> 49:45.540
and the evolution of, like if it was a change of paradigm, suddenly a change of paradigm,

49:45.540 --> 49:50.900
for Ben Zwanger, for the clinic, but also for verbal game self.

49:50.900 --> 49:56.820
But it is why it is very good that they prepared this book about the different documents with

49:56.820 --> 50:00.500
the idea of endless healing.

50:00.500 --> 50:09.060
It's a flight of ideas, the flight of ideas become an endless healing.

50:09.060 --> 50:14.660
But I think there's a consensus, I'm hearing a consensus that was a successful treatment,

50:14.660 --> 50:22.980
that there's a reconstitution, and whether this is a new burst of creativity, I don't

50:22.980 --> 50:23.980
think so.

50:23.980 --> 50:31.700
I'm building the library, an obsessively building the library was a major feat in Hamburg and

50:31.700 --> 50:39.180
the details of the architecture and that they had tubes to send things from top to bottom

50:39.180 --> 50:40.180
and so on.

50:40.180 --> 50:46.700
So, I think it's a lovely building, which, do you know the, bibliotheca, John Giacomo

50:46.700 --> 50:53.220
Feltronelli in Milan, the dome with the lights coming through?

50:53.220 --> 51:01.540
That's what it reminded me of, the photographs that we've seen.

51:01.540 --> 51:06.620
What you point to is something to focus on about his post-Cortslingen life.

51:06.620 --> 51:10.900
It's interesting also to think about in light of the library, because Warburg in the library

51:10.900 --> 51:18.860
was to create a kind of community, so to speak, for himself, that he could not create for himself

51:18.860 --> 51:25.740
in the outside world and maybe began to, you know, very, very late, too late in the 20s.

51:25.740 --> 51:29.820
But when you think about how he thought of that library and the phrase he used to describe

51:29.820 --> 51:36.580
to his principal organization the Good Companion, I mean when you think about Warburg's scholarship

51:36.580 --> 51:44.300
and then that term put books next to Good Companions.

51:44.300 --> 51:52.940
That's a very different attitude now and it's not unscholatively, but it's an idea of what

51:52.940 --> 51:57.940
he's doing through his scholarship that is sort of a search for kind of community, that

51:57.940 --> 52:02.420
by putting these books together, by putting these books together, he can be, he's in some

52:02.420 --> 52:08.660
way putting the people together, and that he's communicating with them and it should be Good

52:08.660 --> 52:14.780
Companions and that makes it natural, not artificial.

52:14.780 --> 52:19.940
And to use the word natural to describe what Warburg does is very difficult at that time

52:19.940 --> 52:27.380
because it is so, you know, because his search for composure is so complete, but there in

52:27.380 --> 52:33.900
the library, right, this community that he creates for himself, one has to try to imagine,

52:33.900 --> 52:37.620
you know, what it, you can't, you can imagine what it might have felt like, but I think

52:37.620 --> 52:40.660
any scholar would be able to appreciate that.

52:40.660 --> 52:44.900
That's something that doesn't distance us from Warburg.

52:44.900 --> 52:52.940
And one more point having to do with how one finds, again, in the method an access to or

52:52.940 --> 53:00.540
at least a way of thinking about his sort of relationship to the world and to himself,

53:00.540 --> 53:05.180
when Warburg goes in search of the documents, you know, when he goes in search of family

53:05.180 --> 53:09.980
documents and business documents, I mean, he reads the accounts, you know, he's reading

53:09.980 --> 53:15.060
the bank, the business accounts and the family memoirs.

53:15.060 --> 53:24.980
Now I'm trying to picture Warburg handling the documents that were written by or being

53:24.980 --> 53:30.140
in proximity of the documents of the people that created them.

53:30.140 --> 53:35.700
And when he spoke about the artist sort of reviving antiquity, for him he thought that

53:35.700 --> 53:40.060
the artist was putting himself in some kind of danger, so to speak, that there could be

53:40.060 --> 53:45.340
some kind of spark, right, that would set something off, that there was some ego issue

53:45.340 --> 53:46.780
that could result.

53:46.780 --> 53:50.300
Well now Warburg is with these documents.

53:50.300 --> 53:54.700
And I just try to picture myself, all right, I mean now, again, methodologically, right,

53:54.700 --> 53:59.620
he's putting himself into proximity with these documents.

53:59.620 --> 54:01.100
What is going on when he does that?

54:01.100 --> 54:03.100
I have no idea.

54:03.100 --> 54:09.620
But he was very, very intent, right, on being with the documents.

54:09.620 --> 54:13.300
And I think that was something that was even very different from other art historians at

54:13.300 --> 54:15.900
the time who emphasized the same kind of procedure.

54:15.900 --> 54:22.140
Are you almost implying that there was a self-healing strategy in this piece?

54:22.140 --> 54:23.140
Perhaps.

54:23.140 --> 54:24.140
I mean, I'm not going to.

54:24.140 --> 54:26.820
I think that it was a self-healing strategy.

54:26.820 --> 54:33.780
But I think also that Binswang had used the self-healing strategy of Warburg.

54:33.780 --> 54:36.420
This is very important.

54:36.420 --> 54:48.500
Perhaps the documents, the metonymic interest for details, the metonymic style of thinking,

54:48.500 --> 54:54.380
the question of movement, of inhibition of movement, as we discussed yesterday, is very

54:54.380 --> 55:06.340
important for Warburg himself to stop something which is in too much excitation.

55:06.340 --> 55:12.740
So psychometric excitation.

55:12.740 --> 55:16.020
Excess of the leaving.

55:16.020 --> 55:17.460
Excess of meaning.

55:17.460 --> 55:22.300
Excess of the signals of the body, perhaps.

55:22.300 --> 55:27.140
And for him, perhaps the document was like a rupture.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.460
But I think it also was a risk.

55:29.460 --> 55:31.460
He was willing to undergo in some sense.

55:31.460 --> 55:34.580
In other words, a risk he had to take.

55:34.580 --> 55:37.420
I'm getting them, speculation.

55:37.420 --> 55:42.300
In other words, the two aren't, they're not opposed interpretations.

55:42.300 --> 55:47.380
But to undergo healing, you have to take a risk.

55:47.380 --> 55:53.740
And there was always, just as in the image, as healing for the artist entails a risk.

55:53.740 --> 55:57.260
And the risk that the artist took, he's taking with the documents.

55:57.260 --> 55:58.260
Or I'm completely wrong.

55:58.260 --> 56:05.300
That's not a reflection about treatment of psychosis, because to use the solution of

56:05.300 --> 56:14.620
the subject, the invention of the subject, as it is for one part risk and for one part

56:14.620 --> 56:15.620
an issue.

56:15.620 --> 56:21.420
And we have this difficult way.

56:21.420 --> 56:26.460
I think it was really important in the strategy of Bin Suang-e.

56:26.460 --> 56:32.300
I think in that question of dealing with documents, I think he tweets both documents,

56:32.300 --> 56:36.980
papers, either historical documents or even books, contemporary books.

56:36.980 --> 56:41.340
And he's encountered with people in the same way as encounters.

56:41.340 --> 56:45.020
For example, the first time he reads Darwin, he puts in his diary.

56:45.020 --> 56:51.700
30 years later, he's going in the front cover of the book and write that I read this in

56:51.700 --> 56:56.420
1989 and when I first read it, I thought that's finally a book that helps me.

56:56.420 --> 57:01.980
So it's an encounter that he goes back to again and again, as if the book was a real

57:01.980 --> 57:02.980
person.

57:02.980 --> 57:09.900
As Richard Vigo recently wrote an article about a bar books reading of Darwin.

57:09.900 --> 57:15.500
And the next day, he was reading that for two days in Florence in the library, the next

57:15.500 --> 57:18.220
day he meets his wife for the first time.

57:18.220 --> 57:24.380
And he leaves Darwin because he notes, finishes, and he plays the Ciceroana with Mary.

57:24.380 --> 57:25.740
So what does this mean?

57:25.740 --> 57:30.820
The most important book that I have read so far, and then the next day I meet the most

57:30.820 --> 57:32.540
important person in my life.

57:32.540 --> 57:39.100
I think psychoanalysts could, you know, put this sort of coincidence that happens at

57:39.100 --> 57:40.100
a time.

57:40.100 --> 57:41.580
And, you know, it's a periodic one.

57:41.580 --> 57:46.780
I even think, and somebody said it yesterday, you know, he had to visit the Pueblo as if

57:46.780 --> 57:50.300
it was a document, you know, and he reads them as documents.

57:50.300 --> 57:55.780
And in fact, it's sometimes when we look at the notes, we don't know some of his sketches

57:55.780 --> 57:57.100
of pottery, for example.

57:57.100 --> 57:59.900
Did he see that live or did he see it from a book?

57:59.900 --> 58:03.900
Because he also goes to the Smithsonian and other sources to look at books.

58:03.900 --> 58:10.820
So it's a scholarly research and people, life people, real people, and historical sources

58:10.820 --> 58:14.460
somehow come together in literary sources.

58:14.460 --> 58:21.820
And even, and that would be the most extreme argument that could make, is that his visit

58:21.820 --> 58:28.580
to Christ again, in Bellevue, somehow ultimately acts as this encounter with the very things

58:28.580 --> 58:33.940
that he was researching his entire life, that is, madness, irrationality, et cetera.

58:33.940 --> 58:39.580
I'm not saying that he pursued that visit, but in the end that's how it functions.

58:39.580 --> 58:45.100
There's almost an implication in what you're saying in terms of his encounter with books

58:45.100 --> 58:52.700
and objects that almost a retention of the ability to animate the inanimate that is a

58:52.700 --> 59:02.140
quality that people like Greenacre attributed to highly creative people, that what is so

59:02.140 --> 59:07.420
immediately available to us in early childhood to sort of take the inanimate and in some way

59:07.420 --> 59:11.660
make it animated or to anthropomorphize, you know, all living things.

59:11.660 --> 59:17.340
I would say even the relationship between the books that you mentioned, it's fairly, if

59:17.340 --> 59:19.100
not animistic, tautomistic.

59:19.100 --> 59:23.540
That is, you have all the books on the snake right next to the books on the ego and right

59:23.540 --> 59:25.620
next to another bird, et cetera, et cetera.

59:25.620 --> 59:31.660
So there is this totemic affinity in analogy between the books, which some time you can

59:31.660 --> 59:33.500
rearrange in new analogies.

59:33.500 --> 59:34.500
Right.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.500
Pre-corresponder.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.820
I've been to a new world.

59:37.820 --> 59:45.620
I contiguity, and not continuity, introducing a discontinuity, because what is surprising

59:45.620 --> 59:55.280
with Warburg in the library of Warburg in my impression is that it's not a psychotic confusion.

59:55.280 --> 01:00:05.220
It is in production tensions, rupture, contradiction, details in the process of the book.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:13.740
The process of the organization of the library, also in the iconology, if the image was a

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:20.100
stop, an open question, an enigma, and not a source of confusion.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:26.260
And perhaps in the process of healing, it was a decisive moment when it was not in the

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:34.740
flight of ideas and confusion, and he opposed something which is suspension, fracture, tension,

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.300
and rupture, contradiction.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:45.500
And it was his way of breaking what he thought were artificial, even, unproductive boundaries

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:47.220
between disciplines.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:55.060
I mean, the catalog of the Good Companion meant as a methodological result is that books

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.980
from entirely different disciplines were going to be found next to each other.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:08.940
And to my mind, again, in a conference like this, that was Warburg's sort of truly kind

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:18.180
of prescient step, that this is an alternative organization, and we must begin to conceive

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.140
of this interdisciplinarity.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:28.420
At a time when he probably felt very constrained by that, there was no clear method forward,

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:35.020
although in a few years Freud would found him ago, psychoanalysis applied to all of the

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.220
Geysys Viscenschaft and all the humanities and social sciences.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:43.540
But Warburg himself in that library was his way of trying to create a framework for doing

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:50.540
what so many people now across disciplines conceive of as necessary.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.540
Yes.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:02:00.380
But the question remains why these kind of solutions of invention were finally discovery.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:06.420
For me, it's very mysterious, from invention to discovery.

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:14.420
But I think one of the things that I want to pick up about the treatment, I think it was

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:21.300
successful, and I think it's significant of Franz Juaz, which you point out that Ben Zwanger

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.300
was quite pessimistic.

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:28.700
He said, in fact, it's hopeless in 1921 and that there's a move.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:38.620
Now Freud and Bloyler told us, and there's a psychodynamic truth in it, that behind every

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:46.860
psychosis there's a kernel of truth, something happened, something that we can get at if

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:53.780
you listen properly, get into the phenomenological world of the patient.

01:02:53.780 --> 01:03:09.260
Now one of the things in his delusions was murders, recounted briefly that he was very

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.260
concerned.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:21.700
He had a big cartai of all the Jewish persecutions and the blood ritual murder in the barber archives.

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.820
It's there.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:29.620
And one of his charges against Ben Zwanger was he wants to murder the Jews.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.860
Comes up several times.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:47.620
And I think this psychosis of murder and in the delusions in Croitslingen, he says, this

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:54.180
male orderly is the one who poisons me every morning.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:04:04.060
And this idea that his family is in another pavilion in Croitslingen and being tortured

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.660
and held captive.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:12.300
Even on these walks with Ben Zwanger, he would walk up to the other pavilion and knock on

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:16.940
the door and ask for his wife Mary.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:24.780
So you've got a re-emergence in life of some of these early fantasies.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:35.980
And they get, I think it was a phenomenological treatment of a person that was successful.

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:39.660
And you can see Ben Zwanger working with him as a...

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:47.380
When I read the clean go, history is put together wonderfully by David Stemmily who should be

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:48.380
here in fact.

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:52.020
He has published that history in Italian, France and in German.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.100
Is the extreme ambivalence, indeed, towards the end?

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.060
There's always a treatment, right?

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.980
Sometimes he's devil, sometimes he's the healer as clippiest, which is inevitable, right?

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:04.180
In every type of treatment.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:13.660
And then there's a very amicable correspondence after he returns to Hamburg at that point.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:21.780
So, and I think that all of these fears somehow don't get resolved, but somehow the object

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:27.500
that embodies the ambivalence is basically the snake in the lecture, right?

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:32.580
The snake is both a healer and the awful snake that belongs to the fire.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.580
And he changes.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.340
Those are the film yesterday.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:40.340
There are some wonderful snakes, but they're not rattlesnakes from...

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:46.300
But it was wonderful in the film, it was an image of the actual capella in the Käuslingen

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.100
that has precisely the presentation of the presenters.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:54.460
And we know that he in fact visited the chapel and he saw that.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.820
But it's interesting how this little object, again I don't want to call it a detail, but

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:04.580
this small, cannot become the cause of all evil or good, etc.

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:11.700
But everything can be condensed to it and somehow present some kind of resolution through

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.500
that lecture, which is not exactly a snake ritual.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.420
The editors call this flag and went to our, but it's just an image.

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:26.500
Yes, the writing of the memories by Schreber was a solution for Schreber.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:31.540
The conference about snake ritual was a solution for Wehrberg.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:38.220
But we are at the end of the roundtable, I think, but perhaps it will be a possibility

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.220
to do another roundtable about transference.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:47.060
Because if we are talking about clinic, it's also the difficult question of transference

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.220
in psychotic patients.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:54.660
And here it is transference with Binsfanger and the clinic, but also transference of Binsfanger

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.380
with pride and the question of the correspondence.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.180
And it's a lot of people included like in the culture.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:09.540
We find the same inclusion of the thing in another semantic field.

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:14.540
It's a wonderful way to end the roundtable, to pose questions for the future.

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:17.860
And we're going to have the question period in the afternoon.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:22.460
We're going to take a 15-minute break and then the memory roundtable is going to convene.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.060
So thank you all for having me.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060
OK.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:53.020
Thank you.
