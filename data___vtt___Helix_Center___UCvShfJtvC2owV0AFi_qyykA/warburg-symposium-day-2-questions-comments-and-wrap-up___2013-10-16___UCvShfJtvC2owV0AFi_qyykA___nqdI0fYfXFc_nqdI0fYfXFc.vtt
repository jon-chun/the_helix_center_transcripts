WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Can you give me, is it on?

00:04.320 --> 00:05.400
OK.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.160
So I thought, what we'll do for the wrap up,

00:09.160 --> 00:14.440
anybody who is sitting on this, in this round area,

00:14.440 --> 00:17.400
you would all participants in the meeting in the round table.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.320
So if you have any ideas, thoughts,

00:20.320 --> 00:23.080
that you feel you didn't get a chance to express properly

00:23.080 --> 00:26.240
or any conclusions you draw or any questions you have,

00:26.240 --> 00:29.200
this is the time to discuss that.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.640
And then after a brief period of time,

00:32.640 --> 00:35.720
we'll see if there are any questions from the remaining

00:35.720 --> 00:37.960
audience, and then that's it.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.960
So Siri.

00:41.960 --> 00:47.320
Yeah, I have a question for the psychosis,

00:47.320 --> 00:50.400
then Swangah people, and actually anyone else

00:50.400 --> 00:51.880
who wants to contribute.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.360
And there are two points.

00:54.360 --> 01:03.440
One is relating the bipolarity of Valbox thinking

01:03.440 --> 01:06.800
to or the continuum from one pole to another

01:06.800 --> 01:10.880
to the psychotic disorder and manic depression.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.920
And the other thing that's very interesting,

01:14.920 --> 01:17.280
and I know someone who may answer this,

01:17.280 --> 01:21.120
is the question of cosmology and psychosis.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.840
When I was teaching writing as a volunteer

01:24.840 --> 01:28.880
at the Payne-Whitney Psychiatric Clinic for almost four years,

01:28.880 --> 01:32.160
a lot of psychotic patients in my classes,

01:32.160 --> 01:38.920
and they were highly cosmological thinkers.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.680
And I mean, they would bring together

01:40.680 --> 01:44.160
all kinds of different cosmologies into one,

01:44.160 --> 01:46.760
and write about it was very interesting.

01:46.760 --> 01:51.560
So I wanted to know from scientists and psychoanalysts

01:51.560 --> 01:55.680
like what the connection between cosmology,

01:55.680 --> 01:59.000
psychosis, and Valbox.

01:59.000 --> 01:59.440
That's it.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
That's it.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.440
That's it.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.720
I think more than that.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.160
Paul, once more, that's your number.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.960
You are the psychiatrist.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.640
Yes, for the first question, I think

02:18.640 --> 02:23.040
I discussed this morning together.

02:23.040 --> 02:28.440
It is the relation to the meaning, to the excess of the meaning.

02:28.440 --> 02:37.160
And we can discuss the psychosis like I said,

02:37.160 --> 02:43.080
la con, an anacroncion a ciluver, an open sky unconscious.

02:43.080 --> 02:48.040
With the direct access to the things in other schools,

02:48.040 --> 02:52.680
we can speak about symbolic equation.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.200
It is the fact that for us, for neurotic,

02:56.200 --> 02:59.120
it's very difficult to interpret the world.

02:59.120 --> 03:04.240
But for a psychotic, he has a direct access to the meaning.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.440
But it is for psychotic.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.360
This is for psychotic in general.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.080
For bipolar is also the question of humor,

03:13.080 --> 03:09.760
the

03:15.240 --> 03:16.240
depression.

03:16.240 --> 03:22.520
For me, for Warburg, it's difficult to do really the

03:22.520 --> 03:23.520
difference.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.800
Because the time of Warburg to say it is a mannequin

03:27.800 --> 03:32.600
depressive psychosis, it was a psychotic structure.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.800
And if we see the different description of Warburg

03:37.800 --> 03:44.480
states during the clinic at Binswanger, he was really in

03:44.480 --> 03:51.240
a psychotic access with delirium, with psychotic anxiety,

03:51.240 --> 03:57.800
with new world, with persecution, with projection,

03:57.800 --> 04:01.720
with dissociation.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.520
The question remains the same that we discussed this morning.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.200
Why invites this kind of state?

04:09.200 --> 04:14.760
He has an access to something which is inaccessible in

04:14.760 --> 04:16.120
another state.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.680
For cosmology, I think it is important.

04:18.680 --> 04:25.680
For example, it was Bispour, who from Brazil, from Rio,

04:25.680 --> 04:33.640
who created a cosmological coat with all the world inside

04:33.640 --> 04:36.920
the coat and the both.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.720
I think Les and Kiteslingen, that Les and the Bell of the

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
clinic.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.800
But more actually in the theories before where he's

04:45.800 --> 04:55.600
actually articulating a bipolar theory of emotion,

04:55.600 --> 04:57.800
essentially, and how it appears.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.240
Yes.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.120
I once said something about the bipolar.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.640
I have a brilliant small article called the Eternatus

05:03.640 --> 05:06.160
Cso, where there's always movement.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.640
He never occupies either one pole or the other.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.160
I agree.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.720
And in fact, he has a little figure striding and standing

05:15.720 --> 05:17.520
up on the ceso in the middle.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.120
That's a very difficult position to keep for several

05:21.120 --> 05:22.640
decades, right?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.800
It's much safer to either sit on one side or the other.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.920
And you have to keep your balance dynamically for so long.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.800
And that has to do also with his later critics that want to

05:33.800 --> 05:37.040
position him either on the one side or the other side of the

05:37.040 --> 05:40.520
Enlightenment or the irrational Kant or the

05:40.520 --> 05:40.880
religion.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.040
It's never either or.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.680
It's a position in between.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.920
And next to polarity, there's the other term,

05:47.920 --> 05:53.120
Ousklish, at Maden Varyngheuser, which in English is called

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
not exactly a balance.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
Balance.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.640
But it's not a static balance.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.040
The balance is always dynamic.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.480
You're always sort of oscillating between the two.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.280
And compensation is a kind of economic term.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.560
You can't say why.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.400
Right.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.880
Yeah.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.000
So it's always dynamic.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.840
And there's never exact safe positioning in the

06:14.840 --> 06:15.200
property.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.240
In fact, he energizes the polarity by making it

06:18.240 --> 06:20.040
unstable.

06:20.040 --> 06:24.440
Well, I think the question is how perhaps you will give the

06:24.440 --> 06:29.320
perspective, because for me it is not the good way to do a

06:29.320 --> 06:32.880
discussion about psychosis of verbog.

06:32.880 --> 06:38.000
It's more important to understand how this kind of mental

06:38.000 --> 06:41.680
status opened to something new.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.440
Like it was creating.

06:43.440 --> 06:51.040
In fact, we are now in New York 100 years after discussing

06:51.040 --> 06:52.640
about verbog.

06:52.640 --> 06:58.440
Each one perhaps, we have each one, his own verbog.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.960
It's my impression after this discussion.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.360
We have different verbog views.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.000
And we are taking lessons from verbog in a different point of

07:09.000 --> 07:09.760
view.

07:09.760 --> 07:16.200
But for me, the question of people-already is interesting

07:16.200 --> 07:22.480
for the notion of patos, for perhaps what can we

07:22.480 --> 07:24.800
learn from patos.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.800
I know nothing of psychosis, of course.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.840
I just wanted to recall the fact that when verbog describes

07:35.840 --> 07:43.120
himself in terms of sort of autobiographical image as a

07:43.120 --> 07:50.080
psychostorian, trying to explore and understand the visual

07:50.080 --> 07:55.840
history of the West has taken between two extremes,

07:55.840 --> 08:01.440
mania and melancholy, the ecstatic nymph and melancholic

08:01.440 --> 08:06.000
god, of river god.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.280
There, of course, you have a polarity of figures.

08:10.280 --> 08:16.520
And this polarism, as he says, he thought at a certain time

08:16.520 --> 08:18.400
it was his own invention.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.880
His own creative invention as a historiographical category.

08:23.880 --> 08:28.960
But there is a very interesting entry in his journal

08:28.960 --> 08:35.720
as early as 1907, where he says, I'm reading good as

08:35.720 --> 08:38.000
metamorphosis of plants.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.640
And I find there the notion of polarity, polarity,

08:42.640 --> 08:47.520
polarity, what I thought was my own idea.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.160
But all is there, all is there in good.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.800
And I think I have tried also personally to explore this

08:54.800 --> 08:58.520
background, which is morphological.

08:58.520 --> 09:01.320
And morphological means that you never understand one

09:01.320 --> 09:07.200
phenomenon if you do not see both forces in it.

09:07.200 --> 09:11.120
So that patos formul exactly is the fact that you have a

09:11.120 --> 09:15.360
formul, which is not a form, which is both a form and the

09:15.360 --> 09:18.480
repetition or the possibility of repetition of this form,

09:18.480 --> 09:23.640
the formula, which immediately expresses a patos, but can be

09:23.640 --> 09:27.280
electrotechnically inverted.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.160
Polarized in this sense, even from these

09:31.160 --> 09:34.960
electro-technical metaphorics we were talking about it before.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.960
So it can become, as we said many times during these

09:37.960 --> 09:43.040
round tables, the mannered and the Magdalene.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.120
The healing serpent and the poison serpent and so on.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.000
But good is there.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.600
Just to follow up, I would like to invite you to,

09:55.600 --> 09:59.640
since you wrote extensively on this topic, you were

09:59.640 --> 10:06.080
mentioning a verbal reading of the good searching for the

10:06.080 --> 10:07.600
wolf lands.

10:07.600 --> 10:18.800
So could you tell us more about this sort of trail recurrent in

10:18.800 --> 10:23.440
the history of images of econology, trying to link

10:23.440 --> 10:30.080
symbolic forms with their biological origin and perhaps

10:30.080 --> 10:33.280
bringing in pit rivers and the like?

10:33.280 --> 10:38.280
I'll try quickly, which is not easy.

10:38.280 --> 10:43.280
Of course, the question of the war, of the origin, of the

10:43.280 --> 10:49.280
war built that has already come out during discussions is

10:49.280 --> 10:53.280
rooted in Gerta's morphological thought.

10:53.280 --> 10:58.280
And Gerta, as we know, understood this idea of natural

10:58.280 --> 11:05.280
research, not as a dilatentistic approach to the study of nature,

11:05.280 --> 11:10.280
but on the contrary, as the other side of the moon, meaning

11:10.280 --> 11:17.280
that a novel, a love novel as the elective affinities can be

11:17.280 --> 11:22.280
understood as well as a chemical treatise, a theory of

11:22.280 --> 11:26.280
attractions and repulsions of nature and the

11:26.280 --> 11:32.280
importance of nature, of sympathies and antipathy of

11:32.280 --> 11:35.280
magnetism as well.

11:35.280 --> 11:43.280
So it must be read as a holistic author in this sense.

11:43.280 --> 11:50.280
Or we find already in Gerta, I think, a tension which is to

11:50.280 --> 11:55.280
be found afterwards in Barbara as well between historical

11:55.280 --> 12:02.280
understanding of the war and properly morphological.

12:02.280 --> 12:08.280
When Gerta was looking for the warplancy, for a certain time,

12:08.280 --> 12:13.280
it was convinced that the warplancy was the first plant ever

12:13.280 --> 12:18.280
that had appeared at the beginning of the world.

12:18.280 --> 12:24.280
And it was convinced that he had found it in the jinkopilob,

12:24.280 --> 12:29.280
the jinkopilob was the most ancient plant on earth.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.280
From the jinkopilob, every other plant had derived,

12:34.280 --> 12:39.280
according to this first historical approach to this notion of

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
the war.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.280
But then going to Italy, there was a letter to help there

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
from Palermo's botanical gardens.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.280
And there he understands, and of course his reading of Kant is

12:54.280 --> 12:58.280
very important as well because he speaks of a transcendental

12:58.280 --> 13:07.280
blood, transcendental leaf, meaning that war is not something

13:07.280 --> 13:13.280
that you have to look for on the timeline, the first point on

13:13.280 --> 13:16.280
the line of the chronological line.

13:16.280 --> 13:21.280
And from that point, everything else in the vegetable phenomena

13:21.280 --> 13:24.280
descends and arrives.

13:24.280 --> 13:29.280
War is rather the theme never given, sort of a bit against

13:29.280 --> 13:32.280
the imperceptible, say, because it was a morphologist as well,

13:32.280 --> 13:36.280
Gertian, morphologist as well, who took perhaps a family

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
resemblance.

13:37.280 --> 13:43.280
So you recognize the theme among all the vegetable phenomena.

13:43.280 --> 13:51.280
During processes of condensation, of expansion,

13:51.280 --> 13:53.280
how do you say it?

13:53.280 --> 13:54.280
Alungamento.

13:54.280 --> 14:03.280
Lengthening or compressing, any vegetable phenomenon is the

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
leaf.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.280
So it can become the roots, it can become the branches,

14:08.280 --> 14:10.280
it can become the trunk.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.280
And the same can be said for the osteological system.

14:15.280 --> 14:20.280
So when he speaks of the war we are built, the original

14:20.280 --> 14:26.280
vertebrae, and he sees that it can become the bones of the

14:26.280 --> 14:30.280
leg, of the skull in metamorphosis, you recognize the

14:30.280 --> 14:34.280
vertebrae, but you never actually see it in itself.

14:34.280 --> 14:39.280
Only varides, so if you want to use a musical metaphor,

14:39.280 --> 14:44.280
we could say we don't have the theme, but we just have

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
variations.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.280
Variations of a theme that is never given in itself, but only

14:50.280 --> 14:51.280
in its variations.

14:51.280 --> 14:57.280
And if you look at the panels of the nemosunearlas, where is

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
the nympha?

14:59.280 --> 15:04.280
You have variations of a theme, of a patos forma that is there in

15:04.280 --> 15:09.280
every nympha that you look at, but never exhausted in any

15:09.280 --> 15:10.280
single nympha.

15:10.280 --> 15:16.280
So you can look at the golf player at the servant of the

15:16.280 --> 15:20.280
gillandaya, of the archive manad.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.280
And this I think is a morphological approach, theme

15:24.280 --> 15:29.280
never given, but in its variations.

15:29.280 --> 15:37.280
This is this tension between a historical approach to the

15:37.280 --> 15:41.280
oor, and a morphological is to be found in Barugal as well.

15:41.280 --> 15:46.280
For example, when he studies Manet, and he says Manet is not a

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
new author.

15:47.280 --> 15:53.280
The de jenès sur l'erbe is not la nouveau té absolut.

15:53.280 --> 15:58.280
It's something that has roots in your journey, in

15:58.280 --> 16:03.280
Marcantonio Ramonde, in a drawing by Rafael, unfortunately

16:03.280 --> 16:15.280
lost, in a relief in the wall of Villa Medicin Rome.

16:15.280 --> 16:20.280
And so he needs to reconstruct the historical chain, going back

16:20.280 --> 16:22.280
to the model.

16:22.280 --> 16:27.280
So he has a traditional idea of the oor as the origin.

16:27.280 --> 16:36.280
But as we know, many links in this chain are missing.

16:36.280 --> 16:42.280
And moreover, if you go back to an elanistic model, you cannot

16:42.280 --> 16:47.280
say you have found the origin, because you can ask for a

16:47.280 --> 16:53.280
Greek origin, and for an archive Greek origin, an oriental

16:53.280 --> 16:55.280
origin, and so on.

16:55.280 --> 17:00.280
So the quest for the origin transforms itself rather in

17:00.280 --> 17:01.280
amorphology.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.280
So it's not important to put all these figures in a timeline,

17:05.280 --> 17:10.280
chronologically oriented, but rather to think them, I would

17:10.280 --> 17:15.280
say, in a radial scheme.

17:15.280 --> 17:19.280
At the center of the scheme, you have the Patosfarna, and around

17:19.280 --> 17:24.280
the scheme you have the figures that gather around the mother,

17:24.280 --> 17:28.280
as Gautis said, of the phenomena, of the oor phenomena.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.280
Like a mother that gathers around herself the children, and you

17:33.280 --> 17:37.280
have this network of phenomena.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.280
And I think that each panel of the mnemosuna are less

17:41.280 --> 17:47.280
organized like that, like sort of gathering of children around

17:47.280 --> 17:51.280
a mother theme that is never given.

17:51.280 --> 17:58.280
Warburg is one author of a very complex landscape, morphological

17:58.280 --> 18:04.280
landscape in late 19, early 20th century, that has never been

18:04.280 --> 18:11.280
reconstructed yet in its density, in its complexity, and I would

18:11.280 --> 18:16.280
call it this morphological paradigm in the humanities.

18:16.280 --> 18:25.280
In anthropology in our history, we found it in Yollis linguistics.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.280
The I'm Faje Farm is a morphological approach.

18:28.280 --> 18:32.280
Prop, morphology of the folk tale.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.280
Some structuralism, the stealth psychology.

18:36.280 --> 18:42.280
So really many, many, many fields, and I think linguistics

18:42.280 --> 18:48.280
is post-formalism, Russian formalism.

18:48.280 --> 18:55.280
Hook school, this idea of course, a morphology of lifestyles.

18:55.280 --> 19:00.280
Although if you think about Darwin and expression of morphological

19:00.280 --> 19:04.280
qualities of expression of emotions in animals and humans,

19:04.280 --> 19:11.280
as everyone has many people have noted, an important book for

19:11.280 --> 19:14.280
Vavog.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.280
There is a chronological element there that perhaps you're

19:18.280 --> 19:20.280
downplaying somewhat.

19:20.280 --> 19:25.280
I agree with you that Vavog is not like Walter Benjamin is not

19:25.280 --> 19:31.280
interested in Orchbrongh as a chronological beginning point.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.280
But yet if we look at the panels, they do move from antiquity

19:35.280 --> 19:37.280
to the present day.

19:37.280 --> 19:44.280
So he is offering us a historical atlas, one that proceeds

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
and moves forward.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
I agree.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.280
In fact, I was talking of attention because I don't think that

19:50.280 --> 19:56.280
Barbara is emancipated completely from the traditional

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
historical approach.

19:57.280 --> 20:02.280
On the contrary, it feels the tension between this and it feels

20:02.280 --> 20:06.280
attracted by the traditional historical task to reconstruct

20:06.280 --> 20:09.280
the timeline, the chronology of the phenomena.

20:09.280 --> 20:14.280
And this is there together with the other side.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.280
When Spiro says it's never one or the other, but you have to

20:17.280 --> 20:19.280
think in between.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.280
Moreover, if you read the origin of the species by Darwin,

20:22.280 --> 20:25.280
there is a paragraph on morphology.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.280
He knew very well good and he says morphology is the mother of

20:29.280 --> 20:31.280
our problems.

20:31.280 --> 20:39.280
So even in this depth that Barbara has toward Darwin, you can

20:39.280 --> 20:45.280
see in transparent but as well again.

20:45.280 --> 20:51.280
And I mean, to complicate or to swing the pendulum just a bit

20:51.280 --> 20:56.280
further, it doesn't really discuss the school, the school

20:56.280 --> 21:04.280
of Athens in the Chvamdoydong as a kind of syncrene of symptoms

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
of appearances.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.280
I think you recall.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.280
Yes.

21:11.280 --> 21:17.280
I don't remember, but I'm not the Freudian here.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.280
The Freudians don't remember it.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.280
I'm not responsible.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.280
I do, I don't remember.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.280
Perhaps in the impression.

21:28.280 --> 21:31.280
I'm pretty sure he does.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.280
But downstairs.

21:34.280 --> 21:41.280
But perhaps an important question which was in the origin of our

21:41.280 --> 21:49.280
meeting here and our discussion was the question of plasticity,

21:49.280 --> 21:52.280
dynamic memory and unconscious.

21:52.280 --> 21:59.280
And the purpose was to revisit the new vision of unconscious and

21:59.280 --> 22:06.280
memory with the information of contemporary neurosciences.

22:06.280 --> 22:10.280
And I think it will be interesting to discuss a little about that

22:10.280 --> 22:15.280
because we can say there is a dynamic memory today in the

22:15.280 --> 22:17.280
vision of neurosciences.

22:17.280 --> 22:20.280
Very dynamic memory.

22:20.280 --> 22:27.280
And the question from neurosciences is the dichronic identity.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.280
Welcome from the dichronic identity.

22:30.280 --> 22:36.280
If we are always changing from where the permanence of

22:36.280 --> 22:41.280
yourself, the permanence of your reference, of your history,

22:41.280 --> 22:42.280
welcome from.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.280
And perhaps we have a paradox as we discussed before.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.280
In biology we have permanent change.

22:49.280 --> 22:56.280
And in cultural point of view you have something which is more

22:56.280 --> 23:01.280
in the dialectic of memory as a conservation, as continuity.

23:01.280 --> 23:06.280
And I think the discussion about continuity and discontinuity in

23:06.280 --> 23:12.280
the dynamic process of memory is interesting to have it change

23:12.280 --> 23:16.280
from the point of view.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.280
For a classical psychoanalyst we are thinking about

23:19.280 --> 23:25.280
psychoanalysis, about human sciences as the field of the

23:25.280 --> 23:27.280
possibility to change.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
And biology as the terminus,

23:29.280 --> 23:32.280
programmation, fixed structures.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.280
And with the new parroting of plasticity you have an

23:36.280 --> 23:43.280
understanding of the representation, perhaps more mobile in

23:43.280 --> 23:48.280
biological structure and more, in mobile in cultural structures.

23:48.280 --> 23:56.280
Is it a pity that the memory people are not here anymore?

23:56.280 --> 23:59.280
Yes, it's gay.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.280
And I know psychoanalytic memory.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.280
We can manage.

24:05.280 --> 24:11.280
I was wondering in fact myself about what we were discussing,

24:11.280 --> 24:14.280
they were discussing, you were discussing this morning.

24:14.280 --> 24:20.280
Because it is indeed one of the most interesting things that

24:20.280 --> 24:24.280
at least I think for neuroscience came out from this

24:24.280 --> 24:27.280
Varburg meeting.

24:27.280 --> 24:31.280
The thing is that the memory was discussed this morning is

24:31.280 --> 24:35.280
in fact somehow very fixed and very flexible.

24:35.280 --> 24:39.280
I mean you speak of a synaptic trace which is something that

24:39.280 --> 24:42.280
really deeply change your brain.

24:42.280 --> 24:47.280
Everything you hear, you listen, you do can change through the

24:47.280 --> 24:49.280
processes of your brain.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.280
But still it's a dynamic thing.

24:51.280 --> 24:57.280
So ongoing, even during these days, we are carrying on changing.

24:57.280 --> 25:02.280
But we perceive our self and our identity as a stable, at least

25:02.280 --> 25:07.280
if we don't run into the pathology as stable in space and time.

25:07.280 --> 25:15.280
So I was wondering if what you were saying about the variation

25:15.280 --> 25:21.280
in the theme could be somehow applied in trying to understand

25:21.280 --> 25:26.280
memory but not as a synaptic trace because it's like explaining

25:26.280 --> 25:30.280
vision with the functioning of the cells in V1, V2 or Colours in

25:30.280 --> 25:32.280
V4.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.280
There is something more, there is, you know, our story is also

25:37.280 --> 25:42.280
a narrative story of our self is something and is not only

25:42.280 --> 25:47.280
about learning what Christina was saying, memory is something you

25:47.280 --> 25:48.280
learn.

25:48.280 --> 25:53.280
I'm not sure it's something you learn, it's something you

25:53.280 --> 25:57.280
experience, something you go through, something that changed

25:57.280 --> 26:01.280
yesterday, the Victoria was saying, we are made of bricks, but you

26:01.280 --> 26:05.280
can change the disposition of these bricks.

26:05.280 --> 26:10.280
And somehow the bricks can be the variation around the theme.

26:10.280 --> 26:15.280
And so the dynamic aspect of memory could be not this variation.

26:15.280 --> 26:21.280
Yeah, the creative and plastic aspect that both reproduces

26:21.280 --> 26:23.280
and produces.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.280
I was thinking, listening to this idea of plasticity, of course,

26:27.280 --> 26:35.280
of the very famous passages in prose or even in certain

26:35.280 --> 26:40.280
phenomenology, but even in all those authors that have insisted

26:40.280 --> 26:47.280
on the retroactive retrograde movement of truth,

26:47.280 --> 26:52.280
Bexon has a beautiful conference on that, the aprecouled in

26:52.280 --> 26:57.280
Treglichkeit Borges when he says that Kafka creates his precursors

26:57.280 --> 27:03.280
or a Thomas Eliot that says in tradition an individual talent

27:03.280 --> 27:07.280
that when a new author appears in the scene in the literary

27:07.280 --> 27:13.280
landscape, the old history has to be rewritten.

27:13.280 --> 27:21.280
So briefly, the present shapes the past, the past shapes the present,

27:21.280 --> 27:26.280
and you have, again, this in between of passivity and activity,

27:26.280 --> 27:31.280
a chiasmatic relation if you want to use the Merlot-Ponten notion.

27:31.280 --> 27:39.280
And I'm not a neuroscientist, but from your comments and this

27:39.280 --> 27:45.280
course is about plasticity, I immediately connected them to this

27:45.280 --> 27:51.280
constellation of problems, which is exactly even in verbal the idea

27:51.280 --> 27:57.280
that he says the Lao-con should have been invented if it was not

27:57.280 --> 28:05.280
there, meaning that Renaissance is a construction, was there a certain amount

28:05.280 --> 28:13.280
of phenomena, but there's a retrograde creative installation

28:13.280 --> 28:19.280
of this notion of Renaissance as an aprecouled.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.280
I think there's a...

28:22.280 --> 28:29.280
No, but just to stress again, the notion that one dimension of

28:29.280 --> 28:36.280
plasticity is that it allows experience to leave traces by modifying

28:36.280 --> 28:40.280
synapses that are facilitated and then when they are reactivated,

28:40.280 --> 28:44.280
that somehow reproduce the experience more or less.

28:44.280 --> 28:48.280
And at the same time, particularly this idea that whenever...

28:48.280 --> 28:53.280
It's not an idea, it's actually an experimental observation that when

28:53.280 --> 28:57.280
traces are reactivated, as Christina mentioned, they are becoming

28:57.280 --> 29:05.280
more fragile or more susceptible to associate with others with a new concept.

29:05.280 --> 29:10.280
So nothing is lost really, but it's updated permanently.

29:10.280 --> 29:15.280
So this is in a way that try to grasp this notion of permanence and at the

29:15.280 --> 29:21.280
same time of continuous change, which is something that is paradoxical because

29:21.280 --> 29:26.280
you would say, you know, memory is something that is there, you know,

29:26.280 --> 29:27.280
once and forever.

29:27.280 --> 29:32.280
And this is really the evolving notion that it's true, but at the same time,

29:32.280 --> 29:35.280
it's susceptible to change.

29:35.280 --> 29:41.280
And all the mechanisms are not known, actually, but certainly this possibility

29:41.280 --> 29:45.280
of re-association of traces.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.280
So given trace is now put into...

29:48.280 --> 29:53.280
Associated with others in a new context.

29:53.280 --> 29:59.280
So produces this change in a way.

29:59.280 --> 30:05.280
Yes, it is important because we have to revisit the relation between nature and

30:05.280 --> 30:09.280
culture if we can say that it is a prominent change.

30:09.280 --> 30:15.280
We can say also that we are, as we said in our books, we are biologically

30:15.280 --> 30:20.280
determined not to be completely biologically determined.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.280
We are biologically determined to be free.

30:23.280 --> 30:30.280
And finally, we can say in this discussion that we are biologically

30:30.280 --> 30:37.280
determined, determined to receive the incidence of the culture.

30:37.280 --> 30:46.280
And the idea, the space for the culture is inside also the biology of the...

30:46.280 --> 30:51.280
And after it is the question, why is it like that?

30:51.280 --> 30:54.280
Why is it necessary?

30:54.280 --> 31:00.280
The incidence of the culture, we are unachieved at birth.

31:00.280 --> 31:05.280
We need the other, or this is a psychiatric psychoanalytic point of view.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.280
We need the action of the other.

31:07.280 --> 31:15.280
And we can develop these ideas, discussing about the necessity of the

31:15.280 --> 31:21.280
culture which is inside the biological organization.

31:21.280 --> 31:32.280
I found the discussion very interesting and talk provoking in particular.

31:32.280 --> 31:36.280
I've been thinking about the issue of memory.

31:36.280 --> 31:43.280
So for a psychoanalyst, there is a relevance and history to the concept of memory

31:43.280 --> 31:53.280
because Breuer Freud with his experience with Charcoal and then on his own discovered

31:53.280 --> 32:06.280
that certain manifestations in a patient, certain symptoms could be traced back to a specific memory.

32:06.280 --> 32:16.280
And that the bringing into awareness of that specific memory would alter the symptoms.

32:16.280 --> 32:23.280
In that way of looking at it, memory is a very discrete entity.

32:23.280 --> 32:32.280
So what we call memory trace, so that there are all these traces, they are discrete entities.

32:32.280 --> 32:48.280
But when you start thinking from the perspective of, let's say, plasticity, when you and Joe this morning say,

32:48.280 --> 32:54.280
well, the brain changes after this meeting or during this meeting, the brain changes.

32:54.280 --> 32:56.280
What is memory in that?

32:56.280 --> 33:06.280
There isn't a discrete, so the whole question of, and then the other thing is,

33:06.280 --> 33:12.280
Christina says, well, there is learning, well, there's learning, there's experience.

33:12.280 --> 33:21.280
And there is what Freud didn't really directly touch upon, though it's inherent in the concept of free associations,

33:21.280 --> 33:29.280
but it's not like you have a discrete experience and that experience stays isolated.

33:29.280 --> 33:37.280
It must be that all experiences are affecting each other forwards and backwards in a dynamic way.

33:37.280 --> 33:48.280
And so, within this way of saying, it's difficult to speak of memory in the usual sense we speak of it.

33:48.280 --> 33:55.280
There may have to be a different approach to understanding exactly what it is that is happening.

33:55.280 --> 34:14.280
That is, and even, and I think once you start thinking that way, the Freudian dynamic unconscious becomes something that needs to be revisited.

34:14.280 --> 34:23.280
Yes, and perhaps the limit between memory, dynamic memory, and dynamic unconscious, Freudian unconscious,

34:23.280 --> 34:26.280
is less clear than before.

34:26.280 --> 34:36.280
For us, we consider that unconscious was, Freudian theory is not a memory system.

34:36.280 --> 34:49.280
But if we enter in plasticity, dynamic memory, we have something new in the confrontation between unconscious and memory.

34:49.280 --> 34:55.280
And finally, it's easier to understand what is unconscious than what is memory.

34:55.280 --> 35:08.280
Well, but in classical Freudian thinking, unconscious or dynamic unconscious is connected to the notion of repression,

35:08.280 --> 35:14.280
which means the memory is not becoming conscious for a reason.

35:14.280 --> 35:23.280
Whereas it may be that memory is not becoming conscious, just further from being whatever needs to bring it into awareness, into consciousness,

35:23.280 --> 35:25.280
is not happening.

35:25.280 --> 35:33.280
So if you don't listen to that piece of music for 30 years, that memory you could say is unconscious,

35:33.280 --> 35:43.280
you could even say in a speculative Freudian way, you kept that memory out of your consciousness because it happened during your adolescence,

35:43.280 --> 35:45.280
you were sexually into this and it kept it.

35:45.280 --> 35:54.280
But it may just be that you didn't have the method of accessing it, and when you accessed it with the repeat of the same music, it came right back.

35:54.280 --> 35:59.280
But this gives a very discrete perspective or retrieval too.

35:59.280 --> 36:08.280
So, and your example was incredibly good in showing that even the retrieval aspect of memory is not discrete.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.280
You don't have to...

36:09.280 --> 36:10.280
Exactly.

36:10.280 --> 36:21.280
So, I think what I was just an idyllarium thinking of your description of the original, this variation around the theme,

36:21.280 --> 36:26.280
it would give to memory a more complex structure.

36:26.280 --> 36:31.280
So, I don't know exactly how it could be formalized, but...

36:31.280 --> 36:43.280
I think the difficulty of addressing these issues, the relationship between memory and unconscious,

36:43.280 --> 36:58.280
the notion of form, where the form comes from, the problem of the ure, or even the related problem of self-identity,

36:58.280 --> 37:08.280
bring us back to a key point of our ontology, of our epistemology, which is language.

37:08.280 --> 37:24.280
And there's a passage that keeps obsessing me, which I totally, by chance, found in a wonderful book by Premolévi,

37:24.280 --> 37:29.280
that's drawn and the saved. I don't have the English, but I can...

37:29.280 --> 37:32.280
It's very short. I have the Italian one.

37:32.280 --> 37:38.280
What we commonly conceive of as understanding, he writes,

37:38.280 --> 37:41.280
coincides with simplifying.

37:41.280 --> 37:51.280
Without a deep simplification, the world around us would be an endless undefined knot

37:51.280 --> 37:59.280
that would challenge our ability to orient and decide upon our action.

37:59.280 --> 38:07.280
We are, to put it simply, forced to reduce the knowable to schema.

38:07.280 --> 38:17.280
And this is the specific purpose of the wonderful instrument we built in the course of evolution,

38:17.280 --> 38:23.280
which is just specific of the human species. Language and conceptual thought.

38:23.280 --> 38:30.280
So, I think Premolévi here is dealing with a completely different issue.

38:30.280 --> 38:38.280
What does it mean to survive ausch with... what does it mean to feel guilty of something, etc.

38:38.280 --> 38:51.280
But if you somehow use this as a starting point to reflect upon many of the themes that we have been discussing during these days,

38:51.280 --> 39:00.280
I think that the notion of identity can be much better tackled from our point of view,

39:00.280 --> 39:07.280
from the neurobiological point of view, if you interpret it as a process, and not as...

39:07.280 --> 39:12.280
So, there is no such a thing in the brain as the self.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.280
The self is a process, a dynamic process.

39:15.280 --> 39:20.280
Which, in a way, is a way not to answer in the question, okay, a process of what?

39:20.280 --> 39:35.280
So, then the neurobiologist desperately needs something to grab in order not to be completely drawn in this sort of indeterminacy,

39:35.280 --> 39:45.280
universal indeterminacy. And this something to grab on are the bricks that metaphorical is speaking, I was alluding to.

39:45.280 --> 39:56.280
So, going back to Várburg, Francois said, each of us has probably had, or his own, Várburg.

39:56.280 --> 40:07.280
One of the things that really struck me of Várburg is his definition of the history of art as the history of human pragmatic expression,

40:07.280 --> 40:19.280
which immediately in my head suggested the possibility not to naturalize the history of art.

40:19.280 --> 40:26.280
That's not the way to put it. But at least they attempt to naturalize the process of morphogenesis.

40:26.280 --> 40:46.280
And then, Várburg reading of Gerta and the tradition that Andrea was very briefly referring to offer a sort of kind of very remote,

40:46.280 --> 41:00.280
but not totally crazy goal, which is specifically that of looking for possible biological roots of symbolic forms.

41:00.280 --> 41:13.280
And I think that in that respect, Várburg definitely, at the very least, I don't see him as standing against this project.

41:13.280 --> 41:29.280
But I think that by reading Várburg perhaps in my very own idiosyncratic way, I think Várburg would not and would encourage this sort of search.

41:29.280 --> 41:50.280
And then I will stop. The notion of a form that is not the primitive form, but being instantiated in a variety of ways still keeps some constant aspect

41:50.280 --> 42:04.280
reminds me of the notion discussed by Agamben radicalizing a paradigm by Aristotle.

42:04.280 --> 42:26.280
So according to a gamble, this is specific of our species. The possibility to achieve something that cannot be universal, but being paradigmatic becomes, so to speak,

42:26.280 --> 42:35.280
by means of decoupling, something from his usual reference role, he makes the example of Rosa.

42:35.280 --> 42:47.280
Rose is a word referring to a biological object, but when decoupled from his role of referring to something in the physical world,

42:47.280 --> 43:00.280
when it becomes one element of the latent declination, Rosa, Rosa, it doesn't refer to any specific roles, it becomes a paradigm.

43:00.280 --> 43:14.280
So I believe the same logic can perhaps be applied to the notion of morphogenesis and can be perhaps fruitfully tackled from an all biological point of view.

43:14.280 --> 43:24.280
So that's the main reason why we decided to confront scribbles with the Chinese ideograms and alphabetical Roman letters.

43:24.280 --> 43:45.280
So, and if I had the power to do it, one project I would really like to pursue would be to look among all known possible writing that we know along human history,

43:45.280 --> 44:00.280
to look for specific biomechanical constraints, kinematic bricks that somehow, so I mean the way we are, it's a dynamic process.

44:00.280 --> 44:10.280
I am not the same as I was 20 years ago. Before becoming a father, my attention started one meter above the ground.

44:10.280 --> 44:22.280
Whatever was moving below one meter didn't exist. Now, all of a sudden I become a father. I discovered the world is full of children of this kind of thing.

44:22.280 --> 44:28.280
So I am not anymore the Victoria or the single...

44:28.280 --> 44:29.280
Clayboard.

44:29.280 --> 44:40.280
It's a red set. Somebody from person. So the idea is that this is something that can be investigated.

44:40.280 --> 44:46.280
And I think verbal in a way can be a source of inspiration.

44:46.280 --> 45:15.280
But I mean, maybe I am just reading what you say in light of what I think. But the point I made this morning about these hardwired, maybe neuronal circuits in a way that respond to certain archetypal biomechanical shapes and patterns

45:15.280 --> 45:24.280
I mean, for me, can be related to what verbal is identified as persisting over time.

45:24.280 --> 45:37.280
And then, of course, based on this, they can re-emerge and be reinterpreted and find their life on their own

45:37.280 --> 45:54.280
through plasticity, through culture, through a given moment in time. But there is a constant invariant throughout time and cultures that is based on some biological property.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.280
So I think we shared the same point.

45:56.280 --> 46:08.280
But it might be interesting to make a distinction between images and text, right? Between images and language. And it's interesting that Valbuk seemed to have...

46:08.280 --> 46:22.280
You really had a hard time with writing. I mean, I don't know what your experience is, but my experience of reading Valbuk is God was not only in the details, but he got lost in the details.

46:22.280 --> 46:28.280
And you can feel a certain compulsive inability to extract...

46:28.280 --> 46:30.280
Let alone the handwriting.

46:30.280 --> 46:39.280
You know exactly. And then stopping the project. So we have to think about that. There was something... And when he came to Numosina,

46:39.280 --> 46:53.280
he really didn't get the text done. He died before the text was finished. But the idea of these pictures speaking. And you know Freud talks about mental images, not external images,

46:53.280 --> 47:00.280
but mental images as phylogenetically and ontologically older, of course, than language, which we know they are.

47:00.280 --> 47:09.280
So it would be interesting to hear people talk about this distinction, which is related to conceptual questions and morphology.

47:09.280 --> 47:24.280
I love the example of Primo Levy, because I mean, Valbuk would describe to it immediately in the sense that this is what he thought in Vissure and the Viconians that he was reading.

47:24.280 --> 47:38.280
This is what the symbol is. But then I would just want to add to that and complicate that with what Andrea, by mentioning invoking Gerta and the Gertian symbol,

47:38.280 --> 47:49.280
was precisely what Valbuk did not want to have, because for him the symbol had to be discursive. It had to be endlessly metonymic.

47:49.280 --> 48:02.280
It couldn't have that romantic Gertian symbolic power, because it was too complicated. It was too oscillating. It was too unstable.

48:02.280 --> 48:16.280
My impression is that the effect in between various the tradition Christ or Baccofen, that is a symbol is something dense, complex.

48:16.280 --> 48:26.280
When you narrate it and you describe it, you have the exegesis of the symbol, and then you have the myth.

48:26.280 --> 48:39.280
And then you recount the history of the serpent as a escapious, and so you decline and you inflect it towards the good, towards the positive pole.

48:39.280 --> 48:55.280
Otherwise you can describe it and recount and narrate it in the myth of Lao-Kon, so the exegesis determines the symbol and its density towards the direction.

48:55.280 --> 49:10.280
But it also undermines it. It doesn't allow it simply to be the serpent or the flag or the chalice. It becomes iconographic, as well as I call it.

49:10.280 --> 49:27.280
I have a question to your argument, your excellent argument of Victoria Gédese. We are speaking about biological roots of form.

49:27.280 --> 49:42.280
Or a biological necessity of the form, because something is missing in the programme of the human being. We are without instruction for use. We are unachieved at birth.

49:42.280 --> 49:53.280
And we need also something from the other. And perhaps we need the form. For me it's different to say, perhaps it's the same, it's different.

49:53.280 --> 50:07.280
But it is important, not the biological root, if like if it was inscribed in your programme, but the biological necessity of the form.

50:07.280 --> 50:27.280
It's like the distinction, excuse me, like the social between language and speech. Each act of speech, each speech act, modifies the system of the language.

50:27.280 --> 50:49.280
And you have this kind of dialectic with an endless permanent change. Or with the necessity of the form, but the possibility not to find the true form, but to recreate permanently endless new form from another form.

50:49.280 --> 51:03.280
And for me, Warburg is very interesting, because in Nemo's sign he put together different kinds of forms that are unified by their necessity, and not by the common root.

51:03.280 --> 51:18.280
If I could pick up on what you said about text and image, I was reminded listening this morning and now that in fact in Warburg, late years, which are dedicated to his own recovery, there's two great words that have the same title, at least Nemozine.

51:18.280 --> 51:23.280
The first is the builder, Al-Aza, and the second is the library, so you have text and image.

51:23.280 --> 51:33.280
And this also reminded me of a very short text that I give to students when I introduce the library and the expectation of how to find your reading list, etc.

51:33.280 --> 51:57.280
And I read very short text by Verbal, which describes the library as an off-claroon-vaff, a weapon of enlightenment. And to me, that seems to be a very powerful way of inverting is phobia with gun and turning the library into something very dynamic and very organized at the same time, because the library has quite a clear organization.

51:57.280 --> 52:05.280
It's organized chronologically, there's an alphabetical order, so it represents time, and it also is subdivided by space.

52:05.280 --> 52:15.280
So it's indeed a space of self-healing and of creating a space where you can navigate himself.

52:15.280 --> 52:21.280
Hello? This isn't a direct response to what has been said.

52:21.280 --> 52:28.280
But when you refer to the library as a weapon, I think that it's something to bear in mind.

52:28.280 --> 52:40.280
And that is Varbar's relationship to the world around him, which was very close, very attentive, very conscious and self-conscious.

52:40.280 --> 52:49.280
When we speak of his identity, there's something very problematic for him in a socio-political sense, and that includes his family, includes religious background,

52:49.280 --> 53:02.280
and he was constantly negotiating this with himself, within the family, with others, and who he was socio-politically, was on his mind.

53:02.280 --> 53:15.280
And that the creation of the library was not just an intellectual act, not just a projected psychological woman, but a socio-political one,

53:15.280 --> 53:27.280
that he negotiated with his family, through his family, and that continual concern with where he fit within the society, the politics of his time,

53:27.280 --> 53:38.280
his identity with his class, with his state, but his problems with that, his identity with Judaism and his ambivalence there,

53:38.280 --> 53:45.280
his attention as Peter pointed out to anti-Semitism and what he could do about that.

53:45.280 --> 53:49.280
This remained constantly of importance to him.

53:49.280 --> 53:59.280
And so all I would say is that in the discussion of his intellectuality and his relationship to the intellectual traditions, with which he is dealing,

53:59.280 --> 54:10.280
I think his socio-political sense and background just sort of helps in some way to understand what stays with him, what he decides to pursue.

54:10.280 --> 54:18.280
That little aphorism fits very well into what you said, because it continues the library as a weapon of enlightenment against orthodox materialism,

54:18.280 --> 54:31.280
and he says, Luther, the French Revolution, science, liberating the right to think for oneself. But I think that really fits very, very squarely into that discourse.

54:31.280 --> 54:46.280
As I've been listening to the way that each of us has been thinking about Warburg, I wonder if in one sense he's an ego ideal of something that the psychoanalyst,

54:46.280 --> 54:59.280
Rothenburg, refer to a Genucian process of thinking after the Roman god Janus, where there's an active and intentional conception of two or more opposites simultaneously

54:59.280 --> 55:11.280
that is very much like primary process thinking with the equivalents of opposites, but is actually a conscious, intentional, rational process that also obeys reality testing.

55:11.280 --> 55:22.280
And that this is something that we recognize perhaps in Warburg, and so many of the comments have been attempts, rather than maybe trying to find the middle ground, reconciling opposites,

55:22.280 --> 55:37.280
whether it was kind of an Aristotelian and platonic undercurrent to what you were, yes, and it's not finding the midpoint, but we're all sort of, you know, I think in a way,

55:37.280 --> 55:45.280
fashioning or thinking after Warburg, and this is what I think we see as so ideal about him.

55:45.280 --> 56:03.280
In this context, I want to bring up the seismograph. You know, Valba really felt he was a seismograph, and if you think about it, I've had this much humbler metaphor about my own nerves, which is a tuning fork.

56:03.280 --> 56:11.280
You see how humble that one is compared to the seismograph, but the seismograph is, you know, picking up earthquakes.

56:11.280 --> 56:27.280
And you feel this in the sensibility, and this might be, this is obviously personal, it's subjective, and I have noticed that, you know, people want to walk very carefully for human and good reason, respectfully,

56:27.280 --> 56:39.280
around the subjective reality of what it was like to be Abi Vabhupa, that we can't know, of course, but we can guess through this particular metaphor of the seismograph,

56:39.280 --> 56:51.280
that he was a person who was picking up a lot, and you feel it in the psychotic material, and you feel it before that, and you feel it after.

56:51.280 --> 56:57.280
Sure. Even in 2019, he uses the metaphor of the antenna as well. Yes, there you go, the same thing.

56:57.280 --> 57:02.280
Okay, I think we could stop here and be open for questions.

57:02.280 --> 57:04.280
Return it.

57:09.280 --> 57:13.280
No, you want to make one last comment before we close?

57:13.280 --> 57:29.280
Yeah, because Siri introduced this very delicate issue text image, and of course, in visual culture studies, it's a main issue, word versus image.

57:29.280 --> 57:49.280
I was wondering whether exactly reading a barber and looking at the panels, we are not perhaps too radically opposing these two systems and registers.

57:49.280 --> 58:10.280
Both for our past and the etymological reason, that is the Greek verb graphane means both to depict and to write, and the same happens in ancient Egyptian language, in Gothic language.

58:10.280 --> 58:37.280
Victoria was mentioning the Chinese ideograms, pictograms. We encounter text and image icon text as many people in the visual culture say in advertising, on the web, in our books, even on the panels of Nemo's Unem.

58:37.280 --> 59:06.280
So I was wondering, and I'd like to ask you as neuroscientists, if such a division between a separation between the responses and the reactions and the processes in the brain with words and with images, is something useful, or if we shouldn't rather develop a method to approach in a holistic way.

59:06.280 --> 59:08.280
The whole thing.

59:08.280 --> 59:28.280
Short answer, I'm not sure how the actual present-day neuroscientific research goes on exploring world versus image.

59:28.280 --> 59:44.280
Perhaps my feeling is in a separate way that our regions processing our relationship towards regions, processing our relationship to images, responses and so on.

59:44.280 --> 59:56.280
Is there a research nowadays questioning the way we respond to icon text?

59:56.280 --> 01:00:06.280
Well, I'm not aware, but that doesn't mean necessarily anything.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:25.280
One of the very interesting discoveries that neuroscience has made recently when comes to the relationship between symbolic graphic science and the brain, I'm referring to the research of Stanislav Dehann.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:44.280
Of coin, people in Paris who have discovered that apparently there's a part of our visual brain, which is specifically and uniquely activated by letters, but not by numbers, for example.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:57.280
So it's not the pragmatic component which specifically leads to this activation, but is something brand new in terms of evolutionary time.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:06.280
It's just an eyeballing 6,000 years of, against the history of at least more than 100,000 years.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:17.280
So what is this? I tend to be inclined to an exoptation perspective.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:26.280
So I don't think our mind can be described metaphorically as a swiss army knife.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.280
No, don't you respect?

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.280
That is wonderful tool.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:50.280
But I don't think our mind can be modeled in that particular way. I don't think that every cognitive abilities is necessarily the outcome of its specific adaptive value, but I stick to gold and leaventh in the spanners of some Mark of famous paper

01:01:50.280 --> 01:02:01.280
where they introduced the notion of exoptation. So to put it simply, nature is a sort of bricolor.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:15.280
So you have something that evolved to answer some specific pressure and you somehow transformed dynamically.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:25.280
Perhaps you use the very same bricks, but the same bricks dynamically connected in a different way can accomplish different things.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:40.280
So what is remarkable is that a trace, a footprint for an animal at best can speak of some other animal that was passing by.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:51.280
In our case, the handprint is a sort of vindication of our identity. So I am.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:03:01.280
And it's amazing how many handprints are discovered. I have a friend who is an archaeologist, Maurizio Fort.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:17.280
He studies the Neolithic period, Catalyuk in an atoria. And he was telling me that all of these houses in a very specific, detailed, very much ritual-like form,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:30.280
there are thousands of these handprints on specific walls. I don't remember if they, with respect to the cardamom points, there is also a rule in that respect.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:36.280
Which is a way of asserting our identity or whatever. I mean, you probably will never know.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:53.280
So this is a real challenge for a biologist because we are dealing with an aspect of human nature that too many is beyond any reach of the empirical sciences.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:01.280
I tend to be rather optimistic or delusional.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.280
I think we have a chance.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.280
Okay, we have one comment on that.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:11.280
Oh yeah, I wanted to ask a question and just kind of follow up on that.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:24.280
You know, Cassierer following Warburg looked at man as the Animal Sinbolicum. So, and his Cassierer's example was, give me a line. And it's all in the context.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:35.280
It's our ability to bring to that line whether it's a mathematical graphical formulation or an aesthetic calligraphic expression or whether it's a numerical symbol.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:48.280
And so, what I found to be interesting and I wanted to know what the neurophysiological opinion might be on this, that there's work done by Stephen Costland and others.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:05:00.280
That says the brain actually projects in the visual courtesies, iconic resemblances to the affordances that we see, that we pay attention to.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:08.280
That the curves that we see are actually modeled two dimensionally on surfaces in the visual courtes.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:18.280
At some point there's got to be like an interpreter that's grading and evaluating like maybe the interpreter, Gazonega talks about.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.280
Is there any literature that talks about this?

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:31.280
The word interpreter is a scary one because you don't want to fall into the moncolous trap.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:44.280
So, the interpreter is at best an emergent property of the whole system. I would put it in that specific way.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:55.280
The vision has been, in my opinion, so far too much studied and conceived of within the limit of vision itself.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:03.280
As we were discussing yesterday, unimodality is not the rule, it's the exception in the brain.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:28.280
So, synesthesia apparently is rules. I have the suspect that a very viable rule to glue this otherwise patchwork like a world of our perceptions of the world is action, is the mortal system.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:47.280
By means of back projection. So, it's not only a matter of top-down effect, like when you see a shaded confused pattern, you don't see anything, then I ask you, oh, don't you see the dalmatian dog?

01:06:47.280 --> 01:07:03.280
Okay, that's a clear example of a top-down influence on early processing. These role of back projection has been either neglected or not sufficiently explored from a neurobiological point of view.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:20.280
People who study the visual system from an anatomical point of view systematically emphasize the fact that recurrent connections, by and large, exceed feed-forward connection.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:44.280
So, there are a lot more fibers that travels back from V1 to the lateral geniculate body than fibers that from the towns gets to the primary visual cortex. That problem means something, which is, I think, also very coherent with the notion of perception that has been discussed during this today.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:08:03.280
So, it's a sort of multimodal enterprise. And I think if one changed this perspective, even the study of images, the study of econology can have a new boost, I think.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:23.280
We still have to map uncharted territory that can perhaps give some food for thought, also for discipline, that in principle don't need the contribution of neurobiology, but I think they can profit of this contribution.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.280
And vice versa, of course.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.280
Thank you all very, very much.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:33.280
And that's it.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:19.280
Thank you.
