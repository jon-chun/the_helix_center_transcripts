00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
Welcome to the Hillic Center for this roundtable on why economists disagree.

00:08.760 --> 00:13.680
Before we start the roundtable and Rob Penzer will introduce the panelists.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.400
I have a few remarks to make.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.600
First, it's about the program tomorrow, which is the 14th.

00:22.600 --> 00:29.880
From 3 to 4.30 pm, we have the inauguration of our poetry series, and it's called Collaborations

00:29.880 --> 00:32.560
Jazz and Poetry.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.960
And Louis Porter, the noted jazz pianist and the educator and author of the celebrated

00:37.960 --> 00:44.720
book on Cold Train, will be here along with jazz poet Sean Singer, whose winner of the

00:44.720 --> 00:48.000
Yale series of Younger Poets prize.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
Then on Friday, October 26, and Saturday, October 27, philosopher and interdisciplinary

00:57.000 --> 01:01.800
scholar Maxine Shish Johnson would be moderating two roundtables.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.840
The first is from 7 to 9 on Friday evening, the 26th.

01:06.840 --> 01:14.480
It's called Life and Movement, Exploring Evolution Coordination Dynamics Sports, Social Interactions,

01:14.480 --> 01:21.880
Neuroscience and Esthetics, as a way of understanding.

01:21.880 --> 01:27.160
Those who know Maxine Shish Johnson's work wouldn't be surprised by this description,

01:27.160 --> 01:39.280
as a philosopher, interdisciplinary scholar, but also used to be a dancer.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.000
It's a way of understanding movement and life.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.840
The other participants are professors Linda Caporel, Jesus Ilanden Agurusa, and Scott

01:49.840 --> 01:52.040
Kelso.

01:52.040 --> 01:59.920
On Saturday the 27th, Rob has written here one, two, three, but I thought it was two-thirty

01:59.920 --> 02:01.320
to four-thirty.

02:01.320 --> 02:16.520
Also, we'll let you know it's, again, the subject is a male-male competition, and the

02:16.520 --> 02:21.800
participants are Randall Collins, Brian Ferguson's James Lieberman, and the science journalist

02:21.800 --> 02:24.520
John Horgan.

02:24.520 --> 02:32.200
The roundtable is going to also touch on issues such as implications of globalization, war

02:32.200 --> 02:35.120
and violence.

02:35.120 --> 02:44.080
Then on Sunday, October 28, from 5.30 to 9, we have the Helix Center's first benefit.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.840
It will be a genie supper club at the Red Rooster.

02:47.840 --> 02:58.120
A jazz ensemble led by Jane Eyreblum will play and Mark Mitten, the internationally known

02:58.120 --> 03:03.160
magician, will perform some magic.

03:03.160 --> 03:10.880
If you want ticket information, if you go on to our website, www.thehelixcenter.org,

03:10.880 --> 03:18.680
you can get the information or you can email to the center and we will send you invitations.

03:18.680 --> 03:25.400
If you can't attend the dinner, we invite you to consider making, I would say, I would

03:25.400 --> 03:28.160
urge you.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
Rob wrote this for me.

03:29.160 --> 03:37.760
I don't think if we're strong enough, it should be, I urge you to make a contribution,

03:37.760 --> 03:43.880
because without it we can't survive and so we hope the benefit will help us some and

03:43.880 --> 03:48.640
we also hope that contributions from people who are interested in these programs will

03:48.640 --> 03:52.760
be helpful in continuing it.

03:52.760 --> 04:00.120
Just the last comment or programs are webcast live and they're archived and if you sign

04:00.120 --> 04:06.880
to our website, then you can participate in ongoing discussions that follow these round

04:06.880 --> 04:09.320
tables and we urge you to do that.

04:09.320 --> 04:16.640
So Rob will introduce the panelists and then we move on.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.640
Thank you, Ed.

04:17.640 --> 04:24.400
And thank you all for coming here on such a beautiful fall day which guarantees we have

04:24.400 --> 04:31.680
a very committed audience and I think you'll be pleased with our panel of noted economists.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.840
We're going to explore their philosophical convergences and divergences around the question

04:36.840 --> 04:39.680
why do economists disagree?

04:39.680 --> 04:47.320

09:05.920 --> 09:09.440
So without, I'm sorry.

09:09.440 --> 09:16.560
And the books, there are a number of books by our panelists that are for sale in the

09:16.560 --> 09:23.240
back and there will be book signing as well so we encourage you to stop there after the

09:23.240 --> 09:24.920
audience discussion.

09:24.920 --> 09:29.080
So without further ado, I turn things over to our moderator, Bob Frank.

09:29.080 --> 09:42.240
Thank you very much, Bob.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.240
It's a real treat to be able to participate in a forum like this.

09:45.240 --> 09:50.240
I've been here once before to a forum in this room.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.040
And it's not like the forums that you see on the Sunday news shows or other popular forums

09:52.040 --> 09:53.400
where people shout at each other.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.600
I think here there's an audience that's intelligent enough to tell a good argument from a bad

09:58.600 --> 10:03.480
argument and so the speakers are under some pressure, not saying things that are demonstrably

10:03.480 --> 10:04.480
false.

10:04.480 --> 10:10.040
And there are issues that are required to reach agreement on and I think when you're

10:10.040 --> 10:15.880
ever in a forum like this, it's good to steer clear of most of those issues.

10:15.880 --> 10:22.200
So there's no way you could have a discussion about what the right public policy posture

10:22.200 --> 10:25.160
is on issues like abortion or other things.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.680
You couldn't get agreement in a diverse group on issues like that.

10:28.680 --> 10:34.040
But I think there are many things that we quarrel about where intelligent people could

10:34.040 --> 10:38.320
listen to a discussion of the pros and cons on each side and come away with a clear sense

10:38.320 --> 10:40.400
that there was a right answer.

10:40.400 --> 10:46.760
And so it's always been my inclination in events like these to stick exclusively to the low

10:46.760 --> 10:53.680
hanging fruit, the kinds of things where it is possible to make real headway and debate.

10:53.680 --> 10:58.920
And so I'm not going to say anything at all that any reasonable person could disagree

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
with.

10:59.920 --> 11:09.360
We'll have a chance to say whether they agree with whether I've done that.

11:09.360 --> 11:16.080
And I'm going to take the, what I think to be the most important issue we face now and

11:16.080 --> 11:20.960
describe how it's not a difficult issue to make genuine progress on.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.200
That's the lingering economic downturn.

11:24.200 --> 11:30.520
It began in 2008 with a financial crisis as always happens in financial crises.

11:30.520 --> 11:36.320
It takes a long time to work off over hanging debt and get the economy back spending.

11:36.320 --> 11:42.320
Again, we're in the midst of what remains a classic demand shortfall downturn.

11:42.320 --> 11:47.280
There's not enough spending to put everyone to work who wants to work.

11:47.280 --> 11:52.560
If you took an economics course long ago, you'll remember the famous national income

11:52.560 --> 11:57.640
identities Y equals C plus I plus G. Why that's national income?

11:57.640 --> 11:59.320
C, that's consumption.

11:59.320 --> 12:03.560
Consumption has been very sluggish because consumers are still paying down debt.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.720
They've made some progress, but it's still a long way to go.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.600
Many of them have remained jobless or are fearful that they'll lose their jobs.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.000
They're not going to spend us out of the downturn.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.720
Businesses, we've all read, are sitting on mountains of cash.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.040
Why aren't they investing?

12:19.040 --> 12:22.200
Some say it's because of uncertainty in the environment.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.600
Maybe that plays some role, but far more important than that is the fact that they already have

12:26.600 --> 12:31.840
facilities that are more than adequate to produce what people want to buy today at the

12:31.840 --> 12:33.760
depressed demand levels.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.800
If there were demand for more output, they would build bigger factories and hire more

12:37.800 --> 12:40.160
workers, but there's not, and so they don't.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.520
So C plus I, those two aren't going anywhere.

12:43.520 --> 12:49.680
Because that leave, as Keynes was the first to point out clearly in a downturn like this,

12:49.680 --> 12:52.640
the solution is for G to get bigger.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.880
People will say we tried G with the stimulus package and it didn't work, so that puts

12:57.880 --> 12:59.640
rest to that lie.

12:59.640 --> 13:05.560
Well, at the time, we were confronting the steepest downturn in employment and output

13:05.560 --> 13:11.440
that we'd seen even through the early months of the Great Depression, output and employment

13:11.440 --> 13:13.760
were falling faster during this financial crisis.

13:13.760 --> 13:18.840
The demand shortfall was something like $2 trillion per year.

13:18.840 --> 13:26.560
It was met by a stimulus program whose total outlays were slated to be $787 billion, about

13:26.560 --> 13:29.120
one third or so of the demand shortfall.

13:29.120 --> 13:33.240
And that was a $2 trillion year shortfall, and the stimulus was spread out over three

13:33.240 --> 13:34.240
years.

13:34.240 --> 13:40.520
It wasn't an ideally constructed stimulus package as the people who are skeptical about government

13:40.520 --> 13:47.000
will give us reason to remember anytime you send the legislative body into a room to make

13:47.000 --> 13:51.240
a bill, all sorts of bad things happen along with whatever good things might happen in

13:51.240 --> 13:52.240
the process.

13:52.240 --> 13:58.040
So the stimulus wasn't up to the task, but studies of it have shown it did some good.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
What should we do now?

13:59.040 --> 14:02.680
I say stop arguing about whether stimulus makes sense.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.680
That's an abstract argument that can play out in the economics journals.

14:06.680 --> 14:12.360
I think it will be resolved in favor of the stimulus approach, but in the meantime, I'm

14:12.360 --> 14:16.240
going to make a proposal that I made in a debate I had with P.J.O.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.000
Rourke last fall.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.680
He and I met at the Cornell Club to discuss what should we do about the ailing economy.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.480
He wasn't inclined at the outset to agree with anything I might say on that subject,

14:28.480 --> 14:34.760
but at the end of the session, we went and did a radio interview together and pushed

14:34.760 --> 14:39.640
a common set of proposals which we then elaborated in an op-ed we published a month later.

14:39.640 --> 14:45.200
So let me just say what the solution is that I think every reasonable person ought to be

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
able to embrace.

14:46.200 --> 14:51.640
And that is we've got the American Society of Civil Engineers report card on America

14:51.640 --> 14:53.520
sitting in front of us.

14:53.520 --> 14:59.360
They've identified $2 trillion worth of desperately overdue maintenance projects in the national

14:59.360 --> 15:01.120
infrastructure sphere.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.360
Now you could say they're engineers, they're just trying to drum up business for themselves,

15:05.360 --> 15:06.760
a fair point.

15:06.760 --> 15:11.200
But as anyone who's driven around New York in a test from firsthand experience, there

15:11.200 --> 15:16.480
is really quite a big inventory of unmet infrastructure repair around the country.

15:16.480 --> 15:21.480
Manhattan dumped how many hundreds of millions of gallons of raw sewage into the East River

15:21.480 --> 15:22.480
last summer.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.920
There are systems failing all around the country.

15:25.920 --> 15:31.400
If we want to rebuild infrastructure, there's never going to be a time cheaper to do it than

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
now.

15:32.400 --> 15:38.680
The Department of Transportation Nevada identified a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 80 in that

15:38.680 --> 15:41.240
state that could be brought up to speed today.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.680
It's very badly tattered.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.920
It could be brought up to speed today for $6 million outlay.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.280
That's for the 10-mile stretch.

15:48.280 --> 15:54.160
If we wait two years they estimated the repairs, the same repairs, will cost $30 million.

15:54.160 --> 15:59.680
Not taking into account any of the temporary shortfall in demand that we're facing.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.280
Just because the roadbed would get more heavily disrupted and we'd have to dig it out deeper

16:04.280 --> 16:10.080
and the repairs would escalate five-fold with two years' wait.

16:10.080 --> 16:16.520
Throw on top of that the observation that the people who could do those jobs are many of

16:16.520 --> 16:18.720
them sitting idle today.

16:18.720 --> 16:23.720
They would not have to be bid away from other useful tasks as they would be if we wait until

16:23.720 --> 16:28.440
the economy is back on its feet before we attend to that.

16:28.440 --> 16:33.560
There's equipment that is needed to do those jobs sitting idle in the yards.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.680
Materials are cheap now in world markets because the whole world is in a downturn still.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.440
The interest rates on the money needed to finance these projects have never been lower

16:42.440 --> 16:43.840
than they are right now.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.720
If we wait, all those costs are going to go up.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.720
The capital dome is crumbling.

16:48.720 --> 16:54.520
The Northeast rail corridor desperately needs capital improvements.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.440
When is the time to do that?

16:56.440 --> 16:58.000
Right now is the time to do that.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.680
That would increase spending.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.760
It would put money into the hands of people who would go out and spend it on other things

17:03.760 --> 17:05.360
and it would begin to circulate.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.480
That's the traditional stimulus problem.

17:07.480 --> 17:12.120
But even if it did none of those things, we would get jobs done that need to be done

17:12.120 --> 17:15.960
at a fraction of the cost that will end up incurring if we have to wait.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.680
So, again, that's what I see as the most important thing.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.160
The most important and pressing problem.

17:21.160 --> 17:26.600
I think there's an easy way to make progress on that problem that all people of goodwill

17:26.600 --> 17:28.000
ought to be able to agree on.

17:28.000 --> 17:34.640
What PJ O'Rourke and I recommended was send a bipartisan commission into a room with a

17:34.640 --> 17:40.720
report card on the American infrastructure and allow them to identify which project should

17:40.720 --> 17:44.040
not be funded for immediate green light.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.320
All others get the green light and we start work on them right away.

17:48.320 --> 17:52.640
If people want to object, we can't borrow more money to finance more government spending.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.640
The debt is already crippling our grandchildren.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.640
That's an incoherent objection if you think about it more carefully.

18:00.640 --> 18:05.840
Think about a family trying to decide whether to put insulation in its attic because energy

18:05.840 --> 18:08.160
prices went up.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.400
It's going to have to borrow money to do that.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.600
We'll have to go into debt further than it's already in debt.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.160
Should it do it?

18:15.160 --> 18:21.000
Answer the question, can't be determined without looking at the logic of the investment.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.680
If the investment is going to cost 50 a month to pay off the loan for doing the work and

18:25.680 --> 18:30.880
it's going to reduce their utilities bill by 100 a month, there's no cogent argument

18:30.880 --> 18:33.800
against doing that investment right away.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
And the sooner you do it, the better.

18:35.800 --> 18:40.560
That's the situation we're in with infrastructure and we could get the economy back on its feet

18:40.560 --> 18:41.720
in a hurry.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.360
Once we get the economy back on its feet, we'll have to worry about what to do about budget

18:45.360 --> 18:50.240
deficits which are truly an important long run problem, what to do about health care

18:50.240 --> 18:55.480
costs which are a big important part of that problem and a host of other things will get

18:55.480 --> 18:59.800
into that as the panel unfolds.

18:59.800 --> 19:06.840
That's my claim about what we could do now that no reasonable person should object to.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.680
And let me just invite.

19:08.680 --> 19:12.720
In a clockwise fashion, Jeffrey, do you want to take first crack at all there?

19:12.720 --> 19:17.200
Okay, so I'm not going to come back to your specific remarks in a second.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.480
The question that was posed was why do economists disagree and just to prove that economists

19:21.480 --> 19:27.360
are truly disagreeable, I'm going to disagree with the proposition that economists disagree.

19:27.360 --> 19:32.040
Of course they do disagree, but I want to argue that in an important sense, they agree

19:32.040 --> 19:36.160
and they agree way more than many other disciplines.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.400
What they agree upon is a methodology.

19:39.400 --> 19:44.440
Economists, across political perspectives, across which school they were trained at or

19:44.440 --> 19:50.760
whatever, they agree that we should have models that are mainly mathematical models sometimes

19:50.760 --> 19:55.680
are written down in words but could be written in mathematical equations, that we should

19:55.680 --> 20:01.840
think about those models as generating testable hypotheses, meaning statements about the world

20:01.840 --> 20:06.400
or forecasts about the world that one could examine with data and in principle, if you

20:06.400 --> 20:13.160
had the right kind of data, either reject or fail to reject and so, like any science,

20:13.160 --> 20:17.480
we would be able to see which models, which hypotheses about the world seemed to fit the

20:17.480 --> 20:19.600
world and which one didn't.

20:19.600 --> 20:26.440
Now of course, you should say to me, if all economists agree with that, then how come there's

20:26.440 --> 20:32.000
so much disagreement about many things, including relatively technical factual type things,

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
why because we can't do controlled experiments for the most part?

20:35.000 --> 20:39.080
Now there is a branch of economics that does a lot of experiments, hey, I'm going to leave

20:39.080 --> 20:43.920
that aside because they're not quite experiments in the same sense as a biologist can do an

20:43.920 --> 20:47.560
experiment on whether watering plants helps them grow or not.

20:47.560 --> 20:52.440
When economists experiment on people, they know they're being experimented on and that

20:52.440 --> 20:54.880
might affect the outcome to the experiments.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.880
For a whole bunch of things we care about, such as the stimulus, it is impossible to do

20:59.880 --> 21:02.880
a real double blind placebo controlled experiment.

21:02.880 --> 21:07.880
We don't have a parallel universe in which Ben Bernanke did not increase the money stock

21:07.880 --> 21:12.880
or in which the Obama administration did not propose a stimulus, so we can't really know

21:12.880 --> 21:17.280
whether the Keynesian model is accurate or not or to what parts of it are accurate and

21:17.280 --> 21:18.280
things like that.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.440
Can historical information help you?

21:21.440 --> 21:27.840
Social episodes are almost always frequently contaminated by the fact that there are many

21:27.840 --> 21:34.800
things going on, some of which we can't control for, and we don't always know which came first

21:34.800 --> 21:40.920
the treatment or the response or the anticipation of the treatment and then the observed response.

21:40.920 --> 21:47.400
So in Professor Frank's example, one issue that comes up is how people respond to the

21:47.400 --> 21:51.520
fiscal cliff and how are people responding to the debt and things stimulus.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.720
If people knew it was coming, they might have changed their behavior before it went into

21:55.720 --> 21:59.000
effect and that makes it harder to draw inferences from the data.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.400
So what we generally try to use is these historical sort of quasi experiments, but they're highly,

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
highly imperfect.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.760
It's really hard to disentangle the cause from the effect.

22:09.760 --> 22:15.600
So given that if we agree on methodology that says we would like to be able to do experiments,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.960
but we can't do experiments, then what happens?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.920
Then I think two really important things take over.

22:20.920 --> 22:26.080
First of all, economists, because they're people, have very different views about efficiency

22:26.080 --> 22:28.480
versus redistribution.

22:28.480 --> 22:33.480
If you can make economists across any political persuasion answer questions in a very specific

22:33.480 --> 22:39.880
way and say which of these two policies is likely to increase the size of the pie, I

22:39.880 --> 22:41.440
think you will get a lot of agreement.

22:41.440 --> 22:47.000
So in a textbook, in a setting of an academic paper, in a seminar room, there's not so much

22:47.000 --> 22:52.520
disagreement on how the model would work, what effect will have on who gets to eat the pie

22:52.520 --> 22:57.720
versus how big the pie is, but different economists have very different views on whether they

22:57.720 --> 23:03.200
think policy should emphasize making the pie bigger or trying to get the pie divided up

23:03.200 --> 23:05.720
in a fashion that's regarded as fair.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.760
Secondly, an auxiliary problem is economists disagree a lot or they just don't really

23:09.760 --> 23:15.360
know because we have even less evidence on which policies will end up being implemented

23:15.360 --> 23:18.480
by the political process in a successful way.

23:18.480 --> 23:23.520
So say in the setting of global warming, economists might tend to agree that the ideal policy

23:23.520 --> 23:28.800
is a harmonized global carbon tax, and yet they know that it's not likely that we're

23:28.800 --> 23:32.080
going to end up with a global harmonized carbon tax.

23:32.080 --> 23:37.360
And so then you're asking, well, which of the imperfect policy responses to global warming

23:37.360 --> 23:42.200
some kinds of cap and trade or Kyoto protocols or certain types of regulation on the use of

23:42.200 --> 23:46.880
carbon-based energy, which of those will get us closer to a decent policy, that depends

23:46.880 --> 23:51.040
on awful lot on politics and economists don't know much about that at all.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.800
So I think we do agree on a methodology.

23:54.800 --> 23:59.280
We disagree because we're people and we put different weights on the objectives of policy

23:59.280 --> 24:03.480
and we have different understandings about how to get particular policies to actually

24:03.480 --> 24:06.080
be adopted and implemented.

24:06.080 --> 24:13.360
So just really quickly, I'll just leave it a sentence or two for now, I disagree with

24:13.360 --> 24:18.760
some parts of what Bob said about the stimulus and about doing lots of civil engineering

24:18.760 --> 24:23.200
projects, except that if you think of the way I think about it, he basically said we

24:23.200 --> 24:30.000
should use cost-benefit analysis to decide what transportation projects we should do.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.640
If that's exactly the way the stimulus had been done, I would have been 100% but I think

24:35.640 --> 24:41.360
large parts of it did not satisfy the reasonable cost-benefit standards.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.360
Joseph?

24:42.360 --> 24:48.880
Okay, I want to follow up on something Jeff said and that is why do economists disagree?

24:48.880 --> 24:52.640
Miller Freeman gave an answer to that a long time ago when he said, well, economists don't

24:52.640 --> 24:54.200
want to disagree on ends.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.160
Everybody's in favor of prosperity.

24:56.160 --> 24:58.880
Most people accept the worst misanthropes.

24:58.880 --> 25:03.240
But we disagree about the means and the means are basically the different theories that

25:03.240 --> 25:08.840
you use to implement ways to achieve prosperity and stability and supposedly all these ends

25:08.840 --> 25:12.040
that we will agree on.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.160
I used to believe that.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.400
I don't really believe that much anymore.

25:15.400 --> 25:21.960
What I think is that we also disagree on ends, very, very deeply disagree on ends.

25:21.960 --> 25:27.960
Because once you begin to prescribe policies, tax increases would be good, you've stepped

25:27.960 --> 25:30.440
outside your role as an economist.

25:30.440 --> 25:36.280
You can describe what would happen if you increase the tax and you can disagree on that

25:36.280 --> 25:37.280
with other economists.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.960
But once you say that, I think it's good and therefore we should implement it, you are

25:40.960 --> 25:42.960
then making a value judgment.

25:42.960 --> 25:46.960
Economics, just like medicine, is a value-free subject.

25:46.960 --> 25:52.960
So a doctor can say, the point of competence of a physician is to say, well, if you put

25:52.960 --> 25:57.800
arsenic in that person's drink, then that person will, certain bodily functions will

25:57.800 --> 26:00.400
cease and that person will die.

26:00.400 --> 26:05.600
If the physician goes beyond that and says something like, and that's murder and you

26:05.600 --> 26:08.760
shouldn't do that, well, he's no longer speaking as a physician.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.240
He's speaking as a citizen with a certain scale of values.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.520
And there might be someone that wants to kill Hitler or kill a dictator.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.720
And so we don't really agree on the ends.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.400
And that's the point I would like to make.

26:23.400 --> 26:30.400
For example, I don't think a dollar spent by government on its favorite interests or bailing

26:30.400 --> 26:35.240
out big corporations and especially financial institutions, I don't think that's equal to

26:35.240 --> 26:39.400
a dollar spent by a family who earns the money.

26:39.400 --> 26:43.760
In other words, I want to make a distinction between taxpayers, people who produce and

26:43.760 --> 26:47.280
earn through exchange on the market, and tax consumers.

26:47.280 --> 26:52.320
That distinction was made a long time ago by a political theorist, John C. Calhoun.

26:52.320 --> 26:56.200
And what Calhoun said was, look, society, the only two classes in society, forget about

26:56.200 --> 27:00.320
men and women, blacks and whites, gays and straits, the only two real classes that you

27:00.320 --> 27:06.740
see in every society throughout history are the tax consumers, those that live by either

27:06.740 --> 27:11.840
taxing without giving something in exchange or printing money, and those who live by the

27:11.840 --> 27:13.600
sweat of their brow.

27:13.600 --> 27:22.320
So I look at the economy as in class conflict from the beginning to its very, very depths

27:22.320 --> 27:28.800
between those who live through government and those who live by earning, by producing

27:28.800 --> 27:33.520
what consumers desire, whether or not an outsider, like myself or Bob, likes what's being produced

27:33.520 --> 27:38.000
by the market, whether it's pornography or Beethoven concertos.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
That's besides the point.

27:40.000 --> 27:44.400
So just to get to Bob's point, I do want to say that I disagree that there's a spending

27:44.400 --> 27:45.880
shortfall.

27:45.880 --> 27:50.920
I think in fact that what has occurred is that we have a regime uncertainty that is entrepreneurs

27:50.920 --> 27:56.280
after coming off the euphoria of the boom from 2001 to 2005, realize that they were

27:56.280 --> 27:58.280
deeply wrong about things.

27:58.280 --> 28:02.920
Now, the Federal Reserve during that period increased the money supply by officials'

28:02.920 --> 28:08.160
fed statistics at about $1 billion per day for five straight years.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.880
Heat the interest rate down to 1%.

28:10.880 --> 28:17.200
I think this caused tremendous profit and loss miscalculations, caused over development

28:17.200 --> 28:22.560
of certain sectors, housing and so on, and instead of allowing prices to, asset values

28:22.560 --> 28:28.960
to drop, now they pumped up household net worth that is the value of your homes and the value

28:28.960 --> 28:36.640
of your 401ks by $23 trillion, okay, in the course of three years.

28:36.640 --> 28:42.680
Then the crisis struck you had a drop of about $15 trillion in household net worth, which

28:42.680 --> 28:49.560
was equal to the annual GDP of Japan, Great Britain and Germany, instead of allowing asset

28:49.560 --> 28:53.480
prices to adjust, instead of allowing other prices to adjust, other costs and so on to

28:53.480 --> 28:57.640
adjust, in the downward direction, which is what should have happened.

28:57.640 --> 29:04.240
What happened was that we had stimulus and then we had QE1, QE2 and QE infinity now, right?

29:04.240 --> 29:10.000
There's $40 billion every month being pumped in to buy mortgage-backed securities.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.520
I think that is giving pause to entrepreneurship in this country.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.160
They don't know what's going to happen with a fiscal cliff, beyond that is the huge debt

29:18.160 --> 29:25.040
that's going to continue to grow and I think that the uncertainty about Obamacare is something

29:25.040 --> 29:27.280
else that's causing all of this to happen.

29:27.280 --> 29:31.520
If we're really worried about spending and I'll stop after this sentence, let's suspend

29:31.520 --> 29:33.640
the income tax, the personal income tax for one year.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.960
Let's just suspend it.

29:35.960 --> 29:40.240
That was actually put forth by a few economists right after the financial crisis.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.000
I'm all in favor of that, two years.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.080
Then we'll have people with productive saving instead of expanding credit to get more spending.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.400
We'll have productive saving and we'll have consumers, earners, arranging their affairs

29:54.400 --> 29:57.000
in a way that brings them greater satisfaction.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.840
I'll stop there.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.800
It was proposed to eliminate the payroll tax.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.360
Was that a proposal that you favored as well, Joseph?

30:06.360 --> 30:13.840
Well, depending, the income tax brings in between 42 and 47 percent of federal revenues.

30:13.840 --> 30:20.200
The payroll tax may be on a 48 percent, either one is fine for me.

30:20.200 --> 30:25.200
Yeah, it was proposed and defeated in the IRS.

30:25.200 --> 30:32.760
Graciela, did you have an axe to grind in any of this or feel free, obviously, to go

30:32.760 --> 30:40.800
off in your own direction?

30:40.800 --> 30:49.600
First of all, the question that we are meeting here about why economists disagree.

30:49.600 --> 30:56.600
Excuse me, we can't hear you.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.600
So maybe there is a...

30:58.600 --> 31:00.600
Can you increase the...

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
Hello?

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
Just go ahead.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Good thing that you're fine.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
They'll turn you up.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.600
They'll turn you up.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
You just continue.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.600
Okay.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.600
So, can you hear me now?

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
No.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.600
No, they're not.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Just keep talking.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.600
How about now?

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
They'll just have to keep talking.

31:17.600 --> 31:18.600
Okay.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.600
Yes.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.600
Yes.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.600
The lady there.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.600
Yes.

31:23.600 --> 31:24.600
Good.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.600
Thank you.

31:25.600 --> 31:32.600
So the question that we're here to address, first of all, why do economists disagree?

31:32.600 --> 31:42.600
And here I have to agree with Jeff that, in fact, we agreed too much.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.600
Let me explain what I mean.

31:46.600 --> 31:52.600
The human being has several nervous systems, at least three.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.600
We have the central nervous system.

31:55.600 --> 32:00.600
We have the brain.

32:00.600 --> 32:07.600
We have the gut, which is the sympathetic nervous system.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.600
They don't agree with each other.

32:09.600 --> 32:14.600
As a matter of fact, when your gut wants to eat, but your brain wants to lose weight.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.600
Does anybody face that phenomenon?

32:19.600 --> 32:21.600
All the time, right?

32:21.600 --> 32:23.600
So, we are a composite.

32:23.600 --> 32:31.600
As a matter of fact, 95% of the DNA of a human body is microbial DNA.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.600
It's not even human.

32:33.600 --> 32:42.600
So, it would be seriously surprising that people that have so different nervous systems, which

32:42.600 --> 32:50.600
are the reactions that we have to the environment and we want to act and make decisions, would

32:50.600 --> 32:54.600
agree, because we, I don't think we can agree with ourselves.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
Number one.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
And there is a good reason for that.

32:58.600 --> 33:04.600
Nevertheless, some of what was said here, I have to agree with.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.600
And some I have to disagree with.

33:07.600 --> 33:12.600
But I want to take a slightly different perspective.

33:12.600 --> 33:17.600
I do understand the importance of focusing on the crisis and getting out of it.

33:17.600 --> 33:28.600
I do understand that there are many people unemployed and most families I know are in trouble, one way or the other.

33:28.600 --> 33:36.600
I understand this is a very painful situation for the majority of people in the nation.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.600
And therefore, I don't want to skirt that issue.

33:39.600 --> 33:43.600
But I have to agree here with Joseph.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.600
I didn't do anything.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.600
No, I know.

33:47.600 --> 34:02.600
I had to agree with Joseph that the proposal, in fact, I made to the Obama administration in 2008, which is partly being implemented now,

34:02.600 --> 34:13.600
and it really goes back to an unstickfully inflated market, and we have to allow somehow those practices to adjust.

34:13.600 --> 34:20.600
And if we just did that in the right way, and there are right ways of doing it,

34:20.600 --> 34:26.600
we can get to a balanced situation without so much pain.

34:26.600 --> 34:36.600
Here is where I probably will disagree with Joseph, in that everybody has to pay change and not just the homeowners.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.600
And this includes the banks.

34:39.600 --> 34:49.600
And the banks have been part of the problem, not the only part of the problem, but the significant part of the problem.

34:49.600 --> 35:00.600
And as I can see, we didn't get around to correct the situation with financial and the banking system the way most people would like to see.

35:00.600 --> 35:10.600
And there is no reason why the unemployed people and the taxpayers should pay for that enormous bubble that was created by the financial institutions,

35:10.600 --> 35:14.600
and that created so much suffering that has to be resolved.

35:14.600 --> 35:25.600
And one of the reasons there is such a lingering of this current crisis in terms of the press demand is because we haven't dealt with that problem.

35:25.600 --> 35:35.600
And there are ways to do it, and negotiation properly done, and affecting everybody, not just the homeowners and including the banks.

35:35.600 --> 35:46.600
Yes, sir, including the banks, a sacred cow that shouldn't be a sacred cow. It's an institution, like anything else we created then.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.600
And in fact, they are under revision.

35:49.600 --> 35:58.600
So for all of these reasons, I partly agree with Joseph, I partly agree with Bob.

35:58.600 --> 36:09.600
But I have to say all of this in a way is the topic that was chosen by Bob, very important topic.

36:09.600 --> 36:15.600
He wants us to focus on how to get out of the recession. We all need to know that.

36:15.600 --> 36:19.600
But I want to be a little bit more demanding.

36:19.600 --> 36:30.600
We're easy to rationalize an economy, but we're the way out of the recession and the situation in which there is so much suffering.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.600
Let me put the emphasis on suffering.

36:33.600 --> 36:39.600
I am shocked about the amount of employment in the United States right now.

36:39.600 --> 36:43.600
I'm shocked about the amount of suffering. It's unnecessary.

36:43.600 --> 36:50.600
And it's cruel. It's cruel and it's going to be felt for generations. And we ought to be doing something about that right now.

36:50.600 --> 37:06.600
I don't want to gild a little. But have you said that the situation now should not be one where we resolve the issue by inflating consumption?

37:06.600 --> 37:15.600
And that was the first see in the equation that Bob was telling us. I'm not criticizing Bob. He's right.

37:15.600 --> 37:26.600
That's the question we learned where the economy output has at least 75% or 2 thirds whatever is consumption. I got it.

37:26.600 --> 37:36.600
But I think everybody around here realizes that an economy that can only resolve its problems and stop suffering by inflating consumption

37:36.600 --> 37:43.600
when we are the highest consuming nation in the world, something is wrong there.

37:43.600 --> 37:56.600
So without going into much detail, we are in a moment of change. We are changing values.

37:56.600 --> 38:08.600
Better to face that change. Getting out of this depression, this recession and depression, and the future ones and the volatility that will continue to come

38:08.600 --> 38:17.600
should not be about increasing consumption. We need to fundamentally restructure our thinking of the economy.

38:17.600 --> 38:28.600
I call this the green Eisenhower moment. And he agreed with Bob. Eisenhower would not so well want to do in this situation.

38:28.600 --> 38:45.600
Think about it. He created the network of roads in the 50s. He created the waterways in California. He even put the first satellites on and created in a way the telecommunication system

38:45.600 --> 38:50.600
which is fundamental for globalization. Eisenhower would know what to do about this.

38:50.600 --> 38:57.600
And nobody will be sitting here criticizing Eisenhower because of government action, as far as I know.

38:57.600 --> 39:04.600
So this is the Eisenhower moment, but I want to say it must be green Eisenhower.

39:04.600 --> 39:21.600
And here I go into Oscar Wilde. Oscar Wilde said, not the only one, that an economist like all of us are people who know the price of everything and the value of nothing.

39:21.600 --> 39:32.600
I suspect we're going to end up agreeing on quite a lot amongst this panel. And that's not a bad thing, even if people are disappointed that they didn't see more fireworks.

39:32.600 --> 39:39.600
But the value of nothing means that we start to change our values. We are changing our values.

39:39.600 --> 39:48.600
And here I wanted to add something that Jeff mentioned. The carbon market that he mentioned, it's the protocol in which I did the writing, which I designed,

39:48.600 --> 39:54.600
is really about changing values, global values, because that's what market prices represent.

39:54.600 --> 40:02.600
They represent our values going out of whack right now. And we're trying to change values and creating these new markets.

40:02.600 --> 40:11.600
And by the way, here I disagree, the new values don't pit equity and efficiency against each other.

40:11.600 --> 40:23.600
We are no longer in the zero-sum economy because the foundation of this economy now, and this change that is coming, is a public good, is knowledge.

40:23.600 --> 40:31.600
And knowledge can be shared without losing it. So right then and there, believe it or not, we are no longer in the zero-sum economy.

40:31.600 --> 40:45.600
So we can take advantage of what's coming, we can do this change of value, and we can incorporate all these changes, and we have to do it, because I think particularly the young people, and there are a few here, but not that many.

40:45.600 --> 40:57.600
I think the young people feel, and they're right, we screwed up the world economy for them. And another way of saying is, I'm just looking at this single young person I see there.

40:57.600 --> 41:05.600
No guy, let me just tell you, either you do it, nobody is going to do it except the young people, I tell that my students are Colombia.

41:05.600 --> 41:11.600
We got to change the way we're going around the economy, which is what Oscar Wilde was talking about.

41:11.600 --> 41:18.600
And the young will have to do it, because it's true that we screwed it up. So in the direction.

41:18.600 --> 41:27.600
The public good aspect is an important part of the conversation, but to go back to one of Joseph's points.

41:27.600 --> 41:47.600
I think the agreement is much broader among economists than your analysis of the equity versus efficiency issue might have suggested, because right now we are enmeshed in such deeply inefficient situations.

41:47.600 --> 41:56.600
I think this is part of Graciel's work, that the old saying that economists like to throw out, there's no such thing as a free lunch.

41:56.600 --> 42:09.600
That means if you get more of this, you have to settle for less of that. That's true when you're doing things as well as they can be done at the moment, but when you're being grossly inefficient, it's possible to make the pie bigger.

42:09.600 --> 42:18.600
That's what inefficient means in our parlance. And here's a graph I show my students 50 times if I show it to them once during the term.

42:18.600 --> 42:33.600
It's two pies side by side, one bigger than the other. And the slogan that they can all shout out in unison after the third or fourth time is that when the pie gets bigger, everyone can get a bigger slice than before.

42:33.600 --> 42:49.600
And so when you're moving from inefficient to efficient, it's just a failure of whipped, not to be able to come up with a scheme for dividing up the new larger pie in such a way that everybody sees advantage in making that move.

42:49.600 --> 43:00.600
So that doesn't sound like a recipe for controversy if you can actually talk about policies that would make the pie bigger, and I think your carbon taxes, people's exhibit...

43:00.600 --> 43:03.600
Carbon market, not that bad. Carbon market.

43:03.600 --> 43:22.600
Okay, you can educate the rest of us about why a carbon market and a carbon tax are two different things, but getting people to take the right price on activities that discharge carbon into the air is a very important part of doing things efficiently.

43:22.600 --> 43:32.600
We're not doing that now, and if we do that, then that's not going to make the economy have to scramble for more resources. It's going to save resources.

43:32.600 --> 43:40.600
And if you have a bigger pie than before, you ought to be able to sell that to the electorate because there's a way to divide up a bigger pie that makes everybody happier.

43:40.600 --> 43:44.600
And so I think there we could get into arguments.

43:44.600 --> 43:55.600
I mean, once we have a fixed pie and we have to decide who gets much share of it, there's obvious room for argument, but while we have room to expand the pie, there ought to be low hanging fruit for agreement.

43:55.600 --> 44:05.600
The pie is the economist metaphor for the total value of everything we care about.

44:05.600 --> 44:19.600
We have to stress that it's a very inclusive measure. It's got to include the nuisance value of noise, the risks to life and safety, the concerns you have about everything that might matter to you.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.600
So that's the pie.

44:21.600 --> 44:31.600
And if people are making decisions, ignoring costs that they impose on others, one simple example, I can get on a congested roadway for free in most parts of the country.

44:31.600 --> 44:37.600
When I do that, I make everybody who's on that roadway take longer to get where she's trying to get to.

44:37.600 --> 44:43.600
I impose a big cost. It might be worth a dollar extra to me to go at that time on that roadway.

44:43.600 --> 44:50.600
The cumulative nuisance to everybody else having to wait longer to get where they're going might be tens of thousands of dollars.

44:50.600 --> 44:56.600
So my case for being able to get on that roadway for free is a non-starter.

44:56.600 --> 45:05.600
I have no right to assert in that situation. Unless you think I have a right to harm others, willy-dilly without compensation, that's a strange political system.

45:05.600 --> 45:09.600
If you think people would bargain freely for a system that gave you that right.

45:09.600 --> 45:15.600
So there are all sorts of things we do now that cause harm to others that we don't take into account.

45:15.600 --> 45:25.600
And if you want to think about long-run budget solvency, nobody who's looked at the numbers thinks we can get there by cutting out wasteful government spending.

45:25.600 --> 45:31.600
There is wasteful government spending, but when we try to cut government spending, we cut what we can.

45:31.600 --> 45:37.600
Every program has its defenders. We cut the ones whose defenders scream least loudly.

45:37.600 --> 45:45.600
What did Bush cut? Bush cut the energy department's program for rounding up poorly guarded nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union.

45:45.600 --> 45:53.600
These are materials that are in poorly fortified centers guarded by soldiers who aren't paid regularly or drink too much.

45:53.600 --> 45:59.600
Paris want these materials. We shouldn't cut the budget for that program. We should increase it, but we cut it.

45:59.600 --> 46:07.600
We cut the National Science Foundation's budget for scientific research, the backbone of our competitive advantage historically.

46:07.600 --> 46:15.600
So cutting government spending, if you find wasteful government spending, you can get legislators to agree to cut well and good.

46:15.600 --> 46:24.600
But everybody who's really looked at the numbers thinks we need additional revenue, especially when you look at the tens of millions of retirements that are coming in the next years.

46:24.600 --> 46:28.600
And so that means you've got to figure out where to get the extra revenue.

46:28.600 --> 46:35.600
And I think a good place to focus attention in that discussion is on things that we do too much of to begin with.

46:35.600 --> 46:41.600
A tax has two effects. It raises revenue, but it also discourages the thing you tax.

46:41.600 --> 46:47.600
And if there are things we do now that cause harm to others that we're not taxing, voila.

46:47.600 --> 46:52.600
That's a possibility for killing two birds with one stone. You can...

46:52.600 --> 46:54.600
Oh, no killing birds.

46:54.600 --> 46:59.600
All right. Give me your metaphor of choice.

46:59.600 --> 47:05.600
We can solve two important problems at once if we shift our focus in that way.

47:05.600 --> 47:11.600
So let's just... This is a loosely organized panel, Jeff.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.600
I can't tell you what to talk about.

47:13.600 --> 47:28.600
I'm going to come back to Gratzel's statement that the banks should have paid more of the costs of recognizing that housing prices had been inflated to values which weren't true values and related to arguments about policy and the response to the financial crisis and as illustration of economists disagreeing.

47:28.600 --> 47:43.600
So lots and lots of people were very upset that there were bailouts, that banks were helped out because banks seemed to have been sort of very, very importantly involved in the fact that housing prices got excessive, the too much mortgage lending was extended and so on.

47:43.600 --> 47:49.600
So one view was, well, these banks did silly things. They're about to lose a lot of money. Let them lose money.

47:49.600 --> 47:56.600
They're the ones who should take the hit. Of course, some homeowners would take hits as well because they could... No matter what, they couldn't afford the mortgage as they had.

47:56.600 --> 48:01.600
But make banks take a large share. Now, that's not what happened for the most part in D.C.

48:01.600 --> 48:10.600
For the most part, the federal government, the Treasury in combination with the Fed and Ben Bernanke in particular, basically pushed really hard for the banks to take money.

48:10.600 --> 48:25.600
Why? Because they had a model in their heads. It's actually the model that Ben Bernanke, more or less, is responsible for in the economic literature in conjunction with a few other scholars that was work he did in the 1980s when he was still an academic economist.

48:25.600 --> 48:34.600
In his model of the world, when banks fail, it's not just or any big institutions fail. It's not just that some wealth is redistributed.

48:34.600 --> 48:44.600
The really simple view, the sort of pretty Bernanke view, if you will, of a bank failure is, well, some loans are made based on expectations that something good projects were going to happen.

48:44.600 --> 48:53.600
A lot of profits were going to be made. But somebody was mistaken. Those profits didn't occur. And so now that loan can't be repaid, somebody has to take the hit.

48:53.600 --> 49:02.600
If a meteor had come down and destroyed half the housing stock, there's no magic wand that magically would be created that housing stock. It's just gone. Somebody has to take the hit.

49:02.600 --> 49:12.600
So one view was, housing is worth much less than we thought. Somebody has to eat that. Maybe it's the homeowners, maybe it's the banks, but somebody has to take it.

49:12.600 --> 49:26.600
And to give it to say that the banks were insulated was a kind of redistribution, was a statement about who bears the costs that clearly lots of people from many economists to occupy Wall Street found really unappealing.

49:26.600 --> 49:38.600
So why did Ben Bernanke and Paulson and a Republican administration, after all, which gave us TARP, defend the notion that we had to protect all these banks, that we didn't want to let them just fail, and whatever banks survived survived.

49:38.600 --> 49:51.600
Their claim was, based on Bernanke's model, that there's an externality. There's an inefficiency when banks fail, and when one big bank, especially when very big banks fail, it affects the whole lending process.

49:51.600 --> 50:05.600
It affects the intermediation between good borrowing projects, you can good borrowers and banks, and it would have made the recession much worse than it already was going to be by virtue of the fact that clearly a lot of housing wasn't worth as much as we thought.

50:05.600 --> 50:23.600
So if you believed Ben's model, his story, that there was this negative spillover, this negative externality inefficiency from letting big banks fail, well then you could get venture self, but it was actually everybody's interest, why don't you understood what was really happening to protect the big banks.

50:23.600 --> 50:46.600
Now, if you were right, I think almost every economist would sign on. Lots of economists did sign on and agreed with that, but there was a vocal minority, for example there was a letter in Wall Street Journal in New York Times, signed by 166 economists of whom I was one, saying, no, we shouldn't be bailing out these banks, we should let them go bankrupt.

50:46.600 --> 50:54.600
Bankruptcy is the better approach. Now, there's lots of variations on bankruptcy, but for the moment just think that it meant letting them fail.

50:54.600 --> 51:05.600
So how do we resolve that? You'd like to resolve it by having observed a parallel universe in which there was a different Ben Bernanke who had let the banks fail, and then we could see what happened.

51:05.600 --> 51:11.600
As Ed suggests a few minutes ago, well, we can't obviously do that, but maybe we can look at historical examples.

51:11.600 --> 51:20.600
There are not a ton of historical examples that one can point to. I've asked a bunch of my friends, my colleagues, or economists, what's the evidence that letting really big...

51:20.600 --> 51:26.600
... some years ago in terms of what happened to Argentina, isn't that historical evidence?

51:26.600 --> 51:34.600
It's historical evidence, but it's contaminated by a lot of things. Most of the places where a lot of big banks have gotten in trouble have been places where a lot of bad things were already happening.

51:34.600 --> 51:47.600
How do you figure out how much of what happened after those big banks failed was going to happen anyway because a bunch of bad things were already in process, and how much was actually caused or exacerbated by the fact that those banks failed?

51:47.600 --> 51:55.600
So every single one of my friends pointed to the same academic study as proof that bank failures caused these big externalities.

51:55.600 --> 52:01.600
It happens to be a paper written by Ben Bernanke, was published in the American Economic Review in 1983, and it's about the Great Depression.

52:01.600 --> 52:08.600
Now first of all, it wasn't about big banks. It was about small banks. The distribution of bank sizes was very different.

52:08.600 --> 52:14.600
So in minimum, it's not entirely on point because it was a somewhat different experiment.

52:14.600 --> 52:20.600
But secondly, the paper turns out to be not very robust. It turns out the results are fragile.

52:20.600 --> 52:24.600
And it's one piece of evidence in a non-experimental setting.

52:24.600 --> 52:31.600
So there's room for economists to disagree. And I don't want to necessarily, I mean, I have taken sides, but that's not my purpose.

52:31.600 --> 52:37.600
The same thing is we disagree because we can't do experiments. We can't figure out things where everyone would agree.

52:37.600 --> 52:46.600
If you could have that parallel universe run the experiment, then we would all, based on a common methodology, have common policy recommendations.

52:46.600 --> 52:55.600
Can I respond to that? Bob brought up the point about the political feasibility of cutting spending.

52:55.600 --> 53:02.600
But I think there is room, even politically, to cut spending. The US is a big welfare warfare state.

53:02.600 --> 53:08.600
There's a lot of spending on welfare, mainly corporate welfare, by the way, and a lot of spending on warfare.

53:08.600 --> 53:14.600
Again, both of the pockets of big corporations. What I want to suggest is that

53:14.600 --> 53:28.600
cutting a defense budget is a beautiful thing. I mean, right now the US spends about 750 billion to $1 trillion per year, depending on all budget items.

53:28.600 --> 53:37.600
That's about 5% to 7% of our GDP. We spend 43% of world military spending. The US spends that much.

53:37.600 --> 53:44.600
We spend 8 times more than China, next biggest military spending. 14 times more than Russia.

53:44.600 --> 53:55.600
We spend 53% more than the other top 10 military spenders. 53% more than all other 9 combined, including Germany and Great Britain and France and so on.

53:55.600 --> 54:02.600
We spend 106 billion on intelligence. We have 9,600 warheads. China has 300.

54:02.600 --> 54:11.600
It's estimated that with 1,000 can kill everybody instantly. With 300 can kill a lot of people instantly, and then pretty much the rest of the world through disease and so on.

54:11.600 --> 54:16.600
To make a long story short, there's a big area to cut.

54:16.600 --> 54:24.600
And that is to stop the wars in Afghanistan and Iran, which have cost us over $1.3 trillion, or $1.5 trillion, depending on who you believe.

54:24.600 --> 54:36.600
Stop the war spending. Close the military bases. We have 700 to 900, depending on who you believe, military bases in 130 countries.

54:36.600 --> 54:41.600
Close them all down. China has zero. Russia has three or four in foreign countries. Close them all down.

54:41.600 --> 54:46.600
You can cut the defense budget in half. Now, there's billions there.

54:46.600 --> 54:52.600
So you can satisfy the Democrats by cutting warfare, or at least the left Democrats.

54:52.600 --> 54:58.600
Most Democrats want to cut warfare a little bit and increase welfare. That's what we saw with Obama.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.600
They just want to increase warfare spending and cut welfare spending.

55:03.600 --> 55:13.600
Well, once you've done that, and that's what Reagan should have done in the early 80s, when he had the chance, we were in a deep crisis when it cut across the board, then, and this ought to be, Bob, will this agree with?

55:13.600 --> 55:18.600
I'm sure. You can zero out some of the so-called welfare agencies.

55:18.600 --> 55:29.600
The agricultural department, which is the big subsidy to agribusiness, you can zero that out. Get rid of that. Get rid of the commerce department, which basically is a marketing program for big firms overseas to increase their exports.

55:29.600 --> 55:34.600
You can get rid of the Department of Education, which we did not have for most of American history, and so on.

55:34.600 --> 55:43.600
So you can cut on both sides, and you can get a coalition of both groups to support that by saying, look, we have a tremendous crisis here.

55:43.600 --> 55:51.600
And, by the way, those resources would then be infused back into the private economy to be used productively.

55:51.600 --> 55:56.600
What's the example of a country where this grand bargain has ever been carried out?

55:56.600 --> 56:00.600
What's the example of a superpower that spends half of what everybody has?

56:00.600 --> 56:12.600
I agree that the US spends way too much in defense, and I agree that with almost everything you said about what would be desirable, but I have to agree with Bob that the political prospect, any kind of grand bargain like that, are seen infinitesimal based on our own.

56:12.600 --> 56:22.600
What can we all agree with that shape? At least we four agree that it would be a good idea to make very large cuts in the defense budget.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.600
I agree with that. I agree with that.

56:24.600 --> 56:27.600
You agree with that, Graciela? Do you agree with that?

56:27.600 --> 56:32.600
Yes, I think the main thing is to stop these uncerely wars.

56:32.600 --> 56:34.600
That would be a start.

56:34.600 --> 56:44.600
Those wars cost much more than what is recorded under the billions of dollars that are spent in defense, which is less than 8% of the GDP.

56:44.600 --> 56:52.600
Those wars are, you know, they are sinking our reputation globally.

56:52.600 --> 56:57.600
They are necessary. They are not getting anything from the nation, and they are costing trillions.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.600
They're making us hate it. They're making us hate it the world over.

57:00.600 --> 57:02.600
We've developed endless enemies.

57:02.600 --> 57:07.600
We can add that to the list of low-hanging fruit, and then we can all agree to that.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.600
On the other hand, if we were in power.

57:09.600 --> 57:12.600
But remember, that's bad from a stimulus perspective.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.600
You'd want to replace that spending with some other spinners.

57:15.600 --> 57:21.600
Paul Krugman's makeup on murder and invasion, and he's existed exactly the opposite of we'd agree to.

57:21.600 --> 57:31.600
He said, we should convince the country that the Martians are invading, and so we need to build a ton of anti-martial missiles and tanks or whatever, because that would be more government spending.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.600
And I think he believes it.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
Paul Krugman.

57:36.600 --> 57:38.600
He's a speaker.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.600
He's a speaker.

57:39.600 --> 57:54.600
He's another way to do something like that, but without necessarily focusing on military expansion.

57:54.600 --> 58:02.600
And again, I want to say the last speech of Eisenhower was about unnecessary military expansion.

58:02.600 --> 58:08.600
I'm sorry to emphasize Eisenhower so much, but I think the guy was a genius.

58:08.600 --> 58:22.600
Anyway, so, but what I wanted to say about that is that there are things like that with a low-hanging fruit and could play that role and do good at the same time instead of kill people all over the innocent people.

58:22.600 --> 58:27.600
Civilians all over the world.

58:27.600 --> 58:46.600
The Chinese, the Indians, and essentially the brick country, but mostly China and India have benefited to the tune of $50 billion, just $50 billion in the last six years, from the Kyoto Protocol Carbon Market Clean Development Mechanism,

58:46.600 --> 58:56.600
which means that this market doesn't cost money to anybody, the carbon market, which is now mandatory in California.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.600
And yes, as of 2012.

58:59.600 --> 59:11.600
And which is now growing in four continents, Australia, Asia, the European Union, where it's trading $215 billion a year and the Americas.

59:11.600 --> 59:17.600
This market has nothing to nobody.

59:17.600 --> 59:19.600
Nobody has to put money for it.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.600
It makes money.

59:21.600 --> 59:26.600
It is different from a carbon tax because a carbon tax, you give money to the government.

59:26.600 --> 59:32.600
And if you're going to have a global government to give tax to, I don't think so.

59:32.600 --> 59:41.600
It's not going to happen at least not in many years that the United States will contribute to a global government that collects taxes.

59:41.600 --> 59:59.600
On the other hand, the United States is moving through the California carbon market and through the federal March 27, 2012 limits on carbon emissions from power plants who kill a lot of children through asthma.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:05.600
The US is moving in the direction of convergence with the global carbon market.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.600
Why? It's called no arbitrage.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:17.600
Markets you can have to market, solid by side, one charging, one price and another one charging another.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:28.600
So the California carbon market and the federal carbon market, the March 27, 2012 resolution supported by the Supreme Court,

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.600
Will sponsor, will create, I can explain, will converge.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600
All of these markets are going to converge.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:49.600
They created the largest exporter of solar and wind equipment in the world in five years through those $50 billion I told you about.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.600
Who is this? China. Wait.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.600
Why is China benefiting from it and not us?

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:03.600
Simple. Because China not only signed like we did, but it also ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.600
We could be benefiting from that.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:21.600
We have the best technology in the United States, the best innovation we need, that no energy, clean energy that changes values in the right direction and involves the best thing that this nation has.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.600
How do I know? Because I benefited from it.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.600
I was born in Argentina and I did my educational system here.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:34.600
Let me tell you, this is the best educational system in the world, particularly the graduate level.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:42.600
And in terms of risk capital, respect of property rights is the best territory for the knowledge economy.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.600
And the knowledge economy, we are leading it. We're there.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.600
So why not embrace this and do what Krugman was suggesting?

01:01:51.600 --> 01:02:06.600
But instead of doing it for destructive purposes, for constructive purposes, energy that is clean, and essentially stop the unnecessary consumption of environmentally degrading commerce.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:15.600
Nobody wants any more. Nobody wants big cars anymore. Nobody wants to have more clothes. Nobody wants to spend more money.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:22.600
Okay, well, he may. He is more...

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:26.600
The whole... There is a direction. It is happening globally.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:31.600
When our economy is moving in the direction, we don't know it that is happening.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.600
And this is change, staring us in the face.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Instead of disagreeing about what's happening now, can we move forward to the future and have a positive disagreement about what the future should look like?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:51.600
Are it easier to create a future than to anticipate it?

01:02:51.600 --> 01:03:01.600
And we should be... I sound like a fortune cookie. It's true. It's true. So let's do it. Let's do it.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:08.600
Okay, let's talk about the subject you raised earlier, consumption.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:18.600
This is one that I've been interested in for many decades, and it's, I think, important to understand the forces that drive it, whether...

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.600
Ed questions whether people really have turned away from wanting big things.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:29.600
I think the fundamental driver of consumption has been how the income distribution has changed over the last three decades.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:38.600
What we saw right after World War II for three decades was pretty uniform growth across all the income classes.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.600
About 3% a year for rich, middle and low income families alike.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.600
Since the mid-70s, virtually all the income growth has gone to people at the top of the income letter.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.600
It's the same pattern within every group. If you look at college graduates, it's the same pattern.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:04:00.600
Those at the bottom aren't doing very well compared to 30 years ago. The ones in the middle have gained a little ground, not much.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:08.600
The gains have been the lion's share of them at the top, and if you look at the top 5%, most of the gains there are in the top 1%.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:18.600
There the biggest gains have been in the top 1-10th to 1%. So that's the demand shifter that's been going on for 30 years.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.600
What's happened is that the people who've gotten a lot more money are spending more money.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:31.600
That's totally the expected response from people in every income group. You get more money, you build bigger, you buy more expensive.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:37.600
What's equally clear is that people in the middle don't seem offended by that.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.600
They want to see pictures of the yachts and the mansions. They're not shaking their fists in anger.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.600
They kind of think they'll be rich someday or their kids will be. Let's see what's in store for us.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:56.600
There's not any case to be made that the public is made indirectly less happy by the spectacle of the rich buying fancy things.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:03.600
But here's what has happened. The rich spend more on their daughters' wedding. They spend 2 million, 3 million.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.600
That means the people who are just below the top rung have a new standard.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.600
They want their daughters' wedding to seem special too, but special is a relative concept, so they spend a little more.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:22.600
Now it's cascaded all the way down the income ladder. The average American wedding costs $30,000 in real dollars.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:33.600
In 1980 it was $11,000. And no one, I don't think anybody on this panel would be willing to say with a straight face that couples are happier now because their weddings cost three times as much.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:44.600
It's just that the standards have shifted. Why have they shifted? Because spending at the top went up dramatically and then there's this sort of indirect cascade that ripples throughout the economy.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.600
And talking about waste, much of that extra spending has been pure wheel spinning.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:56.600
Is the CEO happier with a bigger mansion? Why does he need one? It's because other CEOs have a bigger one.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:03.600
He didn't and his company would appear to be in jeopardy and he couldn't entertain in the style that was expected.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:16.600
And so if we could just figure out some way to steer the dollars that are going into more expensive coming of age parties, bigger mansions and then cascading down, putting a bigger burden on people in the middle.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.600
The median new house in 2007, the height of the housing bubble, 2300 square feet.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:30.600
In 1980, 1600 square feet. Why is the median house bigger? Because of this cascade. The people in the middle aren't earning more. That's not why they're building the grid.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:40.600
And if they didn't spend in line with what their peers were spending, their kids would be the ones that went to the schools with the metal detectors out front.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:47.600
You know, if you don't keep pace with spending standards for your community, your kids don't go to even schools of average quality.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:59.600
So that I think is probably the biggest source of found money to address more important problems is to figure out how to steer money that's now going into that.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.600
So my simple proposal is scrap the income tax and have a much more steeply progressive tax on consumption.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:13.600
You report your income, you report your savings. The difference between those two numbers, that's how much you consume during the year.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.600
That amount minus the big standard of deduction is your taxable consumption and then the tax rate starts low and it goes higher and higher.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:28.600
The more you consume, it's fiscal alchemy. You sort of squeeze the mansion growth rate down a little bit.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:39.600
You squeeze the spending on coming of age parties down. All those dollars are freed up to do green investment or things that really would make a palpable difference in the quality of people's lives.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:47.600
I read that and I like it. I read the Erotis and I think in one of your articles in the New York Times, I've been writing about this for 15 years.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:57.600
I think it was a great proposal. I want to make, I just said two things. One is I was shocked because your argument about economy is exactly the same as psychoanalysis.

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:10.600
It is exactly the same because the argument is that if we are seeing somebody in our office, how can we do a double blind study?

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:23.600
The problem with that is eventually it becomes a science of opinions. What you described is that what we are seeing now is the nenke's opinion.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:32.600
It is not proven, it is not factual. You undercut it even more by saying that in fact the data isn't even very good.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.600
I'm surprised that we have this to share as psychoanalysis.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:43.600
But the other question I wanted to ask, which relates to what you said and what Ratzilla said.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:47.600
In fact, all of you have said this. What is the goal of economy?

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:54.600
We should ask the audience. We should ask the audience. We should ask the audience. We should ask the audience.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:01.600
Let's go. There's lots of room to argue about that. One thing we shouldn't argue about is whether it makes sense to make the pie as big as it could be.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.600
Because if we made it bigger, everyone could get a bigger slice.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:13.600
Which just means that everybody could come closer to fulfilling his life's vision.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:20.600
That doesn't mean consuming more. The pie is everything we care about.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.600
That's what we should be talking about.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.600
There are hands from the audience. If you are anxious, you are ready for it.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.600
Sure. You have to come here.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.600
You cannot ask how much where you are sitting.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:43.600
I want people to question.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.600
Chief? Very good.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.600
Thank you all very much. It's kind of building on where your conversation is at.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:01.600
Is there any common agreement among you, the heck with all economists, about the role of the notion of the common good,

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.600
and defining the common good in terms of economic priorities? Does the notion of the common good?

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.600
Is it relevant to economists, the professional economists?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:19.600
It's not a term we use frequently. We much more tend to use the terminology that Bob used,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.600
which is the size of the pie versus the way the pie is distributed up.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:27.600
We almost always agree on things that are going to expand the total size of the pie.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:35.600
Much of the time, any given policy might simultaneously both affect the size of the pie and affect the way it's divided up.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:41.600
And so then there's lots of room for people to disagree because it depends on which one of those two things you care about from us.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.600
Is the avoidance of environmental degradation of shared common goods?

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.600
Yes, of course.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.600
But we would excribe that as increasing the size of the pie.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:55.600
We want the pie to include bads. We net out bads as we add goods.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.600
There is more agreement on that yet than Jeff is letting on.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:08.600
In fact, there is a set of nations in the world economy that lead the world economy.

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.600
It has changed over time. She's certain that she ate.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Now it's G20. And it includes all the industrial and developing nations.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600
Why?

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:29.600
Because the first time in our recorded history, developing nations are now the engine of growth of the world economy.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:36.600
The most important segment of economic growth in the world is the developing nations.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.600
It's no longer the OECD nations.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:48.600
So the G20 now has prominently nations who have not even gone through the period of industrialization.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:57.600
Think about it. And in Pennsylvania, when the G20 was created in 2009, they made big regulations.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.600
And I have the declaration, and anybody who sends me an email, I'll send it to you.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.600
Because it is focused on sustainable development.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:13.600
And sustainable development is what you're talking about, what you were just asking Jeff, in your words,

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:18.600
which are golden words, because this is what people think about.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:26.600
But also from the economic point of view, sustainable development is connected to how we use the resources in the planet

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:32.600
and how we organize ourselves. In a moment of change, this is a major question.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:41.600
Your question is very major. To come to a point of agreement, I think, I think, we could say most people will agree

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:51.600
that survival of our species is an overall agreed objective, survival of the species.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:13:00.600
Well, guess what? There are serious questions about whether the economic, the weight structure today,

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:08.600
with its limits on resources and environmental use, the way we are changing the atmosphere of the planet,

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:18.600
its bodies of water, and the complex wave of species that makes life on Earth, is consistent with the survival of our species.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.600
Or is it driving towards its extinction? This is a big question.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.600
So we should be addressing that question right now, if we are interested in survival.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.600
Go ahead.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Thank you. One of the questions that Dr. Nasecean brought up towards the end, I thought, was one of them...

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.600
I'm sorry? I'm sorry. One of the questions that Dr. Nasecean brought up are the points that he brought up.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:47.600
I thought it was particularly relevant to the discussion that wasn't really included in this discussion.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:55.600
It was touched upon by several individuals, and it's also something that I believe is missing from the national narrative on economics,

01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:03.600
and that is that the relevance of personal individual psychology and the role that that plays in the decision-making,

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:10.600
the purchase decisions, the prioritization that plays in buyer behavior or economic behavior investments,

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:16.600
and that sort of thing. I realize that there is a science called axiology.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:25.600
I'm not sure if anyone's ever heard of that, but axiology is a relative measure of one's individual values

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:33.600
and the psychological propensity to drive behavior or drive actions and making choices.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:40.600
I guess my general question to the panel would be, if there were a way to somehow evaluate that,

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.600
if there were a way to somehow measure that as a backdrop, economic policy and theory,

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.600
would that change, would that be able to impact or change your perspectives as economists,

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.600
and would that change the impact of economic decisions they're made?

01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:02.600
Just to add to that, doesn't Stigley talk about something that replaces the GDP with some other G?

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.600
Happiness index?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.600
Yeah.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:11.600
There have been systematic attempts to bring in non-market aspects of behavior that we assign value to

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:16.600
and somehow factor them into a measure of what we're doing.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.600
GDP clearly leaves out a bunch of things we care about.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.600
There is another way of looking exactly the same thing that Bob is saying,

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:31.600
which is that by introducing new systems of property rights and the new markets that go along with trading them,

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.600
like the carbon market, but also markets for biodiversity,

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.600
markets for solar, solar dioxide emissions that exist in the Chicago World of Trade,

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600
markets for water, etc.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.600
We create values that will change the GDP.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.600
So it's not just to throw the, you know, the baby with the bathwater,

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:59.600
but actually you can transform the market by creating new property rights

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:04.600
on the limits that matter for survival of humankind and letting people,

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:09.600
trade on them, creates the values that then change the GDP.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.600
It's the day that wags the dog.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.600
And one thing that showed up clearly in this was the sense of human motivation

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.600
and how people respond to tax changes.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:29.600
I think there's been a long-standing assertion that if taxes go up on people at the top of the income distribution,

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.600
they'll begin withholding their effort.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:39.600
And it resonates because I think we all accept the idea that people respond to incentives,

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.600
and it seems like if you raise people's taxes, you're reducing the incentive to work.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:50.600
But in fact, economics is really quite silent on what the effect of a tax increase would be.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.600
It makes you poorer, so it might make you feel like you have to work harder to achieve whatever you're trying to achieve.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.600
It also makes taking time off cheaper, so that cuts the other way.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.600
If you look historically, people worked many more hours a hundred years ago

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.600
and the real reward to working was a tiny fraction of what it is now.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:15.600
So there's no compelling reason to think that if the tax rate on people went up,

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.600
they would suddenly quit the game.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:23.600
I mean, the more subtle view of human motivation is that people at that level

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.600
are getting all sorts of rewards from being a CEO other than the take-home after-tax pay.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.600
They're a player. They're in charge of something.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:37.600
And so I think what economists begin to embrace that, a lot of these debates

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.600
about the sort of narrower assertions about incentives go off to the side.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.600
Thank you.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:54.600
Yes. Do economists really think that their models and theories can increase the size of the pie?

01:17:54.600 --> 01:18:01.600
I'm thinking of Kyle Cowan's great study and hypothesis that many of our problems

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.600
is that there's been no new invention, no new wealth-create, no new ideas.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:13.600
I mean, I'm sure of that a new cheap source of energy was found, say, fusion energy.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:19.600
All these economic problems would be small and go away, and all the policies are really rather meaningless.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.600
It's what creates wealth, is new knowledge, and new advances in science.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.600
I wonder if people can give their names because you are not interested in me. What's your name?

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.600
Mel Melchner. Say that again. Mel Melchner.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600
Mel Melchner. Thanks.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.600
And your name?

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.600
Francesca. Francesca Ficciano.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.600
Okay. You want to ask him this question?

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.600
Yes. You go ahead.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:56.600
I mean, I think lots of economists believe that various policies will affect the incentive to innovate

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:01.600
and will infect whether people who innovate can take advantage of their new ideas

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.600
because their intellectual property is protected by a patent and copyright and things like that.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:13.600
So that's one way of reconciling your two statements that do policies matter or is innovation that matters.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.600
But secondly, I think a lot of economists think that policies matter too, whether they're a lot of fun property rights,

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.600
whether the government is intervening in the places where regulation is beneficial

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.600
and intervening in places in ways that are mainly protecting some industries relative to other industries.

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.600
I think economists think that has a lot to do with whether economies have a big pie or a small pie.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.600
I mean, if the communist countries versus roughly capitalist countries,

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:45.600
the base of this obvious comparison, most economists I think believe that because central planning was leading to a lot of inefficiencies,

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.600
not letting market prices signal what was scarce and what was not,

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:54.600
that those economies tended to be poor than economies that mainly used capitalism to allocate resources.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:01.600
Do you think that Steve Jobs or Bill Gates did what they did because of tax policy or any other policies?

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.600
Based on Steve Jobs' biography, he actually cared a lot about tax policy.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:16.600
He cared a lot about the innovation policy. He worked very, very hard to make sure that innovations he created were protected

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.600
so that he could earn a profit. That was after he became wealthy.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.600
I think that was through the history of it.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.600
I think he just wrote an article that said he doesn't care anything about, and he never did, about tax policies,

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.600
that he would have done what he did regardless of what the tax structure was.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:38.600
I don't quite believe that, but I think a lot of these guys are driven by other motives, as Bob has pointed out.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.600
But I did want to say the other thing about Cowan's book, and that is, innovation is not enough.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.600
You can put a bunch of scientists and really bright guys, engineers, and Bonon Island, and not have other resources.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.600
I think saving and capital investment allows these innovations to be put in a commercial form.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:58.600
I think that's very important. That's where tax policy matters more.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:05.600
My question is about Brett. My name is Brett.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.600
My question is about historiography of your field.

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:16.600
There are historians, and even in the 19th century, have written about the kinds of money and institutions

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.600
that have gotten behind promoting certain schools or suppressing others.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:28.600
The American Economic Association, 1880s, backed Rockefeller, Carnegie, et cetera,

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.600
when they were doing a lot of building of institutions in this country.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Catherine Cryer in book, Patriot Acts, does a great job of showing how economists were used,

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:50.600
selectively used by the owners of banks, more or less.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:57.600
It doesn't surprise me, then, to hear this story about Bernanke's paper and his theory,

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:04.600
that he would be the one put into the position by the money people who fund the presidential elections.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:10.600
They wouldn't surprise me, given Catherine Cryer's book.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:17.600
Eric Bynhocker in his book about complexity economics talks about, opens the book with the kind of suppression

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:25.600
of behavioral economics by Chicago School neoliberal efforts, probably in the 70s.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.600
Herb Simon is featured in that story.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:37.600
I wonder if you can talk about the institutions and the money that has shaped you, continues to shape you,

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:45.600
given from your CVs, and why the creation of this panel doesn't include other fields of economics

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.600
that some of you allude to, but they're not here today.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:55.600
And why would the panelists, the curator of the panel, pursue this binary, which we're so used to?

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.600
And they get so much money behind it, the two sides, not just the one.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.600
You've said that you even often agree on things, quite a lot, but those things where you disagree

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.600
are also well known to us, those points.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:14.600
So let me say just on one part of what you said, I in no way shape or form think that Bernanke's position

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.600
on the crisis or anything else has anything to do with being in the pocket of banks.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.600
I think Bernanke is one of the most objective.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.600
He's one of the best economists.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Despite the fact that I'm a hardcore libertarian and a lot of libertarians are not very happy with Ben Bernanke,

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:33.600
the Fed, and I disagree with him about some things, the notion that he did what he did for any reason

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:39.600
other than his objective attempt to try to fix the economy is not, he didn't, he's just wrong.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.600
It's just everything I know about Ben.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:46.600
He's a co-author of mine and I know him very well and that's absolutely accurate.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:53.600
So you might say very quickly that as a profession, economics in some sense took over the function

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.600
of the old crown and church.

01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:03.600
The king needed people sell his dissent from the gods to the masses.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.600
And before that he had the chief in the witch doctor.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:11.600
I think here you do have economics after the Progressive Era starting World War I,

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.600
going through World War II.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.600
The economists began to be the new intellectuals or the new priesthood that sort of sold a larger and growing state.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.600
Now, as to whether any particular economist is in anybody's pocket, that's another question

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.600
altogether and I agree with what they said about Bernanke.

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:36.600
What the research that's been done on conflict of interest shows very clearly is that no one, everyone recognizes

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:43.600
that others are subject to conflict of interest but almost no one thinks the itself is subject to it.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.600
We all agree on that.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:53.600
I'm guessing many people in the audience saw the film Inside Job.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.600
Many economists who were interviewed in that film I think had good reason to be embarrassed by positions they had taken

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.600
on behalf of the financial services industry and regulators.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.600
I was thinking of one in particular watching him squirm.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:13.600
I'm not going to say that.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.600
He had been hired by Iceland to do a review of their financial regulatory system.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:29.600
I'm not in the finance field but it was so easy to imagine that if I had been an accomplished finance scholar

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:36.600
and had been approached by the government of Iceland and somebody told me what a brilliant scholar I was

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:43.600
and why it was really worth $300,000 or whatever the fee was to do a review of their regulatory system,

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.600
how I could have allowed myself to believe that I was uniquely positioned to give an objective evaluation of it

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:57.600
and how easy it would have been knowing that they had paid me that much and they've been really nice to me

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.600
and might hire me to do something in the future, not to want to say anything horribly nasty about them.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.600
You're not in the world we live in if you don't recognize those kinds of influences on people.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:15.600
I think you just have to design institutions in a way that pushes back against that

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.600
and we haven't done a good job of that.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:26.600
I think there are two facts that explain much of what Brad, what is Brad, we're not asking you about

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:34.600
and they're not so evil as they seem, but the first one is people desperately want to be useful

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:41.600
and this is misvalued generally, but it is really the only source of happiness I know

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.600
when people feel they're really useful.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:50.600
And the second fact is the way that the brain operates has nothing to do with my observation,

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.600
but it has to do with neurobiology.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:03.600
The brain constructs structures, frameworks to think, and is extremely reluctant for good reasons to move the frameworks

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:10.600
and the reason is that we have very limited capability, so we screen all the information that we get

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.600
by having frameworks.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:18.600
For example, you walk into a tennis court, you don't think from scratch what you are going to do with the ball,

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.600
you walk into a tennis court and you go into a framework.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:26.600
Okay, this is a tennis court and then you automatically play.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:30.600
And you can actually talk about what the players say, they do play automatically unconsciously

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.600
and talking about psychoanalysis, but there is one more thing that was discovered recently,

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:48.600
which I find is fascinating, which is that the cortex makes it, acknowledges a decision of what is going to be doing,

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:54.600
watch this, after the decision has been right.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:03.600
So most of the brain is dedicated to justifying, and the cortex justifying the decisions you have made.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.600
Now, if the brain is doing that, how can you blame Bernanke?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Go ahead, that's good.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600
My name is Patrick.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.600
I am a commercial credit manager.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600
I'm a credit manager for a bank.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:28.600
I am with Professor Celerna, I'm an Austrian because of what I saw at a micro level ten years ago.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.600
I saw the rates go down and I saw people, whatever their motivation was for buying the big house,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.600
they could get it with a 3% arm.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.600
And why save when the CD rates are 1%?

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:46.600
I saw a lot of, we the banks pumping in, pumping credit that was, you know, created credit, not savings,

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:49.600
because people weren't saving, created credit into an asset.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.600
And there were lots of reasons why we did that.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.600
But our calculations are a lot simpler than yours.

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.600
We have income over debt service, which changes when debt service is lower.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.600
The cap models, the WAC models, the cap N models, it assumes a rate of return.

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.600
And if that's higher than the interest, the capital costs, that changes.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:15.600
We're going to fund more deals and they're going to do more deals because it does cash flow at the temporarily low rates.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.600
So, I saw guys going into construction, building a couple of expansions a year,

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.600
making $120,000 a year with high school education.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:32.600
It seemed like this can't last forever and it seemed obvious that it was driven by the rates and the credit flowing into this.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:38.600
To what extent does everybody else agree that, you know, now that I've read more about economics,

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.600
the Hayekian triangle seems to explain it.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.600
And to what extent does that matter?

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.600
If the Austrians are basically right about how we got here, is that relevant to,

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:56.600
does that mean that we should put them first in terms of how do we get, listening to how do we get out of it?

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Can I just, I'll give you some anecdotal empiricism.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.600
I know about Vice President of, Vice President of loans, who was in Las Vegas during that time.

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:11.600
And one of the loans that they made was to fire, a retired fireman from New York City wanted to buy a home from self

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.600
and a home for rent, for rental income.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:22.600
They walked them into buying 25 homes without a down payment.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.600
I mean, that was, it was crazy.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.600
But I think it has to do, it's not just everyone going mad.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.600
It's not necessarily sinister motives.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.600
It's due to the fact that we had a tremendous falsification of monetary calculation

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:42.600
throughout the interest rate structure. And that's what Hayek, the Nobel Prize winner,

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.600
has emphasized with this Hayekian triangle. I mean, that's just one sort of model of it.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.600
But I think that's a key. I don't think it was just a sudden onset of greed.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:31:05.600
No, but a much more important dimension of that whole dynamic was the lifting of effective constraints on leveraging up the banks.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:13.600
In most countries are permitted from loaning out more money than a certain multiple of what they have in assets.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.600
The deregulation of the banking system here effectively loosened those limits severely.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:28.600
And when you're in a financial asset bubble, you can make even more money by borrowing and buying even more of the bubble whose price is inflating.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:35.600
And there were people, I know, who thought, well, the prices are already too high, this doesn't seem safe.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.600
But then here's the one thing we know about people. They can't sit on the sidelines

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.600
while neighbors who are stupid and they are making a lot of money without doing anything.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:53.600
So you had to dance while the music was playing. That's been one of the comments that's been made about this.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:00.600
And the parents who borrowed when the banks let them borrow think about the situation they were in.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:07.600
John McCain was very critical of people who had visions of grandeur buying vaulted ceilings and grand countertops.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:13.600
But when I bought a house, I needed 25% down. It was a short loan.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.600
My kids could buy houses with nothing down and balloon payments.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:24.600
And if you don't spend what people in your income level spend on a house, it's your kids that go to the bad schools.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.600
And others were borrowing more. They were allowed to borrow more. They spent more.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:36.600
So what am I to do as a parent? Send my kid to the school where the metal detectors are out front or borrow more myself and hope for the best.

01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:42.600
I'm going to do the second thing. And that's not a prescription to deregulate the banks.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.600
That's a prescription to regulate the banks more tightly.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:55.600
Yes, absolutely. And here's a thing. Just before the crisis erupted, you could see the leveraging factor was close to 40 times.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.600
40 times. Now, here's...

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:04.600
That was at the end of the quarter when they cleaned up their books. It was 300 times in the middle of the quarter.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:11.600
But the point is that that leveraging itself is something that you cannot do in Las Vegas.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:20.600
Taking your example. If you try to play Las Vegas, other stakes and you don't show that you have money to play, they won't let you play.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:30.600
So my question is why can the banking system and the US economy have a regulation which is as good as Las Vegas?

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:36.600
Get it right here. You know, Bob touched on a good point about the deregulation.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:46.600
Only the asset side was deregulated. When you have a fraction reserve banking system and you still have FDIC insurance and you have to big the failed doctrine, you can't...

01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:53.600
I'm an Austrian. I'm anti-regulat... But you can't deregulate the asset side and allow all of these improved investments.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.600
When you have fraction reserve banking, that's sort of guaranteed to be bailed out.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:05.600
But as far as deregulation, I just want to mention that under the Bush years, spending on the FCC increased 11.3% per year every single year.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:20.600
And the staff grew by 1% a year. And we also had a tripling of spending from 1980 to 2005 or so on all agencies that had to do with financial regulation.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.600
So I don't think more regulation is necessarily a story that comes out of this, but we can agree to disagree on that.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.600
Thank you.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.600
Robert?

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.600
Hi, my name is Bob.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:45.600
You know, we're talking about why economists disagree. And it was really, I think, very little disagreement on this panel.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600
Okay, we can't...

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.600
We can't just build up on that.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:35:00.600
I don't mean that in a derogatory manner, but the values of the people on the panel are pretty much in line with one another.

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:08.600
You mentioned happiness is what everybody's seeking. I don't know about that. I think power is what a lot of people are seeking.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:17.600
And I think the kind of disagreements that we have politically and the inability of the parties to talk with one another...

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:29.600
Far transcends economics. I think that the disagreements have so much to do with bad will and with a lack of shared values and with our political system.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:45.600
And I...as much as I learned, and I learned a lot in this discussion, but I didn't learn anything that's going to help us make that leap to the political arena and get more agreement there

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:53.600
since things can get moving. I hope I'm wrong, but that's my sense of things.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:36:11.600
If I could just say, when I wrote a piece advocating the progressive consumption tax I described in 1997, I got a very warm letter from Milton Friedman a week later saying he didn't agree with me that the government should be raising and spending more money.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:25.600
This was at a time when the Clinton budgets were edging into surplus. But he went on to say that if it did need to raise more money, I think most people now think that it does, the progressive consumption tax would be the ideal way to do it.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:38.600
And he enclosed in his letter a reprint of his 1943 paper from the American Economic Review in which he had advocated a progressive consumption tax as the best way to pay for World War II.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:46.600
So there is a concrete proposal I've now seen a book from AEI, the American Enterprise Institute, where two scholars are advocating it.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:53.600
And that would make the pie bigger and generate a lot of revenue to pay bills that we need to pay.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.600
So don't say you didn't get any proposal for moving forward into the future because I tried to get that one out there.

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:12.600
And I think it's a climate change issue and I think of the tremendous amount of money that's being spent with people who want to ride climate change science and then say that it's false sense.

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:18.600
That whatever you're doing with economics, it kind of doesn't work with that.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:26.600
It's a tremendous, I don't know what to call it, but it's more than a fly in the ointment, it's more than an ointment than a fly, I suppose.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.600
Gradula has to live in Faguna.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.600
I wanted to apologize for that, but this was known in advance. I have to go to, I have to fly to London.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:39.600
So we would kind of move faster if we can.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.600
You can live, but we can...

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:49.600
And that's an important question. I wish I had more time. It is very important.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:59.600
All right. I'm Steve Miller from Bridgeport, Connecticut, the home of P.T. Barnum, who said there's a sucker born every minute to the take.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:07.600
I was going to agree with Professor Salerno until he said there was nothing sinister.

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:17.600
What I want Professor Salerno to comment about is when this cash is going to be worth absolutely nothing.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.600
But I want to put into that context, please.

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.600
On top of Bernanke's crazy...

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.600
I could fire Bernanke in a second.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:41.600
Crazy creation of fake money that he lies about every time he testifies before Congress under oath.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:49.600
What about the $680 trillion which I love to hear the word notional?

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:57.600
But that's not the deal. There's $680 trillion in off-balance sheet accounts.

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:02.600
I mean, that is a number. It's so crazy.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600
Nobody wants to...

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.600
You mean unfunded...

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:15.600
I'm talking about off-balance sheet accounts that the banks never denied.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600
They don't say no, that's not true.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:27.600
They grew from like in the late 1980s from about $15 trillion to this number of $680 trillion.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.600
Supposedly there's $400 trillion in swaps that are in these off-balance sheet accounts.

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:37.600
That nobody ever even mentions.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:43.600
It's like, wow, I don't see how... Where does this money actually come from?

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.600
And how crazy can it get?

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:52.600
And one question that I just want to throw in here and then I'll sit down.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:40:02.600
Is the idea that bankers are going to seduce people to take money like the 25 condos or something.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.600
And get a fee.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.600
That's what they're doing. They're getting fees.

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:17.600
They're putting the money in their pocket and then they go ship it down the street to their buddies at the rating agencies who put AAA on everything.

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.600
I mean, if that's not sinister,

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.600
PT Barnum hit it right on the head.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.600
There's a sucker born every minute who to take them.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.600
So that's the problem here.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.600
It's like we're in this political correctness deal that is...

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:40.600
The media just keeps the propaganda crashing into the skulls of everybody.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.600
I don't know what...

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.600
I don't know anything about the off-budget accounts of $680 trillion.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.600
But I do want to say one thing.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.600
Well, I do want to say one thing about hyperinflation and the money being worth nothing.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600
I don't think we'll have a hyperinflation in the United States.

01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.600
What I do think is that after a while we're going to have galloping inflation.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600
It's going to scare them.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.600
And when I fear, and I think we'll have in five years, maybe even fewer years, is wage and price controls.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.600
I think that's what we're headed for.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.600
I think we're going to go on with sort of inflationary recession or stag inflation.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.600
For a while, the inflation is going to get worse.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.600
And at some point they're going to slap on some form of income policy away to price controls.

01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600
I think that that has not been talked about.

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.600
And I think that that's very likely in our future.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.600
The world economy is about $60 trillion.

01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:34.600
It is known that the derivative markets are a multiple of that.

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:37.600
That's more or less the number you're talking about.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.600
$600 trillion.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.600
Yeah, that's the number you spoke about.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:49.600
So the derivative markets originate from people being able to take position without having to make a deposit on the position.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.600
That is the leveraging factor we talked about that he mentioned was as high as 300.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:07.600
And what I said about what happens in Las Vegas is when you want to make a bet, you have to show that you have a proportion of that money on you

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600
before you can play, otherwise I don't let you play.

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.600
You cannot make and round it.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:12.600
You put it right down.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.600
Hey?

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.600
Understood.

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.600
I'm trying.

01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600
What are you reporting?

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600
There.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600
100% is a proportion.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600
Yes.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.600
I'm trying to say no, but there is more than that.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.600
You cannot make bets when you pay poker, etc.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:31.600
Going beyond what you actually can show you have.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:46.600
And what I'm trying to explain is that precisely is the opposite of the concept of the derivative markets in which you can go short, so that you can sell something you don't know.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:49.600
And this is what requires regulation.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.600
By the way, this is no different than what already happened in the 1930s.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.600
So this is not something very inventing now.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.600
I have to go.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:58.600
Thank you.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.600
It's absolutely not.

01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.600
But you have to move that and then you can go.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.600
This is fine.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.600
Okay.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:10.600
Thank you, Gretz.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600
We love you.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:23.600
Thank you.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.600
Graciela.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:25.600
Graciela.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.600
Graciela is on her way to London.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:36.600
I have an old shoe.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:43.600
I would like to thank you for your time.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.600
Okay.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.600
Ask your question.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.600
You want me to ask them for you?

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.600
My name is Ron.

01:43:49.600 --> 01:44:00.600
I'm sorry to see Graciela go because I was most sympathetic to what she had to say, but I just like to make my points as briefly as I can.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:08.600
This forum was about whether or not economists agree or they can agree.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:17.600
I would put forth a very simple proposal that this crisis that we're facing now is basically, it's a financial crisis.

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:21.600
It's not an industrial crisis.

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.600
This is all about money and banking.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:36.600
And one of the gentlemen mentioned that yes, they brought it on, but if we don't save them, the whole ship goes down.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:44.600
So they're too big to fail, so whether we like it or not, we've got to deal with it.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:52.600
But I think we're all familiar with saying that when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:58.600
Nobody is addressing this too big to fail issue.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:09.600
Nobody is addressing the whole monetary banking system that got us into this crisis that is stronger than it ever was, and that will probably lead us to the next one.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.600
So, because we have three more people, just ask a question.

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600
Okay, please.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.600
Two very brief points.

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:27.600
I do believe that all economists do make moral judgments before they form their models.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:34.600
It's almost impossible for human being not to make moral judgments and then create models that work with their moral judgments.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600
But the final point I want to say is that as economists who do make moral judgments,

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:49.600
and I think the most important thing for you is to get on the same page on what you believe is the ideal solution, not what is the doable solution.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:58.600
Put out to the public, this is the best possible thing that we could do, and then let the public decide whether it's doable or not,

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:05.600
instead of giving us proposals that are band-aids because you think, well, maybe politically feasible.

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.600
That's my point.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:07.600
Thank you.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.600
So, to be clear, I am not advocating too big to fail.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.600
I am one of the biggest critics out there too big to fail. I think it's a disaster.

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:20.600
I'm excited to explain why Bernanke thinks the too big to fail is something that we have to do.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:24.600
And many economists agree with banking. I'm certainly in the minority amongst economists.

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.600
I'm not a president elephant in the room.

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:35.600
Because they're convinced, not even correctly, but they're convinced that the consequences of not

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:39.600
failing out big banks would be even worse than the consequences of failing out big banks.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.600
Because we don't agree on the ideal proposal.

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.600
I mean, there are few areas where we do actually agree.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:53.600
The economists are pretty much unanimous that rent control is a bad policy, that free traders are good policy, a handful of other things.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:58.600
And yet, millions of countries for millennia haven't followed those policies.

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.600
So, just laying out something we agree on doesn't seem to be sufficient.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:02.600
Okay, next question.

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.600
Hi, Maria Cavallo, a student at Columbia University.

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.600
Go right up to the microphone.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.600
I'm Maria Cavallo, a student at Columbia University.

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.600
So, there's been a lot of talk about a pie, but I think the first question is who is making the pie.

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:18.600
And as Dr. Solano said, there are only taxpayers and tax consumers.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:24.600
So, if the government is in charge of the pie, that means we have bigger government and bigger tax consumption.

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:30.600
And as Hayek says, central planning can't work. So, how would you respond? Thanks.

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:38.600
So, that sounds like a variation of the 47 percent, the makers and the takers argument.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.600
I think that's the wrong way to think about government.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:49.600
I think government is what we do, not what some disembodied institution does to us.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:55.600
We make the government, there are lots of countries where the citizens feel good about their governments.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.600
I think the government's delivered good services and the public officials are by and large free of corruption.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:13.600
And government just, the idea of government recognizes that the individual's own interests don't coincide in all cases with society's interests.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.600
I mentioned the example of my decision to get on a crowded roadway.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.600
There's nothing I can do to prevent you from getting on a crowded roadway.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.600
If it's not important for you to get on it, you'll get on it if it's better for you than not getting on it.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.600
But your presence there makes all the rest of us wait for hours longer to get where we're going.

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:43.600
But all of us acting together can implement an easy pass technology that charges us, we charge ourselves for the privilege of getting on a crowded roadway.

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:50.600
Then we decide for ourselves whether it's valuable enough to go at that hour or whether we'd save more money

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:53.600
or not suffer much inconvenience if we went at a less crowded time.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600
That's government.

01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.600
And to say that's social engineering, well, homicide laws are social engineering.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:02.600
Stop signs are social engineering.

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:09.600
There's just no presumption that what the individual wants to do is for that very reason alone what ought to happen.

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.600
Sometimes individual action is in harmony with social interests, but not always.

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:15.600
Okay.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:21.600
My name is Walter, and I'm neurologist, so I usually engage in value of rejectments.

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.600
And that's a lie.

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:34.600
What I'd like to pose as a question is, obviously, there's going to always be disagreements among long-term people looking at the same data.

01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.600
We have a lot of data to look at.

01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:44.600
We can look at Japan, for example, and look at its last 20 years, not just the last 10 years, and see a massive failure of advice coming from the individual.

01:49:44.600 --> 01:50:02.600
We can also look at Europe and see that it's in full-blown crisis, that they're also getting advice from well-intentioned economists, and the one the verge of is a revolution in Europe, possibly the next war.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:03.600
We don't know.

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.600
And it doesn't stop there.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:13.600
It comes right back to our lab as to whether or not we're pursuing policies that have been demonstrated to have failed the first time.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.600
We're not going to be frustrated to have failed in the past, simply repackaging them as the best we can do.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:31.600
There is one other country that's worth thinking about, which is Germany at the end of World War I, when reparations were literally destroying Germany from the inside.

01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:38.600
And their economists gave way to their bankers, who said, we can't afford to maintain Germany as it is.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:41.600
Therefore, we're going to start the printing presses.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:55.600
Eventually, they did dig themselves out of that hole, and were invested in heavily by Americans, who accepted the German solution, which was not deflationary, but rather the opposite.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:06.600
Yet, no one here has broached that aspect of agreement or disagreement as to whether or not that's a possible solution to some of the problems that were happening.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:17.600
Let me just quickly say, there was a economist behind the German hyperinflation, an eminent monetary economist named Karl Helfrich, who believed the quantity theory and so on.

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.600
He was the one who said, really, it's import prices that are going up.

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:25.600
The German walk is being attacked by speculators, and therefore, we have to print more money to catch up.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.600
It's allowed people to pay the higher prices.

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:34.600
So, even though he wasn't the central bank chairman, he was somebody who was very influential in that.

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.600
So, economists can be wrong.

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:40.600
I mean, economists, you know, it's an art.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:44.600
I don't quite understand the question.

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:49.600
Is the proposal that the US economy would do better if we generated higher inflation?

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.600
It's not a proposal.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600
It's just a value-free question.

01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:58.600
In other words, would we be better off with inflation versus a deflation?

01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:10.600
It seems that Bernanke is very worried about the US plunging into an uncontrollable deflation, and a lot of the stimulus is exactly an attempt to prevent that.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:11.600
The risk of...

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600
That seems to be what's going on.

01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.600
I mean, Harry Truman, I'm going to have to say, it depends.

01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:17.600
It depends why you're having inflation or deflation.

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:20.600
So, there's not a short enough answer to give to that.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.600
But certainly, there are risks of deflation.

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:27.600
There are periods in US history where we had very substantial deflation at real economic growth.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.600
It was quite robust, and some of the most robust growth in US history.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.600
So, deflation per se is not the issue.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:39.600
It's things that are going along with particular deflation, such as collapse in aggregate demand, as Bob was explaining earlier.

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.600
Okay, last question.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.600
I'm just going to try to slip two, and if I can get one for free out of a panel of economists, my name is Stuart.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:54.600
To begin with, how could you compare the cost of bailing out the system by bailing out the consumers,

01:52:54.600 --> 01:53:02.600
that is a mortgage guarantee program in place, allowing the cash flow of structured bonds to go unimpeded?

01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:06.600
Is there a way to compare the cost of the two approaches?

01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.600
I'm not sure I understand your approach.

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.600
So, I guess, it's so...

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:13.600
Since bailing out the banks, bailing out the consumers that...

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.600
Bailing out the stock the foreclosures, bailing out the people who are on the water...

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.600
Maintaining the cash flow of structured bonds.

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:25.600
And then that way you could... Some level we're trying to do both the HAMP program, the other mortgage programs

01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.600
that we're trying to prevent defaults and transfer money to homeowners, we're going in that direction.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:34.600
If you do that, then mortgage bonds won't default, and then the banks aren't in trouble,

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.600
then you don't have to worry about whether to bail a matter or not.

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:43.600
But it may also have disincentive effects if it encourages people to not be as careful about taking out mortgages they can't afford.

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:50.600
I just am asking about the cost. What would the difference of cost and cost have been if there's any way to analyze that?

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.600
I'm sure some of you have a lot of cost better than any of us.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:05.600
Any of us know, Bob Schiller and others have described this as a collective action problem, that it would be good for the banks even if collectively they would write down their mortgage loans.

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:19.600
But any one bank would not find it in its interest to do that. And so a way to circumvent that collective action problem that's being experimented with in several areas that have had a severe high incidence of underwater mortgages

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:32.600
is imminent domain, the local level. The city governments are seizing underwater mortgages and under imminent domain and then essentially forcing them to be written down

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.600
and then putting the properties back on the market.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:43.600
I'll need to stand really quickly to that. There is a cost to stopping foreclosures. What's rolling falling prices?

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:55.600
As the housing prices fall to more natural levels, to the market adjusted levels. At that point, there are people who are the poor lower income people and also people who are prudent during the boom didn't get caught up into it.

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:03.600
We're going to afford houses now. Don't forget the house is not going to go unsold if they're foreclosed. They're going to be turned over to people that didn't make bad decisions.

01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:09.600
I don't think that's such a bad thing. But writing down those loans doesn't prevent the price from falling.

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:23.600
If they would accelerate the money. It would have though at the beginning. If we backed all the ARMs right before they'd faulted and before the assets that were structured upon them became toxic.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:29.600
It would have propped up the price of the housing market and there would have been negatives. I'm sure you could associate with that as well.

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:37.600
If I can try to squeeze my second question in, is there a point at which we should target diminishing the GDP?

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:43.600
Are there circumstances under which we should target contraction rather than growth?

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.600
Not if it's being measured reasonably.

01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:58.600
You would not want to make the pie smaller. The pie isn't exactly the same as GDP. There are certain parts of the pie that we definitely want to make smaller.

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:10.600
We have instruments that can achieve that. I think if the overall pie gets smaller, everything will turn nasty in a hurry.

01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:19.600
There's been some very convincing research that the willingness of society to clean up the environment, to assist the needy, to do any number of things.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:27.600
Your colleague Ben Friedman's work is way greater when economies are growing rapidly than when they're shrinking.

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:35.600
It's much easier to give up part of your gain for a common purpose than to take away from things that you're already doing in order to fund a common purpose.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:42.600
That really relies on what value we assign health and happiness in the pie.

01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:49.600
Yeah, exactly. You've got to be talking about the right ingredients in the pie for any of this conversation to make sense.

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:59.600
I ask the question because it seems that considering the contraction of economy and intentional contraction is never considered.

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:04.600
Just from a philosophical background, it seems like something that should be at least in a simple way.

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:16.600
Because we think that in almost any recession or any slowdown of growth, all the aspects of that we care about, material like houses and toaster ovens and health, go down.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:22.600
Lots more people become unemployed. That's not good for their health. Fewer people can afford health care when there are sessions.

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:28.600
That's not good for their health. Most of these things we care about that are not explicitly in GDP are pretty highly correlated with GDP.

01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:33.600
And so looking at measure GDP is a very good proxy for all of these things that we care about.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.600
It's not perfect, but it's a pretty good problem.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.600
Once more caveat to that, I'm not in favor of targeting, government targeting anything.

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.600
But for example, if people suddenly became aesthetics and wanted to move through the hills and become hippies and communes,

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:48.600
and GDP, Sri Lanka has a result of those voluntary decisions, fine with me.

01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.600
What if they want to start the first?

01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:53.600
No, I think we have to stop. Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:58:00.600
And a listen, thank you very much.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:04.600
Go on. No doubt we can go on forever.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.600
Thank you.

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:07.600
Thank you.

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:28.600
Sure.
