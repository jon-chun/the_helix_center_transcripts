01:41.660 --> 01:47.620
Our participants are, if you can raise your hand, Priya Natarajan's research is focused

01:47.620 --> 01:53.060
on exotica in the universe, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. She is noted for

01:53.060 --> 01:58.300
her key contributions to two of the most challenging problems in cosmology, mapping the distribution

01:58.300 --> 02:03.060
of dark matter and tracing the growth history of black holes. Her work using gravitational

02:03.060 --> 02:07.580
lensing has provided a deeper understanding of the granularity of dark matter in clusters

02:07.580 --> 02:12.980
of galaxies and offers a novel way to unravel the nature of dark matter. She also works on

02:12.980 --> 02:17.860
the assembly and accretion history of black holes. Deeply invested in the public dissemination

02:17.860 --> 02:22.620
of science, she serves on the advisory board of Nova Science Now and is a fervent proponent

02:22.620 --> 02:28.300
of numerical literacy. She is also a published poet. A professor in the departments of astronomy

02:28.300 --> 02:32.860
and physics at Yale University, Priya is a strong supporter of gender equity in the workplace

02:32.860 --> 02:40.540
and was on the chair of the women's faculty form at Yale from 2011 to 2013. She also serves

02:40.540 --> 02:45.180
on the foundation board of the EDGE certification foundation based in Switzerland. She also holds

02:45.180 --> 02:50.340
the Sophie and Tycho Bra professorship at the dark center, Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen

02:50.340 --> 02:54.620
and an honorary professorship at the University of Delhi. She has undergraduate degrees in

02:54.620 --> 02:58.900
physics and mathematics from MIT. She is also interested in the history and philosophy of

02:58.900 --> 03:04.700
science as well as technology and public policy and was enrolled in the MIT program in science,

03:04.700 --> 03:08.580
technology and society where she was awarded a master's degree and the MIT program in

03:08.580 --> 03:13.420
technology and public policy. She did her graduate work in theoretical astrophysics at the Institute

03:13.420 --> 03:17.700
of Astronomy University of Cambridge in gangland where she was a member of Trinity College and

03:17.700 --> 03:22.980
was elected to a title, a research fellowship. She was the first woman in astrophysics to

03:22.980 --> 03:30.740
be elected a fellow of Trinity College Cambridge. Next to her, Tal Rabin is the manager and

03:30.740 --> 03:36.060
research staff member of the cryptography research group at IBM's T.J. Watson research center.

03:36.060 --> 03:41.820
Her research focuses on the general area of cryptography and more specifically on secure

03:41.820 --> 03:46.900
multi-party computation, threshold cryptography and proactive security which the National

03:46.900 --> 03:51.740
Research Council cyber security report to Congress identified as quote, exactly the right

03:51.740 --> 03:56.540
primitives for building distributed systems that are more secure unquote. She obtained

03:56.540 --> 04:01.860
her PhD in computer science from the Hebrew University in 1994 and was an NSF postdoc

04:01.860 --> 04:08.020

51, which many of you may also be familiar with. Film credits include a screenplay adaptation

06:29.220 --> 06:34.580
of photograph 51 funded by a Tribeca Film Institute slash Sloan Foundation grant. She

06:34.580 --> 06:41.340
received the BA from Yale and an MFA from NYU Tisch School of the Arts.

06:41.340 --> 06:47.660
To her right, Liz Phelps received her PhD from Princeton University in 1989, served on the

06:47.660 --> 06:52.260
faculty of Yale University until 1999, and is currently the Julius Silver Professor of

06:52.260 --> 06:56.660
Psychology and Neuroscience at New York University. Her lab has earned widespread acclaim for

06:56.660 --> 07:01.100
its groundbreaking research on how the human brain processes emotion, particularly as it

07:01.100 --> 07:06.220
relates to learning, memory and decision making. Dr. Phelps is the recipient of the 21st century

07:06.220 --> 07:10.820
scientist award from the James S. McDonald Foundation and a fellow of the American Association

07:10.820 --> 07:14.780
for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She has served

07:14.780 --> 07:18.460
on the board of directors of the Association for Psychological Science and the Society for

07:18.460 --> 07:23.020
Neuroethics, was the president of the Society for Neuroeconomics and has served as the editor

07:23.020 --> 07:26.940
of the journal Emotion. She is the current president for the Association for Psychological

07:26.940 --> 07:32.100
Science. And next to her, Christina Alberini, professor in the Center for Neuroscience

07:32.100 --> 07:35.780
at New York University, who has been studying the biological mechanisms of long-term memory

07:35.780 --> 07:40.340
for the last 20 years. Her studies explore the biological mechanisms of memory consolidation

07:40.340 --> 07:45.100
and re-consolidation, the processes by which newly learned information become long-lasting

07:45.100 --> 07:49.660
memories and how memories are modulated and integrated into complex behavioral manifestations

07:49.660 --> 07:54.220
respectively. Her studies also aim at utilizing the basic understandings of the mechanisms

07:54.220 --> 07:58.780
of memory formation to enhance memories and prevent forgetting or disrupt pathogenic

07:58.780 --> 08:04.300
memories. Both approaches have important translational applications. She graduated from the University

08:04.300 --> 08:08.460
of Pavia in Italy with honors and obtained a doctorate in research and immunological sciences

08:08.460 --> 08:12.660
from the University of Genoa. She trained as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University

08:12.660 --> 08:17.740
studying the role of gene expression regulation during long-term synaptic plasticity consolidation

08:17.740 --> 08:23.940
in Applijia, California. From 1997 to 2000, she served on the faculty of Brown University

08:23.940 --> 08:28.980
before joining Mount Sinai in 2001, where she worked until 2011 when she joined the Center

08:28.980 --> 08:34.820
for Neuroscience at NYU. She has received several awards, including the Hershweil Career Scientist

08:34.820 --> 08:41.540
Award, Narsad Independent Investigator Award, McKnight Memory and Cognitive Disorder Award,

08:41.540 --> 08:45.900
Mount Sinai Dean's Award for Excellence in Basic Science Research, Paul Harris Fellow,

08:45.900 --> 08:51.460
Rotary Club, Ramona and NIMH Merrick Award. Since 2004, she has been a member of the Council

08:51.460 --> 08:56.820
of the Molecular and Cellular Cognition Society and served as a society's treasurer from 2006

08:56.820 --> 09:04.100
to 2009 and then as president from 2009 to 2012. So those are the introductions and we

09:04.100 --> 09:12.580
now open the discussion to our participants. Thank you for the introduction. That was a

09:12.580 --> 09:17.580
lot. Yeah, thanks for coming in through the introduction. Okay, I can start. It looks

09:17.580 --> 09:26.340
like it's too. It's a little awkward. Go ahead. So I've been thinking recently about all

09:26.340 --> 09:31.220
these issues of women in science because I have to give some speech in a week about

09:31.220 --> 09:37.660
this issue and I was supposed to give some inspiring talk. So I had thought a little bit

09:37.660 --> 09:43.780
about my history and how I got here and how women surrounded me during my studies and

09:43.780 --> 09:51.100
I ended up telling us, I will be telling a story of how when I was doing my PhD in Jerusalem,

09:51.100 --> 09:57.620
we were a gang of women. We were all together. We were like four or five women doing our

09:57.620 --> 10:03.940
PhD and I was even trying to think whether there were men there or not but I can't remember

10:03.940 --> 10:08.900
but I remember these four or five women. Four or five women and we were together and we

10:08.900 --> 10:13.600
really helped each other throughout our studies and so on. And then towards the end of my

10:13.600 --> 10:21.020
PhD, I went to a conference in San Diego and there I saw another bunch like that. At the

10:21.020 --> 10:27.260
same time at Berkeley, there was also a group of four or five women doing a PhD in theoretical

10:27.260 --> 10:34.180
computer science. So there was the one in Jerusalem and the one in Berkeley and it was

10:34.180 --> 10:42.460
wonderful to see. And then we graduated from our studies and all of us got fantastic jobs

10:42.460 --> 10:50.540
and research institutions and universities, really fantastic jobs. And then I was young

10:50.540 --> 10:55.860
and maybe a little bit foolish and I thought yes, you know, we women we can succeed on

10:55.860 --> 11:01.460
our merit all by ourselves without anybody helping us and if you're good, you'll definitely

11:01.460 --> 11:08.380
get a good job and so on. But it's time elapsed. I really realized that we succeeded in some

11:08.380 --> 11:13.620
way because we had each other and we were helping each other throughout that time in

11:13.620 --> 11:18.100
a way that we saw other women that were doing it and we're getting through it. The Israeli

11:18.100 --> 11:23.220
ones of course, we all had kids, unlike the American ones, we were simply much older than

11:23.220 --> 11:28.820
our counterparts in the US. But we went through it and we saw, okay, even if you have a child,

11:28.820 --> 11:32.540
even if you're pregnant, you can still get through it, you can still travel and we were

11:32.540 --> 11:41.180
really a huge support group. And somehow I feel that I see in percentages, we succeeded

11:41.180 --> 11:46.300
much more than the average woman succeeds who's doing a graduate studies in computer

11:46.300 --> 11:51.180
science and theoretical computer science and getting work. So I realized that somehow

11:51.180 --> 11:57.100
over the time that we need each other and it's somehow for women it's harder and if

11:57.100 --> 12:03.580
they're missing the support group, we succeed less. This was something that I had thought.

12:03.580 --> 12:10.180
I don't know what your experiences were but I had felt that I had misattributed our success

12:10.180 --> 12:15.500
just to our talent and not realized that there really was also a component of the support

12:15.500 --> 12:20.780
group that we got. And many the support group a little bit less. Also in theoretical computer

12:20.780 --> 12:26.580
science, the whole world is a support group because they're all men. There's so few women,

12:26.580 --> 12:32.260
women in theoretical computer science are tops 10%. But I felt that it really helped

12:32.260 --> 12:37.980
me and now I appreciate it.

12:37.980 --> 12:42.260
I think one of the things that I find these days, if I'm on a board or something like

12:42.260 --> 12:47.420
that, I'm almost always the only woman in the room. And when, especially if I'm on an

12:47.420 --> 12:53.780
advisory board, I always point out that I'm the only woman in the room and that's a problem.

12:53.780 --> 12:59.540
And then the answer I always get is, yeah I know there just aren't that many senior

12:59.540 --> 13:05.300
women, you know, discipline. But the good news is, you know, half of our graduate students

13:05.300 --> 13:09.860
are women, half of our postdocs are women. But then I always say, well you know when

13:09.860 --> 13:13.420
I was a graduate student, half the graduate students were women and half the postdocs

13:13.420 --> 13:18.460
were women and now I'm the only woman in the room. And so I think it is the case that

13:18.460 --> 13:23.780
we're training a lot of women these days. But you know, talking about support groups,

13:23.780 --> 13:28.060
you know, maybe you have it at that level but not everybody is getting the same opportunities

13:28.060 --> 13:33.060
going up and being asked through the same thing. I imagine in your discipline you get

13:33.060 --> 13:41.460
that a lot. I realized that I often don't even notice that the other woman in the room.

13:41.460 --> 13:51.620
Because I'm so used to the idea of what normalcy is. But you know thinking about sort of issues,

13:51.620 --> 13:55.980
I think there's sort of two things, right? There's the demographics and then there's

13:55.980 --> 14:04.500
the culture. I think the issue with the demographics is worrisome. They're interrelated of course.

14:04.500 --> 14:10.820
And I think for about if you look at the data for about 30 odd years in many disciplines,

14:10.820 --> 14:15.540
not mine but in a lot of disciplines, especially in the biological sciences for example, you've

14:15.540 --> 14:23.540
had about 50-50 through this sort of metaphorical pipeline, right? But it's progress up the pipeline

14:23.540 --> 14:29.300
that seems to be really problematic. And that's where culture intervenes. And it's culture

14:29.300 --> 14:34.900
with big C, right? I mean, it's our communities, our professional communities, culture, nurturing

14:34.900 --> 14:42.540
talent support groups, mentoring versus sponsoring, all of that. And then culture with a big C,

14:42.540 --> 14:49.620
which is the outside world and stereotyping and expectations and all of that. I think

14:49.620 --> 14:55.540
that has changed. There has been progress. But I think it's just too slow. It's just

14:55.540 --> 15:00.780
been too slow. And I think one of the problems has been that I think a lot of the debate

15:00.780 --> 15:07.820
has gotten mired in the issue of whether women are capable of doing cutting-edge science

15:07.820 --> 15:13.740
or mathematics or abstraction. I think that's a completely pointless debate because what

15:13.740 --> 15:21.780
we do know is that our own sense of sort of stereotyping and expectations that culture

15:21.780 --> 15:27.180
offers bigger impediments that we're fully aware of. And we now know from all these wonderful

15:27.180 --> 15:32.620
studies, and there was a study by colleagues of mine last year, which was really quite

15:32.620 --> 15:37.540
disturbing, amazing and disturbing at the same time. This is a study by Maastra Kussin

15:37.540 --> 15:43.460
and Joe Handelsman, which showed that both men and women are biased. So if you look at

15:43.460 --> 15:51.620
a resume with a male name and a female name circulated to people looking to hire biology

15:51.620 --> 15:57.020
lab assistants, we're not talking of faculty. We're not talking of this is a summer job.

15:57.020 --> 16:03.860
And it's clear that both men and women faculty were biased against young women and were biased

16:03.860 --> 16:08.540
against not just hiring them, but offering the male candidate a higher salary, but also

16:08.540 --> 16:14.300
not wanting. The thing that was most disturbing for me was the fact that they were less likely

16:14.300 --> 16:18.300
to mentor the young women, want to mentor the younger women, so help them improve their

16:18.300 --> 16:23.980
resumes so that they could do better next year. So I think that the fact that culture

16:23.980 --> 16:30.100
intervenes in this very huge fashion, I think it's much more constructive to talk about

16:30.100 --> 16:35.260
that, then to get admired in, you know, are we hardwired and can women do this or not do

16:35.260 --> 16:39.740
that? I just think that's not a very constructive debate. But you know, I leave it to those

16:39.740 --> 16:43.340
of you studying psychology and the brain to...

16:43.340 --> 16:48.580
Well, what's interesting about that Joe Handelman study was that that was a replication of about

16:48.580 --> 16:53.900
50 experiments that had been done previously. The only difference between the studies you

16:53.900 --> 16:58.980
did and one that, you know, someone like Madeleine Holleman, who's at NYU has done over the years,

16:58.980 --> 17:03.300
is that they asked scientists. Right. You know, as if scientists think they were immune.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.220
It's because they're objective. Right. Standard and implicit bias, right? You know.

17:07.220 --> 17:10.420
No, they're objective. Yeah. Yeah. The economists are the worst actually.

17:10.420 --> 17:14.580
They're better and I have three towers. Right. And it got a lot... I mean, I'm glad it got a

17:14.580 --> 17:18.940
lot of attention because it's an important issue, but it's an old finding. Yeah. You know,

17:18.940 --> 17:22.300
that now we've just replicated with scientists. Absolutely. That, you know, we have these very

17:22.300 --> 17:26.900
subtle implicit biases that... And, you know, no one's immune to them because we all grew up

17:26.900 --> 17:30.420
in the same culture, whether you're male or female. You know, it's not like I grew up in a

17:30.420 --> 17:35.620
culture where all the scientists were women, you know. You know, you're not immune to those

17:35.620 --> 17:41.700
things regardless of who you are. By the way, the point that I found shocking, the point

17:41.700 --> 17:46.420
with the mentoring I agree with you, that was really horrifying because that's stepping stone

17:46.420 --> 17:50.260
towards other thing. And I'll mention another research that I thought that related to that.

17:50.260 --> 17:56.420
But the fact that the women were the same as the men. That... Why wasn't shocking to me though?

17:56.420 --> 18:02.420
I always hope that... And by the way, there was just a... I heard an NPR and other research

18:02.420 --> 18:10.020
done recently, not just about gender, but also about race. That black faculty are not more

18:11.220 --> 18:18.180
responsive to black students and so on. So it's across the board. It's not just that women are

18:18.180 --> 18:24.980
failing. But with the mentoring issue, in the past, there was a research which I saw which I thought

18:24.980 --> 18:34.020
somehow related to this point that they did a statistical examination of how many

18:34.020 --> 18:41.380
papers women have in science and in nature. And their percent of the papers was much lower

18:41.380 --> 18:46.820
than their percent in the population. Okay, so let's accept that their percent is 20%, but at

18:46.820 --> 18:54.820
least little that they have 20% of the publications in these leading magazines, but journals.

18:54.820 --> 19:00.020
But this was not the case either. Their percent were lower. And I was trying to give all kinds

19:00.020 --> 19:05.940
of explanations of why this happened. But I always felt that the reason was that when the woman comes

19:05.940 --> 19:12.740
to the advisor to start discussing what problems are possible, what she could work on and so on,

19:12.740 --> 19:20.100
the advisor will never give her the problem that has the potential of being a nature or science

19:20.100 --> 19:26.260
article. That they even aim lower when they're giving them the research. And because that,

19:26.260 --> 19:31.620
they can never go as far. It's hard for me to say because I'm not in these areas. So this was just

19:31.620 --> 19:37.380
my assumption. In my area, it's slightly different. You also have to go and find your own problems.

19:37.380 --> 19:44.900
So you can't blame the advisor. But I think that when it's a lab issue, it's much more that the

19:44.900 --> 19:51.860
advisor hands the problem and that that even is not done in even keel that the women will not be

19:51.860 --> 19:56.260
offered the better problems to work on. Is that the New York, I think it was a New York Times

19:56.260 --> 20:01.780
article, maybe at Yale as well. That's right. This was so long ago that I don't remember the detail.

20:01.780 --> 20:06.580
It was about an undergrad at Yale. Yes, essentially. A woman who was dissuaded.

20:07.220 --> 20:11.540
This was recently, I read that one, but what I'm telling you is something that I heard maybe 10

20:11.540 --> 20:17.860
years ago about research in the beginning of the 2000s. But there are these studies that also show

20:17.860 --> 20:22.100
from, I think it was one of the Nordic countries, probably Sweden, where even funding

20:23.060 --> 20:28.500
there's gender bias in who gets funded. If you look at, and this was a medicine,

20:29.300 --> 20:36.740
that women tend to be less successful in a systematic fashion. And who gets it? Controlling

20:36.740 --> 20:43.700
for everything else. And you get invited to write inventories in science and nature. So after,

20:44.740 --> 20:55.380
one second, I just want to say, after the summer thing, then at MIT, they put a commission in place,

20:55.380 --> 21:02.180
which I forgot the name of the woman who added it. Nancy Hopkins. Right. And there she even found

21:02.180 --> 21:07.860
that women have less lab space. That everything is constrained for women. And of course, you have

21:07.860 --> 21:13.300
less lab space. You can have less students. You can do less research. It's continuous.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.540
Well, the nice thing about the MIT report, I think that was before summer, they were complaining

21:17.540 --> 21:24.260
for years and years and years. And to MIT's credit, they finally did what any good science

21:24.260 --> 21:29.300
institution should do. They got the data. I mean, it took years and years and years of women's

21:29.300 --> 21:33.940
scientists at MIT complaining. With this kind of subjective thing that you always hear,

21:34.660 --> 21:38.420
this person gets a little bit more because they got this article and you only had that article.

21:38.420 --> 21:43.220
But of course, we all know the way these things work. If the genders were switched,

21:43.220 --> 21:45.460
it would have been, well, they got that article and you only had that.

21:45.460 --> 21:53.140
By shifting sense. Exactly. And so I thought they were actually very brave because they got the

21:53.140 --> 21:57.460
data and they published it. And they acknowledged it. And they didn't just acknowledge it among

21:57.460 --> 22:02.500
themselves. I was president of the women's faculty at caucus at NYU for a while. And we also got a

22:02.500 --> 22:08.020
gender equity committee together that did the same types of things. But NYU is not putting their

22:08.020 --> 22:13.540
dirty laundry for everybody to read on the web the way that MIT did. Which I kind of think was

22:13.540 --> 22:21.300
great. It provided some support for, I mean, those women suffered for a long time. And that was

22:21.300 --> 22:26.900
obviously horrible. But the fact that MIT got the data, acknowledged they were wrong,

22:26.900 --> 22:31.700
and acknowledged the dean, if you read that report, acknowledged that this was sort of unconscious

22:31.700 --> 22:37.780
and unknowing. Which is really where the issues are these days. I mean, I think most people have

22:37.780 --> 22:45.940
good intentions. It's just sort of how they act in ways that maybe is not what they really intend

22:46.740 --> 22:51.620
and they aren't even aware of. But I think one thing I have is someone like Christina nearby,

22:51.620 --> 22:56.980
you know, as a colleague. So we always are talking to each other about these little things that

22:56.980 --> 23:00.660
happen. And that's where I find my women colleagues come in handy today because they're like, I

23:00.660 --> 23:06.580
know exactly what you're talking about. I agree with you that this is the best thing. And

23:06.580 --> 23:12.980
unfortunately, not all of us have it. As I say, I can go for a month at work without speaking to

23:12.980 --> 23:23.460
a woman because they're just not around. And it's a problem. And because also I feel,

23:23.460 --> 23:29.460
I have a very close friend in my group, but he's a guy. And I feel that when I do eventually meet

23:29.460 --> 23:36.420
with my friend who is, she's in another group and the conversation is different. I can discuss

23:36.420 --> 23:42.740
the issues with him sometimes. But we speak on it about it on a different level when I speak to her.

23:43.380 --> 23:52.500
There's something about our joint experience that makes her advice different. And you're lucky.

23:53.300 --> 23:57.700
No, I am. I'm very lucky to have colleagues like Christina, you have a friend down the hall

23:57.700 --> 24:01.540
who's Layla, but you know, named Layla. But it's the same thing. Like, if I didn't have somebody

24:01.540 --> 24:04.740
that sort of every once in a while who totally gets what it's like to be a woman in science,

24:04.740 --> 24:07.220
and I could go to. And I think that would be a great question.

24:07.220 --> 24:12.180
I think one of, so for example at Yale, we have this group called the Women's Faculty Forum.

24:12.180 --> 24:16.340
And that's been absolutely fantastic because it's interdisciplinary. It's cross-disciplinary.

24:16.340 --> 24:22.180
It's basically all the senior women from across. And I think I second your point about the data.

24:22.180 --> 24:27.940
So every five years we publish a data of the view of men and women at Yale. It is public.

24:27.940 --> 24:35.620
We make a little less noise about it. But it's sort of guidance to our community and it's helped

24:35.620 --> 24:41.700
set the aspirations for the university. And I said, that is progress, but it is slow.

24:42.420 --> 24:49.220
And I think we cannot underestimate the power of women getting together in institutions,

24:49.220 --> 24:54.340
across levels, across seniority in trying to change.

24:54.340 --> 25:00.100
I agree with that, but I also want to point out to something in addition to that.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.620
It's great to have colleagues to go and talk to. It's great to have support.

25:03.620 --> 25:10.260
But that's not enough. Things are not changing actually. Changing much too slow.

25:11.140 --> 25:18.740
And so how do we promote changes a little faster? I mean, for me it was a wake-up call actually,

25:18.740 --> 25:27.620
looking at the data from MIT, which I met by chance. I was a brown at that time,

25:27.620 --> 25:35.540
assistant professor, so a young faculty. And the colleague, a man, was supposed to go to the NIH

25:35.540 --> 25:41.140
to one of these meetings where they were discussing about women and minorities.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.980
And he couldn't go. And so he said, could you please go?

25:44.980 --> 25:51.140
I can go. I will tell them that you go instead of me. So I went.

25:51.700 --> 25:56.100
And it was not really my choice. And I was like, oh no, why are they sending me to these

25:56.100 --> 26:03.540
things? It's going to be a waste of time. Because I want to put my time into my work,

26:03.540 --> 26:08.580
rather than I go there. And I see this report and I was shocked.

26:08.580 --> 26:17.460
50% women and men are the graduate student level. And post-doc about that.

26:18.180 --> 26:23.860
But then when they start to go into professional career, a system professor,

26:23.860 --> 26:30.820
you start to cut down in half. 25% a system professor. About 12% associate professor,

26:30.820 --> 26:38.100
women, compared to me. About less than 10% food professors. So this was 10 years ago, 12 years

26:38.100 --> 26:43.140
ago. How much did we change from there? If I look at our department, same.

26:45.060 --> 26:49.620
It's a problem. When I was at Yale, I was the junior faculty member in psychology. Peter

26:50.740 --> 26:53.860
salivate was one of my colleagues. And this was before Peter got tenure.

26:54.420 --> 26:56.580
When I first got there, he got tenure while I was there.

26:57.940 --> 27:03.060
There were no senior women on the faculty. And then half of the junior faculty were women.

27:03.060 --> 27:08.980
And we're sitting in the room someday. And we bring this up. And they say, one of our senior

27:08.980 --> 27:13.300
colleagues said, well, we'd love to hire a good woman faculty. We just can't find any good women.

27:13.860 --> 27:18.980
And of course, half the junior women are sitting there in the room.

27:21.620 --> 27:26.820
And one of the things, you see this drop off, and it often gets blamed on women having children

27:26.820 --> 27:30.100
and things like that. But you also have to understand the stuff we put up with.

27:30.100 --> 27:37.540
The kinds of little tiny insults we get on a daily basis. The microaggressions.

27:38.740 --> 27:43.060
It adds up. And if you put men in the same situation, I think more of them would leave as well.

27:43.780 --> 27:48.420
It's not the case that there aren't family issues and stuff, because women tend to have

27:48.420 --> 27:52.180
less support for those types of things as well. But it's also the case that

27:52.180 --> 28:00.500
these things do get to you unless you're unbelievably confident. And confidence is something that

28:00.500 --> 28:05.140
often is lacking in young women scientists. There's some beautiful work by a woman named

28:05.140 --> 28:12.100
Bourgeois Gupta, who's shown that if you, women who are in women colleges with more women

28:12.100 --> 28:18.180
professors in STEM disciplines have much more sense of self-efficacy, they actually do better

28:18.180 --> 28:23.620
than the male students. But how well they feel they're doing, whether they think they could have

28:23.620 --> 28:27.540
a career in it, whether they think they're capable of doing it, has a lot to do with whether they

28:27.540 --> 28:35.780
have female professors. So it's not just the case of you need women to, you have to be confident

28:35.780 --> 28:40.500
yourself. That actually comes from the environment that we create, which is another reason to really

28:40.500 --> 28:46.100
think seriously about who we're putting out there as your examples of women. But Peter is an

28:46.100 --> 28:49.940
interesting case, because Peter's a social psychologist or a clinical... I think this was a time when

28:49.940 --> 28:55.860
Mazarid was there... Mazarid and my old friends, yeah, we collaborate. But he knows this world well.

28:55.860 --> 29:00.980
So he's in an interesting situation to be a university president who really knows about

29:02.580 --> 29:08.260
implicit bias and the subtle effects and these subtle environments that you create that make

29:09.140 --> 29:15.620
it easier or not so easy for women to promote. We're very hopeful that now that he's at the

29:15.620 --> 29:20.980
helm, that the pace of institutional change is going to be much more rapid.

29:20.980 --> 29:25.860
I want to say two points about this thing. So first of all, I agree with you that discussion,

29:25.860 --> 29:30.340
whether we can do science or not, is not that important. But I'm one person that I don't think

29:30.340 --> 29:34.580
that women and men are the same. I do think we're different. And don't start asking me how I think

29:34.580 --> 29:41.540
we're different, because it's slightly unimportant, but on the confidence issue. I think there's no

29:41.540 --> 29:48.340
question about it. If you look at averages, women are not as confident as men are. I hear my colleagues

29:48.340 --> 29:54.580
speaking at conferences about their work. I would never use the superlatives that they use. About

29:54.580 --> 30:01.220
their own work, I would never use it about my work. I even once had an incident that some guy was

30:01.220 --> 30:06.260
talking about his work. He still didn't mention what it was. And I was thinking, what work does he

30:06.260 --> 30:13.220
have that satisfy these descriptions? Turned out it was a joint paper. But I would have never used

30:13.220 --> 30:21.300
these things. So I think that we do lack in our capabilities of self-promotion. I think it's a

30:21.300 --> 30:28.180
little bit of how we are and what we are. And I think if I look around at one of my women colleagues,

30:28.180 --> 30:34.660
they definitely are above the curve in their confidence and so on. So in order to survive in

30:34.660 --> 30:41.940
this world, there is unfortunately a selection happening based on personality. And I'm sure that

30:41.940 --> 30:46.820
we're losing great scientists in the process. But I don't know its personality. I think it's

30:47.380 --> 30:52.500
the environment we create. I mean, if you're an undergraduate and you're just trying to figure

30:52.500 --> 30:58.740
out, am I any good at this? And all you see are men. And you don't identify with any of them,

30:58.740 --> 31:04.420
and you're not getting the extra support. I mean, I think that is her environment and

31:04.420 --> 31:11.700
not just her personality. I agree that the question of role models is huge. That's not an issue. And I

31:11.700 --> 31:17.380
think that for example, in computer science, we need to pass some hurdle and we'll have like a

31:17.380 --> 31:22.420
slightly exponential growth for a slow time. It won't bring us to high percents. But I think

31:22.420 --> 31:27.860
if we have a bit more, there are women who don't see female professors at all due to the presence

31:27.860 --> 31:33.460
in the universities. I agree with that. But I still think when I'm looking at the women who have

31:33.460 --> 31:39.220
survived, a person like me, I would definitely say that I do not lack in confidence. Okay? And

31:39.220 --> 31:45.060
anybody who knows me would say that as well. But I have to tell you that I'm not like the guys.

31:45.060 --> 31:52.020
I see it even on these little things. You know, each of them, they think that they're the best.

31:52.020 --> 31:57.300
I don't think that I'm the best. I think that there are people around me who are very, very

31:57.300 --> 32:04.180
talented. But these guys, if you ask their inner inner self, they think they're the best.

32:06.020 --> 32:16.180
But they think it. We don't know. I've had a few say it. So I've had a few say it. So I definitely

32:16.180 --> 32:21.860
think that. So that is one point that I wanted to touch about. I want to go back to your point

32:21.860 --> 32:30.260
about change. And how do we bring it about? And I am a person that I believe that we need to take

32:30.900 --> 32:37.540
active measures to improve these things. And it's a two-edged sword. I don't think that it's a

32:37.540 --> 32:42.660
great solution. But I think we don't have another solution. I think that things that

32:43.780 --> 32:50.420
things actively need to be awarded to women. And not for a second do I think that we'll be lowering

32:50.420 --> 32:57.220
the quality. I think we'll be fixing for the biases that the people who are awarding the things have.

32:58.020 --> 33:05.300
Because all these things like that. But you know, before we go there, I think a more radical way

33:05.300 --> 33:14.100
to do that is just to shift the idea within our communities of who are successful scientists.

33:14.100 --> 33:21.940
So I believe that it might be more fruitful for us women to not buy into this sort of

33:21.940 --> 33:27.140
male notion of success. The male notion of the presentation of the self, all this self-promotion

33:27.140 --> 33:32.820
whatever. Break, you know, make a break and say well there are different ways to be outstanding

33:32.820 --> 33:39.540
scientists. You don't have to talk yourself up all the time. And I think that shift in culture

33:39.540 --> 33:46.580
will be much more, will have more staying power. I agree with you as an end goal. But I don't agree

33:46.580 --> 33:53.380
in the order because I think that our percent are too low to impact to say this is what a successful

33:53.380 --> 33:59.060
scientist is. I think we first have to increase our numbers a little bit. And then we can start

33:59.060 --> 34:06.260
and change the culture to say look this is also success. This is also good. But to raise the number,

34:06.260 --> 34:11.860
I think the thing, I think you need to do both at the same time. You can't wait for the demographics.

34:11.860 --> 34:19.060
I agree. It has to be hand in hand. But I think that at this point people are a little bit hesitant

34:19.060 --> 34:29.540
about saying the NIH is giving funding. There's 30 percent of women, they need to get 30 percent

34:29.540 --> 34:35.140
of the funding. I'm sure they're getting below their percent. Just to actively say that because then

34:35.140 --> 34:42.500
the other people will say she got it because she's a woman. She didn't get it based on merit. But I

34:42.500 --> 34:50.260
say who cares? I have to tell you. I was on, I organized this workshop of Women in Theory,

34:51.220 --> 34:57.700
which was meant in the introduction. And in this workshop I always have a panel. The workshop is

34:57.700 --> 35:03.540
for graduate students and all the speakers are faculty. And the women love this panel. They eat

35:03.540 --> 35:13.060
the stuff that the women say, the advanced women in their career. And I invited a professor from MIT,

35:13.620 --> 35:20.580
Nancy Lynch. For me, Nancy Lynch was one of the women, one of my role models. She was their already

35:20.580 --> 35:27.780
superstar, amazing research, breakthrough results. She's like, and then she sits on this panel.

35:27.780 --> 35:38.100
And she starts telling her story. Turns out she was a female hire at MIT. Nobody today would think

35:38.100 --> 35:43.860
of her as a female hire. And she had said, you know, take these opportunities. Who cares how they

35:43.860 --> 35:52.500
arrived? And make the most of it. And shortly after, people will forget that this was a female hire.

35:52.500 --> 35:58.900
Just prove yourself and do the work that needs to be done. And that's what I'm saying. You know,

35:58.900 --> 36:03.780
let's get the money. Let's get the positions based on these. I don't want to call them affirmative

36:03.780 --> 36:08.420
actions because I don't think they're affirmative. Correcting actions because it's just to fix

36:08.420 --> 36:15.940
where the bias is. And let's make the most of them. And we, the women who are here currently,

36:15.940 --> 36:21.540
we're like the generation walked through the desert. You know, we're going to suffer. But for a better

36:21.540 --> 36:26.500
cause, it will be said that we got things that we didn't deserve. Can I just say, I mean, it's,

36:26.500 --> 36:30.820
you know, irrespective of that situation, I need to go back and do that. It's not,

36:31.860 --> 36:37.460
women are not necessarily always women's advocates. I mean, all of the literature suggests that women

36:37.460 --> 36:43.060
are equally gender-based. I agree. You know, and I think you really need to pay attention to that.

36:43.060 --> 36:47.060
I mean, you know, one of the things is they think if they're going to fix this situation by getting

36:47.060 --> 36:51.860
a woman on the search committee, that makes no difference whatsoever. And it just makes all of

36:51.860 --> 36:56.340
your women do extra committee work. You know, I mean, that's a classic thing of a woman,

36:56.340 --> 37:00.580
faculty members want every committee. And we can't get our work done because we're actually always

37:00.580 --> 37:05.220
doing service. And the service gets dumped on us. But I didn't say to put us on committees, I said

37:05.220 --> 37:10.260
to give us the amount of research. What I'm saying is bringing women, like promoting women more

37:10.260 --> 37:22.020
through is not going to change if you don't change the culture. I have not been having a woman that has not been handed hand, but what I'm saying, back to your point of role models.

37:22.020 --> 37:32.580
Of role models, if you get, if in computer science, there'd be more than 10%, then the young students coming in through the pipeline to go have the role models.

37:32.580 --> 37:40.180
So I'm saying that's why I said we're the generation of the desert. We will be the ones who will get things and it'll be said that we didn't get them from merit.

37:40.180 --> 37:47.620
But the minute that there's enough women, it'll impact the younger females and they'll stay on.

37:47.620 --> 37:54.100
I'd just like to interject one thing. I think it's a great relevance.

37:54.100 --> 38:08.980
Rosalne Franklin's experience, speaking of, you know, a previous generation, I'm wondering, you know, from her perspective as a non-scientist and having a deep knowledge of her experiences, how that might

38:08.980 --> 38:10.740
expand the discussion.

38:10.740 --> 38:18.660
Yeah, I mean, it's been really interesting for me to sit here and listen to everyone.

38:18.660 --> 38:27.780
Because I'm not a scientist and I'll say two things very carefully.

38:27.780 --> 38:32.340
Is that my mic, I guess?

38:32.340 --> 38:48.340
And one is that, I mean, just coming from a theatre perspective, and I know we're not here to talk about theatre, but I'm going to play right, and we're having all the same conversations in theatre.

38:48.340 --> 39:02.260
And it's really discouraging, I think, to, I mean, I'm not surprised that the same conversations are happening in the science world, but I guess what I find most discouraging to hear is just that everyone,

39:02.260 --> 39:06.820
knows about these biases, and just knowledge of them doesn't do anything apparently.

39:06.820 --> 39:07.820
That's right.

39:07.820 --> 39:08.820
That's certainly true.

39:08.820 --> 39:22.980
In theatre too, there have been all these studies that suggest that female artistic directors who run theatres are not any more likely to program women's plays, for instance.

39:22.980 --> 39:28.260
And there are just as many women, if not more, writing plays right now.

39:28.260 --> 39:37.060
There are more women in graduate school, and 13%, I think, of plays produced around the country are plays written by women.

39:37.060 --> 39:41.460
So, I mean, the numbers are very stark as well.

39:41.460 --> 39:58.060
And I think that your questions about sort of what should come first are certainly the questions, but I don't think at least in theatre, and it sounds like in the science world too.

39:58.060 --> 40:10.460
There might not be enough enthusiasm to really make those changes because there's so many factors at that play, and you just don't know how to unravel them.

40:10.460 --> 40:27.860
But as far as Rosalind Franklin is concerned, I mean, I think when I was writing that play, and I'm not a scientist, I assumed that I was writing a piece of history, and that the landscape in 1953 was radically different.

40:27.860 --> 40:33.260
Then the advanced landscape in the science world for women today.

40:33.260 --> 40:43.060
And of course, I mean, it comes as no surprise to anyone here, but to me, the response to the play was shocking, has been shocking.

40:43.060 --> 40:47.060
It's been done all around the country, and most...

40:47.060 --> 40:48.460
So, why are you shocked?

40:48.460 --> 40:52.460
Well, I mean, I was initially, I'm certainly not, I certainly not, no more.

40:52.460 --> 40:57.860
That women would say, oh, the challenges are really still the same as they were over 50 years ago.

40:57.860 --> 41:06.260
And I would say largely sort of older women scientists mostly espouse that view.

41:06.260 --> 41:12.060
It seemed like younger women scientists for the most part were more optimistic.

41:12.060 --> 41:21.860
I don't know if that's something that you guys find, but it does seem like a shame that a lot of the legacy of trailblazers,

41:21.860 --> 41:28.660
you know, over 50 years ago, it's all, it's just not changing fast enough, and that's...

41:28.660 --> 41:32.060
It just seems to be true across every field.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.060
That's what's so discouraging.

41:34.060 --> 41:45.060
I think I have to say that things have improved since the, it's the work of the previous generation that has made my walk down the corridor somewhat easier,

41:45.060 --> 41:47.660
and that, you know, that has to be acknowledged.

41:47.660 --> 41:53.460
There has been some progress, very hard-earned, but again, you know, insufficient.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.060
The Nancy Hopkins.

41:55.060 --> 41:56.060
Yeah, yeah.

41:56.060 --> 42:01.460
I have to say about your point that maybe people were a little older feel differently.

42:01.460 --> 42:09.860
I was being interviewed for the New York Times, and I was 10 years younger than the other women researchers.

42:09.860 --> 42:21.060
It was Jill from Columbia, I forgot her name, and Marie King from, she's a biologist from Washington.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.060
Never mind.

42:22.060 --> 42:25.060
Anyway, they were all an April...

42:25.060 --> 42:26.060
Helena Priya.

42:26.060 --> 42:29.460
Helena Priya from, but they're all like 10 years older than me.

42:29.460 --> 42:35.260
And we were all discussing, and then I was the most optimistic in some sense.

42:35.260 --> 42:36.660
The interview ended.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.460
They started screaming at me.

42:38.460 --> 42:40.660
How dare you say that?

42:40.660 --> 42:46.460
It was like, and I was thinking, how can it be that even the sense...

42:46.460 --> 42:48.060
And I was saying that it was hard.

42:48.060 --> 42:54.660
I didn't say that it was easy, but I felt that they, they felt that for me, it was easier,

42:54.660 --> 42:58.860
and that I was trying to make a light of how hard it was, but I wasn't.

42:58.860 --> 43:05.060
I did say it was hard, but there was a measurable difference between how they clearly felt it and I felt it.

43:05.060 --> 43:11.460
So I guess 10 years did make a difference, and I hope that we're making a difference for women who are a bit younger.

43:11.460 --> 43:16.660
I don't know, but hopefully things are improving too slow.

43:16.660 --> 43:22.660
But I think that there is a point to be made about this larger culture scene.

43:22.660 --> 43:28.460
So I did my schooling in India, but I came here as an undergraduate, as a young undergraduate.

43:28.460 --> 43:34.460
And it has to be said, from my understanding of American culture now, compared to my experience growing up,

43:34.460 --> 43:40.260
when I was growing up in India, there was absolutely no taboo about girls' contour science or math.

43:40.260 --> 43:44.660
This was before the pre-Barbie times.

43:44.660 --> 43:53.260
And actually, the cooler kids in school did the harder stuff, and that's how you became cool.

43:53.260 --> 43:55.860
I mean, because you were doing challenging things.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.260
And that is very different.

43:57.260 --> 44:02.660
Having taught students here now, as a faculty member and an American now,

44:02.660 --> 44:05.660
not having gone through the school experience here, however,

44:05.660 --> 44:14.860
I noticed that there is a huge component that is pertinent to when girl kids and boy kids are in school and come through high school.

44:14.860 --> 44:21.660
There's something about this particular version of stereotyping of scientists and mathematicians,

44:21.660 --> 44:29.260
this whole sort of cool versus nerds thing that gets started and gets reinforced very early, very early.

44:29.260 --> 44:36.460
So we're actually losing a lot of, it's another matter that once you make it and you get to have a PhD and so on,

44:36.460 --> 44:40.860
the point is we're losing a huge amount of talent beforehand.

44:40.860 --> 44:50.260
So why do you think that this issue affects the girls more than it affects the guys, the social issues that you're talking about or relevant to the guys?

44:50.260 --> 44:58.660
It affects the guys in the sense that the ways in which it affects the guys is that this image of the need to be successful,

44:58.660 --> 45:04.260
the need to be the breadwinner, to sort of, they have very different pressures.

45:04.260 --> 45:09.260
The pressures that operate on the women are pertinent to their dropping out from science and math.

45:09.260 --> 45:14.260
And for young boys and men, it is about success in the world.

45:14.260 --> 45:17.460
Steere typing of how it is that they get to be successful in the world.

45:17.460 --> 45:19.460
So there are pressures for both genders.

45:19.460 --> 45:26.460
But I think pertinent to our conversation now is the fact that a lot of girl kids feel very discouraged

45:26.460 --> 45:29.660
and drop out of science and math in this country early on.

45:29.660 --> 45:34.660
And I think that is what I find quite sad because it can be reversed.

45:34.660 --> 45:41.860
And often it comes back to some of the questions we were talking about, which is really how we view success and failure.

45:41.860 --> 45:45.460
And I've noticed this in my teaching.

45:45.460 --> 45:53.260
I'm collecting the data for the last seven years or so, which is our perception of how successful we are.

45:53.260 --> 45:57.460
So I have, I give out a survey before I do a test.

45:57.460 --> 46:00.260
And it's just quoted by gender and it's anonymous otherwise.

46:00.260 --> 46:04.060
And I ask them, how do you think you're going to do on this exam?

46:04.060 --> 46:08.260
And then I look at the distribution afterwards.

46:08.260 --> 46:10.060
And it's quite skewed.

46:10.060 --> 46:15.060
If you look by gender, the guy kids always think they're going to do better than they actually did.

46:15.060 --> 46:19.060
And the girl kids actually do better than they thought.

46:19.060 --> 46:21.060
This goes exactly back to the other side.

46:21.060 --> 46:25.660
The confidence of how you think that your work is, that's what I said.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.860
The guys always think that they're great.

46:27.860 --> 46:30.660
And I don't want to say about the rest of you.

46:30.660 --> 46:32.460
I don't think I'm the smartest.

46:32.460 --> 46:33.260
Right.

46:33.260 --> 46:37.260
But you know, I think it's the response that's more interesting.

46:37.260 --> 46:43.460
So it will always be, the girl students will come to my office when they don't do well on a test and say,

46:43.460 --> 46:46.260
well, professor, I really don't think I can have this material.

46:46.260 --> 46:48.860
And do you think I should drop the class?

46:48.860 --> 46:55.660
And the male students, not surprisingly, will always say, well, you know, your test was too hard.

46:55.660 --> 47:02.260
You didn't quite cover what you did in class on the test, et cetera, et cetera, you know, the usual stuff.

47:02.260 --> 47:12.460
So I think there is something that gets shaped much earlier about success, failure, confidence, kind of, you know.

47:12.460 --> 47:16.060
But I think it's something that happens well before you're standing on a podium

47:16.060 --> 47:19.860
and giving an invited talk in front of, you know, the American Astronomical Society.

47:19.860 --> 47:28.460
It's just, you know, the, so I think the problem, the solutions have to start at every stage,

47:28.460 --> 47:35.260
right from, you know, infancy for expectations of, you know, when you have like a girl child versus a boy child.

47:35.260 --> 47:42.060
I see a lot of my friends who are parents and, you know, just the subtle ways in which the expectations are different

47:42.060 --> 47:45.060
and how they get loaded on to kids.

47:45.060 --> 47:50.460
And then through the school system, you know, and the teaching of mathematics and sciences as well.

47:50.460 --> 47:56.460
So I think the problem is very complex and I personally think that there isn't a sequence.

47:56.460 --> 48:00.660
I think we have to solve it at every stage and that's when it's kind of finally kind of,

48:00.660 --> 48:02.060
I think you know, come together.

48:02.060 --> 48:05.060
I'm the president of the Association of Psychological Science.

48:05.060 --> 48:08.060
You know, one of the things that I'm trying to do as president is society.

48:08.060 --> 48:14.060
I mean, we are the society of scientists that study bias, you know, and produce the science on bias.

48:14.060 --> 48:18.060
And interestingly, we haven't been evaluating ourselves, you know.

48:18.060 --> 48:23.060
So that's, you know, that's actually been my one initiative because you're only president for a year.

48:23.060 --> 48:27.060
About what you can do is actually just start to get the numbers much like MIT did.

48:27.060 --> 48:32.060
But I think one of the challenges we have as a science who studies these things is, you know,

48:32.060 --> 48:34.060
we've been very good at documenting.

48:34.060 --> 48:38.060
We've been very good at documenting implicit bias, the type of studies that, you know,

48:38.060 --> 48:43.060
Joe Handelman did, which have been done in lots of other contexts.

48:43.060 --> 48:46.060
And we haven't been good at coming up with solutions, you know.

48:46.060 --> 48:50.060
And I think that's actually a fault of our science is that, you know, we can't, I mean,

48:50.060 --> 48:56.060
documenting is obviously the first stage of anything and knowing what the problems are and knowing where the, you know,

48:56.060 --> 48:57.060
where the issues are.

48:57.060 --> 49:02.060
And I agree it's at every level and you sort of need to decide which level you're going to work on.

49:02.060 --> 49:07.060
But I mean, we also should as a science be able to produce some great recommendations.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.060
And we haven't done a very good job.

49:09.060 --> 49:15.060
And the one recommendation that has come out of all of these resume studies, which isn't usually used,

49:15.060 --> 49:21.060
is to decide your criteria for hiring before you even look at an application.

49:21.060 --> 49:28.060
Because what happens is your criteria shift depending on whether it's a male, resume, or a female resume.

49:28.060 --> 49:29.060
All right.

49:29.060 --> 49:34.060
So decide your, you know, have real criteria for promotion and real criteria for, you know,

49:34.060 --> 49:40.060
for hiring, like what you're looking for in this position before you ever look at an application or before you even

49:40.060 --> 49:42.060
have the information to evaluate anybody.

49:42.060 --> 49:46.060
And that seems to reduce somewhat this bias.

49:46.060 --> 49:47.060
I mean, nobody follows that.

49:47.060 --> 49:54.060
But having said that, you know, we haven't gotten a lot of other good ideas that the science would say really works.

49:54.060 --> 49:58.060
And I think that's a fault of our science is figuring out, you know, we're all sort of, you know,

49:58.060 --> 50:04.060
conjecturing on how we're supposed to fix this. And the truth is the psychological, you know, the study of psychology,

50:04.060 --> 50:09.060
the experimental study of psychology is the science to help answer those questions and we haven't done that.

50:09.060 --> 50:15.060
So about the solutions, I didn't really mean to say that we should prioritize and so on.

50:15.060 --> 50:20.060
The truth is that what I believe in, that we have to shoot in all directions.

50:20.060 --> 50:21.060
Exactly.

50:21.060 --> 50:26.060
I think you may be able to give some good recommendations, but I think that we really don't understand completely

50:26.060 --> 50:29.060
the source of the problems and what's driving anything.

50:29.060 --> 50:32.060
And because of that, we should try as much as we can.

50:32.060 --> 50:37.060
So I know that I, on my personal level, I try to do various things.

50:37.060 --> 50:41.060
I go to schools to talk to students and I talk to women.

50:41.060 --> 50:45.060
I mean, I go to elementary schools and high schools and I talk, I do this workshop.

50:45.060 --> 50:49.060
In my hiring practices, I'm aware of these things.

50:49.060 --> 50:53.060
So I always pay attention that I'll have a female summer student.

50:53.060 --> 51:00.060
If I'm on a committee, I, things that I organize, I try to do that one of the speakers, at least out of the bunch,

51:00.060 --> 51:03.060
will be a woman's, so I pay attention to these things.

51:03.060 --> 51:08.060
And I think that maybe what we need to do is just to raise our level of attention and say,

51:08.060 --> 51:11.060
everybody, don't wait for instructions.

51:11.060 --> 51:15.060
Do locally, whatever you can do and try to improve.

51:15.060 --> 51:19.060
And maybe that will cause somewhat of a change.

51:19.060 --> 51:26.060
I just wanted to respond a little bit to, I mean, I think the work that's come out of psychology has been fascinating and fantastic.

51:26.060 --> 51:34.060
The only thing I really worry about is that, you know, if ultimately, I'm worried that we maybe get a little paralyzed,

51:34.060 --> 51:39.060
because if ultimately all of us are biased, then that's that, right?

51:39.060 --> 51:44.060
But there are some very interesting solutions as you, I mean, interventions, little nudges, interventions that...

51:44.060 --> 51:50.060
Well, even just being, I mean, probably one of the best interventions. It's just being aware that you're not immune.

51:50.060 --> 51:52.060
That's right. You know, that you are not immune.

51:52.060 --> 51:55.060
You know, I am a woman of science. I'm not immune to gender bias and science.

51:55.060 --> 52:00.060
Right. Right. And knowing that, and individuals who are aware of the fact that these things are subtle,

52:00.060 --> 52:04.060
they're based on a culture. It's not a personal, it's not about your beliefs. It's not about your morality.

52:04.060 --> 52:08.060
It's based on the fact that you grew up, where these were your role models.

52:08.060 --> 52:11.060
Right. You know, and these are the stereotypes you learned.

52:11.060 --> 52:16.060
That's going to seep in in little ways that you aren't necessarily thinking about whoever you are.

52:16.060 --> 52:19.060
And being aware of that actually changes your decisions.

52:19.060 --> 52:25.060
So I think this is really, you know, so, you know, just even discussions now in search committees,

52:25.060 --> 52:30.060
having them read about implicit bias, thinking about it as they're doing things.

52:30.060 --> 52:36.060
You know, I've been in faculty hiring committees where they'll be like, well, you know, she hasn't published anything without her advisor.

52:36.060 --> 52:40.060
How do we know it's her ideas? I'm like, I'm like, we don't hire anybody who doesn't publish with their advisor.

52:40.060 --> 52:49.060
Ever. You know, why? You know, and I get calls saying with a male student, you know, did you have anything to do with that?

52:49.060 --> 52:53.060
And then I get calls with a female student like, did she have anything to do with that?

52:53.060 --> 52:56.060
You know, you get it all the time. You see it constantly.

52:56.060 --> 53:03.060
But you know, if you're aware of it, you would never, when I point out to the NIH grad officer who asked me if I had anything to do with my own work,

53:03.060 --> 53:07.060
how sexist that sounds, he's horrified. He realizes in a second.

53:07.060 --> 53:13.060
But I mean, the point is that, you know, even if you're aware of it, I mean, it seems like you have to be persistent.

53:13.060 --> 53:24.060
You do. You do. You do. You do. You do. You do. You do. You do. You do. You kind of just all of a sudden make that.

53:24.060 --> 53:28.060
Every time you write a letter, think about it. Right. Think about the decisions that matter.

53:28.060 --> 53:34.060
And I think just even having that, you know, in a search committee, a conversation or search committee before you start,

53:34.060 --> 53:41.060
it does change people's thoughts about things. You know, just, it does make a difference.

53:41.060 --> 53:47.060
And, but I think people have a hard time accepting the fact that they too are biased.

53:47.060 --> 53:48.060
They may be biased, you know.

53:48.060 --> 53:53.060
So on top of all these things, as I said, I think we should do everything. Everything that's mentioned should be done.

53:53.060 --> 54:00.060
And of course, these things are very important. But I also think the decisions should be made that are just operational,

54:00.060 --> 54:06.060
that you have no room for deviating. For example, with funding.

54:06.060 --> 54:13.060
Any field that has 25% women, 25% of government grants are going to go to those women.

54:13.060 --> 54:18.060
And then there's no room for deviation. They're going to have to choose a woman to give her the money.

54:18.060 --> 54:25.060
And I think that these things will help, first of all, it will help because we'll have the money.

54:25.060 --> 54:31.060
And then it'll also slowly enable these women are going to have students.

54:31.060 --> 54:43.060
I found, by the way, that any guy who's ever worked with a woman has changed his perception, that these men, because if the woman was good,

54:43.060 --> 54:50.060
they see it differently because there's nothing like a close-up example.

54:50.060 --> 54:52.060
So you see that those men are better.

54:52.060 --> 54:56.060
So a woman shall have a lap, she'll have more money, she'll have male students.

54:56.060 --> 55:02.060
These guys will change their opinion of women. They will grow to be heads of departments and so on.

55:02.060 --> 55:13.060
And they'll have a different, so it'll seep in some ways, just making sure that we get our fair share of the resources at any given time.

55:13.060 --> 55:18.060
How do you persuade people to make that happen, I guess? I mean, it seems like the...

55:18.060 --> 55:24.060
I mean, it's a loss, but who is less than a target for it.

55:24.060 --> 55:31.060
Promoting them and enforcing them. I mean, it just seems like even the most progressive people in various fields want these things to happen,

55:31.060 --> 55:35.060
but then don't actually enact any...

55:35.060 --> 55:38.060
That's why they want the decision.

55:38.060 --> 55:41.060
The decision is going to come from some governmental office.

55:41.060 --> 55:48.060
We're having the NIH this month. For each field, here is the percent that goes to women.

55:48.060 --> 55:51.060
I think part of the reason why this is not simple, definitely in academia,

55:51.060 --> 55:56.060
and there may be similar things that operate in other creative fields, like yours on it,

55:56.060 --> 56:07.060
is that there is this notion of a meritocracy and a shared understanding of what is excellence.

56:07.060 --> 56:15.060
And I think that's the tension. The tension really is that if you do anything proactive,

56:15.060 --> 56:21.060
you are doing it at the expense of a meritocracy and excellence, right?

56:21.060 --> 56:24.060
No, I don't have to agree that we're going to be losing on the excellence.

56:24.060 --> 56:28.060
I'm not saying we are losing. I think that's the fear for people.

56:28.060 --> 56:35.060
It's a two-edged sword. And that's why I said, we're a generation that we will need to suffer,

56:35.060 --> 56:39.060
and we're being told that we got it just because there was an allocation.

56:39.060 --> 56:43.060
I can live with that. I have no problems. I do my research.

56:43.060 --> 56:46.060
I'm happy with what it is. I'm confident about what it is.

56:46.060 --> 56:52.060
And if this will make things better for the next generation, then I think we've gained something.

56:52.060 --> 56:53.060
No, but I mean...

56:53.060 --> 56:59.060
What you're saying is exactly you adhering to the definition of the guys, what they said.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.060
I'm not saying... I'm just saying that that's the problem. This is not my opinion.

57:03.060 --> 57:08.060
I'm just saying that the tension comes because the people who are currently in power

57:08.060 --> 57:16.060
see that you are diluting excellence if you make an allowance for a proportional representation.

57:16.060 --> 57:18.060
Okay, so you have to talk about my opinion.

57:18.060 --> 57:22.060
Okay, so you're talking to these people who just make the decisions.

57:22.060 --> 57:27.060
It's not when you're in the department, this is money coming from the guy's pocket

57:27.060 --> 57:31.060
and going into the girls' pocket, and he's unhappy and he doesn't want to do it.

57:31.060 --> 57:34.060
So you're talking about governmental administrations.

57:34.060 --> 57:40.060
You come and you tell them, you're biased. You give them the whole discussion that she's saying.

57:40.060 --> 57:44.060
And you show them that they're going to make these decisions in a wrong way.

57:44.060 --> 57:50.060
And based on that, you say, and now you have to put the rule in place in order to prevent the bias

57:50.060 --> 57:56.060
that women will get 30% of the funding if they're 30% of the field.

57:56.060 --> 57:58.060
And then he'll be talking...

57:58.060 --> 58:01.060
I think that he's not losing an exercise.

58:01.060 --> 58:04.060
But that's the point. How do you convince all the men is the issue?

58:04.060 --> 58:07.060
How do you make this a policy is where it's at?

58:07.060 --> 58:12.060
I mean, this is a suggestion that I have.

58:12.060 --> 58:14.060
I mean, I think complex, right?

58:14.060 --> 58:18.060
As we have discussed, it's complex, but there are very simple things to do

58:18.060 --> 58:21.060
that I don't even see in place, for example.

58:21.060 --> 58:27.060
For example, in academia or in the institutions where things can be under control,

58:27.060 --> 58:31.060
they could, are women paid less than men or equally?

58:31.060 --> 58:34.060
Let's get the data. Let's change the numbers.

58:34.060 --> 58:38.060
Are there more committees, less important committees?

58:38.060 --> 58:41.060
Let's get the data. Let's change the numbers. This is easy.

58:41.060 --> 58:44.060
It should have been done yesterday.

58:44.060 --> 58:47.060
Let's hope it's going to be done tomorrow.

58:47.060 --> 58:50.060
We have a number of numbers on those that are in the way.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.060
I mean, they are being done that way.

58:52.060 --> 58:54.060
And? Yeah, they're done.

58:54.060 --> 58:58.060
I mean, when they first did this, there was a big discrepancy between,

58:58.060 --> 59:01.060
and we have a gender equity report, there's a big discrepancy between pay.

59:01.060 --> 59:06.060
And so the university over the years has tried to make sure that becomes less so.

59:06.060 --> 59:11.060
Where the discrepancy is at NYU right now is a lot in the promotion rates.

59:11.060 --> 59:14.060
And the time of promotion, everything like that can be passed through.

59:14.060 --> 59:17.060
Exactly. For us, too, that's the challenge.

59:17.060 --> 59:20.060
But that is the responsibility. Those are people we take this.

59:20.060 --> 59:25.060
The problem with NYU in terms of just because I know the data at NYU,

59:25.060 --> 59:28.060
there aren't enough women in science to get good numbers.

59:28.060 --> 59:32.060
That's really the issue right now. So we have very good numbers for the humanities and things like that.

59:32.060 --> 59:37.060
There just aren't enough women in science departments to have anything more than examples here and there,

59:37.060 --> 59:39.060
so we can't actually do a full-on-out.

59:39.060 --> 59:40.060
We don't have good systematics.

59:40.060 --> 59:42.060
To look at things systematically.

59:42.060 --> 59:46.060
So the numbers are too few in science to look at any systematic discrimination

59:46.060 --> 59:49.060
where in other departments they were able to do this type of stuff.

59:49.060 --> 59:54.060
But in science, the numbers are still so small that you can't pull out anything.

59:54.060 --> 59:58.060
There are things that don't require a lot of numbers.

59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.060
Sometimes I get into the stupidest bets with my friends.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.060
I don't know when I'm... And then I just want to prove that point.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:10.060
So we were discussing about salaries and about salaries of professors in history.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:18.060
So I went, I looked for a top 10 public university, Berkeley, in history, top 10.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060
All the salaries, of course, are known.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:24.060
I went and I checked the salary of every full professor in that department.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.060
You see, I have a little bit of an OCD thing.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:33.060
So anyway, I go and I look and I don't remember, first of all, I was shocked that people in history

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:40.060
could make $203,000, $303,000 a year. I was impressed.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.060
Anyways.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:47.060
So I start and I look at the salaries of all the people in this department

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.060
and what a wonder.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:01:00.060
The bottom nine salaries had seven women and one woman had a salary higher than that.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.060
And there were like about 30 people in the department.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.060
And this has nothing to do with science.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:09.060
This was just in the humanities.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:13.060
So we know we're not doing well. That's not even a question.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.060
Those things can be easily fixed.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:21.060
You would think so I wrote to the women in the bottom seven.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.060
And I asked them, can you explain to me what's going on here?

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:28.060
Is it an issue because you're less senior?

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.060
Because I don't know anything.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.060
I took a list from the department.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.060
I don't think they know. They probably don't know.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.060
They can answer my emails.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.060
They can answer my emails.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.060
But I think a lot of institutions are trying.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.060
Actually, in fact, I must admit.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.060
Berkeley is an exemplar in many ways because it's a public university.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:54.060
So they have a vice provost and an amazing woman Angie Stacey who's been looking at the

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.060
data and trying to equalize.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:05.060
But I think part of the question in institutions like mine, for instance, is the lack of transparency

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:07.060
for some of this data.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:13.060
And the reason I think this is important is that the same culture of lack of transparency

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:16.060
propagates to promotions in tenure.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:22.060
So I think this whole, you know, we sort of touched upon this idea of shifting criteria

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:29.060
and what the real criteria are and how you evaluate people, the biases that sort of creep in there.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.060
Those are even hard to quantify.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.060
So because we don't actually have the statistics.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.060
How many women are actually put up for tenure?

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.060
How many get it?

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.060
Don't get it?

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.060
Why?

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.060
Et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:46.060
So those are things that we should all definitely push within our institutions to learn and understand

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.060
and diagnose much, much better.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:55.060
So recently I was involved with this Swiss foundation, this group called the Ed Strategy

01:02:55.060 --> 01:03:02.060
Group, where they've been working so far on trying a very clever, cute idea in the corporate world.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:11.060
So what they do is they look at, you know, they are devoted to pay equity, basically gender pay equity

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.060
for the same work.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:17.060
And what they do is they look at institutions, corporations, and they look at survey, employee survey data

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:22.060
about, you know, how much they're getting paid, their satisfaction, whether they're supported, mentored, et cetera.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:29.060
They look at the HR policies that are, you know, pertinent to that group.

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:34.060
And then they talk to the CEOs, people in the C-suite about, you know, how is it going, how are the promotions going.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.060
And then they do a triangulation to look at the consistency.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:44.060
I mean, is the perception of the employees in alignment with the policies?

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.060
And they find these huge gaps.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.060
And, you know, sort of it's a real diagnosis for companies.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:55.060
And so we recently got a grant from the Sloan Foundation to adapt this methodology for the university setting

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:57.060
and Yale ran the pilot.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:01.060
And what was amazing about it, as, you know, at Yale, we've been collecting the data.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:06.060
The women's faculty form has been collecting data for, you know, for about 14 years now.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:15.060
So we understand what's going on in our universe, probably as best as most, you know, most of the well universities

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.060
that think a lot about these matters do.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:26.060
And this one's pilot immediately sort of showed us, you know, pointed out what the problem is.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.060
What the problems really are.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:32.060
And what, you know, and especially in the promotion and retention of women.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:40.060
The fact that there is a lack of transparency about expectations of what it takes to get promoted,

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:48.060
how the evaluation is done even once the expectations are laid out, and then what really happens.

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:52.060
I mean, there's a real gap and mismatch in this.

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:57.060
And these are the, I mean, these are the things we absolutely need to bridge within institutions, you know,

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.060
talking about what are the things that we can do.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:05.060
And I think we all have to be pushing from within as well.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.060
Part of, I mean, so at NYU, we have a women's faculty caucus.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:13.060
I was president for a while, but part of the problem is it takes so much work.

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:16.060
Right now, like, we can't find anybody who wants to be president.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.060
I was going to say, and it's because, you know, it's just been so much, so, you know, a bunch of us ex-presidents

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.060
of the women's faculty caucus are kind of forming a committee of people to run a bit.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.060
It takes so much work to go and egg the deans and do.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.060
Again, it's not compensated.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:34.060
It's not compensated. It's just another committee that you're on, and you have to be persistent.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.060
And, you know, it's just time to start.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:41.060
But it falls on us too, right? I mean, I think that's the one thing that has been interesting in astronomy,

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:48.060
is that there is a growing group of powerful men who have gotten on the cause

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:53.060
and who are calling out these things within the community and institution.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:56.060
So, for example, you know, with speakers at all the major conferences,

01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:01.060
if the list looks out of alignment with the membership, you know,

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:07.060
a lot of men have become really important spokespersons for these issues.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:13.060
We are going to look at the audience for questions.

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.060
I just wanted to ask something from you.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:22.060
You said you were first in Israel before you came here.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:32.060
And I have never been to Israel, but I have heard that, for example, women are a lot more active in the army.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:44.060
And women are involved teaching men about how to shoot rifles at some of the training facilities.

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:54.060
So, is there a different, because in terms of looking for causes, the psychological causes everybody knows about and talks about all that,

01:06:54.060 --> 01:07:05.060
when in terms of societal causes, is there a difference between the way women succeed in various fields, including science,

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:08.060
in Israel compared to the U.S.?

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.060
Okay. So, it's a little bit of a long answer.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.060
So, first of all, things in the army have changed drastically.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:20.060
When I was in the army, I was assigned to a unit.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.060
I was bilingual. I spoke both English and Hebrew.

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.060
And it was a unit that needed translators.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:34.060
But when I got to the unit, the female officer there told me, no, only men translate.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.060
You're going to go and learn to be a secretary and learn to type.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:44.060
By the way, it turned out to be the best thing in my life, because they went to, and I learned how to blind type in English,

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:48.060
and how much we all use computers, the best effort ever.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:55.060
But I didn't know that in 1980 when I joined the army. I wasn't so happy. I didn't see the future.

01:07:55.060 --> 01:08:01.060
So, the army itself has transformed drastically.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:10.060
Since I was there now 34 years ago to now, women now are involved in positions like you're saying.

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:18.060
But they're all educational positions. Women teach how to operate the computers on the tank,

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:26.060
how to, the systems in a plane. They do a lot, a lot of things. All theory.

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:34.060
There are very, very few women in combat. So the Israeli army and any army, I'm sure even the American army,

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:39.060
where women I think are slightly allowed in combat. I'm not exactly sure what the situation is.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:46.060
It's still extremely chauvinistic. There's no question about it that the army is not an equalizer.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:51.060
And I can tell you a little anecdote just to exemplify this thing.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.060
My sister is the Dean of her law school in Israel.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:04.060
And she was put on a committee where the head of the committee was a high-ranking officer from the army,

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:08.060
one level below the chief of staff.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:13.060
And there were four professors on the committee, a professor from Tel Aviv University,

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:17.060
from Haifa University and from Jerusalem in my sister.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:23.060
And they were interviewing people. And every time that a person would come in, he would say,

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.060
this is Professor Cohen from Jerusalem. This is Professor Levy from Tel Aviv.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:34.060
This is Professor Smolansky from Haifa and Sharon.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:40.060
Every time she said that every time a person would come in, that's exactly what would happen.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:49.060
So in some ways, and people from the army are very influential in politics, in companies they're considered to be very,

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:57.060
of course, leaders, no wonder. So they play roles in these organizations.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:09.060
So the biases do carry over from the army. And I would say that women are, we have the same issue with women in the sciences

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:18.060
and the departments. You look at deans of schools in the sciences, very low percent in my area in computer science,

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:26.060
very, very few women faculty. I would say that the Taeqnion, which is a leading institution, two or three.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:34.060
I think I left Israel in 1994. And till last year, they didn't hire a single female faculty in computer science.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:42.060
So that gives you an indication things are not good. So I wouldn't say necessarily worse than here,

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:53.060
but I would say that there's an issue. One thing that I do have to say is that Israeli women, due to financial situation in Israel,

01:10:53.060 --> 01:11:03.060
they need to work. Here are many women who marry men who earn a lot of money and so on.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:11.060
Many of them even haven't gotten a great education. Usually they have great education because that's where they met these successful men.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:22.060
They stop working. In Israel, not an option. Every woman has a job. Maybe it's not a career, but they have a job.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:28.060
The women are in the workforce. I would assume maybe an higher percent.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:43.060
Interesting article in the Times, a couple of weeks back, that even at the high school level, the perception of results in math.

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.060
Yes. You know the article. But please repeat because I don't.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:57.060
The interesting thing was, I'm sorry, I'm horrible to names. Our friend here from astronomy noted that a lot of women

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:07.060
were actually girls in high school. Panic at math. Even though they're score, it was very, the exactly phenomenon that was talked about

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:14.060
about coming in, the guy's dream that has to be too hard. The girls said I want to drop the class, but this was in high school.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:22.060
At 75, a guy was going to try harder. The girl was looking for a way out. This is cultural.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:27.060
My grandpa came from a high school where that was unacceptable, but I think we were the rarity.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:35.060
Is the problem beginning that the problem begins that early?

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:45.060
And the issue of papers, two observations. Is it a choice of safe topic, the same phenomenon effectively?

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:54.060
That a high risk topic might be embarrassing, so you don't do it. A low risk topic is much safer.

01:12:54.060 --> 01:13:06.060
And in the resume studies, what about, I forget if that resume study had a category for names which are unisex?

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:16.060
Like Jean in the US and Jean in France getting the obvious cross-correlation issue.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:21.060
And what about the British trick of just using the initial leading initials?

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:33.060
Part of it, just to get to the very last thing you mentioned, probably everybody's favorite example of gender bias, is this orchestra study.

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:43.060
So basically, once they started to do auditions behind a screen, all of a sudden orchestras became equalized.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:53.060
Now, the problem is we never have a situation where we're interviewing somebody inside without knowing who they are and meeting them and knowing something about them.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.060
So doing something like that is not possible.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:04.060
The interesting case is the government grant review, which in theory I thought was supposed to be named sanitize.

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:09.060
You know who does this research? That's the problem.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:19.060
So it's true only in admissions possibly to grad school that you could do some sanitation, but the minute that people start publishing papers, it's over.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:26.060
Yes, I had a very funny case in that point, Fran Allen, who you probably know.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.060
The first touring award winner.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:38.060
The first idea female fellow had a whole collection of stories because when she entered the field, of course all her publications were F. Allen.

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:44.060
And there was a lot of confusion when she showed up at registration.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:51.060
But I think you already mentioned this. Of course, some of these issues start very young way before high school.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:15:02.060
The issue with the grade review is, in fact, despite the theoretical name white, the fact that everybody knows who's doing what research is.

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:03.060
Well, because it's a period of view.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.060
Yeah.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.060
That's a good discussion.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.060
Go ahead.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:15.060
Yeah, I guess I've worked for many years. I studied computer science and got a master's degree in computer science.

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:22.060
I was probably the first person in my school. We had five computer majors at a women's college when I graduated.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:35.060
And I think what's been disturbing to me, I don't know if this is a question exactly, but the studies I've seen recently are around the time I graduated, it was probably about 37% or so female.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:40.060
Graduates of computer science. And today it's maybe 12%.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.060
I have.

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:48.060
And I think I've seen a lot of things, you know, it is a complex problem, but I've seen a number of things.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:53.060
And I think some of it is maybe cultural. I'm not sure the reason behind it.

01:15:53.060 --> 01:16:04.060
You know, it could just be that women tend to think in more liberal arts and concepts and were encouraged to go into those topics versus, I think that with, you know, even in English,

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:10.060
you know, even in India, I see many more women at work from India and other countries.

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:16.060
You know, I would say I feel like an extreme minority in an IT department as a white woman at this point in time.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:23.060
When I first started working, I would say it was maybe 30% women. I see the numbers going hugely down.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:33.060
And I see also another disturbing trend for me is kind of the, I would say, startup mentality, where I see a lot of very young people

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:40.060
bringing in their friends and you see kind of the Silicon Valley, you know, even that TV show that's on now.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:47.060
It's all guys and they all are together in a garage and they don't consider women in these rules.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.060
And even, yeah.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.060
We don't want to be there.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:57.060
And Facebook and social media, you know, LinkedIn, you see someone's picture. You immediately know if it's a woman.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:02.060
It's not even their name. You see what they look like. You see their background.

01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:09.060
So anyway, I'm throwing that out. I don't know why the numbers are so low now among, you know, computer graduates and technology.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.060
But if there are any comments on that?

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:15.060
So I want to support your point with the data.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:23.060
Priya was saying before that in all the sciences, things are advancing, but there's no question that computer science is going backwards.

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.060
That's a known fact. The numbers are decreasing.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:35.060
Also, when I was studying, we were 25 to 30 percent. Today, the numbers are much lower.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:45.060
It's an excellent question what's happening to computer science compared to math because a lot of computer science is somewhat connected to math.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:50.060
Definitely, when you're doing a degree, you study math as well. Math is going up. We're not.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:18:01.060
I think that it has something to do with the vision that the world has of what it is like to work in computers later on.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.060
But the truth is that I'm baffled by it.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:13.060
Okay. So the environment maybe is very male dominated and goes by the male definition of how things should be and so on.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:21.060
But so many of these startup companies do things that women should be so happy to be doing. They relate to social issues.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:30.060
They enable things, improvements on things that are dear to women's art that are, they deal within their lives continuously,

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:34.060
but they could really have a huge effect working in such startup.

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:38.060
Doesn't do it. Doesn't do it from computer science.

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:44.060
We, on top of the women in science, I think are facing yet another challenge.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:49.060
And I don't know what's the source of the additional problem.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:59.060
I just want to mention here that I've been reading about, and I'm sure all of you have read about Maria Cloud and sort of the initiative that she's been doing about freshman.

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:07.060
One of the barriers is this idea that you have to be an ace coder in order to start a startup or whatever.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:18.060
And so I think she's trying to get at that by getting freshman women started on coding and by revamping how it's taught.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:26.060
And she's done a very successful experiment. And let's hope that sort of ratchets.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:33.060
But you know, I think the startup culture thing is puzzling. It is very puzzling.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:41.060
But you know, once again, it's such a mythology around how a company gets started, a successful company.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:45.060
It's a bunch of guys who are friends who, you know, that...

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:51.060
But they could join. They don't need to start. But I have to tell you guys the story about this Maria Clava,

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:54.060
who you have to know her. She's a complete character.

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:58.060
But she has all kinds of ideas. And of course she does a lot.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:03.060
She left. She was the dean at Princeton and she left to be the president at Harvey Mudd.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:10.060
But once I had met her and she had this idea that she wanted to get to J.K. Rawlings.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:20.060
And she thought she had a way because she thought that through Tony Morris and at Princeton, she would get to Oprah and she'd get to J.K. Rawlings.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.060
And what did she want J.K. Rawlings to do?

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:28.060
She wanted her to make Hermione. Did I say the name correctly?

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:31.060
No, Hermione.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.060
Hermione. She wanted Hermione.

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:39.060
She wanted J.K. Rawlings to make Hermione study computer science.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.060
That's what she wanted to do.

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:47.060
And I don't think Harry Potter, but I know that it didn't happen.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:21:00.060
In fact, I saw her. Exactly. I think that Maria Clava then realized that maybe it wasn't a normal path for a magician or a sort of a...

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:02.060
No, no, no.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:11.060
It's a very... It plays to a very important point in public culture and media and the presentation of women and girls' children in the media.

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:20.060
And I think we have to think really hard about how to use the media to subvert some of these stereotypes.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:26.060
I think that is a... It was going to be a lot more effective than we actually imagined.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:34.060
Well, first of all, just in terms of what you mentioned before the names, I remember reading...

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:41.060
Maybe a year ago, most that this article of a man was applying for a job in construction.

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:44.060
He just lost his jobs looking for a new one. He had tons of experience.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:51.060
Now, his name is Unisex Kim, but he couldn't get an offer anywhere despite his experience.

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.060
And then he looked at the resume trying to figure out what's going on.

01:21:55.060 --> 01:22:00.060
He was probably the name, so he changed one minor thing on the resume. He wrote, Mr. Kim.

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.060
And suddenly offers poured in out of nowhere.

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:10.060
So before that, the same resume wasn't getting anything because of this whole mentality that you were talking about.

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:16.060
I mean, from high school, I'm not sure exactly what age it starts, but it needs to go in.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:22.060
Everybody, like on the internet, was getting mad at him, but why are they getting mad at him and not the owners of all these companies?

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:27.060
And in many cases, even it's just local companies, huge chains or something.

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:34.060
So you know, bias operates because there's such a gendered notion of profession, right?

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:39.060
So who's meant to be doing what and who's meant to be excellent at what?

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.060
Yeah, that was very interesting.

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:45.060
And there was also, like you were talking about being, you know, like wandering through the desert or whatever.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.060
I read about one of the first women in Princeton.

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:53.060
They didn't start admitting women as undergrads until 1969.

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:58.060
And she said that when she was in an economics class, the professor said to the three women in the class,

01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:04.060
I don't know what you're doing here. I'm not going to call on you throughout the semester, and he stuck to it.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:10.060
So you had an academia people doing this, you know, and then in the workplace.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.060
I mean, where do you start to rehabilitate society?

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.060
Everywhere.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060
Yeah.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:21.060
I mean, what day you're born, there has to be a different level of teaching.

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:27.060
It makes me wonder, it's hard to convince an economist that he or she is not rational, he usually is.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:28.060
So.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:37.060
Hi. I teach at a community college. I teach writing.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:42.060
And my question is the model of women in sports.

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:47.060
Right now, you don't have to feel that you're an athlete to play soccer.

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:53.060
You know, your kid, they have teams in every junior high school or high school.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:24:00.060
There's a culture, but 50 years ago, 40 years ago, they wouldn't let women on a tennis team because they thought it would give them a heart attack.

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:10.060
So what I'm asking is, to what degree have the women in science started efforts to make doing science, however that means,

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:20.060
whether it's from the point of view of cooking or looking at women, you know, biographies of women in science, it seems to me that has to happen from grade two.

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:27.060
And I wonder, because so that the culture then, the expectation is not such a rarefied expectation.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:34.060
And also, you haven't really talked about class in relation to these access.

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:45.060
For example, at this community college, I'm teaching working class people whose parents are working class people and who know they're working class people and who are hoping and praying that they're going to even get a job.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:57.060
So that where's the access of science? How is science making itself, inserting itself into the popular culture, other than through the great discoveries, the stars and the screw-ups.

01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:12.060
So actually, my field, I think, is doing some very interesting, innovative things. And one of the projects I think you must have all heard about, this notion of citizen science, getting citizens involved in the doing of science, all age groups.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:18.060
And of course, you notice that, you know, children, younger people, are really quite over-represented in that group.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:32.060
So for example, there's a project called Galaxy Zoo, where there's now so much data about external galaxies, other galaxies, that you need help astronomers can classify galaxies on their own.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:37.060
It's often done by eye. It's actually more reliable, done by eye, than automating it.

01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:41.060
So what they've done now is these projects have put the data in this project called Galaxy Zoo.

01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:47.060
They put the data out, and anyone can take a small training session to understand what it is that they're doing.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:26:01.060
And they can train, and they can classify. And so for instance, and then people are looking, and even I have co-authored a paper with a woman who was a Dutch school teacher, who found this bizarre object, which was unclassifiable.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:09.060
And it turns out there's many of them. And she actually ended up on a scientific paper with all of us, because she found the object, and we figured out what it was.

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:28.060
It turns out it wasn't quite a light echo, wasn't quite a galaxy. But I think astronomy is trying, and it's trying not as self-consciously as it's just sort of opening up science, not with the view of the gender, but really access.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:43.060
There are people who do not have the access to get into educational institutions where they can get started on science, either school, high schools, they don't go to good enough schools, or because of economic barriers.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:27:03.060
I think there's some effort, but there really isn't as much work from what I can see on class, and the intersection of gender and class. But all of these things are very fraught in terms of access to admission and affirmative action, and all these things are quite fraught.

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:18.060
I also think the notion of socioeconomic status is one of the reasons why we have a lot fewer minorities, in your lack of Americans, for instance, because there's a correlation between race and socioeconomic status here.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:38.060
You know, I have great students, but you have to feel somewhat comfortable financially to invest in a career where you're not going to really make a salary until you're 40. And so I do think that actually plays a bigger role in some of the racial differences we see in science, which are profound.

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:49.060
But also the sort of uncertainty in the career. Also, there's uncertainty as well. And the fact that you have to move, right? Because this is pertinent because it makes a difference to women as well as socioeconomic status.

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:58.060
It deters people who feel that they don't have the freedom to indulge, you know, they see this as an indulgent career.

01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:09.060
So most of my students who don't come from someone else's families will go to medical school instead of going into sciences. Yeah.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.060
Not that medical school isn't science, don't get me wrong. But they'll go in for practicing doctors.

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:32.060
In observation, the medical school, medicine is an interesting example. They've been a whole bunch of comments made both autobiographical and statistical that even though med school classes enter at 50-50, pediatrics has become almost a female preserve.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:50.060
And surgery, even 40 years after women broke into surgery, is highly hostile in many cases. And the anecdotes that I've heard people tell me, and I've seen in print, are the worst of frat house hazing I've ever heard.

01:28:50.060 --> 01:29:07.060
The interesting thing about how early the problem becomes two anecdotes. One is the computer science achievement test makes very interesting statistical reading in terms of who takes it and where.

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:27.060
Heavily white, very unheavily minority, and very heavy and certain strips of the United States. The problem starts early. Secondly, it was also of some very interesting comments made recently by Neil deGrasse Tyson on an interview panel about the obstacles he encountered

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:38.060
being African American on his way to the directorship of the hate and sanitarium. Makes upsetting reading when you hear it.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:30:01.060
Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank you very much for having this talk. I think it's very, very important and very germane to all of society, not just women in general.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:24.060
I'd also like to say that a lot of the younger men, and this is sociological, it is not anyone's fault, a lot of younger men seem to be more interested in what women, having women as a part of their whole career as opposed to the secretaries or the receptionist or whatever.

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:40.060
I'd like to introduce another little thought in there and that's women as they age. I was thrown out of a job in 2009 like a lot of other people were, and I'm a paralegal. I've been for many years.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:55.060
They were no jobs. They need their attorneys. They need their secretaries. They don't need paralegals. Everybody does those jobs. When there's a lot of money around, they use us because we are very important. We do a lot of work that both of those other careers do.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:31:16.060
In the meantime, I got thrown out of a job. My father had been an electrical contractor, and my love of math came from him and my mechanical abilities. I heard of a training course, a pre-apprenticeship course called new, non-traditional employment for women.

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:29.060
It's not an apprenticeship program. It's a pre-apprenticeship program to help women get into the unions. We were expected, and I got in, to the pre-apprenticeship program. We were expected to carry enormous weights.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:45.060
They showed us how to carry sheetrock, which a lot of buildings are made out of and a lot of things are made out of. It's about as big as I am. I was taught how to carry it, and not just pick it up, but I mean actually walk around with it and things, and carry huge toolboxes

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:58.060
full of all kinds of tools and all kinds of things. It was just amazing. Also, I was taught incredible math. I have amazing math skills because of that.

01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:03.060
I went to private school. There's no reason, private girls school. There's no reason why I shouldn't have learned it there.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:12.060
That was in the old days when I also had nuns, and some of them were in retirement or nearby there, and they kept them around.

01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:28.060
That's fine. That's what happened. In the meantime, I lagged a bit in my math skills. Given that background, here I am over 40 and starting a new career in that sort of thing.

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:43.060
The other thing that they introduced was the idea that we have to really mind our own businesses and not talk to people, and men or women in the unions, because they'll get at us. They're trying to get our spots, and they're trying to get rid of us.

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:59.060
It was like this amazing explanation of the culture, and it was very different than how I was taught, and living as a paralegal and things like this. It was just a very interesting education.

01:32:59.060 --> 01:33:19.060
I think if we wrote Screenplays about that sort of thing, it would change things, talking about the cultures. I think the Big Bang Theory is great, except the women are stupid, most of them. And I think it would be incredible if the women were not so stupid, and they were portrayed as different things.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:35.060
I mean, women as they age, I mean, I can write a screenplay. I'm actually trained now to write a screenplay, because I was a theater major in college, and it was just great, but I went more for the arts, even though I loved science. I really loved science, but I did go into the arts because I loved that as well.

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:56.060
I felt that I had to fit my personality a little bit better for some reason, but so now I've got Screenplays that do that, but what do we do for older women? When I went to that construction school and could not pick up that 61 pounds without throwing my back out, and was never retested, even though I worked at it. I was never retested, and they didn't want to hear about it.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:12.060
I said, okay, now what do I do? So I talked to someone who was an engineer, a woman engineer, and then I went to Cooper Union and talked to the people over there, and they were like, oh, look at your background.

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:18.060
You'd have to work too hard. If you're going to do anything, you should be a mechanical engineer, not an electrical engineer.

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:31.060
So what do we do for people that do want to go into it? Young women, yes, let's get them involved. It's important to help them get that leg up. And men, and young boys, young men, but young women especially.

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:39.060
But what do we do for the older women that want to enter the force, except saying, sorry honey, I'll read a nice book about it. It's not the same thing.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:53.060
So I'd like to see what we can do about that. I have an answer which you might not like, but in my area of computer science, not only older women have a problem, but older men have a problem.

01:34:53.060 --> 01:35:04.060
This is a young, young field. If you're not in your 20 or your 30s and you get laid off, you have a problem also if you're a man in computer science.

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:13.060
So at least in this area, I don't think you're going to find a good answer because it's not only women who are struggling.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:28.060
But I think coming back to your point of retraining older women and possibly men who have interest in science and math, but somehow didn't enter the formal pipeline.

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:37.060
Personally, I think that it's obviously tricky whether and how you could join the work force even if you did get trained.

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:44.060
But one exciting thing that I think is happening that we've all probably sort of registering now are the MOOCs.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:53.060
So you can get trained. You can learn. And then if you find a new passion, then you can find a route back in.

01:35:53.060 --> 01:36:03.060
So these massive open online courses which are free, available on many platforms, there's some excellent courses in mathematics in every field.

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:14.060
And so I think that there's room now for possibly people who did not discover their passion for science or gave it up early to kind of...

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:16.060
Either have a family or do something else.

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:25.060
Yeah, to do something, it may not be the quickest way to get a job, but it's a way to sort of grow your passion and then if you're serious, you can probably find a route back in.

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:35.060
One of the challenges is, like I said, most people, assistant professors, I think now you get your first NIH grant on average like at 42.

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:36.060
Right.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.060
So I mean, this is because you've gone through graduate school, then you've gone through postdoctoral training.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:45.060
That's sort of like when you're just getting going in some of these disciplines.

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:52.060
It's pretty scary. I mean, I went through quick, so I missed that, but that's where we are now today.

01:36:52.060 --> 01:37:00.060
So it's a little bit hard to have a traditional career in science, given that it takes that long to even get.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.060
So then the question becomes, what are the other careers in science?

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:12.060
And this is something we talked to our students about who maybe do not want to be doing the whole science thing, but there's science foundations, there's science...

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.060
Journalism, there's all sorts of things.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:21.060
And so these are kind of non-traditional careers which don't necessarily take all this, but we aren't very good at identifying that.

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.060
And we're also not very good at counseling our students about it because that's not what we did.

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:34.060
But there are quite a few non-traditional careers in science, I think, that you just have to kind of be creative about and look at and see where the avenues are.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.060
If nothing, I'm very creative.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:40.060
But I have to say, I really think...

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:46.060
But I just want to finish one point. I think that there are definitely great education.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:51.060
You can learn a lot of things online and I agree that these courses are fantastic and so on.

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:59.060
But I do want to leave this not on an optimistic point, because I think that this society admires youth.

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:04.060
And getting jobs at older ages is much harder.

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:10.060
And we have a huge population that's unemployed in their 20s.

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:14.060
All my friends, they're 20-year-olds, they're living at home with them, not working.

01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:18.060
So the older people are competing with these young people.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:28.060
So I think that maybe you could train yourself to do something else and maybe have a wonderful time and really enrich yourself.

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:33.060
But I think that getting paid later is a whole different story.

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.060
That's why I take on things. It's not a happy one, but that's how I see things.

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:41.060
We have a question and one question that the answer probably is not so quick.

01:38:41.060 --> 01:38:49.060
Do you find that women would submit articles more often to journals where the woman is an editor?

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:54.060
The editor is a woman. That's maybe the quick question.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:58.060
And the other is, do you see anything that women bring to science?

01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:07.060
Is there a particular sensibility that you believe women bring that does have a difference in it from a male scientist?

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:12.060
I personally have never even thought about who the editor is.

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:19.060
Unless it was sort of like a science or nature where you kind of know who the editors are, they're professional editors.

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.060
Other than that, I've actually never thought.

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:30.060
And I was an editor of a journal and it just didn't even occur to me to have that be one of these.

01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.060
It doesn't have a full word.

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:38.060
No, I mean, I couldn't even name the editors of most of the journals that I submit to.

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:42.060
You usually submit to the editor in chief also and that's whoever it is.

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:49.060
But different people evaluate it like so the who evaluates it is not the editor sends it out to peers.

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:55.060
You don't know who those people are from the evaluation which is really the critical part.

01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:58.060
So I never really think that.

01:39:58.060 --> 01:40:00.060
I mean, my view, I don't have the data.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.060
That's an interesting point.

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.060
We'll be worth looking at.

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:08.060
We've not had too many women editors too.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:12.060
But I think there are some now who are on the editorial board.

01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:17.060
It'll be interesting to see whether that encourages more women to even sort of submit.

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.060
Particularly for nature and science.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:20.060
That might be an interesting.

01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.060
Nature and science, I think.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.060
You don't submit to the editor in chief?

01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:25.060
No, we send it to people and I edit it.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:30.060
So there's an astronomy, it's so happy that the astronomy women, they are women, the editors.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.060
And I've submitted to them.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:37.060
Then you know who the editor is and you kind of know what they like and don't like.

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:40.060
I actually think they're pretty, they are very biased.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:46.060
In my field, many journals say you sent to the editor in chief and the editor in chief distribute.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:51.060
It's different, they're little, slightly different cultures and everything.

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:55.060
About your second question, as I said, I don't think that women and men are the same.

01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:59.060
And I do think that we bring something special to the research.

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:06.060
And going back to Priya's point about not discussing whether we have the aptitude or we don't have the aptitude,

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:12.060
diversity, even in gender, in the research, makes a difference.

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:16.060
And that's why the reason that I think that the question is also non-interesting,

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:19.060
because we need the women in order for it to be different.

01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:26.060
And I see when I work with my guy colleagues, you've heard many times I have only guy colleagues.

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.060
I look at things differently and I can't put the finger on it.

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:36.060
It's not that I can say this is what, it's different.

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.060
That's all I can say without.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:46.060
You know, I don't know, I don't think I want to give a blanket answer on this because I don't understand it well enough.

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:57.060
But I think there is a richness that comes from the diversity of experience of backgrounds, etc., etc.

01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:07.060
How well that correlates to gender more strongly, I'm not so sure, because I think that that spread in diversity is there in both genders.

01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:13.060
I mean, there are lots of men who think very laterally and there are some men who think very linearly.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.060
There are lots of women who think laterally and lots of women who think linearly.

01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.060
So I don't know how that works.

01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:26.060
And I personally feel that it's a sort of a dangerous question.

01:42:26.060 --> 01:42:39.060
Only because of the fact that there's a danger that certain biases can get reinforced with flawed data.

01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:41.060
I think that the whole issue is dangerous.

01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:47.060
It's like a minefield when we're just walking between something that blows up and you lose a leg.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:50.060
I think it's an extremely charged thing.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:58.060
But I think that the most important thing, and I think it's okay to say things like I say that we're not the same.

01:42:58.060 --> 01:43:01.060
People might be horrified, especially women.

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:05.060
But it's okay to say things and everybody can have a different thing.

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:09.060
But I think that the problem is that we're not given equal opportunities.

01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:14.060
And it doesn't matter if we're the same or not, but the opportunities should be the same.

01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:23.060
And that's why, and it's okay to discuss these things and it's okay to say things without data and it's okay to say things with data.

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:26.060
It's now on our topic of discussion.

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:34.060
But I think when we get different pay, when we get don't get the promotions, when we're not given this, when we don't have the right money.

01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:38.060
We're not getting the equal opportunities.

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.060
And that's what we should be fighting for.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:46.060
And I think there is no question that we contribute tremendously to every field that we're in.

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:54.060
And I do want to say that I think that much I see in terms of women scientists who have been put in charge of things,

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:58.060
they're just as variables of the men in terms of what they're good at.

01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:59.060
What did you say?

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:03.060
They're just as variable as the men, I think, in terms of what they're good at and not good at.

01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:08.060
And so I think part of the issue is sometimes people have a stereotype about what we're supposed to be like as women.

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.060
And so we get assigned to things.

01:44:10.060 --> 01:44:19.060
In some departments, I won't mention, but Christina knows, the women are always the director of undergraduate studies.

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:28.060
And the problem is those stereotypes are changing our responsibilities and they're not getting the more nurturing administrative roles,

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:32.060
not that they're necessarily nurturing people because not all women are nurturing.

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:40.060
And some men are nurturing. And so I do worry a little bit about those types of assignments.

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:45.060
But I just feel like I've seen huge variability in women, both in the hands of power.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:47.060
That's exactly what I was trying to say.

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:52.060
How receptive they are to these types of things, whether they actually think it's an issue or not an issue.

01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:55.060
And variability in men too.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:45:03.060
Thank you very much for the sitti.

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:47.060
Thank you.
