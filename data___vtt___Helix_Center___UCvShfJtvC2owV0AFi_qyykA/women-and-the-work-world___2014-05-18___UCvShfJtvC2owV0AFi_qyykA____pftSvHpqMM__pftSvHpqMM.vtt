as Special Legal Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the nomination of Supreme Court

00:34.080 --> 00:39.240
Chief Justice John Roberts.

00:39.240 --> 00:44.720
Prior to becoming a lawyer, she enjoyed the career in media after graduating from Northwestern

00:44.720 --> 00:47.160
University.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.600
Professor Nancy DeMosso is sitting there.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.520
at Rutgers Business School.

00:58.520 --> 01:03.240
Her research specialties include the management of diversity and change, the management of

01:03.240 --> 01:08.880
knowledge-based organizations and the management of scientists and engineers.

01:08.880 --> 01:14.680
She has co-authored and co-edited five books and has had articles published in many journals.

01:14.680 --> 01:21.320
Her recent book is the American Nondilemma and is available from the Russell Sage Foundation.

01:21.320 --> 01:29.960
Sorry, and on the table.

01:29.960 --> 01:35.040

a position on the American Sociological Association Council as chair of the Organizations and

01:40.920 --> 01:50.200
Occupational Section of the ASA and as president of the Society for the Advancement of Socioeconomics.

01:50.200 --> 01:57.000
Ernesto Rubin is Associate Assistant Professor at Columbia Business School.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.880
Well, it says Assistant One Place Associate One Place and one is, oh, your Associate Professor

02:02.880 --> 02:05.640
of Management Columbia Business School.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.200
Assistant Professor.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.880
At Columbia Business School.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.880
Yes.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
Okay.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.840
His research interests live within behavior and public economics.

02:14.840 --> 02:19.320
He investigates the role played by social norms and particular psychological traits on

02:19.320 --> 02:27.040
activities that are economically relevant for public policy and business strategy.

02:27.040 --> 02:32.040
More recently, he's been working on the role of reciprocity in the interaction between

02:32.040 --> 02:39.120
special interest groups and politicians, the effect of present bias preferences on procrastination,

02:39.120 --> 02:45.480
and how implicit associations can lead to biased expectations and discrimination.

02:45.480 --> 02:51.760
Ernesto has taught courses in public economics, microeconomics, experimental economics, statistic

02:51.760 --> 02:56.200
and strategy at numerous universities.

02:56.200 --> 03:02.800

04:29.240 --> 04:32.320
International House New York.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Thank you.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.000
We can just get going.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.800
Well, I feel humbled.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.720
So I'm going to let one of y'all start.

04:43.720 --> 04:52.240
Well, you know, what puzzles me continuously in traveling around the world is that the

04:52.240 --> 04:59.480
United States seems to be out of step with many countries, other countries in the world,

04:59.480 --> 05:06.720
such as the Nordic countries where there is a high employment rate amongst women.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.160
So what comments might you have on that?

05:11.160 --> 05:18.480
Well, I attended a conference recently where one of the participants addressed that issue

05:18.480 --> 05:26.600
and mentioned that some of the social democratic policies that have affected women in the workforce

05:26.600 --> 05:33.120
in the Nordic countries essentially emerged when some of the Nordic countries were concerned

05:33.120 --> 05:37.200
about the influence of immigrants on their economy.

05:37.200 --> 05:44.760
So essentially, some of those policies emerged essentially to keep the labor force more Swedish

05:44.760 --> 05:47.880
or Norwegian or whatever.

05:47.880 --> 05:56.280
So while we can look at those policies and admire them, I think that it reminds us that

05:56.280 --> 06:03.000
for any kind of assessment of what's happening to women in the labor force or women in the

06:03.000 --> 06:07.920
workforce or women in social relationships in general, that we have to look at a number

06:07.920 --> 06:09.280
of different factors.

06:09.280 --> 06:16.520
We have to look at the social, the legal, the economic, the behavioral, the psychological.

06:16.520 --> 06:23.280
Since, by training, I'm a sociologist and do study diversity in the labor force, including

06:23.280 --> 06:29.280
race, ethnicity, gender, and other kinds of differences.

06:29.280 --> 06:39.840
I did, I'm fairly familiar with the, at least the research findings for the US, not as much

06:39.840 --> 06:43.880
the research findings around the world, although when we're talking about women in the labor

06:43.880 --> 06:52.040
force, particularly in advanced countries, it looks pretty much the same.

06:52.040 --> 06:57.720
So let me just mention a couple things and then maybe that can spark some of the conversation.

06:57.720 --> 07:03.680
There's a very good book that just came out fairly recently called Documenting De-Segregation

07:03.680 --> 07:13.680
that analyzed the data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 through 2005

07:13.680 --> 07:17.680
and looking particularly at the issues of what has happened since the passage of the

07:17.680 --> 07:25.800
civil rights movement to segregation for various kinds of groups from white men in the labor

07:25.800 --> 07:28.120
force in the US.

07:28.120 --> 07:37.640
And the big story there is that much less has changed than we probably assume.

07:37.640 --> 07:46.720
The biggest story of the stories in that book is that essentially white men have retained

07:46.720 --> 07:52.360
their access to the best jobs at the same proportion that they had when the civil rights

07:52.360 --> 07:58.280
movement was passed and in some cases in some types of occupations and industries they've

07:58.280 --> 08:02.680
actually enhanced their access to those types of jobs.

08:02.680 --> 08:10.040
So that the access for women of various types and minorities in the labor force have both

08:10.040 --> 08:17.280
basically come from growth of jobs at the lower end of the distribution in terms of

08:17.280 --> 08:23.000
authority income, etc. or in the public sector because these data are all for private sector

08:23.000 --> 08:24.960
organizations.

08:24.960 --> 08:32.640
The second finding was that although there was a slight decline in the segregation between

08:32.640 --> 08:39.920
white men and black men from about 1966 to about 1980, small change.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.560
Something has happened since 1980.

08:41.560 --> 08:46.960
It's basically been flat in terms of the desegregation of black men from white men.

08:46.960 --> 08:53.360
The desegregation of black women from white men never changed much.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.560
It was very high.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.200
It stayed very high.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.720
Slight, slight shift but basically no change.

09:00.720 --> 09:08.000
For white women from white men there has been somewhat more of a change.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.280
It was slow to start.

09:10.280 --> 09:15.280
It accelerated a bit through the 70s and 80s but basically trailed off about 2000 and has

09:15.280 --> 09:20.800
not changed much since then.

09:20.800 --> 09:26.920
While some white women have entered jobs that previously were held only by white men, it

09:26.920 --> 09:32.160
has contributed to a resegregation between white women and black women in terms of the

09:32.160 --> 09:34.080
jobs that they hold.

09:34.080 --> 09:39.400
But even with the advances that white women have made in the labor force, essentially

09:39.400 --> 09:46.920
they are now almost at parity with black men in terms of the proportion working in the

09:46.920 --> 09:51.320
same jobs as white men.

09:51.320 --> 09:58.520
Even if you look only at managerial jobs, again white men's over representation has

09:58.520 --> 10:03.880
been absolutely not changed since the civil rights movement.

10:03.880 --> 10:08.800
In other words, under representation has declined to some extent but again they are

10:08.800 --> 10:15.520
still almost but not quite at the level of their representation in the labor force.

10:15.520 --> 10:22.040
Black men and black women, there has been almost no change in terms of their representation

10:22.040 --> 10:24.520
in managerial jobs.

10:24.520 --> 10:31.800
Professional jobs, same story although white women doing slightly better in terms of their

10:31.800 --> 10:37.320
representation and in craft jobs, essentially same story.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.960
So white men still dominate the best jobs.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.880
Over the last 50 years there has been advances for white women.

10:45.880 --> 10:51.960
There have been modest changes for black men and black women but not much for the last

10:51.960 --> 10:55.200
35 years since about 1980.

10:55.200 --> 11:00.440
So I think that that's something to keep in mind when we're talking about what is happening

11:00.440 --> 11:06.320
and why those dynamics haven't changed more than we would anticipate it.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.240
That deals with the situation as it is.

11:09.240 --> 11:16.680
It doesn't deal with why that situation has become so.

11:16.680 --> 11:22.040
Why do white men still dominate those managerial positions?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.120
Well, I do have an answer for that.

11:24.120 --> 11:29.760
Let me give mine very quickly and then I'll turn it over to others.

11:29.760 --> 11:36.040
The book that is sitting on the table out there that I recently published is really focused

11:36.040 --> 11:44.200
on racial inequality but I think it is related to issues of gender inequality as well.

11:44.200 --> 11:50.360
So my explanation for why there hasn't been more change in terms of equality in general

11:50.360 --> 11:56.400
since the passage of the civil rights movement is because all of the focus has been on issues

11:56.400 --> 12:01.240
of discrimination and racism or sexism.

12:01.240 --> 12:07.960
Essentially framing everything in a negative way.

12:07.960 --> 12:13.880
What bad things whites do toward blacks or what bad things men do toward women.

12:13.880 --> 12:18.080
So again discrimination, racism, sexism.

12:18.080 --> 12:25.600
But I think in the post civil rights period and it affects women as well as racial minorities,

12:25.600 --> 12:31.240
but most of the action has been in terms of whites helping each other, whites helping

12:31.240 --> 12:34.840
other whites or men helping other men.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.440
And those kinds of things are not illegal.

12:38.440 --> 12:44.880
Discrimination is illegal but giving favor to people who are like you is not illegal.

12:44.880 --> 12:53.000
So while some public policy issues have focused on the discrimination against women, there's

12:53.000 --> 12:58.440
been very little attention on how men keep hiring other men and promoting them and paying

12:58.440 --> 13:00.520
them more and so on.

13:00.520 --> 13:05.640
And same thing in terms of whites hiring other whites and giving them higher salaries and

13:05.640 --> 13:09.960
more authority and better jobs and more promotions and so on.

13:09.960 --> 13:16.040
Let me just add to that that I think there is something that everybody continues to neglect.

13:16.040 --> 13:20.040
And that's the women that hurt other women.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.480
It is a huge issue that I've seen in the workplace.

13:23.480 --> 13:29.320
Not where I work now, but I'm just saying in general with people, I remember in 1998 Gloria

13:29.320 --> 13:35.320
Steinem was speaking at Union Square and I was younger then.

13:35.320 --> 13:41.160
And I had read Revolution from Within, I had been working at ABC Television and I was the

13:41.160 --> 13:45.440
last person who got to ask a question and she was launching a new magazine.

13:45.440 --> 13:50.720
You know, just kind of about a lot of these different issues and women in the workplace

13:50.720 --> 13:51.720
and things like that.

13:51.720 --> 13:56.600
And I raised my hand and I said, with all due respect, you prepared me in how I could

13:56.600 --> 14:00.600
choose to deal with discrimination, sexism, all these things.

14:00.600 --> 14:06.400
I feel like I've been given a voice as someone who's going forward in my career.

14:06.400 --> 14:11.840
What we haven't addressed is the fact that I think women in many respects are our own

14:11.840 --> 14:14.480
worst enemies at work.

14:14.480 --> 14:19.240
I think the fact remains that part of the sexism and things like that is the perception

14:19.240 --> 14:24.800
that women are highly emotional, that they get into these other dialogues that have

14:24.800 --> 14:28.440
nothing to do with the work at hand.

14:28.440 --> 14:38.280
They are more inclined to suck up to men thinking that that will give them an advantage rather

14:38.280 --> 14:43.520
than promoting the woman sitting next to them that is equally intelligent and qualified.

14:43.520 --> 14:49.360
And until women start embracing other women in the workplace, they're all pitted against

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
each other.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.320
So what does that mean?

14:52.320 --> 14:57.240
No one supports each other so that if a second job comes up, that person has pretty much

14:57.240 --> 15:02.480
been tarnished in a certain way and a man is free to get on in that spot.

15:02.480 --> 15:07.600
I mean, this is just a theory I have from watching and learning and talking to people,

15:07.600 --> 15:16.120
and I think it's something that people are forgetting to address and is incredibly important.

15:16.120 --> 15:22.120
So I think that as women, we do have to take some responsibility as well.

15:22.120 --> 15:30.600
That's actually very consistent with the research on discrimination, which doesn't necessarily

15:30.600 --> 15:37.880
show that women are worse than or are tougher than other women, but they certainly don't,

15:37.880 --> 15:40.040
let's say, help.

15:40.040 --> 15:47.040
So both men and women tend to discriminate at the similar rates when it comes to promotions

15:47.040 --> 15:49.480
and things like this.

15:49.480 --> 15:54.520
And the reasons for that, I mean, there could be many, but it's certainly something that

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
you see.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.720
You don't see a very strong favor.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.280
It is between women.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.520
This is for top jobs.

16:01.520 --> 16:07.800
And that's a very important point to make, that there's been enormous strides in labor

16:07.800 --> 16:14.680
for participation and things like this, but it's important to think of the role of women

16:14.680 --> 16:20.800
in the labor force, not just overall, but thinking of the top positions where the situation

16:20.800 --> 16:27.000
looks very different, where there hasn't been as much progress, and coming somewhat to

16:27.000 --> 16:29.760
this point about different countries, these can actually vary a lot.

16:29.760 --> 16:34.000
So some countries that might look very well on overall statistics, actually for the top

16:34.000 --> 16:36.160
jobs might not look so well.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.120
And it's not necessarily the same type of policies that would help women get promoted

16:41.120 --> 16:48.560
to the top jobs than the ones that would help just women go out and get some job.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.640
So that's something that still needs to learn more about.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.080
Other countries, for example, like the Netherlands has great statistics when it comes to labor

16:57.080 --> 16:58.200
for participation.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.640
And so that's driven by a lot of part-time work.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.240
It's driven by a lot of work at lower positions.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.600
So in top positions, you see a lot of discrimination.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.560
So it varies a lot.

17:12.560 --> 17:17.080
I thought you were going to go somewhere else in response to the comments.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.880
And I'm not sure I agree with you, and I'm not sure the data support, what you've just

17:20.880 --> 17:21.880
said.

17:21.880 --> 17:26.600
But with a couple caveats.

17:26.600 --> 17:32.640
It is the case that men and women, whites and blacks are, for the most part, similarly

17:32.640 --> 17:37.800
affected by the cultural messages and experiences that we all have.

17:37.800 --> 17:48.200
So for example, when the distribution of resources overlays categorical differences.

17:48.200 --> 17:52.600
So for example, most CEOs are white men.

17:52.600 --> 17:59.200
And then cognitively, when we see that over and over again, we come to assume cognitively

17:59.200 --> 18:03.360
that the people in those kinds of positions deserve to have them.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.040
That's called status expectations theory.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.640
And it's been demonstrated in a number of different ways.

18:10.640 --> 18:15.040
So those kinds of messages we all share.

18:15.040 --> 18:21.640
And if you look at implicit associations or implicit association tests, men and women

18:21.640 --> 18:25.720
are so similarly affected by those kinds of messages.

18:25.720 --> 18:33.480
But it isn't the case, I think, that having the representation of women in higher level

18:33.480 --> 18:38.640
jobs wouldn't be beneficial in terms of hiring more women in general.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.200
In fact, I think that there is some research that showed at least limited research that

18:43.200 --> 18:49.800
when women, for example, in law firms, if women are represented in top level positions

18:49.800 --> 18:55.320
in law firms, then they're more likely to hire other women in those firms compared to

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
men.

18:56.320 --> 19:02.600
But where I thought you were going is what's called the double bind for women, which is

19:02.600 --> 19:08.800
that because of these cognitive associations in our heads, we associate being a good manager,

19:08.800 --> 19:12.280
being a good leader with being a male.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.480
And so when we think manager, we think male.

19:16.480 --> 19:22.160
And so women who enact the behaviors that we think of as being a good manager or a good

19:22.160 --> 19:30.920
leader are thought of as not being sufficiently female or feminine in their behavior.

19:30.920 --> 19:35.360
And so they're thought of as competent but not nice.

19:35.360 --> 19:42.240
And if they enact the more feminine role of being emotional and nice and caring and so

19:42.240 --> 19:47.080
on, then their thought about as being nice but not competent.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.680
And that trade-off doesn't exist for men.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.600
Men can be both competent and nice.

19:51.600 --> 19:57.520
In fact, they are thought of as that way when they're in top leadership positions, but it

19:57.520 --> 19:59.000
isn't the case for women.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.440
So if women face that double bind and they are having to walk that narrow line, then

20:07.440 --> 20:12.360
their behaviors in those roles may be somewhat different than men because women are having

20:12.360 --> 20:18.400
to address other kinds of issues about how they're perceived and how they get evaluated.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.640
So even they may be subject to those kinds of messages.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.600
So if they are in a position to select someone for a job, they also may perceive a woman

20:28.600 --> 20:38.120
as being competent but not nice or nice but not competent and also feel that they should

20:38.120 --> 20:42.440
hire the man because he seems to have the traits that are the whole package.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.480
The whole package, right.

20:44.480 --> 20:56.200
But visiting that, how do you change that sort of cognitive perception that you have?

20:56.200 --> 21:03.240
To me, that sort of change would take more than a generation, take several generations

21:03.240 --> 21:06.880
of thinking in that way.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.440
So it's a very difficult situation.

21:10.440 --> 21:16.000
Well, I've had that question addressed particularly with regard to my book on racial inequality

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
a lot.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.480
So what do you do if whites help other whites?

21:20.480 --> 21:26.280
And they act with favor toward other whites and it's not really discrimination and racism.

21:26.280 --> 21:29.800
Well the first answer to that is it's not an individual solution.

21:29.800 --> 21:34.320
It's not something that you can do simply by changing your own behavior.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.000
It's really a collective solution.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.680
It's a public policy solution.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.280
It's a social movement solution.

21:40.280 --> 21:47.320
But short of that, you can also have organizational policies that change if organizations have

21:47.320 --> 21:51.880
more accountability for the kinds of decisions that get made.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.120
That can make a difference.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.080
And then individual people can make a difference.

21:56.080 --> 22:00.160
But to do so, they can't just try to be better.

22:00.160 --> 22:08.920
The research tends to show that they have to be explicit about these cultural biases

22:08.920 --> 22:12.160
that they hold and make them salient.

22:12.160 --> 22:17.040
And when they do that, they're less likely to enact the kind of cultural biases that

22:17.040 --> 22:21.640
would lead to giving favor to men over women.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.840
So those are some of the kinds of things that could be done.

22:25.840 --> 22:30.920
One thing that's not emphasized enough I think is a lot of this is put in a way that seems

22:30.920 --> 22:36.800
to be like we should favor women in some way.

22:36.800 --> 22:42.560
And organizations you can think they don't want to do that because they might be worried

22:42.560 --> 22:47.800
that you will hurt their performance, that they will be just a political correctness type

22:47.800 --> 22:49.800
of thing.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.600
And it should be much more emphasized that that's not the case.

22:53.600 --> 23:00.880
That actually even unknowingly if your organization, this favoritism or some sort of discrimination,

23:00.880 --> 23:06.040
you are actually hurting your organization because you're not promoting the most qualified

23:06.040 --> 23:07.040
people.

23:07.040 --> 23:13.200
And that message should be out there so that let's say men, which are the ones that hold

23:13.200 --> 23:20.400
now the top positions, start to worry more about and say we should actually worry about

23:20.400 --> 23:25.160
these associations, these stereotypes that exist about what is a good leader.

23:25.160 --> 23:32.360
And so we try to be much more objective about there's lots of evidence that show that women

23:32.360 --> 23:37.840
perform equally if not better sometimes that men in many, many managerial positions but

23:37.840 --> 23:43.360
the stereotype might still be that the man is the, or the qualities that are associated

23:43.360 --> 23:47.960
with men are the ones that you want as leaders which is not necessarily the case.

23:47.960 --> 23:55.320
But if we come back to the differences between the United States and for example will take

23:55.320 --> 23:56.480
the Nordic countries.

23:56.480 --> 24:06.880
Aren't there policies in those countries that the United States or women as a whole strive

24:06.880 --> 24:17.240
towards for instance the type of leave they have, the existence of public funded daycare

24:17.240 --> 24:20.040
centers and things of that nature.

24:20.040 --> 24:24.960
Yeah certainly those kinds of policies make a huge difference is that in the Nordic countries

24:24.960 --> 24:31.360
and in Europe more so than in the US or England I guess.

24:31.360 --> 24:38.160
Having paid childcare for some period of time makes it easier to manage the work family

24:38.160 --> 24:46.320
issues than the other, you know they have similar laws about non-discrimination and

24:46.320 --> 24:55.320
so on but give more support for women who might have responsibility for children and

24:55.320 --> 24:58.840
families or elder care and so on.

24:58.840 --> 25:03.720
The other thing that I believe the Nordic countries have done, I don't know for sure

25:03.720 --> 25:08.280
but I know some European countries and I think it's the Nordic countries have mandated a

25:08.280 --> 25:12.440
certain proportion of representation on their boards of directors.

25:12.440 --> 25:13.440
That's right.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.440
I think 30%.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.440
40%.

25:15.440 --> 25:23.680
So the assumption there is that if you have representation of women in these positions

25:23.680 --> 25:31.200
that then the policies in the firms will be less likely to be discriminatory or at least

25:31.200 --> 25:36.880
will be more likely to be fair and the research on those kinds of issues of which there is

25:36.880 --> 25:47.040
some emerging tend to show that there isn't a direct clear relationship between that kind

25:47.040 --> 25:57.000
of representation and better performance but at least there is no evidence to suggest

25:57.000 --> 26:01.160
that that kind of representation leads to lesser performance.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.080
So it's not the case that's coming.

26:04.080 --> 26:10.400
The changes are a little very recent so you would expect that at the beginning there might

26:10.400 --> 26:15.720
be a shorter qualified woman to fill all these positions because the demand didn't exist

26:15.720 --> 26:23.320
and now as years pass and then more and more women get.

26:23.320 --> 26:28.960
There is something that let's say I see in my research or what I'm interested in my research

26:28.960 --> 26:34.720
is this idea that if you think you're not going to be promoted you're not going to

26:34.720 --> 26:37.800
work as hard to get those promotions.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.800
So differences that look like maybe the man looks like he's performing a little bit better

26:41.800 --> 26:46.800
was because he has better incentives to work hard.

26:46.800 --> 26:52.040
Like this idea with the boards if suddenly you know that 40% of the board will be female

26:52.040 --> 26:57.760
now there's going to be some woman that will start to think and say well if I want to be

26:57.760 --> 27:04.360
a member of the board I need to do this five things and then get the necessary qualifications

27:04.360 --> 27:13.120
and as this happens then my hope or my prediction will be that performance will get better after

27:13.120 --> 27:15.840
you get enough qualified women.

27:15.840 --> 27:22.720
But the comment that you made about if you think you're not going to be promoted you

27:22.720 --> 27:31.360
don't work as hard is an anthema to a woman's ability to be promoted isn't promotion dependent

27:31.360 --> 27:37.720
on performance so if you don't perform well then you're not going to get promoted.

27:37.720 --> 27:44.920
It's a cycle right and that's the problem this is why it's so hard to break because if you

27:44.920 --> 27:49.600
think you're not going to get promoted you're not going to work as hard so then you're not

27:49.600 --> 27:53.920
going to get promoted because you're not as good as the equivalent male but you cannot

27:53.920 --> 27:59.520
change only one side you cannot you need to change both sides for this to break the

27:59.520 --> 28:04.360
conversation makes it sound like promotions and other kinds of choices like this are based

28:04.360 --> 28:12.560
on merit and we know that is not the case that it is centrally based on who knows or supports

28:12.560 --> 28:18.880
or is sponsoring whom and the fact that there are any number of people who might be thought

28:18.880 --> 28:24.320
of as qualified so it's not the best person it's the one who has the right connections

28:24.320 --> 28:31.680
the right people the right place in the right time and in general if white men are in the

28:31.680 --> 28:36.000
decision making positions they will tend to hire other white men or promote them or give

28:36.000 --> 28:42.280
them raises and so on and that's that's true actually throughout the labor force not just

28:42.280 --> 28:51.480
at the top and it's very consequential let me give you an example that was very interesting

28:51.480 --> 28:58.080
to me about a year and a half ago I was invited to attend a conference that was sponsored

28:58.080 --> 29:06.000
by a major company fortune 100 company that wanted to have business school faculty do

29:06.000 --> 29:12.760
a better job of admitting and training and graduating minority students because they

29:12.760 --> 29:16.880
wanted to be able to hire them and they thought if they could influence the faculty they would

29:16.880 --> 29:22.280
do a better job with the students so the CEO of this company came to this little conference

29:22.280 --> 29:30.720
of about 30 people and gave an impassioned plea about the importance of diversity to

29:30.720 --> 29:37.240
the survival of his firm he said that like many firms 75 percent of their profits and

29:37.240 --> 29:42.080
the growth of the company was coming from outside the United States he said that people

29:42.080 --> 29:47.720
had to learn to work with people whose names they couldn't pronounce and that in general

29:47.720 --> 29:54.640
that the firm would not survive if middle management didn't become more representative of the

29:54.640 --> 30:04.440
world and so on and so in this discussion I posed to him the issue about implicit bias

30:04.440 --> 30:08.360
that so many people have heard about about unconscious bias the fact that we have these

30:08.360 --> 30:14.200
cognitive messages in our heads he knew all about that he had brought one of the key researchers

30:14.200 --> 30:20.080
from Harvard into talk to the top management of the firm he knew all about trying to get

30:20.080 --> 30:26.680
rid of implicit bias and yet at dinner that night I learned from one of the HR directors

30:26.680 --> 30:36.560
that that firm rewarded people in the company who recommended people they later hired so

30:36.560 --> 30:42.400
he was supposedly wanted to increase the diversity of middle management but middle management

30:42.400 --> 30:48.040
was disproportionately white men and so if they recommended people it was going to be

30:48.040 --> 30:55.560
other white men and so his whole framework about bias was bias against he wanted to get

30:55.560 --> 31:02.520
rid of the bias against people and gave no attention to the fact that in his firm continually

31:02.520 --> 31:09.000
there was bias for whites hiring other whites and so he thought the survival of his firm

31:09.000 --> 31:14.160
depended on having a more diverse labor force and yet they had policies in this firm which

31:14.160 --> 31:19.840
were reproducing the system labor force. If I can also go back to the comment about a

31:19.840 --> 31:27.200
woman who perceives rightly or wrongly that someone a male white male black male even

31:27.200 --> 31:34.880
just a male is going to be promoted so they kind of just laws that become laws like there

31:34.880 --> 31:42.680
I have to disagree I feel like there are a lot of women that work even harder when they

31:42.680 --> 31:48.200
see that situation I feel like that's been our MO is that we have to to prove ourselves

31:48.200 --> 31:54.320
and everything else but we're still not getting that job or that managerial position or that

31:54.320 --> 32:05.920
CEO level you know I think that it's a real problem when people perceive women is giving

32:05.920 --> 32:10.800
up or just going to accept the status quo because I really don't know any woman that

32:10.800 --> 32:19.680
does that on any level willingly there's a difference in how they've been raised or the

32:19.680 --> 32:24.960
values or their own self-esteem and I think self-esteem does play in a immense role in

32:24.960 --> 32:30.400
this as well I think in those situations that you're talking about a lot of women because

32:30.400 --> 32:36.040
they've either been rejected or they feel like they've been passed up or whatever their

32:36.040 --> 32:40.760
self-esteem becomes smaller and smaller and so they don't demand what they deserve and

32:40.760 --> 32:47.880
I don't think that's addressed men don't seem to engage in these same types of dialogues

32:47.880 --> 32:56.440
at least in the people that I've observed if anything their ego is often inflated it's

32:56.440 --> 33:03.400
true and so they don't they don't second guess themselves all the time I mean I speak

33:03.400 --> 33:07.560
when at least in my line of work women are always coming back and kind of second guessing

33:07.560 --> 33:12.440
one so I have right that it is like this perfectionist thing and men are just kind of like it is

33:12.440 --> 33:17.240
what it is let's move on what's the next witness you know it's it's like this thing and I think

33:17.240 --> 33:24.920
some of that is based on how we're groomed to to think about ourselves as women and I

33:24.920 --> 33:29.320
also want to get back to the point I think you mean an excellent excellent observation

33:29.320 --> 33:36.200
I'm just curious how you all would view yourselves in your work careers are you the nice incompetent

33:36.200 --> 33:45.480
one or you the one who's um can I swear bitch from hell but like gets it done like

33:47.560 --> 33:51.640
you know I'm just curious and where has that gone for you because I can say it for me

33:51.640 --> 34:00.520
I've grown I used to start out in pantsuits and things like that being kind of what I perceived

34:01.160 --> 34:06.760
you know was the right track and then I said you know what I'm a woman and like I'm gonna

34:06.760 --> 34:14.200
wear makeup and I'm gonna you know wear heels and I'm gonna you know not wear hose sometimes in

34:14.200 --> 34:19.800
court and I'm gonna wear pink I'm gonna wear blue I'm gonna be who I am and I've seen how that's

34:19.800 --> 34:24.680
worn out for me I'm just curious if either one of you has ever identified with one of those

34:25.240 --> 34:35.480
I just want to raise a point about something you said that we all know that you're not promoted

34:35.480 --> 34:41.960
because of what you do it's who you know and that that's generalizing though because there are

34:41.960 --> 34:48.040
situations well there are a lot of situations and they are careers for instance in science

34:48.040 --> 34:55.960
that's promotion depends on what you have achieved your ability to do it good or bad

34:56.520 --> 35:04.120
positive or negative and it doesn't depend at all on who you might know in the department

35:04.120 --> 35:10.760
and I know that because we have traveled so much and I have gone to various institutes

35:10.760 --> 35:19.560
oftentimes not knowing anyone at all and it's only on a CV that your position and your salary

35:20.360 --> 35:24.680
is estimated it doesn't depend on who you know or

35:27.080 --> 35:34.440
that's that's a wonderful that's a wonderful setup for my response because of course a lot

35:34.440 --> 35:40.040
of the research I've done are on scientists and engineers and my research does not show

35:40.040 --> 35:49.800
what you have just said I did a study of 24 major multi-billion dollar US companies in different

35:49.800 --> 35:57.160
parts of the country with 3200 scientists and engineers and we had data on their career experiences

35:57.160 --> 36:02.440
and then we also had the evaluation of their managers and in the analyses that we did

36:02.440 --> 36:10.440
we looked at two different kinds of outcomes one was their evaluation as being innovative

36:10.440 --> 36:16.120
which is a key thing for scientists and engineers and the other thing was their evaluation

36:17.400 --> 36:24.680
as promotable into management and among other factors controlling for all the kinds of things

36:24.680 --> 36:31.960
that you think you should control for we looked at their access to favorable work experiences

36:31.960 --> 36:36.920
which in science and engineering is being able to choose your own work as opposed to having

36:36.920 --> 36:44.120
someone assign it to you and we found in that analysis that US-born white men were more likely

36:44.120 --> 36:48.920
than other groups to be able to choose their own work and what's called access to technical

36:48.920 --> 36:56.040
control and then over and above their access to these favorable work experiences they also got

36:56.040 --> 37:01.560
higher evaluations on innovativeness and higher evaluations on promoted,

37:01.560 --> 37:09.240
promoted into management, net of patents, net of publications, net of their education,

37:09.240 --> 37:15.640
net of their years of experience so essentially US-born white men were getting the benefit of the doubt

37:16.280 --> 37:23.240
and they were getting favorable experiences that affected their evaluation as being more

37:23.240 --> 37:31.560
qualified and then also more likely to be promoted into management so even in science and engineering

37:31.560 --> 37:38.040
where you think that there's a very hardened fast kind of measurement of merit they're simply

37:38.040 --> 37:46.040
isn't and certainly in any university that is quite evident you can take any one's qualifications

37:46.840 --> 37:51.800
and they can be interpreted in a number of different ways I've been on the faculty for

37:51.800 --> 37:59.480
I think about 40 years now I've been tenured for a long time set on many many personnel committees

38:00.120 --> 38:05.560
and the bar gets raised or lowered depending on who the candidate is and who in the room wants to

38:06.120 --> 38:11.320
be favorable toward that person and you can fight against it and you can raise all kinds of questions

38:11.320 --> 38:16.760
about merit but you know you can't finesse zero if the person has done nothing then you can't do

38:16.760 --> 38:22.360
much but no one for the most part is in that situation everyone has done something and then

38:23.000 --> 38:29.160
depending on whose friends with whom the case can get presented as the best things in sliced

38:29.160 --> 38:36.200
bread or it can be sort of just not good enough you know needs to go somewhere else because

38:36.200 --> 38:44.280
it doesn't meet our standards I suppose the difference is the type of science that you're

38:44.280 --> 38:52.920
in you're involved in because I was in biological science and the fact that I never

38:52.920 --> 39:01.880
aspired to a management role in fact I couldn't because we moved so much but certainly my CV

39:01.880 --> 39:08.920
or curriculum VITA made a difference and the papers I'd published and the research that I had done

39:08.920 --> 39:14.360
did contribute towards the position that I was able to get.

39:14.360 --> 39:20.680
Yeah that's true for everyone certainly patents and publications had a positive effect but the

39:20.680 --> 39:28.200
issue is net of that controlling for that US white men still got the benefit of the doubt and

39:28.200 --> 39:34.680
they got favorable assignments. Well I can see that might be the outcome. My data included you

39:34.680 --> 39:41.320
know electronic and biology and chemistry and every type of science so it was not limited to a

39:41.320 --> 39:47.160
certain field. Did you do one in law? I didn't do the work in law but there are lots and lots

39:47.160 --> 39:52.360
of research on lawyers and they tend to show the same thing. Really? Oh absolutely. Okay.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.280
I think one issue to think about here is

39:58.280 --> 40:08.120
like to think yeah generally we tend to separate and say well output is really publications and

40:08.120 --> 40:13.720
patents and for scientists and engineers. But if you really think about output it is not just

40:13.720 --> 40:21.480
those two things but it's also networking and that's like part of your production of not just

40:21.480 --> 40:27.320
science but in many other positions. There we see some clear differences in the type of networks

40:27.320 --> 40:36.760
that say that white males might have and that women might have but part of that in a way I think it's

40:39.400 --> 40:44.360
is the way they go about building their network. I mean it's not like it's not determined that

40:45.160 --> 40:49.800
the social networks are the way they are. You can work on networking and that's where you see

40:50.600 --> 40:55.160
ment and to network more than the women do. And women don't have time to network.

40:55.160 --> 41:01.480
They might not. Yes. Working full time and taking care of families. Exactly. And those differences

41:01.480 --> 41:08.360
let's say are but that's where I think that if there's a change of incentives at the top

41:08.920 --> 41:17.000
the incentive to network might also change. And then you might if some cultural changes like the

41:17.000 --> 41:21.640
man who takes care of the kids at home you have more time you can start networking and then

41:21.640 --> 41:28.600
some of this difference is my my go away. Yeah let me mention that just these issues about how

41:28.600 --> 41:34.840
you evaluate competence and whether one can do it on objective criteria or not really was underlined

41:34.840 --> 41:41.480
for me this year because as vice dean for faculty and research I'm in charge of personnel issues.

41:41.480 --> 41:48.440
So I have to oversee all the tenure and promotion decisions. And we had this year two cases in

41:48.440 --> 41:54.760
the same department one white male one woman who happened to be European born who were both

41:54.760 --> 42:02.520
coming up for promotion. And our appointments and promotions committee raved about him and said

42:03.080 --> 42:09.880
you know this is such a clear case for someone who deserves promotion. And on her case there was

42:09.880 --> 42:17.560
they're saying they're not quite enough she's not really ready etc. They both had

42:18.440 --> 42:23.560
almost identical citations they had almost the same number of

42:25.240 --> 42:31.400
published papers in good journals if anything I think hers were were more over her career.

42:32.600 --> 42:37.800
She was on a major editorial board he was on an editorial board of a journal no one had ever

42:37.800 --> 42:44.440
heard of and yet this committee represented his editorial board membership as being on a journal

42:44.440 --> 42:50.360
which was not the one he was actually on. They simply substituted the name of a top journal instead

42:50.360 --> 42:55.800
of the one that actually he was on. And you know this kind of stuff happens all the time and if

42:55.800 --> 43:02.040
you don't have people who are paying attention to how these criteria get weighted and evaluated

43:02.040 --> 43:13.720
then you will reproduce these kinds of inequalities. I made first of all I sent the report back to

43:13.720 --> 43:18.360
the appointments and promotions committee and said you don't have the right name in the journal

43:18.360 --> 43:27.320
here and then I because as vice dean I got to write the dean's report of course I you know tried

43:27.320 --> 43:33.000
to write an equitable case now as it turns out he has been promoted we're still waiting to hear

43:33.000 --> 43:38.120
about her so. Can we get back to networking because I think there is a difference in networking as

43:38.120 --> 43:45.320
a woman and networking as a man. There's a no matter what if you're in a room full of people in the

43:45.320 --> 43:52.680
industry or whatever and as a woman you approach a man who's in power. There is a observation by

43:52.680 --> 43:58.920
people there's a sexual component to it there's all these other pressures and and things that go

43:58.920 --> 44:03.880
into it versus the guys hanging out in the back and being the guys and I think a lot of times

44:04.840 --> 44:11.720
I've heard a situations where men feel very uncomfortable just you know either having that

44:11.720 --> 44:17.000
dinner or networking or having that follow-up conversation or whatever and I think that in some

44:17.000 --> 44:24.600
sense that does hold women back in a way you disagree but I well it could also work the other

44:24.600 --> 44:30.360
way let's face it it can go either way but the whole point is is that networking I think is

44:30.360 --> 44:37.400
different for men and women and how you go about that and how it's perceived in everything else and

44:37.400 --> 44:43.560
I also think that in science maybe networking isn't everything and perception isn't everything

44:43.560 --> 44:49.080
but at least in the industries I've been in I would say that's 50 percent everybody's you know

44:50.200 --> 44:55.640
at different levels obviously it's going to be behind you know between you know two different

44:55.640 --> 45:01.720
people of kind of the same level but the perception and if this is someone that you can hang out with

45:01.720 --> 45:07.160
and go have a drink with after work and all these other dynamics play a huge part not not in what

45:07.160 --> 45:11.800
you're delivering it's extremely important again the research shows exactly what you're saying that

45:11.800 --> 45:17.320
networking is not the same for men and women and not the same for whites and non-whites essentially

45:17.320 --> 45:25.160
women and non-whites have to borrow social capital from white men yes in order to do as well but

45:27.880 --> 45:34.120
and it's also there are also some research to show that it is more difficult to have the kind of

45:34.120 --> 45:42.920
mentoring relationship between a female subordinate and a male superior because of this romance it

45:42.920 --> 45:47.480
looks like a date as opposed to a professional relationship yes and then all your colleagues

45:47.480 --> 45:54.920
are looking at it is that she's getting ahead not because she has merit and credence but because

45:55.480 --> 46:03.880
favors of favoritism and so it's very difficult to walk that balance which is partly why it's so

46:03.880 --> 46:09.480
important to have representation of women in the top level decision-making jobs as well because it

46:09.480 --> 46:16.280
helps mitigate that issue to some extent one of the key things that I found in the research that I

46:16.280 --> 46:22.920
did for my book which included detailed job histories for whites in several different parts of the

46:22.920 --> 46:30.840
country between ages of 25 and 55 I found that 70 percent of the jobs that people got over their

46:30.840 --> 46:37.400
lifetimes was because they got help from somebody because they got information other people didn't

46:37.400 --> 46:41.880
have they had influence used on their behalf or they had someone who actually could offer them a

46:41.880 --> 46:49.080
job or an opportunity so 70 percent of the time people had that kind of help and the jobs where

46:49.080 --> 46:54.520
you didn't have the help was as one of my interviewees said when one job is as bad as another you

46:54.520 --> 47:01.960
don't have to draw on social capital to get a job because you know anybody can get it but when I

47:01.960 --> 47:06.920
asked the people that I interviewed so what do you think most contributed to your having the kind

47:06.920 --> 47:11.400
of life you have now they all said because I worked hard because I was smart because I got an

47:11.400 --> 47:17.800
education because I did whatever so they although they actively drew from this kind of social

47:17.800 --> 47:24.920
connections they all individualized their success and thought they did it on their own I think that's

47:24.920 --> 47:29.880
another thing that's important is that women want to do it on their own I mean I know I was in an

47:29.880 --> 47:37.720
industry where my family well after the fact got very connected quit that job went to law school

47:37.720 --> 47:44.280
went were no one of my family is and I think that that's very important in terms of knowing

47:44.280 --> 47:49.880
and I'm not saying that I didn't have other things in my favor I mean I was well educated I came

47:49.880 --> 47:55.720
from a nice family you know I had other things going for me but I think that for women to get

47:55.720 --> 47:59.800
forward they need to believe in themselves and know why they got there there are plenty of women

47:59.800 --> 48:05.560
that I have heard from that are like well the only reason I got it is because my uncles you know

48:05.560 --> 48:10.440
whatever that never really kind of move forward or know their own worth or anything else because

48:10.440 --> 48:17.400
they just kind of relied on those wings I mean I think that's important for women to work on

48:17.400 --> 48:23.080
themselves I mean I do think there is a lot of work for women to do on themselves as well and

48:23.080 --> 48:27.320
there are conversations that we need to be having with each other and supporting each other and

48:27.320 --> 48:33.880
this goes back to my theory that nobody else really is but I think that there is a great resource

48:33.880 --> 48:42.840
in the in the in the workplace of women sharing with women and empowering other women and looking

48:42.840 --> 48:49.160
at you know the intelligence and the beauty and the and the potential and being happy for other

48:49.160 --> 48:55.800
women I think that is counterintuitive to most women most women are in a competitive they feel

48:55.800 --> 49:00.840
like it's them against someone else I know you disagree I am so stunned just

49:00.840 --> 49:09.640
because you're standing yes okay okay now I understand okay let me let me support your comment for a

49:09.640 --> 49:14.920
minute well she can support and research let me just say I'm not a research person I I prosecute

49:14.920 --> 49:20.920
cases I deal with people who kill people like I'm a homicide I have no research but I have everyday

49:20.920 --> 49:26.360
experience not as much as many people not as much but I also make the observations in the comments

49:26.360 --> 49:31.560
that I think a lot of people feel that nobody does make and nobody bothers to research this is a very

49:31.560 --> 49:36.760
uncomfortable area women don't want to hear they want to believe that women you know we're the

49:36.760 --> 49:43.160
victims we need to be empowered and okay no no but I'm saying I hear this a lot that we're somehow

49:44.200 --> 49:49.800
being repressed or this whether it be sex all of that is true but there is a great potential for

49:49.800 --> 49:56.120
women to get together and really embrace each other I'm sorry I actually asked a bunch of people

49:56.120 --> 50:02.760
at work this for a couple years I'm like what is the deal what is the deal in this office why can't

50:02.760 --> 50:07.960
we say instead of the catie remark can you believe this can you believe that can you believe the

50:07.960 --> 50:15.880
man she's networking with can you believe all of that is just contributing to the fact that we're

50:15.880 --> 50:23.480
not uplifting each other and I think it's a real problem that needs to be equally I so let me say

50:23.480 --> 50:30.360
first of all that I don't think in general that your observation is correct that in general I think

50:30.360 --> 50:35.880
the more representation of women and decision-making positions the better off other women in the

50:35.880 --> 50:42.600
organization will be and that well there may be the occasional catie remark I don't think that that's

50:42.600 --> 50:48.600
general representation of what happens when women enter the labor force but the place where there is

50:48.600 --> 50:55.960
some support for what you are observing can be found for example in work that Rosa Beth Moss-Cantar

50:55.960 --> 51:04.040
who's currently at Harvard did years ago where she was looking at the structure of women's jobs

51:04.040 --> 51:09.800
compared to the structure of men's jobs and she observed several different kinds of things first

51:09.800 --> 51:15.640
of all that women were more likely to be in jobs that had access to fewer resources than the jobs

51:15.640 --> 51:22.200
that men had and when you have access to fewer resources then you might hoard them and be less

51:22.200 --> 51:29.720
likely to share right and then the second thing she observed was that men's jobs were likely to be

51:30.680 --> 51:36.840
in the types of jobs that had ladders to better jobs whereas women's jobs were more likely to be

51:36.840 --> 51:45.000
in ladders that didn't go anywhere and so men had more opportunity and had links to those opportunities

51:45.000 --> 51:50.840
whereas women's jobs did not and then she also looked at the observation of the when women were

51:50.840 --> 51:58.120
in a minority that certain kinds of things happened in terms of how people address them like it

51:58.120 --> 52:05.000
tickly if there's only a very small proportion of women in the that work setting and she observed

52:05.000 --> 52:11.080
that particularly when there was a small group of women and it seemed that only a few women could

52:11.080 --> 52:16.520
get ahead then under those circumstances each woman might think that they're competing with

52:16.520 --> 52:21.720
the other one because only one will get the job it wasn't a general experience it's mostly men

52:21.720 --> 52:26.360
but occasionally a woman gets through and I'm going to be the one to do it so under those kinds of

52:26.360 --> 52:31.720
circumstances you may observe the kind of behavior that you're talking about but I don't think it's a

52:31.720 --> 52:39.880
general experience when you're talking about broader representation in the labor of the ballot

52:39.880 --> 52:45.160
because that's the working environment that you would see I've always experienced and that many

52:45.160 --> 52:50.600
women experience and I don't want to not have a voice or not have a way to express that because

52:50.600 --> 52:55.880
I'm in a particular area and I'm not the general I guarantee I'll never be in the general you know

52:55.880 --> 53:02.520
like it's just it's something that I think but even but even in law firms that there's some research

53:02.520 --> 53:09.800
by Robin Ealy from Harvard who looked at law firms and found that when there were more women

53:09.800 --> 53:16.840
partners then there's more chance that a woman will be hired in that firm compared to when there

53:16.840 --> 53:22.120
are no women partners even with women in lower level positions then I would agree there'll be

53:22.120 --> 53:29.720
different dynamics but don't you think it is a combination of things that result in a woman

53:29.720 --> 53:38.040
and not maybe not general but certainly specifically in women getting ahead that you do need people

53:38.040 --> 53:46.840
at some stage you may not realize it overtly as someone helping you and then the woman herself

53:46.840 --> 53:56.120
has to have a diversion or a passion for a particular application so it's a combination of

53:57.080 --> 54:05.400
someone who wants to do something and also someone who may want to help and most times women

54:05.400 --> 54:14.120
well in my own case it's been men who've helped me get along so that it doesn't necessarily need

54:14.120 --> 54:20.840
to be the one thing or the other well again most women will be helped by men because men are the

54:20.840 --> 54:28.200
decision makers disproportionately but with women in positions of decision making they are probably

54:28.200 --> 54:37.880
more likely to recognize and call to attention the issues of women's competence as well and

54:37.880 --> 54:47.320
women are likely to do well but that's the problem of really telling about that that effect is it's

54:47.320 --> 54:54.120
very hard right and because law firms let's say they have more women at the top are also law firms

54:54.120 --> 55:00.760
where the men are different from the law firms where there's only men at the top so it could be

55:00.760 --> 55:14.360
an effect for from both right well again the well not not just history I think that you could be a

55:14.360 --> 55:21.640
little more specific again there's lots of different ways that one could address it but the one that

55:21.640 --> 55:28.040
I think makes the most sense is again from what's called status construction theory or status

55:28.040 --> 55:36.600
expectations theory that finds that when resources are distributed unequally and overlaid with

55:36.600 --> 55:42.760
categorical differences among people like men versus women whites versus blacks and so on and so

55:42.760 --> 55:50.760
when you observe men always in positions that have more authority more income more training more

55:50.760 --> 55:58.440
education etc or whites in those kinds of positions then you come to assume that the people with the

55:58.440 --> 56:05.880
resources are the ones who are both competent and worthy and this sort of research let me just say

56:05.880 --> 56:13.880
because it sounds like it's just you know describing something that isn't real the research has not

56:13.880 --> 56:21.800
been done on men versus women or blacks versus whites it's done on artificially constructed groups

56:21.800 --> 56:28.120
artificially constructed categories like people might be called over estimators and under estimators

56:28.120 --> 56:34.920
or people that like Paul Clay versus people that like Picasso so the this social psychological

56:34.920 --> 56:40.840
research creates these distinctions and then give the people with these different distinctions

56:40.840 --> 56:47.640
different amounts of resources and then they evaluate how they evaluate each other and again

56:47.640 --> 56:51.960
they find that people with the most resources are the ones that are assumed to be more competent

56:52.680 --> 57:00.120
to be more worthy to get the benefit of the doubt and so on and so forth so even without real groups

57:00.840 --> 57:07.560
you just artificially create the groups you have this cognitive outcome because we have a tendency

57:07.560 --> 57:12.840
to want to think whatever is is right and therefore if those people are in charge it's because they

57:12.840 --> 57:18.680
should be in charge and again we do that to ourselves and there's the and that effect is

57:18.680 --> 57:24.840
multiplied by then let's say a young woman or a thinking of a career if they never see a woman

57:25.240 --> 57:32.200
in say in engineering they might assume that or they implicitly they might think that men are better

57:32.200 --> 57:40.120
that even though it's not true and and then again they don't get the proper training and then

57:40.760 --> 57:45.400
later on yeah they won't be qualified for those jobs and there is variation across countries

57:45.400 --> 57:52.680
these better models that if you have a good model let's say you have a mother who is working

57:52.680 --> 57:59.960
and successful that that will lead you also to as a woman to work and become successful

57:59.960 --> 58:01.960
the research does show that

58:01.960 --> 58:10.440
the research shows that women need to see other women in areas and that two things women need

58:10.440 --> 58:17.480
to see women in other areas so they have a whole lot of women in elementary school are being

58:17.480 --> 58:24.920
discouraged from owning into mass and sciences okay so Israel which is the most techy country

58:24.920 --> 58:24.920
world described conference on and they had a representation from IsraelComp Dre

58:33.160 --> 58:38.960
and they were saying that in Israel they didn't have enough women for wills and

58:38.960 --> 58:44.120
that women needs now what you do we don't see

58:44.160 --> 58:49.620
now you don'tails it's

58:49.620 --> 58:51.160
way to join

58:51.160 --> 58:55.160
Women do mentor.

58:55.160 --> 58:56.360
Oh, no, no, I agree.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.360
I have a mother who's still working even though she should

58:58.360 --> 58:59.440
retire a long time ago.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.480
She'll work to the day she dies.

59:01.480 --> 59:04.240
I have incredible women influences.

59:04.240 --> 59:08.280
At work, I gravitate towards women mentors and everything

59:08.280 --> 59:09.120
like that.

59:09.120 --> 59:11.440
But most of the professional organizations,

59:11.440 --> 59:15.640
I belong to right now, are the only ways some of us

59:15.640 --> 59:18.680
have counted that as a group of women.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.440
We have gone together.

59:20.440 --> 59:20.940
Yes.

59:20.940 --> 59:24.480
We have been very helpful with each other.

59:24.480 --> 59:24.980
Yes.

59:24.980 --> 59:27.480
We've started a separate women's group.

59:27.480 --> 59:27.980
Wonderful.

59:27.980 --> 59:29.320
We're not sacred.

59:29.320 --> 59:29.820
OK.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.560
We've been to a professional group that's

59:31.560 --> 59:33.320
partnered with the other group.

59:33.320 --> 59:37.320
And we get good, a woman will talk about her new idea.

59:37.320 --> 59:38.320
We will be there.

59:38.320 --> 59:40.960
But most of us are in the same profession.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.000
I'm in the same profession with all these women.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.280
I'm not competing.

59:44.280 --> 59:44.800
Right.

59:44.800 --> 59:46.200
I have enough.

59:46.200 --> 59:49.600
So you really have to be, you're not going to get the

59:49.600 --> 59:51.160
support from the guys at the male

59:51.160 --> 59:53.560
dining professional organization.

59:53.560 --> 59:55.560
I'm not going to change that culture.

59:55.560 --> 59:58.200
I can create another culture.

59:58.200 --> 59:58.840
Right.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.120
And I guess in my job, that's what I'm trying to do.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.000
And I've had these discussions over the years.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.680
I'm in a very different kind of place.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.080
But I've been in that different place

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.320
in three different careers.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.560
So at least in my experience, there

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:19.840
are certain types of jobs where it's

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.160
hard to get the women to get on the same page.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.320
I had an office many years ago in Staten Island.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:25.840
Ooh.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.840
And I had to go to social functions.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.520
And I was told that I quote, in Staten Island, women

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.040
don't talk to men.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.160
Men come up to talk to women.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.560
So what I had to do was to work hard on many people.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.320
I was very friendly.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.760
We would talk to everybody.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.800
It was strictly business.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.880
It was strictly business.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.640
It was not an end.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.440
If I hadn't had lunch with a guy, I'd

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.280
read them.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.440
Lunch.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.240
Lunch.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.440
And then I made it never to leave the women, the wives,

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.800
so that the boys would get to know the ANC.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.000
Oh, I don't understand.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.560
Is the solution that women have to get together

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.720
and create groups to counter men?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.200
Is that what the solution is?

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.720
It's not the solution.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.240
There are many solutions.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.760
Again, solutions include collective behavior,

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.480
collective actions, social movements, public policy,

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.000
organizational policies, and individual behavior.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.760
There is some controversy, if you will,

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.000
in terms of women in leadership roles.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.400
Should women simply have leadership development

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.680
courses, or should they have courses that are specifically

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.920
for women in leadership?

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.080
And the research tends to show that both of those things help.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:50.040
So that you need different kinds of social support,

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.160
for example.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.200
You need some people who will be instrumentally helpful,

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.560
who are going to help you with job opportunities,

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.600
and with knowledge about certain kinds of things

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.080
happening in the profession.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.160
And then you also need social support.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.920
You need someone to validate your experience,

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.840
who is going to help you understand that it's not you,

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.800
that it's structurally related to factors

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:17.080
like how women get treated versus how men get treated.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.280
I mean, one of the famous examples of that

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.200
was the study of the scientist at MIT,

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:27.000
is that one of the women, and I think she was in biology,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.600
I'm trying to remember, just got fed up one day

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.880
with feeling somehow she wasn't getting the resources

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.400
that she wanted.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.600
And so she went around, she measured, physically

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.840
measured everybody's office.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.480
And then she, to see how many square feet each of the scientists

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.840
had in her area.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.560
And she found the women had less square feet of office space

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.640
than the men.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:57.080
And she got together with other women scientists at MIT,

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.800
and they began to talk among themselves about, well,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.200
what's happening to you, and what's happening to you?

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.440
And they were finding out they were having very common

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.640
experiences, which they didn't know,

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.120
because there was only one of them in each department,

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.960
you know, a very small representation.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.440
And then their efforts to put together some data

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:19.360
to show that, in fact, they weren't being treated the same way

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.800
the men were, was facilitated by the fact

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.160
that Lottie Bailin happened to be president of the Faculty

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.680
Senate at that time, who was someone

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.120
who had done research on these kinds of issues.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.360
And therefore, she kind of fostered the attention

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.560
to their concerns.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.120
And then it went to the president of the university

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.000
who then said, well, you know, you're right.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.800
We haven't been treating women the same.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.040
And they started making some changes.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:50.480
So that suggests individuals doing things, groups,

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.240
offering social support, having the right people

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.760
in decision-making power, who can influence decisions.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.720
And at the right time, it happened to be at MIT

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.160
when they had the resources, I guess, to make some changes.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.000
And then it spread across the country.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.920
Somebody made Lottie, I think, made sure it got into the New York

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.520
Times.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:15.640
And then it was picked up by all kinds of other media

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.880
publications.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.240
And then other universities started saying, well,

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.280
maybe we should look at what's happening to our women

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.240
scientists and so on.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.160
So it didn't change everything, but it had an impact.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.520
Ultimately, to really reach parity,

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.680
let's say, in the men have to be on board.

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.400
Otherwise, it's just not going to happen.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:43.840
And coming down to issues about perception of the jobs

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.840
and family issues, if men don't pick up

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.240
the taking care of the kids, it would be impossible for women

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.840
to be in this really competitive profession.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.640
Well, men aren't taking care of the kids.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.520
Other women are taking care of the kids, for the most part.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.600
But that's what I mean.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.160
That's what I mean.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.720
They need to fully participate.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.320
Eventually, you need to get the men on board.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.880
Also, because what you don't want, I think,

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:16.760
it's a mistake, is to try to fix it by making women look

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.080
like men.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.760
And to me, that's a little self-defeating,

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:25.680
because then it's just going to destroy the diversity

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.000
and the good things of having both men and women

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.080
in top positions is that they are different.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.160
They think different.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.440
Otherwise, we will have parity, maybe at some point.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.600
But they'll be all acting like men.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.080
And that's not necessarily a good thing.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.880
Like to go back to some of your points.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.000
Men tend to be overconfident.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.920
That's not good.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.760
I mean, it might promote them in their careers,

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.720
but they're making their own decisions.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.240
Yes.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.920
I'm kidding.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.200
It's pretend.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.880
But I'll open it up for questions.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:09.800
OK.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.800
You have a comment on the question of science.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.920
There was a panel discussion here a couple weeks ago

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.560
on that on women in science.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.240
And they mentioned studies where papers were submitted

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.040
to journals or for grants.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.360
And they had women's names or men's names on the paper.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.000
And there was clear discrimination

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.720
in terms of just what names were on the paper.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.000
Also, my question has to do with how much

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.520
does the fact that, as was mentioned,

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.400
that the responsibility for having

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.600
and raising children isn't shared equally responsible

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.400
for the problems.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.960
And I wonder, I read that if you look at single women

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.000
without children, that their salaries are the same as men.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.160
There isn't discrimination.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.920
Is that true or not?

01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.920
No.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:00.600
No.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.800
What's the difference?

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800
How much is it?

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.000
The 20% they always?

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.920
I don't remember the exact data,

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:10.480
but at every point of comparison, you

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.080
will still find that when you control for full-time work,

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.720
weeks worked, type of job, type of occupation, and so on,

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.840
that men are going to make more.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.600
And that's true whether you're talking about single women

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.880
or women with children.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.200
It tends to be the case that for each additional child,

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.520
women pay a penalty in terms of salary and such

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.320
in the workforce.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.280
But even single women tend to be disadvantaged compared

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:41.720
to men.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:45.560
Even male nurses make more money than female nurses

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.960
and so on.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.280
So even in overwhelmingly female dominated positions,

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.720
men still benefit.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720
But not.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.160
It's in the New York Times.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:54.920
Yes.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:08:01.960
And there was some effort to say that between the ages of 25

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.760
and something rather than there was parity.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.600
But that's a very narrow thing.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.280
And the gap widens over time.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.680
But not to say that it's not a very important component.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.960
It's not a very important component.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.920
The gap is true that there's still a gap once you're

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.080
going to account for these things.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.080
But these things account for a lot of the gap.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.600
Well, job segregation accounts for the most.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.600
And then years of experience.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.760
And then the evaluation of women's work versus men's work

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.600
and so on.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.080
I was going to mention, as Lady mentioned,

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.440
Abrams.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.960
And the big case now at the New York Times

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.760
is really serious to look at.

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.360
Because we're talking about salaries of $500, something,

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.360
$500, an over.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:56.760
Salzberger actually hired this person himself.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.560
This is the person he fired.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.520
And she'd been with this paper for many, many years,

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.320
and many important managerial positions.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.000
He was upset because she realized and did

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.840
her research about how much the former person in her CEO

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.640
position got.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.080
And when she was the managerial position lower one,

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.960
how much money she was losing.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:27.480
And also, she had, in her job description,

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.680
and her responsibilities, the right

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:37.640
to put a new person on as a co-manager or take somebody off.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.200
The judgment is not about the work.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.920
The judgment is about brusque or indiscriminate

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.680
or insensitive or something like that.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.320
They don't use that with men when they're making the decisions.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.600
So when she came to the boss's office with an attorney,

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.000
he was in shock.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.040
How did she dare come to him with an attorney?

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.480
Why did she talk to him?

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.600
Because she did her homework.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.080
And when they responded, I don't know if you read this whole case,

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.680
when they responded, the answer was,

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.600
you're not making $75,000 less.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.160
The original salary, what we offered you, was $505.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.320
And then when you said this one was getting $5.95,

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.280
we gave you $5.35.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.400
And you agreed.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.760
Because we gave you perks.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.400
And they showed how all these perks were

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.800
equal to the men's salary.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.080
That was a straight salary.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080
Maybe he got the perks too.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:34.880
I don't know.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:41.000
But the point is it was the hutzpah of her coming

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.840
to his office with a lawyer, having the research,

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.960
having the evidence, having the facts,

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.560
and saying, this is not equal.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.480
And she was fired.

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.200
Now that was the big report.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.760
You can look at it on your internet

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.880
and see a lot of different responses to this.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.760
But this is a case to watch.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.360
Because it's a matter of turf.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.080
You mentioned floor space.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.680
That's not just segregated to women.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.000
Architects have been told, top down hierarchy.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.360
The CEO will get this.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360
This one will get back.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360
This one will have a window.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.080
This chair will be higher than this one.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.960
So when he sits in the guy is lower,

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.240
it's very psychological.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.240
We're in a psychological institute.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.280
There are a lot of games that were written.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.520
There's a book from Harvard.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.120
You might remember the games mother, the games mother.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.520
And the told is to play.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520
The games mother never talked about it.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.600
We don't have the bag of tools.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.960
We should have them by now.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.200
I mean, for Dan and her book a long time ago,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.120
these books are all old books.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.360
The problem is the culture.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.040
Who said we don't have them?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.720
No, I'm just saying the problem is the culture.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.680
The women who were younger don't understand the struggle that

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.600
was done for them.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.000
They take it for granted.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.280
And we don't have the same force.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.680
So the women that you want to sit around and say,

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.240
I don't need that.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.120
I don't need that.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.440
That's very good for men.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:08.520
It's not good for the women.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.120
Women need to stay together.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.480
They have to help each other on every single level.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.280
To reinforce that particular case,

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.880
there's been some studies of women on Wall Street.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:21.360
And again, it's exactly the same thing.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.320
Women may be making a million dollars,

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.280
but they're not making three.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.600
And so in every point where there's a comparison,

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.200
men end up making more, there was recently

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.240
a study that was released about a year

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.760
so it go by catalyst, which is the research organization

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.320
that studies women in the workforce, particularly

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.920
in management and boards of directors,

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.160
in which they looked at, I think,

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:49.080
was 4,000 MBAs from all kinds of universities

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.240
from different parts of the world.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.640
And they looked at controlling for issues of childcare

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.440
and full-time work and type of job and so on

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.000
that women start out in their very first job making less.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.440
And then it just grows over the career.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.640
And we're talking about people with MBAs.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.880
You know, same.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.720
I just lost it.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.440
Actually, the gap is bigger at the top, right?

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.280
Yeah, it grows over time, particularly after 10 years.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.600
That brings up a point.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:25.800
What impact does the equal pay law,

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.600
which was passed in the 1963 or 1965?

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:36.040
Because that seems to be ignored throughout the whole country.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.200
So what does it mean?

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.040
Anything?

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.600
That kind of legislation like the Civil Rights Act.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.560
I mean, like the Civil Rights Act.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.960
It depends on someone bringing a lawsuit.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:51.720
It depends on showing that people are in similarly

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.880
situated positions and that they have similar kinds

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.480
of qualifications, et cetera.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.560
It's very hard to use that kind of law

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.440
to lead to equitable outcomes.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:08.160
And for the most part, the data that I talked about

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.520
for the Civil Rights Act, we assume

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.200
because the legislation is there,

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.480
the outcomes will follow.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.200
That simply is not the case.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.400
Well, does that mean that the law needs to be more specific?

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.000
I mean, how else?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.520
That's exactly what groups are now lobbying for.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.120
An equal pay act.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.840
But there is already that one in place.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.800
Well, what about how are they going to change it?

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.360
What they're lobbying for currently has to do with the right

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.400
to have the knowledge of the.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.560
It's the exposure of public.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.120
Like in government, obviously everything of us

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.080
is public record.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.800
I like that because I know the guy sitting next to me

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.160
is my aunt, you know, that's good.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.520
But you don't have that in most professions.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.520
And I think part of the problem, and I hate feeling

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:00.960
like a woman, I'm a bargaining chip.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.520
It's almost like you get the promotion.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.960
Women get so excited.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.360
They forget to ask, well, wait a second.

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.200
I feel so honored.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.600
I'm so, oh my gosh, me?

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.480
OK, great.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.760
This is so great.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.760
And then they forget to do the research.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.280
And then they don't have the hoods,

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.560
but in everything else.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.760
I really do believe all of these salaries.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.920
It's just like a house that gets sold.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.120
You know how much it's sold for the last time?

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:29.400
So what's the job for going out?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.880
I deserve that.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.160
And it's a question that should be asked.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.840
And we shouldn't be afraid to ask it.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.400
We shouldn't be so taken aback by the fact

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.640
that we've been selected.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.840
Women don't negotiate.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.520
They don't ask.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:41.440
Well, negotiation's getting left.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.960
If they do ask, they get left.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.360
And they're afraid that they're not.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.720
And I think because we've been taught this way,

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.280
we're afraid that all of a sudden people are not

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.040
going to look like we're appreciative.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.720
But hopefully you would go back to your professional organization

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:58.520
and then start talking to some of the older women.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.020
Yes.

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.000
Mentoring for that.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:00.500
Yes.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:04.200
And it will be helpful so that each one goes back.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.400
So I do with people in my field.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.160
And I talked to them about presentation, doing seminar,

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.480
and asking for money.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.360
And hopefully your whole profession,

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.600
you would go to some people and they would mention you

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.880
as all right, this is what you have to do.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.960
No, the problem is that you are talking

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.280
that we can't do coding.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.080
So if you want to say something, you're not

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.200
going to talk to me.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.880
Yes, right.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.680
Oh, I forgot to say something.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.880
There are certain areas that have protected women

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.960
that can't have gender or sexism or ages and that much

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.960
as anything else.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.000
And those are places where you have unions.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.160
Like in the theater, you have a part.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.720
You have six women come up for the part.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.560
One gets the part.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.280
It has nothing to do with it's her talent, her reading,

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.040
or whatever.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.640
And the guy gets the guys part.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.000
But there's less women parts.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.560
After an equity and all these other unions

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.960
and health benefits, it has nothing to do with anything else.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.160
They had a breakthrough.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.960
The racism part of it, full Latinos and blacks and so on.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.400
But they did work through it.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.720
They had little clutches and people work together.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.160
Then you have also an academia.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.720
You have all this business and publisher,

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:17.960
parish, and all that stuff.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.600
But it works for the men, same as the women.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.240
But it's a little harder for the women.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.600
Because even if they're senior, the men

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.840
get into the men's bathroom and they have always discussion.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:29.600
By the time you're getting into the meeting,

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600
the meeting took place in the bathroom.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.680
You're just hearing the results.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:38.800
So very hip women who are VPs in different areas,

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.880
in corporate areas, have figured out.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.880
We're talking about women.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.880
We're talking about men.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.880
We're talking about men.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.880
We're talking about decisions.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.440
The decisions were already made.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.200
That's what the people are talking about.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.360
Morning, there were showers in the men's bathroom.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.080
There were no showers in the women's bathrooms.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.400
They're coming in the middle.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.720
So the meeting takes place there.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.280
And they get there and they make their decision.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.680
It's always random.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.880
But there are some women who already are too smart.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.560
I know this.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.480
Because they read some of those books from way back.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.960
Now, one last question.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:19.760
OK, one example of one woman who took it on, straight on,

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.360
she had a big budget, had a lot of airline tickets that she used.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:29.440
And she called up and wanted a VP.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.920
She wanted her her own.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.080
Superior.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.040
She wanted the same ticket that they had to the men

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:39.560
with VPs.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.800
Because she was flying all over Europe and the United States

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.600
and so on.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.200
And she had great these people with her

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.760
and set up the lectures.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.720
So they said, oh, we can't choose to point them out.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.840
I'm not a vice president in charge of dishwashing.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.320
I run the advertising department.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:54.760
What do you mean?

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.760
Why not?

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.040
You wouldn't give it to you.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.440
She said, you have three minutes to do it

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.400
before I call up Gloria Steinem, Harriet Van Horn,

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.800
and all these famous people of those days,

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.320
Dorothy Colgowan.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.080
And I'm not using your airline.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.720
And I'm sending these back.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.000
Guess what?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.520
She got it.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.000
She said, I don't need cigars.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I don't need first class.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.400
I want you to hold a plane for me if I'm

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.920
like the way you do with the guys.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.920
I love the after-pump.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.960
I am such a case in point.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.480
You can do all the statistics on me.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:31.480
My brother told the family that when he was 16 years old,

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.880
he went to there was an ad for you

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.840
can fly anywhere for $25.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.600
And if the plane is full, we'll give you your own plane.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.440
I don't remember this.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.680
He said he went to LaGuardia Airport.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.120
He was 16.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.200
He waited for four hours till the plane was full.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.680
And then he was the next one.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.200
And he said, I want my own plane.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.280
I want you to know my brother's a very, very successful man.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.320
It starts when you're little.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.680
It has to do with your self-image.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:10.240
And mommy darling, mommy said to me, I'll never forget this.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.280
Your brother needs the bigger room.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.400
He has more stuff.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.240
I'd like to know what that stuff is.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.480
I want some of that stuff.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:27.400
Fortunately, I realized at a very young age,

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.320
I've got stuff too.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.800
It may not be in a penis.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.000
It's maybe up here.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.720
My stuff is up here.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.960
And I'm going to use it.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:43.680
And I made damn sure I married a man who respected my head.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.040
And I told Freddie, Freddie is my boss.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.800
I work for Freddie.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.600
He's an artist.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.360
I said, Freddie, everything in my life is a negotiation.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.760
I negotiate for a cup of coffee.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:58.720
I want that coffee.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.160
I want it the way I want it.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.280
Harry said to me, and I write.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.240
That's what I do, unpublished.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.800
If you weren't such a good goddamn writer,

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.200
I would have made you stay as a teacher.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.720
And I left teaching 30 years ago to write for the drawer.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.720
If you know what that means in Russia,

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.040
people who are writing controversial stuff

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.200
don't get published.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.080
They write for the drawer.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.720
I'm your writer for the drawer.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.720
Thank you.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.720
Thank you.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.720
Thank you.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:29.720
Please.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720
Please.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720
Please.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.720
I'm going to have some of this.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720
I have a bad answer.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.720
Can we have an answer?

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720
Yeah.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720
That's OK.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:39.720
Yeah.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.720
Oh, hi.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.400
My name is Miriam Stern.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.040
I'm also an attorney, so I'm not a researcher,

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:48.160
but I have a lot of anecdotal feelings

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.840
about some of the things said.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.520
You have to hold the mic close to me.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.120
OK.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.320
Miriam Stern, attorney.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.640
So I'm not a researcher.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.120
I have anecdotal feelings about some of the things said.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.080
And Professor Diddemasso, I thank you so much

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:06.280
for all the research that you mentioned today.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:10.080
And I so agree with everything, feeling it.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.920
I just want to comment about what was said about theater,

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.200
because I'm an entertainment lawyer, also an adjunct professor

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.560
at several universities here in the city,

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.440
teaching business law and law to filmmakers.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.880
There is tremendous prejudice in the theater industry.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:33.840
There are hardly any female writers that are being produced.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.840
There are hardly any female directors that are being hired.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.040
You can count them on one hand.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.600
Same in the film industry.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.200
And in terms of academia, I totally

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.200
agree with everything you've said.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:50.480
And again, anecdotally, as a lawyer,

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.680
I've read that 2% of females ever make partner.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.240
So there are no females up there to support other females.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.000
Any other questions?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Yeah, I'm Fran Dillon.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.920
I wanted to go back to implicit bias.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.240
I had an experience this morning with a visiting transplant

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.800
surgeon.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.440
She was, I guess, one of 40 who were here in New York

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.680
at the New York Academy of Medicine.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.200
And I guess at the opening meeting,

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.160
she was sitting at a table with other surgeons.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.520
And they were introducing the people at the table.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:57.600
And they came to her and said, she's the coordinator.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:01.760
And she was shocked, of course.

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.240
But she's one of the few, I think, transplant surgeons

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.360
in the country.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.520
So I was interested in different sectors,

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.160
what's happening in different sectors, particularly medicine.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:17.320
But I said to her, what did you say?

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.720
And she said, well, I said, I'm a surgeon.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.120
And after that, she said, I didn't say anything else.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.760
So I just wonder about the language

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.760
to deal with that implicit bias.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.960
Because I think women don't have the language to deal with it.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.640
And she really needed that.

01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.440
She's in her 40s.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.000
And she will go to meetings over and over again like this.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.680
And so I'd love your comment.

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.200
Right.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:56.400
Well, I think, again, any time one is an only in a profession

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.960
or in a group, you're going to have these experiences over

01:24:58.960 --> 01:24:59.600
and over again.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.560
Because people will form prototypes in their head

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.840
about who should be in this kind of profession.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.280
And it'll be like those that are in the majority.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.920
But let me mention two things that I think we haven't addressed

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.240
yet, and that might be useful for the conversation.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.040
One is that while all of the kinds of things

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.880
that we've been discussing are true in terms

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:27.400
of the research that has looked at the issues,

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.720
women get paid less.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.560
Women are less likely to be in positions of authority.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.800
Women are less likely to be taken seriously, and so on.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.600
But some women do make it.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:42.160
And that's one of the things that we do need to keep in mind.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.000
Alice Eglie and I think Linda Carley did a book called

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.080
The Labyrinth of Leadership, where they argued

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.240
that we have the wrong imagery to talk about the glass ceiling

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.560
and somehow think that everything's just fine

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.120
until women get to the top and then they get stopped.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.760
Because they argue that these kinds of things take place

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:02.920
at every point along the way.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:09.640
But it isn't simply a straight shot

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.520
that when women run into obstacles, they can go around them.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.360
They can find another pathway.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.520
And that's why they called it The Labyrinth of Leadership,

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:24.120
that there are ways to manage to overcome the obstacles,

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:30.720
despite discrimination, despite the favoritism that men enjoy.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.520
And part of that is persistence.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.280
Part of it is good luck.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.160
Part of it is skill.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.160
But knowing that there are examples of people who have

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:45.640
somehow done it against the odds, I think,

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.840
is something to be sure that we remember and to be encouraged

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:50.800
by.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:54.800
One of the things I think along those lines

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.960
to keep in mind that I teach in my classes

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:04.920
when I teach them is that one shouldn't get caught up

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:10.000
in that double bind about trying to act competent versus act

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.880
nice or trying to do it like a man versus doing it

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.600
like a woman, that essentially you can't

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.280
win in that kind of a trade-off.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.000
Hillary Clinton can't do it because someone will always

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.080
think that if she acts too feminine, she's being

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:32.720
inauthentic, and if she doesn't act feminine enough,

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.960
she's not someone to be admired, and so on.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:43.720
So Robin Ealy, again at Harvard and her collaborator,

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.960
whose name I'm Deborah Rode, talk about opting out

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.200
of that effort to balance between doing it like a man

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.280
versus doing it like a woman, and instead focus

01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.240
on the goal of performance and learning your job

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.680
and looking for opportunity and doing it in a way that

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:10.760
engages and involves other people and helps them develop

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.680
their capacities and their ability to win.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.200
And when you keep the focus on what you're

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.680
trying to accomplish and how you're

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.520
going to get there and go around the obstacles,

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.720
as opposed to be stopped by them,

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.440
you have a much greater opportunity

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.640
to not be undone by these kinds of experiences.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.600
This has been a really interesting conversation,

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.200
and I'm just curious how you would

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.160
see women and the world of work against what I consider

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.320
the greater context, which is the American culture.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.440
I'm very interested in, say, the demise

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.320
of the women's movement that I grew up with,

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.680
and the role models that I had in the 70s,

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.880
like the glorious dynames, and that whole,

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.000
there were magazines, there were movements,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.440
they were very, very public voices who were inspirational,

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.200
and they were role models for us.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.320
That seems to have been plotted or fizzled out.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.280
The role models we see now, the Oprah Winfrey's,

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.200
are more concerned about celebrity or very soft subjects,

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.800
like, I don't know, spirituality is not soft, but.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.200
Oh.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.720
So there seems to be, to me, a lack of cohesive movement

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.080
and leadership.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:35.360
I see not to diss Michelle Obama,

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.960
but she's talking about not women's work,

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.280
but eating habits.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.440
The other thing, the concomitant trend that I've seen,

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.960
we've all seen over the last, say, 20 years,

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.120
is this hyper-sexualization of American women,

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.360
American society, so that men and women

01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:02.280
seem farther apart in TV, in movies, in music.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.760
I mean, the sexual images, to me,

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.640
are shocking and stunning, somebody

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.720
who grew up in the 70s.

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:14.200
And I'm wondering whether the push for equality

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.800
on the job front is made more difficult

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.680
by these cultural and social trends.

01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.440
I mean, we're kind of fighting against a wave that's

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:26.120
pushing us back.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.720
So any comments you would have on that, I would be interested.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:33.720
OK, I'll comment.

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.960
Well, it is the case that many of the social movements

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:46.440
that some of us grew up with have dissipated.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.640
I mean, there's a certain sense in which people have gotten

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.000
older.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.800
They had to go in other directions.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:57.000
There became some downsides of being involved

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.360
in some of those kinds of things.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:01.040
But I think that, to some extent,

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.440
the energy from those social movements

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:04.840
got professionalized.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:08.240
I mean, there were professional organizations

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.400
that got created as opposed to just social movements.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.360
So I don't think that the pressure for change

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.600
has necessarily disappeared, but it's taken a different form.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.600
However, at the same time that those kinds of things

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:25.760
have happened, there has been an organized effort

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:29.360
to turn the country back from liberalism that

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.400
has been driven by a very well financed right wing movement.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.920
I talk about this in my book as well.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:42.800
And they have had a strategy for doing that that included

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.760
creating public intellectuals and generating books

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:50.960
and capturing the media and the development of Fox News

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:55.120
and all kinds of organizations to sort of create

01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:01.200
model legislation and many, many kinds of sectors

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:06.360
of the society have been influenced by this effort

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.720
to turn the country back from those social movements.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.440
So obviously, one of the solutions

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.040
would be to sort of recreate some aspect

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.720
of those social movements, but it's

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:22.120
a very difficult thing to do, particularly

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:28.520
because the Supreme Court and the campaign finance laws

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:29.840
and so on.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:35.040
So unfortunately, as the successes of those social movements

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:39.960
have begun to erode, the new generation of people,

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.400
and I guess to some extent some of us as well,

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.000
sort of have to fight those battles again.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:55.840
And that's sort of an unsettling sort of thing to me.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.920
I was very happy for those social movements

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:02.600
and glad that I didn't have to be as involved as some people

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.800
needed to be.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:08.400
But I do feel committed to supporting

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.400
what other kind of efforts sort of emerged

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.240
to sort of take things back again.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.840
You were like, today is the anniversary,

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.240
the 50th anniversary of Brown-listed

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.680
Board of Education.

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.000
And it's now the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.440
And we're going back.

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.800
If there are no other questions, we will finish.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:28.440
I just hope yes.

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.440
Thank you.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:29.940
Thank you.

01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:30.440
Thank you.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.440
Thank you.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:57.400
Thank you.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:18.960
Thank you.
